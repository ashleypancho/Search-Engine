{{fsharpTitle|Exception Handling}}

When a program encounters a problem or enters an invalid state, it will often respond by throwing an exception. Left to its own devices, an uncaught exception will crash an application. Programmers write '''exception handling''' code to rescue an application from an invalid state.

== Try/With ==
Let's look at the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let getNumber msg = printf msg; int32(System.Console.ReadLine())

let x = getNumber(&quot;x = &quot;)
let y = getNumber(&quot;y = &quot;)
printfn &quot;%i + %i = %i&quot; x y (x + y)&lt;/source&gt;
This code is syntactically valid, and it has the correct types. However, it can fail at run time if we give it a bad input:

This program outputs the following:

 x = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;
 y = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;monkeys!&lt;/font&gt;
 ------------
 FormatException was unhandled. Input string was not in a correct format.

The string &lt;code&gt;monkeys&lt;/code&gt; does not represent a number, so the conversion fails with an exception. We can handle this exception using F#'s &lt;code&gt;try... with&lt;/code&gt;, a special kind of pattern matching construct:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let getNumber msg =
    printf msg;
    try
        int32(System.Console.ReadLine())
    with
        | :? System.FormatException -&gt; System.Int32.MinValue

let x = getNumber(&quot;x = &quot;)
let y = getNumber(&quot;y = &quot;)
printfn &quot;%i + %i = %i&quot; x y (x + y)&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

 x = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;
 y = &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;monkeys!&lt;/font&gt;
 7 + -2147483648 = -2147483641

It is, of course, wholly possible to catch multiple types of exceptions in a single &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; block. For example, according to the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3h1hf19.aspx MSDN documentation], the &lt;code&gt;System.Int32.Parse(s : string)&lt;/code&gt; method will throw three types of exceptions:

&lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.argumentnullexception.aspx ArgumentNullException]&lt;/code&gt;
: Occurs when &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is a null reference.
&lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.formatexception.aspx FormatException]&lt;/code&gt;
: Occurs when &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; does not represent a numeric input.
&lt;code&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.overflowexception.aspx OverflowException]&lt;/code&gt;
: Occurs when &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; represents number greater than or less than &lt;code&gt;Int32.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Int32.MinValue&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. the number cannot be represented with a 32-bit signed integer).

We can catch all of these exceptions by adding additional match cases:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let getNumber msg =
    printf msg;
    try
        int32(System.Console.ReadLine())
    with
        | :? System.FormatException -&gt; -1
        | :? System.OverflowException -&gt; System.Int32.MinValue
        | :? System.ArgumentNullException -&gt; 0&lt;/source&gt;

Its not necessary to have an exhaustive list of match cases on exception types, as the uncaught exception will simply move to the next method in the stack trace.

== Raising Exceptions ==
The code above demonstrates how to recover from an invalid state. However, when designing F# libraries, its often useful to throw exceptions to notify users that the program encountered some kind of invalid input. There are several standard functions for raising exceptions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* General failure *)
val failwith : string -&gt; 'a

(* General failure with formatted message *)
val failwithf : StringFormat&lt;'a, 'b&gt; -&gt; 'a

(* Raise a specific exception *)
val raise : #exn -&gt; 'a

(* Bad input *)
val invalidArg : string -&gt; 'a&lt;/source&gt;

For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a tree =
    | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
    | Empty
    
let rec add x = function
    | Empty -&gt; Node(x, Empty, Empty)
    | Node(y, left, right) -&gt;
        if x &gt; y then Node(y, left, add x right)
        else if x &lt; y then Node(y, add x left, right)
        else failwithf &quot;Item '%A' already been added to tree&quot; x&lt;/source&gt;

== Try/Finally ==
Normally, an exception will cause a function to exit immediately. However, a &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; block will always execute, even if the code throws an exception:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let tryWithFinallyExample f =
    try
        printfn &quot;tryWithFinallyExample: outer try block&quot;
        try
            printfn &quot;tryWithFinallyExample: inner try block&quot;
            f()
        with
            | exn -&gt;
                printfn &quot;tryWithFinallyExample: inner with block&quot;
                reraise() (* raises the same exception we just caught *)
    finally
        printfn &quot;tryWithFinally: outer finally block&quot;
        
let catchAllExceptions f =
    try
        printfn &quot;-------------&quot;
        printfn &quot;catchAllExceptions: try block&quot;
        tryWithFinallyExample f
    with
        | exn -&gt;
            printfn &quot;catchAllExceptions: with block&quot;
            printfn &quot;Exception message: %s&quot; exn.Message
    
let main() =                
    catchAllExceptions (fun () -&gt; printfn &quot;Function executed successfully&quot;)
    catchAllExceptions (fun () -&gt; failwith &quot;Function executed with an error&quot;)
    
main()&lt;/source&gt;

This program will output the following:
&lt;pre&gt;-------------
catchAllExceptions: try block
tryWithFinallyExample: outer try block
tryWithFinallyExample: inner try block
Function executed successfully
tryWithFinally: outer finally block
-------------
catchAllExceptions: try block
tryWithFinallyExample: outer try block
tryWithFinallyExample: inner try block
tryWithFinallyExample: inner with block
tryWithFinally: outer finally block
catchAllExceptions: with block
Exception message: Function executed with an error&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that our finally block executed in spite of the exception. Finally blocks are used most commonly to clean up resources, such as closing an open file handle or closing a database connection (even in the event of an exception, we ''do not'' want to leave file handles or database connections open):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;open System.Data.SqlClient
let executeScalar connectionString sql =
    let conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString)
    try
        conn.Open() (* this line can throw an exception *)
        let comm = new SqlCommand(sql, conn)
        comm.ExecuteScalar() (* this line can throw an exception *)
    finally
        (* finally block guarantees our SqlConnection is closed, even if our sql statement fails *)
        conn.Close()&lt;/source&gt;

=== &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; Statement ===
Many objects in the .NET framework implement the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx System.IDisposable] interface, which means the objects have a special method called &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; to guarantee deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources. It's considered a best practice to call &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; on these types of objects as soon as they are no longer needed.

Traditionally, we'd use a &lt;code&gt;try/finally&lt;/code&gt; block in this fashion:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let writeToFile fileName =
    let sw = new System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName : string)
    try
        sw.Write(&quot;Hello &quot;)
        sw.Write(&quot;World!&quot;)
    finally
        sw.Dispose()&lt;/source&gt;
However, this can be occasionally bulky and cumbersome, especially when dealing with many objects which implement the IDisposable interface. F# provides the keyword &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; as syntactic sugar for the pattern above. An equivalent version of the code above can be written as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let writeToFile fileName =
    use sw = new System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName : string)
    sw.Write(&quot;Hello &quot;)
    sw.Write(&quot;World!&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

The scope of a &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; statement is identical to the scope of a &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; statement. F# will automatically call &lt;code&gt;Dispose()&lt;/code&gt; on an object when the identifier goes out of scope.

== Defining New Exceptions ==
F# allows us to easily define new types of exceptions using the &lt;code&gt;exception&lt;/code&gt; declaration. Here's an example using fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; exception ReindeerNotFoundException of string

let reindeer =
    [&quot;Dasher&quot;; &quot;Dancer&quot;; &quot;Prancer&quot;; &quot;Vixen&quot;; &quot;Comet&quot;; &quot;Cupid&quot;; &quot;Donner&quot;; &quot;Blitzen&quot;]
    
let getReindeerPosition name =
    match List.tryFindIndex (fun x -&gt; x = name) reindeer with
    | Some(index) -&gt; index
    | None -&gt; raise (ReindeerNotFoundException(name));;

exception ReindeerNotFoundException of string
val reindeer : string list
val getReindeerPosition : string -&gt; int

&gt; getReindeerPosition &quot;Comet&quot;;;
val it : int = 4

&gt; getReindeerPosition &quot;Donner&quot;;;
val it : int = 6

&gt; getReindeerPosition &quot;Rudolf&quot;;;
FSI_0033+ReindeerNotFoundExceptionException: Rudolf
   at FSI_0033.getReindeerPosition(String name)
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0036&gt;.$FSI_0036._main()
stopped due to error&lt;/source&gt;

We can pattern match on our new existing exception type just as easily as any other exception:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; let tryGetReindeerPosition name =
    try
        getReindeerPosition name
    with
        | ReindeerNotFoundException(s) -&gt;
            printfn &quot;Got ReindeerNotFoundException: %s&quot; s
            -1;;

val tryGetReindeerPosition : string -&gt; int

&gt; tryGetReindeerPosition &quot;Comet&quot;;;
val it : int = 4

&gt; tryGetReindeerPosition &quot;Rudolf&quot;;;
Got ReindeerNotFoundException: Rudolf
val it : int = -1&lt;/source&gt;

== [[Textbook of Psychiatry]] ==

A group of people have come to Wikibooks recently and have begun working on [[Textbook of Psychiatry]].  I have been attempting a few gentle corrections, but so far my [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Textbook_of_Psychiatry&amp;diff=1458032&amp;oldid=1456315 advice] has been rejected.

It seems to me that they are in clear violation of Wikibooks policy - isn't our mantra &quot;anyone can edit?&quot;  I am hesitant to be less gentle, but can't think of a good way to address this without being a little more forceful (i.e., page protection to block edits by unregistered users).  So far they have ignored all my attempts to discuss the matter.  Since their editing is always done from unregistered ip's, perhaps they have missed my comments to them. Or perhaps being psychiatrists, they're just playing with my head ;-) 

They ''really'' ought to break this mondo page into about 25 new ones, and they also need to quit saying &quot;only we can edit.&quot;

Any advice here is much appreciated, or if another admin wants to tackle this, please do. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:48, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
:Yeah, I noticed your comments &amp; they were spot-on. I'm going to remove the notice about editing and attribution from the page, and start splitting it up... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:08, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
:Actually, I found the email address of the coordinator of that project - so I've emailed them. Hopefully a personal touch will get them to notice. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:11, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

: I share your concerns, but they aren't so much in violation of policy as they are in violation of the spirit. If they repeatedly revert your reasonable improvements, you can give them a short block or ask another admin to do so. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:19, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
::Thanks for the help guys (especially Mike who did all the hard stuff).  Swift, you're probably right about it being against the spirit vs policy.  I don't normally like to add more policies, but I wonder if &quot;anyone can edit&quot; ought to be one.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:49, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
::: Yes, good job, Mike!
::: As for a policy dictating that anyone is allowed to edit, I don't see the need for one. It's implied by the software settings. If someone tries to excert editorial control or authorship without considering comunity input, such edits will be seen as disruptive and treated as such. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:42, 3 April 2009 (UTC)
:::Anyone can edit is a non-negotiable community foundation issue. There is no need to restate it as a project-level policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:45, 3 April 2009 (UTC)
:::Yes, I'm onboard with that. There was some other behaviour that was questionable, like blanking and redirecting other books without actually incorporating the content. Hopefully at some point it'll settle down. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::::Where did that happen?
::::So you folks know, I am in contact with the coordinator. This is really an issue about understanding what Wikibooks is, why wikis work, and so on. It's not malicious and I don't think a hardline stance like &quot;such edits will be seen as disruptive and treated as such&quot; will be helpful. Dan is responsive to my concerns, and is modifying both attitudes and actions as I discuss this with him. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:48, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

== Import question ==

I was planning to start a textbook on the history of the NHL. It's an off-shoot off the Wikipedia project, in that it's based, but I plan to make it go in more detail (hopefully invite &amp; and get more hockey editors from WP here too :-) ). Since the foundation of this book are the five Wikipedia articles (main one, plus four sub-articles each covering 25 years to avoid making the main article ridiculously long), should these articles be imported into WikiBooks for proper attribution? [[User:Maxim|Maxim]] ([[User talk:Maxim|talk]]) 22:11, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
:This is me basing it on my experiences at Simple English Wikipedia, so it might not be correct. I normally simply permalink the article I found it from and stick it in the edit summary, as ''This version of this article was based on xxxxx''. But that's me, I don't know if there is any proper policy. [[User:Microchip08|&lt;font color=&quot;#778899&quot; face=&quot;high tower text&quot;&gt;Microchip08&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[:simple:User:Microchip08|&lt;font color=&quot;#B0C4DE&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;@simple&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:18, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
::There's a separate page—[[WB:RFI]]—for requesting imports for proper history attribution, to which I was led to when opening the editwindow; also, it would see to be better attribution to import it outright. Simple English Wikipedia is facing somewhat of a &quot;crisis&quot; with proper attribution, no? Anyways, most of the time they're chasing their, which is one of the many reasons why I left that project. [[User:Maxim|Maxim]] ([[User talk:Maxim|talk]]) 22:30, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
:::Yes, you can (and should) request a full history import of material you want to use from Wikipedia, unless it is only a small amount (say, a paragraph). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:19, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
== 66.68.218.211 ==

Created [[Mega Man VS The Simple Bots‎‎]] and [[Mega_Man_(video_game)]] and countless templates to support the pages which may be in violation of policy at [[WB:GUIDE]].  The former was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_VS_The_Simple_Bots deleted at Wikipedia] and the latter is ripped [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_(video_game) straight from Wikipedia].  The former page has some links which point to [[User:Bobesh8]], whose [[User_talk:Bobesh8|talk page]] has notes on previous complete rips from Wikpedia and the creation of a game guide on Sonic the Hedgehog.  It may be the same person, just not logged in.  See [[Special:Contributions/66.68.218.211]] for a full list.  Something to look at.  I left a note on the IP's talk page on game guides. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] ([[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]) 17:09, 27 April 2009 (UTC)

: Each and every one of the contributions was a copyvio. I've deleted these and made a note on the IP talk page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:06, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Ataxia-Telangiectasia'''&lt;/big&gt;


*[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&amp;part=ataxia-telangiectas Gene Reviews Link]
*[[w:Ataxia-telangiectasia|Wikibooks link]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Damage_Response|DNA Damage Response chapter]]


===Overview===
*Absence of ATM protein (90% none, 10% trace, 1% present but non-functional), by immunoblotting
*Progressive cerebellar ataxia (starting age 1-4), oculomotor apraxia, choreoathetosis, frequent infections, telangiectasias of the conjunctivae, immunodeficiency, and an increased risk for malignancy. 
*Cancer risk: 
**Homozygotes: life-time risk 40%
***Leukemia and lymphoma account for ~85%
***With longer life-span, also ovarian, breast, gastric, melanoma, leiomyomas, and sarcomas
**Heterozygotes: risk 4x normal population
***Majority of increase due to breast cancer
*Autosomal recessive
*Sensitivity to ionizing radiation; but no increased sensitivity to UV light
*Cells don't arrest in S phase after DNA damage
*Alpha-fetoprotein elevated in 95%



===Radiation Therapy Literature===
*Severe response to ionizing radiation in patients with AT
*Some ATM variants may be predictive of adverse RT responses


'''AT'''
*'''1968''' PMID 5687489 -- &quot;Radiation reaction in ataxia telangiectasia.&quot; (Morgan JL, Am J Dis Child. 1968 Nov;116(5):557-8.)

*'''1967''' PMID 6072741 -- &quot;Ataxia telangiectasia. Neoplasia, untoward response to x-irradiation, and tuberous sclerosis.&quot; (Gotoff SP, Am J Dis Child. 1967 Dec;114(6):617-25.)



'''ATM variants'''
*'''Aarhus; 2006''' (Denmark) PMID 16338099 -- &quot;ATM sequence variants and risk of radiation-induced subcutaneous fibrosis after postmastectomy radiotherapy.&quot; (Andreassen CN, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Mar 1;64(3):776-83.)
**Conclusion: ATM codon 1853 may be associated with development of Grade 3 fibrosis in breast RT

*'''Mt. Sinai, NY'''
**'''2007''' PMID 17517479 -- &quot;Possession of ATM Sequence Variants as Predictor for Late Normal Tissue Responses in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy.&quot; (Ho AY, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 1;69(3):677-84.)
***Conclusion: Sequence variants in ATM may predict for late response in breast CA
**'''2002''' PMID 11849780 -- &quot;ATM mutations in female breast cancer patients predict for an increase in radiation-induced late effects.&quot; (Ianuzzi CM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Mar 1;52(3):606-13.)
***Conclusion: Significant correlation between ATM mutations and Grade 3-4 fibrosis</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''The Internationale''''' is a widely recognized song. It is originally in French language with dozens of translated versions. Its singers include socialists, democrats, social democrats, communists, and anarchists. Raising a hand in a clenched fist salute is a traditional gesture.

      <comment>More precise calculation of the French copyright term</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Respecting copyright==
Though ''The Internationale'' is often performed and sung to resist repression, it is not automatically in the public domain, so respecting others' copyright is still important.

After Eugène Pottier died in 1887, Gustave Delory, once the Lille mayor in France, once acquired the copyright of his French lyrics dated in 1871 through the songwriter G B Clement having bought it from Pottier's widow. It is in the public domain essentially everywhere in the world.

The first edition of ''The Internationale'' with Pierre De Geyter's music showed the composer as his family name (Degeyter) to save his job unsuccessfully. Pierre's brother Adolphe was once considered the &quot;composer&quot; due to false copyright claim. This was disproved in 1922 when the French court accepted Adolphe's 1916 suicide note confessing the fraud as new evidence to award the copyright to Pierre. However, the Soviet Russia already adopted ''The Internationale'' as the national anthem in 1917 without knowing the real composer yet. After the Soviet Union discovered the real composer in 1927, Stalin awarded Pierre a Soviet state pension to possibly compensate for his copyright. However, the Soviet Union had no international copyright relations at that time.

After Pierre died in 1932, a film director in France in 2005 was asked to pay 1000 euro for whistling the song for seven seconds. This incident is a very important lesson to respect others' copyright. His music of ''The Internationale'' is expected to remain copyrighted in France until October 2017. The calculation is based on year 1932 when he died, plus 70 years through year end, plus, for musical works, 6 years and 152 days to compensate for World War I and 8 years and 120 days to compensate for World War II respectively:
&lt;pre&gt;
1932 Common Era
+ 70 years until year end
+  6 years 152 days
+  8 years 120 days
=========================
2016 year end + 272 days
=========================
2017 September 29
&lt;/pre&gt;
Please check your national and regional copyright laws and regulations to see whether the music is in the public domain. If you are in a country or area where the copyright length is limited to an author's lifetime plus up to 80 years, the French copyright length is no longer relevant. However, if you are in France or a country copyrighting for an author's lifetime plus more than 80 years, please be careful before performing ''The Internationale''.

Without affecting the copyright of original works being based on, translated lyrics are derivative works with separate copyrights. Depending on which language version you would like to use, always respect others' copyright. For example, no matter how popular Billy Bragg's modern English version may be, [[wikilivres:Talk:The_Internationale_(Bragg)|his copyright permission]] has not released his work into the public domain.

==Other legal issues==
Besides any copyright considerations, the legality to perform any specific lyrics may vary among countries and areas. In countries and areas respecting freedom of speeches, publicly singing the third French verse (or its translations) to criticize the governments and laws may be okay, but others suppressing freedom of speeches may consider this verse unacceptable or even unlawful. Furthermore, publicly singing the fifth French verse (or its translations), mentioning soldiers going on strike, breaking the ranks, and shooting one's own generals, in any military installations may be unwise or even unlawful as inciting military disorder. After all, before performing ''The Internationale'', please check the legality in your country or area to be sure.

*[[w:Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer|wikipedia entry]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Repair|DNA Repair chapter]]


*Defect in DNA mismatch repair pathway (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS, PMS2)
*Microsatellite instability is hallmark feature
*Estimated to be responsible for ~5% of colorectal cancer; conversly, patients with HNPCC have ~80% risk of colon cancer and 30-50% risk of endometrial cancer
*Also increased risk for ovarian, gastric, small intestine, hepatobiliary, upper urinary, brain, and skin
*Autosomal dominant, but has incomplete penetrance
*Criteria - Amsterdam criteria (PMID 2022152), Bethesda guidelines (PMID 9392616, [http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/jnci;89/23/1758 Full text]), PREMM&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; model (Prediction of Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2)
**3 colon cancers in which 2 people are first-degree relatives of the third. Cancer in 2 generations. One diagnosis before age 50. No evidence of FAP
**However, up to 40% of families with these mutations don't meet the Amsterdam criteria
*Average age of developing cancer: 45 years (vs 63)
*Screening: full colonoscopy q3y beginning age 20-25; annual endometrial screening age 25-35</text>

*[[w:Fanconi_anemia|wikipedia entry]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Radiobiology/DNA_Repair|DNA repair chapter]]


*FANC-D2 serves two roles, which are independent of each other
**Phosphorylation at S-222 by ATM in response to double strand break leads to activity in S-phase checkpoint
**Ubiquination at L-561 by FA nuclear complex leads to regulation of BRCA2 during homologous recombination
*Increased sensitivity to DNA cross-linking, but limited radiosensitivity
*Short stature, skeletal abnormalities, increased solid tumors and leukemias, aplastic anemia

'''Usage''':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
var objXML = loadXMLDoc(&quot;filename.xml&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;
var oNodes = objXML.getElementsByTagName(&quot;AnyTagYouWish&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

Having said everything about Textures in Blender in the manual [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Textures], many people find it still hard to grasp the concepts behind the texturing system and applying Textures. 

'''Noob note''' The link below to Leigh's 'Texturing for Dummies' is dead.  She has a concise version of some general pointers here, something I would call [http://www.leighvanderbyl.com/texturing-for-dummies/ How to texture, in a word], but it's roughly 1/15th the presumed length of the original. This passage should be updated or removed as perhaps it can only be purchased now.

There are some brilliant tutorials about texturing on the net, I personally like [http://www.leighvanderbyl.com/tutorials.html Texturing for Dummies] by Leigh Van Der Byl. It is free (as in free beer, not as in free speech like this book), so you should download and read it now, to take the most advantage out of this tutorial. 

We're going to see how to apply the texturing concepts within the Blender texturing system. I will explain it using an image texture and procedural textures, but be aware of the fact that the texturing system is quite complex, and more advanced maps are created with the use of a few combined textures.

If you're really into texturing you need to learn how to [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics|UV-Map]], there's no way around it.

== Colormap ==
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-Colormap.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Image 1a:''' An image applied as a texture to a plane. [[:File:Wales-Tenby-Die Stadt.jpg|Download texture]]]]
This is the most basic mapping type. You can use an image or a procedural texture to change the color of a material.

[[File:Blender3D MapToPanelStreichholz.png|framed|'''Image 1b:'''  The ''Map To'' Panel for a colormap.]]
'''Using an image texture:'''
* Add an ''Image'' texture in the ''Texture Buttons'' and load the image (this is necessary also for UV mapped textures). 
* The button ''Col'' in the ''Map To'' Panel uses the RGB information of the image to change the color of the material. 
* The slide number button ''Col'' governs the blending amount of the texture, ''Neg'' inverts the colourvalues. 
* If you use ''No RGB'' only the intensity information from the picture is used. The target color is then taken from the RGB sliders in the ''Map To'' Panel.

'''Using a procedural texture:'''
The result depends on the type of value the texture provides. 
* If the value is of type intensity (e.g. ''Clouds''), the color is taken from the RGB sliders in the ''Map To'' Panel. 
* If the value type is color (e.g. ''Magic''), everything is handled as with image textures. 


{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Color and intensity? What the heck?''

An image texture (and other textures as well) may provide two different types of values: 
# RGB-Color information
# Alpha information.
Now we have to take a look at a few different scenarios.
* If an image has no alpha channel and you
** don't activate ''Use Alpha'' or ''Calc Alpha'' everything is easy - the texture provides only RGB-Color information. An intensity value is then calculated automatically if necessary.
** activate ''Use Alpha'' the texture provides no intensity value and it is not calculated. If you now activate ''No RGB'' the intensity value is again calculated from the color information. So either you use ''Use Alpha'' and ''No RGB'' or neither of them. 
** activate ''Calc Alpha'' the texture provides automatically calculated intensity values. Now ''No RGB'' has no effect.

== Diffusemap ==
[[File:Blender3D DiffuseMapSettings-2.49.png|framed|'''Image 2a:''' Diffusemap settings with a small range (0.2).]]
A Diffusemap changes the amount of diffuse light the material reflects/absorbs. This is controlled by changing the reflectivity (''Ref''). A material with a rough surface may have the color white, but absorbs light to a greater amount than a material with a smooth surface. For more on diffuse reflection physics, see [[w:Diffuse reflection|Diffuse reflection]].

Noob note: Most of the settings described below will be found in the &quot;Influence&quot; section under the texture/material panel in blender 2.61

Let's test:
* In the Texture buttons ('''F6'''), in the Map Image panel, make sure ''UseAlpha'' is unchecked.
* In the Material buttons ('''F5'''), in the Map To panel, uncheck ''Col'' and check ''Ref''.

Noob note: In blender 2.6x &quot;Ref&quot; has been changed to &quot;Intensity&quot;

To understand the effect of this and all other mappings, we have to discuss the meaning of the NumButton ''DVar'' (Destination Value). 
* White in a texture (or an intensity value of 1) will be mapped to the value of the ''DVar'' Button. So if you set ''Dvar'' to 1, white will be mapped to 1, if you set ''DVar'' to 0, white will be mapped to 0. The result is multiplied with the value of the ''Var'' number button. 
* Black on the other hand (or an intensity value of 0) does not change anything, so the settings from the material will stay unchanged. The difference between the material settings and the ''DVar'' button is the range for the texture. 
Let's take a look at an example.

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-DiffuseMap0.2.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Image 2b:''' The image used for the Colormap applied as a Diffusemap with a small range (0.2).]]
If we use the default settings for the Diffusemap the range of the values is small.
* ''Ref'' is 0.8
* ''Dvar'' is 1.0
* White pixels in the texture change the ''Ref'' value to 1.0, black pixels in the texture don't change the ''Ref''  value at all.
So the resulting '''range''' for ''Ref'' is 1.0 - 0.8 = 0.2.

{{clr}}
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-DiffuseMap1.0.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Image 2c:''' Diffusemap with full range (1.0).]]
When we change the ''Ref'' parameter in the ''Shaders'' panel to 0, we'll get a much larger range of ''Ref'' values from 0.0 (black pixels in the texture) to 1.0 (white pixels in the texture). 

{{clr}}
There are other ways to achieve a larger range, you could also set ''Ref'' to &quot;Inverted&quot; (click it twice, it will be painted in yellow), ''DVar'' to 0 and ''Ref'' in the ''Shaders'' panel to 1. 


{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Why is this so complex?''

Well, with complexity comes flexibility. You can use an image (or procedural texture) for a few mappings at once, e.g. Color, Diffuse, Alpha, Spec and the like.}}

== Luminositymap ==
Luminosity is the property of self-illumination, i.e. of objects emitting light. So we change the ''Emit'' value with this texture. 

This light does not illuminate other objects - you would have to use Global Illumination (e.g. Yafaray) to use an emitting object as a true light source. Radiosity rendering does not work with Luminositymaps.

Everything that was said about the ''DVar'' value applies here exactly as for Diffusemaps.

{{clr}}
== Specularitymap ==
Specularity is the second most important material attribute. Specularity fakes the reflections of light sources. Of course you can modify the general specularity with a texture. In Blender you can change three different attributes related to specularity:
# ''Spec:'' The degree of specularity. You can't set values above 1.0 with Specularitymaps, but you could invert the texture and set ''Spec'' on the ''Shaders'' panel to a higher value and ''Dvar'' to the lowest value of your range. So the texture actually lowers the specularity in all areas, that shall have a low specularity.
# ''Hard:'' The hardness of the specular reflections. Sometimes called &quot;Glossiness&quot;. A ''DVar'' of 1 is equivalent to a hardness of 130. Use the same method as described above to achieve a greater range for the hardness.
# ''Csp:'' The specularity color.

You will probably use some kind of &quot;Dirtmapping&quot; (stenciling) to change the specularity in certain regions of an object, like an often touched object, that is shinier on the used or touched parts.

For more on specular reflection physics see [[w:Specular_reflection|Specular reflection]].

== Reflectionmap ==
A Reflectionmap would be used to fake real raytracing reflections, either because you don't want to use raytracing, or you don't want to create a scene, or you need a special effect you don't get with raytraced reflections. A Reflectionmap would be a Colormap, typically an [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Textures/Types/Environment_Maps Environment Map]. Since you can use prerendered Environment Maps, you can fake a surrounding for your object. Sometimes it is sufficient to use a simple Colormap that just bears the right colours, e.g. if you want to create a stormy sea it is not necessary that the clouds above are truly reflected in the water. 

Environment Maps are a bit more complicated to create, see the respective section in the manual.

A very different kind of texture would be used to change the amount of raytracing reflections, the ''RayMir'' value. This is useful for something like a stained or dirty mirror. Simply click the ''RayMir'' button in the ''Map To'' panel and lower the ''DVar''.

== Transparencymap ==
Transparency- or Alphamaps change the (partial) visibility of an object. They don't have to be transparent themselves (though it doesn't hurt, see [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using a texture to make a material partially transparent|Make a material partially transparent]]). You will often use an image as Colormap and Transparencymap together. A nice example for a Transparencymap is in the paragraph ''Translucencymap''.

There's one catch though, you can't change Fresnel transparency with a Transparencymap. So you have to use plain transparency, or fake the Fresnel effect with the method described in the section [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Tutorials/Textures/Map_Input_Techniques Map Input].


== Refractionmap ==
Well, there's no such thing as a Refractionmap. You can't change the IOR with a texture. You may try and use Environment Maps to fake refraction, but the result is often not worth the effort (for stills, in an animation it might not be that noticeable).

== Translucencymap ==
Translucency is a material property of all semitransparent materials, like frosted glass, paper, plastic, cloth, skin, stained glass and the like. It allows objects to be lit from behind. 

Totally clear glass does not show where the lightrays travel through it. But if the glass is dirty or uneven you will see the path of the light. In the first example (''Translucency 1'') the glass material has a transparency of about 0.5 and a translucency of 0.78. So the glass is brighter where the lightrays hit the surface from behind. Additionally a Transparencymap - which sets Alpha to 1 - lets the surface appear to be stained. If we use the same map also as a Translucencymap (''Translucency 2''), the stain appears to be lit - which it would be of course also in reality. 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-noTranslucencyAlphamap.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Translucency 1:'' Material with Translucency and a Transparencymap, but without a Translucencymap. This is an example from the releasenotes of Blender v2.32.]]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-TranslucencyAlphamap.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Translucency 2:'' Material with Translucency and a Transparencymap and a Translucencymap.]]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

[[File:Blender3D TranslucencyMapSettings-2.49.png|framed|Material settings for example ''Translucency 2'' (blue glas).]]
The settings for the material (''Z-Transp'', but raytracing shadows):

The texture itself is a ''Hard Noise'' ''Clouds'' texture, with modified ''Brightness'' and ''Contrast''.

{{clr}}
{{B3D:N2P/Note|To get the shadow and those colors as in the example images set the light to use ''Ray Shadow'' and the plane to recieve transparent shadows by enabling ''TraShadow'' in the shaders tab in the ''Material'' buttons.}}

== Bumpmap/Normalmap ==
[[File:Blender3D BumpMapSettings-2.49.png|framed|Settings for a Bumpmap in the ''Map To'' panel.]]
[[w:Bump mapping|Bumpmaps]] are a technique to create the illusion of geometry. They could be used for something like a canvas or any small structures that are either difficult to model, or are too computationally expensive. As long as you don't get too close with the camera you won't notice the difference. 

They come in several different flavors:
* A Bumpmap texture in the nearer sense is a greyscale image or procedural texture mapped to ''Nor''. Don't activate the button ''Normal Map'' in the ''Texture Buttons'' for a Bumpmap. 
* A Normalmap is an RGB image whose color information bears the information about the direction of the surface normal, also mapped to ''Nor''. For this you need to activate the button ''Normal Map'' in the ''Texture Buttons''.

See also the manual about the differences between [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Textures/Maps/Bump_and_Normal_Maps Bump and Normal Maps]. 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-ColorBumpmap.jpg|thumb|300px|The bumped image.]]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
[[File:Blender3D Tutorials-Textures-Bumpmap.jpg|thumb|300px|The Bumpmap, a simple greyscale image.]]
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
In the example the bump map was used additionally to the colormap. The ''Nor'' slider in the ''Map To'' panel sets the depth of the bumping. 

{{clr}}

== Displacement Map==
[[File:Blender3D DisplacementHoehenfeld.png|framed|none|A displacement map deformes the mesh]]
A Displacement Map creates real geometry, i.e. it moves the vertices of a mesh. Therefore you need a lot of vertices. You can use it as a texture mapped to ''Disp'', or even more flexible using the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Modifiers/Mesh/Displace Displacement Modifier]. 


== Dirtmap ==
[[File:Blender3D ColorDirtmap-2.49.jpg|thumb|300px|Our picture has seen some bad times.]]
I will try to explain what a Dirtmap is and how you apply one. There are different things that people mean when they talk about dirtmapping. 
* Sometimes a Diffusemap is meant. 
* Dirtshading is often used as a term for Ambient Occlusion. 

With a Dirtmap I simply mean any texture that breaks the clean, uniform, untouched look of image or procedural textures. You may do this by simply combining some partially transparent textures resp. textures that affect only parts of the picture in a semirandom way. You can also select parts of the object with a [http://www.cgcookie.com/articles/2008/12/21/blender-intro-to-stencil-maps stencil] texture. And of course you can (and will) combine both of these methods.

As long as two textures don't affect the same property you can simply apply one after the other. To select only parts of your texture to apply another texture with the same properties use stenciling. Or use stenciling as a convenient method to separate two different sections on your texture. 

You need at least three textures for this. 
# The basic texture (e.g. color).
# The selecting (stenciling) texture.
# The Dirtmap affecting the same or other properties then the first texture.

The stenciling texture has to provide an intensity value, so if you want to use an image (or other RGB) texture you must activate ''No RGB''. 

[[File:Blender3D StencilingTexture-Example.png|thumb|300px|left|The stenciling texture.]]
The image texture used as a dirtmap for our example contains some semirandom noise.
[[File:Blender3D StencilDirtMapSettings-2.49.png|framed|Settings for the stenciling texure.]]
''Nor'' for the stenciling texture was not really necessary, but it adds a nice 3D effect. Since the stenciling texture is mostly white, I had to use ''Neg'' to use the black pixels as mask.

The third texture (&quot;Dirt&quot;) affects ''Col'', ''Nor'' and ''Spec''.
{{clr}}

== Use UV Coordinates for your Maps ==
It is often necessary to create UV coordinates for more complicated textures/objects. UV coordinates only describe the geometry of the mapping, i.e. which pixels to map on what face. You can use the UV coordinates to create any mapping you want.

# Create an UV map for your object. This is beyond the scope of ''this'' tutorial, see [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics|UV Map Basics]] and the section about UV Mapping in the manual. 
# Don't turn ''TexFace'' in the ''Material'' Panel in the ''Material buttons'' on. Though ''TexFace'' is a very simple way to use UV textures, the normal texture mapping methods are much more flexible.
# Load the image you used for UV-mapping (or any image with the same size) as an image texture. Change ''Map Input'' to ''UV''. 
# Now you can use this image - or multiple different images - for your maps, including color-mapping.

The advantage of this technique is that you have much better control over your texture. Even if you just want to texture something like a cube shaped object, you're often better of with UV mapped textures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &lt;big&gt;'''Option A: Modern Analytical Chemistry'''&lt;/big&gt; ==



== A1	Analytical Techniques ==

&lt;big&gt;A.1.1	State the reasons for using analytical techniques&lt;/big&gt;

	The main use of analytical analysis is to determine chemical structure and composition, and to determine purity of substances.  Structure is found through instrumentation.  

&lt;big&gt;A.1.2	State that the structure of a compound can be determined by using information from a variety of analytical techniques singularly or in combination&lt;/big&gt;

	Information from only one technique is usually insufficient to determine or confirm a structure.


== A2	Principles of Spectroscopy ==

&lt;big&gt;A.2.1	Describe the electromagnetic spectrum&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;A.2.2	Distinguish between absorption and emission spectra and how each is produced.&lt;/big&gt;

Emission Spectroscopy: the analysis of light energy emitted by excited atoms, ions, or molecules as they transition back to their ground state.

Absorption Spectroscopy: when radiation is passed through a sample, some of the energy is absorbed by the sample to excite an atom, ion, or molecule to the excited state.  A spectrometer analyzes the transmitted energy relative to the incident energy.  This energy is quantized.  

&lt;big&gt;A.2.3	Describe the atomic and molecular processes in which absorption of energy takes place&lt;/big&gt;

	Absorption in the UV and visible region are due to transitions in which electrons excite to high levels
	Molecular vibrations, stretching and bending, occur in the Infrared (IR) region resulting in changes in polarity of the molecules
	Molecular rotations occur in the microwave region
	For every bond type, there is a unique bond strength, and there is a different amount of energy necessary to vibrate, rotate, etc.

== A3	Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy ==

&lt;big&gt;A.3.1	Describe the operating principles of a double-beam IR spectrometer.&lt;/big&gt;

The spectrometer has a source of infrared light (hot coil of nichrome wire) that emits radiation over the whole frequency range of the detector. The beam is then split into two beams of equal intensity. One beam is passed through the sample and one through the reference chamber. The rotating disk alternates the two light beams passing through. The intensity of the two beams are compared and the wavelength over which the comparison is made is dispersed on the detector via the prism. Generally, this detector converts the reading into electrical signals for storage. 

&lt;big&gt;
A.3.2	Describe how information from an IR spectrum can be used to identify bonds.&lt;/big&gt;

	IR helps to confirm or eliminate functional groups present in a molecule
	When an organic compound is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, it absorbs energy of a certain wavelength and transmits energy of other wavelengths.
	Based on this information about energy released or absorbed, information about functional groups can be deduced
	Functional groups have characteristic IR absorptions that do not change from one compound to another.

&lt;big&gt;A.3.3	Explain what occurs at a molecular level during the absorption of IR radiation by molecules&lt;/big&gt;

	When IR radiation strikes a molecule, it causes the molecule to stretch, bend, or vibrate, thus changing the polarity of the molecule
	The energy needed to stretch, bend, or vibrate is quantized
	A molecule can vibrate at specific frequencies relative to specific energy levels


&lt;big&gt;A.3.4	Analyze IR spectra of organic compounds&lt;/big&gt;


&lt;big&gt;

== A4	Mass Spectrometry ==
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;A.4.1	Determine the molecular mass of a compound from the molecular ion peak.&lt;/big&gt;

Look at the farthest right peak to determine the mass of the entire molecule.  This may vary by one or two grams per charge due to isotopes.  

&lt;big&gt;A.4.2	Analyze fragmentation patterns in a mass spectrum to find the structure of a compound.&lt;/big&gt;
	
When a sample is introduced into the mass spectrum and ionized, some of the molecular bonds are broken and produce fragments.  These fragments are also deflected by the magnetic field and show up on the detector.  The fragments can help determine the molecular structure of the molecule. Examples:  

Mr -15)+ is a loss of CH3.
	
Mr -17)+ is a loss of OH.

Mr -29)+ is a loss of C2H5 or CHO.

Mr -31)+ is a loss of CH3O.

Mr -45)+ is a loss of COOH.

== A5	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy ==
 
&lt;big&gt;A.5.1	Deduce the structure of a compound given information from its H NMR spectrum.&lt;/big&gt;

	The number of hydrogen environments is shown by the number of peaks on the chart.  The relative height of the peaks is equivalent to the number of members of each hydrogen environment.
NMR Theory
	The hydrogen nucleus acts like a “spinning top.” 
	The spinning nuclei act like a spinning magnet which can interact with an external magnetic field.
	A spinning Hydrogen nucleus will orient itself so that it is parallel or anti-parallel to an external magnetic field.
	Parallel orientations are more stable than anti-parallel, therefore they are lower in energy.
	When a nuclei is radiated with energy of the correct frequency, the lower energy (parallel) orientations flip to the higher energy (anti-parallel) state.
	When a flip occurs, it is now in a resonance state and exhibits nuclear magnetic resonance.
	Absorption frequency is not the same for all hydrogen nuclei.
	Local magnetic fields from surrounding electron clouds will shield the external magnetic field.
	Each cluster of groups creates a different amount of shielding.

&lt;big&gt;A.5.2	Outline how NMR is used in body scanners.&lt;/big&gt;
	
Protons in water, lipids, carbohydrates, etc. each give different signals depending on their hydrogen environments.  An image of the whole body can be built up by placing the patient inside a magnet of a MRI machine. MRI is especially useful for diagnosing tumors, cancer, multiple sclerosis, hydrocephalus, and torn ligaments. The radiation associated with Nuclear Magnetic Radiation are low-energy radio waves, therefore they are not harmful to the human body. 

The MRI scan can detect heart defects and also changes in the thickness of the muscles around the heart. MRI gives detailed images and can be used to find tumour in brain and examine soft parts such as liver, kidney, spleen. 

MRI is dangerous as it has small risk to the foetus in the first 12 weeks. Its disadvantage is that the scan may augment claustrophobia.

== A6	Atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy ==

&lt;big&gt;A.6.1 	State the uses of AA spectroscopy.&lt;/big&gt; 

	Used to determine concentrations of an element or ion to one part per million.  AA can also be used to determine the concentrations of metals in water, blood, soil, oil, and food.

&lt;big&gt;A.6.2	Describe the principles of atomic absorption.&lt;/big&gt;
 
	Atomic Emission spectra are obtained by giving atoms of an element sufficient electrical or heat energy and recording the light emitted as the electron transitions back to the ground state.  AA is the reverse of emission spectroscopy. In AA, it is the energy absorbed by the electrons as they are promoted from a lower state to a higher state that is measured.  By the amount of light absorbed, the concentration of a particular element can be quantized.  AA utilized a double-beam principle outlined in IR spectrometer.  There is a different light source necessary for each element being analyzed.  The AA utilizes light of a specific frequency passing through the sample (analate).  

&lt;big&gt;A.6.3	Describe the use of each of the following components of the AA spectrophotometer: fuel, atomizer, monochromatic light source, monochromatic detector and readout.&lt;/big&gt; 
	AA uses light of a specific frequency passing through the sample.  The sample is first put into a fine mist/aerosol in the nebulizer.  The mist is mixed first with the fuel and the oxidizer, then burned.  
	Monochromatic light from the light source is passed through the vapor sample.  
	Amount of light absorbed by the sample is detected by converting it into an electrical signal
	Double-beam principle compares the amount of light from the source to the amount of light which passed through the flame.  The difference between the beams is detected and converted into an electrical signal by the photomultiplier.  This is the amount absorbed by the photomultiplier
	A calibration curve must first be determined by comparing its absorption to the control

&lt;big&gt;A.6.4	Determine the concentration of a solution from a calibration curve.&lt;/big&gt; 

	The concentration of each element can be determined because there is a direct relationship between the concentration and the absorption.  If the same sample and the same path length are maintained, the Absorption remains proportional to the concentration.  A plot of Absorption vs. Concentration should produce a straight line.  
	A=-logTf
	A = log (lo/la)

== A7	Chromatography ==

&lt;big&gt;
A.7.1	State the reasons for using chromatography.&lt;/big&gt;

Chromatography can be used to separate mixtures containing very small amounts of the individual components.  Coupled with other techniques, it can be used to separate and identify complex mixtures quantitatively and qualitatively.  It can also be used to determine how pure a substance is. 
 
&lt;big&gt;A.7.2	Explain that all chromatographic techniques involve absorption on a stationary phase and partition between a stationary phase and a mobile phase.&lt;/big&gt; 

In each type of chromatography, there are two phases: a stationary phase which stays fixed and a mobile phase which moves.  Chromatography relies on the fact that in a mixture, the components have different tendencies to absorb onto a surface or dissolve in a solvent.  This makes it possible to separate them.  

&lt;big&gt;A.7.3	Outline the use of paper chromatography, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography.&lt;/big&gt; 

Paper Chromatography: 
	A small amount of the mixture is placed onto the paper approximately 1 cm from the edge.  Then, the paper is suspended in a small quantity of the solvent (eluent) in a closed container.  The closed container allows the atmosphere to be saturated, and prevent evaporation of the solvent from the paper to give better and faster separation.  As the solvent rises up the paper, the components in the mixture divide between the two phases depending on their relative solubility.  As the solvent nears the top, a mark is made to record the level, then the paper is removed and dried.  Some components are colored and can be seen with the naked eye, however, some necessitate staining (maybe with iodine) or irradiation with an ultraviolet lamp.  Due to the equilibrium between the two phases, the solute will solute will always move at the same fraction of the distance of the solvent as long as temperature is held constant.  Solutes have individual Retention factors (Rf) for each eluent.  This factor is found by measuring the distance from the original spot both to the center of the particular component and to the solvent front.  

	 Rf=(distance moved by solute)/(distance moved by solvent (eluent)) = x/y

	If substances have similar Rf values, the paper can be turned 90⁰ and treated with a different solvent.  This is known as two-way chromatography

	Sometimes, paper chromatograms may need to be developed, as in the separation of sugars

Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):

	Similar to paper chromatography, but instead of paper, a thin layer of solid (such as alumina or silica), or an inert support (such as glass) are used.
	When absolutely dry, it works like adsorption, but, like paper, silica, and alumina have a high affinity for water, therefore the partition occurs more by partition, with water as the stationary phase.
	The separated components can be recovered pure by scraping off the section containing the component and dissolving it in a solvent.  
	Pregnancy tests may use TLC to detect pregnanediol in urine

Column Chromatography: 

	Separates the components of a mixture for further use rather than identification
	Stationary Phase: alumina or silica gel
	Column is set up by packing the dry stationary phase on top of a piece of glass wool in a long column with a tap at the end and then saturating it with the eluting solvent.  
	The sample is added at the top and as it moves down the column, more eluent is added
	After some of the components have been eluted, it is possible to elute more tightly help components

== A8	Visible and ultraviolet (UV-Vis) spectroscopy	 ==

&lt;big&gt;A.8.1	Describe the effect of different ligands on the splitting of the d orbitals in transition metal complexes.&lt;/big&gt; 

	Coloration has to do with an unoccupied d level; hence, Zn, Cd, and Hg are colorless.  The different ligands are actually not all on the same level—the dx2-y2 and dz2 are slightly higher than the dxy, dxz, and dyz ligands.  

&lt;big&gt;A.8.2	Describe the factors that affect the colour of transition metal complexes.&lt;/big&gt; 

	Electron transitions withinn the d sublevel absorb energy in the visible light spectrum.  When white light falls on a solution containing the complex ion of a transition metal, some of the light is absorbed.  The solution transmits the remaining light.  The light is the complimentary color of the absorbed light.  Factors that affect d-d splitting and hence color include the nature of the transition element, the oxidation state, the type of ligand, and the shape of the complex ion (tetrahedral, square planar, octahedral)

&lt;big&gt;A.8.3	State that organic molecules containing a double bond absorb UV radiation.&lt;/big&gt; 

	Molecules that contain unsaturated double bonds can absorb UV radiation. UV light tells us about the presence of a double-bond in a molecule. Molecules that have double bonds alternating with single bonds are called conjugated dienes. Compounds absorbing UV radiation include alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons/arenes, and chlorophyll.   

&lt;big&gt;A.8.4	Describe the effect of the conjugation of double bonds in organic molecules on the wavelength of the absorbed light.&lt;/big&gt; 

As energy is gained, the double bond is elevated to an anti-bonding state.  With UV radiation, the energy absorbed corresponds to the amount necessary to raise the energy level of a pi electron in an unsaturated solution to a higher empty energy level.  

&lt;big&gt;A.8.5	Predict whether or not a particular molecule will absorb UV or visible radiation.&lt;/big&gt; 

	When a wavelength of UV with the correct quanta of energy needed to excite a pi electron to a higher energy level is absorbed, energy is absorbed.  This absorbed energy is detected and recorded.  This requires a large amount of energy.  Most compounds absorb in the UV region and therefore appear colorless.  Conjugated dienes require less energy to promote pi electrons to a higher energy level.  Only conjugated dienes show UV absorption above 200nm because of the delocalizes electrons and corresponding resonance structures.  

&lt;big&gt;A.8.6	Determine the concentration of a solution from a calibration curve using the Beer-Lambert law.&lt;/big&gt;

	Beers law states that the concentration of each element can be determined because there is a direct relationship between the concentration and the absorption.  
	A = abc where A=absorbance, a=absorbicity constant, b=path length, and c=concentration
Since the path length and the absorbicity are held constant, absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration.  A plot of Absorbance v. concentration should produce a straight line.

== A9	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy ==

&lt;big&gt;A.9.1	Explain the use of tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the reference standard&lt;/big&gt;

	TMS is used as a reference for a variety of reasons: (1) It has only one type of hydrogen, therefore a single peak is produce. (2)The signal appears at a higher field than most compounds, and thus can be set to zero for reference. (3) It is a relatively inert compound, and therefore unlikely to react with the sample. (4) It has a low boiling point, and can be easily removed from the sample.  

&lt;big&gt;A.9.2	Analyze H NMR Spectra&lt;/big&gt;

	The number of peaks on the diagram corresponds to the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the neighbouring carbon atoms (note: the neighbouring hydrogen atoms must have a different chemical shift). The area under each peak is proportional to the number of carbons with the same number of hydrogen neighbors.

== A10	Chromatography ==

&lt;big&gt;A.10.1	Describe the techniques of gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).&lt;/big&gt;
 
Gas-Liquid Chromatography:

	Use: separate and identify components that are present in mixtures of volatile liquids that do not decompose at temperatures at or near their boiling points.
	Stationary Phase: liquid coated onto a solid support in a long, thin capillary tube
	Mobile Phase: inert gas such as nitrogen or helium
	Sample is injected through a self-sealing cap into an oven for vaporization.
	The sample is then carried by the inert gas into the column which is coiled and fitted into an oven.
	At the end of the column the separated components exit into a detector
	This is usually a flame ionization detector to a chart recorder
	Each component will have a separate retention time and the area under its peak will be proportional to the amount of component present
	Practical applications: BAC

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):

	Column Chromatography—gravity allows solvent to elute
	HPLC—mobile force is forced through under pressure
	Stationary Phase: silica particles with long chain alkanes adsorbed onto their surface
	Separation is efficient to long columns are not needed
	Separated components identified with UV Spectroscopy
	Like GLC, results recorded on a chart showing different retention times
	HPLC can be used for separation and identification
	Useful for non-volatile components that decompose near their boiling points
	Can separate enantiomers using columns containing optically active materials

&lt;big&gt;A.10.2	Deduce which chromatographic technique is most appropriate for separating the components in a particular mixture.&lt;/big&gt;

HPLC: component that are temperature-sensitive; analysis of

	Oil
	Alcoholic beverages
	Antioxidants
	Sugars and vitamins in foods
	Pharmaceuticals
	Polymers
	Biochemical and biotechnology research
	Quality control of insecticides and herbicides

GLC: identify compounds that can vaporize without decomposing; uses include analysis of

	Urine samples from athletes for drugs
	Underground mine gases
	BAC levels

[[Image:Kielbasas.jpg|thumb|Various brands of kielbasa]]

'''Kiełbasa''' is a Polish word for traditional '''Polish [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]]'''. The word has become a commonly used North American term for Eastern European styles of sausage, including '''Ukrainian sausage''', which is called ''kovbasa'' or ''kubasa''. 

==Usage==
[[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] is a staple of Polish cuisine and comes in dozens of varieties, smoked or fresh, but almost always based on [[Cookbook:Pork]] (although in many areas, it is available in [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], and sometimes in [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Horse|horse]], [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], or [[Cookbook:Bison|bison]]), every region having its own speciality. Popular varieties include:
* ''[[Cookbook:Kabanos|Kabonos]]y'', a thin, air-dried sausage flavoured with [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]] seed, originally made of horse meat (but today usually pork or turkey)
* ''[[Cookbook:Krakowska|Krakowska]]'', a thick, straight sausage hot-smoked with pepper and garlic; its name comes from Kraków
* ''[[Cookbook:Wiejska|Wiejska]]'' (pronounced in Polish {{IPA|/ˈvʲejska/}}), a large U-shaped [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] sausage with [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] and [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]; its name means &quot;rural&quot; or (an adjectival use of) &quot;country&quot;, or (adjectival use of) &quot;village&quot;.

In the U.S., &quot;kielbasa&quot; almost always means some form of ''wiejska'' (although often not U-shaped and seldom containing veal), which may be unsmoked (&quot;fresh&quot;) or fully or partly smoked. Similar sausages are found in other Slavic nations as well, notably the Czech Republic (spelled &quot;klobása&quot;) and Slovakia (spelled &quot;klobása&quot;).  In Ukraine &quot;kovbasa&quot; is properly pronounced {{IPA|/kovbɑsɑ/}}, but in English is usually pronounced {{IPA|/ˈkʌbɑsɑ/}}.

Original kielbasa is also called &quot;Polska kiełbasa&quot; for &quot;Polish Sausage&quot; or &quot;Kielbasa Starowiejska&quot; known as &quot;Old Country Style Sausage&quot;. This one comes closest to what is generally known in America as &quot;kielbasa&quot; (Polish sausage, Polska Kiełbasa). Nowadays, many major meat packers across America offer a product called &quot;kielbasa,&quot; but it is usually a far cry from the real thing.

Real kielbasa uses only the choicest cuts of tender pork, and often a little beef or veal is added to improve its body and character. The sausage is seasoned with fresh herbs and spices and then gently smoked, just long enough to achieve the right color, flavor and aroma. It is good for breakfast or supper as a cold cut with [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] or mustard.

In Poland, kielbasa is traditionally served with fried onions, red horseradish (which is blended with beets), and - in form of small pieces, fried together with onions - as an addition to [[Cookbook:Pierogi|pierogi]], which are crescent-shaped dumplings filled with potato, cheese or mushrooms. Kielbasa can be served hot — boiled, baked or grilled. It can be cooked in soups (such as ''biały barszcz'', ''kapuśniak'', or ''grochówka''), baked with sauerkraut, or added to bean dishes, stews (notably ''[[Cookbook:Bigos|bigos]]'', the Polish national dish), and casseroles.

A less widely available variety of kielbasa is the White Fresh (''biała''), which is sold uncooked and unsmoked, then usually boiled or cooked in a soup in place of a typical meat.  This variety of kielbasa taste similar to mild Italian sausage.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE ARMY OF INVADERS==


THE BEGINNING OF CONFLICT

There has always been spiritual conflict between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness which is ruled by the adversary of God, Satan.

The conflict began before the world began when Satan who was then a high official in the realm of Yahweh God's domain became lifted up in pride and presumed to be like the Most High God.

The Bible tells us, &quot;Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of splendor;&quot; (Ezekiel 28:17a) &quot;For you have said in your heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the farthest side of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most high&quot; (Isaiah 14:13-14)

We are given to understand that in his rebellion, he drew away one third of the angelic hosts under his leadership in accusations he made against the justice and wisdom of Almighty God. The question of the worthiness of Yahweh God to require complete submission and obedience had to be addressed and so the plan of redemption was formed in the mind of God to address the issues Satan raised.

It was not long after the creation of Adam that Satan entered the scene, to usurp the authority and dominion which Adam as head of the human race, had been given over the earth.  In the Garden, he proposed the same type of question regarding the credibility of Yahweh God, as he had done before the throne of God.  Through the deception of the woman who enticed her husband Adam, he gained dominion over the human race and thereby over the whole earth.  Now, it was not only the angelic hosts who had come into subjection to him, but he had also gained an earthly kingdom over which to rule.  Genesis 1:26-3:24
And so, began the enactment of the plan of salvation which was formulated before the foundation of the world.


THE KINGDOM OF SATAN

The first era of man's existence upon earth was so filled with violence and corruption by Satan's infiltration of the human race, that it had to be destroyed (Genesis 6:1-8). After the flood, men again rebelled under the leadership of Nimrod who became a &quot;mighty one on the earth&quot; (Genesis 10:8).  He established a kingdom with the cities of Babel, Erech, Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar.  It is said that he was a mighty hunter of men's souls in opposition to Yahweh God (Genesis 10:9-14).

The rebellion began in earnest at Babel against submission to Yahweh God by the substitution of the true worship with a subtle counterfeit of man's government.  Man in control of his own destiny under the leadership of Nimrod strengthened himself in his independence with a false messiah-image which was portrayed in Nimrod after he was killed.

His wife continued the image which he had adopted of being King of the earth's inhabitants, and claimed that from his 'heavenly' state, he had impregnated her with divine seed of the promised 'messiah' which would save mankind.  And so , mankind in his fallen, rebellious state was provided with a messiah/saviour image through &quot;immaculate&quot; conception which was a complete counterfeit of the true promised Messiah that was promised to Eve, in the garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).

Satan presented mankind with a substitute religious system which was like the &quot;Most High&quot;, pre-empting the virgin birth of the Son of God through his own intermediatory agent. By this means, Satan deceived mankind into worshiping him through a counterfeit image. When the peoples had their languages confused and were dispersed throughout the earth after the fall of the tower of Babel, this form of religion was taken with them and it's end result is in the many different religions we have in the world today.  The same Madonna and child images are portrayed in every religion under different names in the different languages.


THE KINGDOM OF GOD

When the true Messiah, the Son of God, came as promised through a virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14), He established the kingdom of God first in the hearts of men (Luke 17:21) who would become citizens of His kingdom before going away to receive the kingdom from the hands of its present owner (Satan) and to return at a later time with His faithful servants to establish the kingdom on earth (Luke 19:11-12,15; Rev 11:15).

He commissioned His apostles and disciples to go through all the earth and make disciples of all the nations as ambassadors for Him during His absence (Matthew 28:18-20; 2 Corinthians 5:20). But with the passing of the original apostles, the truth was subverted was within and it was not long before the true faith was also perverted through the infiltration of these counterfeit religions.
 
With the advent of Constantine, Christianity became the state &quot;religion&quot; by enmeshing together pagan practices with Christian ordinances.  Eventually, the Roman Catholic Church became the embodiment of this false system of religious worship that counterfeited the true knowledge of God as given by revelation through Moses and renewed to the people of God through the advent of Yeshua the Messiah.

However, Yahweh God raised up a standard and a restoration began with Martin Luther who headed a reformation against the Roman Catholic Church that eventually led to the Bible being placed in the hands of the common people, so that all could read the scriptures for themselves. The light which began to be shed on the Word of God has continued to this day, with various groups breaking away from the established churches, as they saw truths in the Bible which had been forgotten, or lost to their knowledge.

With each truth re-discovered, which was usually only received by a remnant each time, the main body of people who had come into this further measure of truth have had to leave the mainstream church of their time, to give expression to their new-found illumination, and each move of God has ended up becoming a denomination which then resisted the next measure of truth that was revealed. And so, the process has gone on to our present day, with each group persecuting the next group who comes into more revelation.
&quot;The path of the just is like the shining light, that shines even brighter unto the perfect day&quot;  (Proverbs 4:18)

And so, in each generation, in each church, God has had a people who are prepared, whatever the cost, to forsake all and follow Him - to leave father, mother, sister, brother. friends and loved ones for the love above all others. He who died to give His life for us, that we might become the sons of God. That we might know what it is to be adopted  into the family of God - sons of the Most High God  - to inherit all of our heavenly Father's estate and be transformed into His image.

Even so, in this day, out of this last day &quot;church&quot;, He is calling forth a people who are willing to lay down all to follow Him, who are prepared to pay the price of discipleship, who are prepared to be all that He has called them to be, to lay down their own self-life for His sake and forsaking all, to follow where He leads in the passion of their love for Him - to count it but &quot;dung&quot; that they might be counted worthy of the prize of His high calling in Yeshua the Messiah, to be His firstfruits that come forth from the earth into His glory.

&quot;If Jesus Christ be God, and died for me, then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for Him&quot;  (motto of C. T. Studd missionary to India and South Africa who did leave all to follow the divine call and gave his life on the mission field and formed the missionary organisation, Worldwide Evangelisation Crusade)

No sacrifice is too great in the light of what He did for us!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Initialization ==

When a computer is first started, it is in an unknown state. Static electricity and remnants of previous states can lead to values that are not valid states for the machine. In defense, computer programmers have learned to initialize all variables before using them.

After the initial start-up process, the next step depends on the type of computer
==Mainframes==
For large mainframe computers, the Initial Program Load, or IPL, is used to load a bootstrap program, typically very tiny, whose purpose is to load the actual boot loader from disk, tape or other media.
==Microcomputers==
For typical desktop, server, or rack-mounted blade computers, the power-on-self-test or POST initializes the computer, which then passes execution over to the ROM, where the BIOS system initializes the bottom page or so of RAM, then passes execution to the boot process.
==Bootstrap==
One of the first things that the boot process does is load the boot loader, which then loads the operating system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Interface ==

An interface is a connection between two devices or organisms or between a device and an organism.
Interfaces are usually characterized by a '''standard''', by '''protocols''', and by '''physical links'''. The earliest computers had only a plug-board and lights for input and output. Scientists had to put customized plugs into the plug-board, and then read the results off of the lights. Then, a printer interface was created that allowed the computer to form letters in much the same way as typewriters did. Then punch cards were created that let operators enter programs one line at a time. From this evolved command languages that operated on a line at a time, these early protocols were later called Command Line Interfaces or CLI's. As computers became more powerful, more devices were allowed to hook up to them, and more interfaces were designed. Different computer companies made different types of interfaces for the same devices, and so there was always a demand that the manufacturers settle on a common standard for their interfaces. From this developed first buses, then Interface cards, then standard interface designs, until today, computers come with many standard hardware and software interfaces that allow them to talk to many different types of hardware, and to connect to humans in different and gradually more and more intuitive ways.

Fiction would have us believe that the most intimate interface would be an implant within the head that allowed us to interface directly with a computer, that might also be within our heads. Until this is practical we are limited to interfaces based on graphics and pointing devices, and a type of  interface called a GUI or Graphics User Interface. The most popular of these interfaces is called WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers), which was originally written in Smalltalk for the Xerox star, and was rewritten to suit other platforms when it was found to be so useful. You are probably using a variation of this interface now.

type=Magic spell|
features=Knocks things over|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Descendo''''' jinx is used to knock over piles of things. It is apparently not an instantaneous action; using it on a tall pile of stuff, for instance, will cause the pile to start to fall, but it can still be stopped with a properly timed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite|Finite]] charm.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this jinx used near the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] have entered the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], and have split up to search for the lost Diadem. Harry is trapped by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Hearing Ron, Crabbe uses the Descendo jinx to try and drop a 50-foot pile of stuff onto Ron; Harry stops it with the Finite charm, and Draco then prevents him from using it again.

The '''''Duro''''' spell turns things to stone.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell was used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to allow her, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] to escape pursuing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. Having [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Glisseo|turned a staircase into a slide]], the Trio passed through a tapestry at the bottom. Hermione then turned the tapestry to stone to disable the Death Eaters following; we hear the crunch as they hit the back of the tapestry.

== Overview ==

The '''''Finite''''' charm, like the similar [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite Incantatem|Finite Incantatem]] charm, is used to stop a spell's continuing effects. Finite seems to generally act on only one spell, where Finite Incantatem appears to act on all active spells in a locality.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] is hit by a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tarantallegra|Tarantallegra]] jinx. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] uses the Finite charm to quiet Neville's legs.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Descendo|Descendo]] jinx to try to drop a pile of junk onto [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] stops the pile falling with the Finite charm.

Note that this spell, like all other working spells, seems to be based on Latin, and as such its incantation should be pronounced with three syllables rather than two.

name=Glisseo|
type=Spell (charm)|
features=Turns staircase into a slide|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]}}

== Overview ==

The '''''Glisseo''''' charm flattens the treads of a staircase, effectively turning it into a slide.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this charm in action in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 17|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], upset at what he believes to be a betrayal of the newly created [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]], attempts to fetch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] from her dormitory. After he has taken about three steps on the staircase, it turns into a slide under him, depositing him on the floor of the Common Room. Hermione later says that evidently the Founders felt girls were more trustworthy than boys, which is why the boys' dormitories are not similarly rigged to prevent girls from entering.

We do not hear the incantation, though, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']]. There, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], the Trio have taken refuge behind the tapestry at the top of a flight of stairs. A pair of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] spot them, and Hermione uses Glisseo to turn the stairs into a slide to hasten their getaway.

Key (b)
Sol.: a ×b = | a
( a ×b).(c ×d)=1
⇒ sinα . sinβ 1 2 (nˆ .nˆ ) = 1 where θ is the angle between 1 2 n􀁇 &amp;n􀁇
⇒ sinα sinβ cosθ = 1
⇒ sinα = 1, sinβ = 1 and cosθ = 1
⇒ α = π/2, β = π/2 and θ = 0
Now, a . c 1

As a ×b || c×d , a, b, c, d are coplanar
There are two possibilities as shown

It is easy to create a survey type questionnaire using Question Writer, using either '''multiple choice'''; 
 

[[File:QW3 Survey Multiple choice.jpg|center]]


'''True/False''';

 
[[File:QW3 Survey True false.jpg|center]] 


or '''Essay''' type questions;  

 
[[File:QW Essay.jpg|center]]


If you want to use the questionnaire to measure overall satisfaction numerically you could also use Partial Credit questions with variable scoring, eg  

 
[[File:QW3 Survey Partial credit.jpg|center]]


In the Quiz set up you need to 
#Set [[../../Quiz Options/Quiz Details/Feedback Method|feedback]] to “No Question Feedback” 
#Untick Display Points Value for Questions in [[../../Quiz Options/Advanced Settings/General Question Properties|General Question Properties]]
#Disable the [[../../Quiz Options/Advanced Settings/Report Options|Display Report page]]
#Enter an appropriate message in [[../../Quiz Options/Other Labels|End of Quiz]]
 

[[File:QW3 Survey End of quiz.jpg|center]]


As with all Question Writer quizzes, the results can be sent to Question Writer Tracker and then downloaded to Excel if you want to do further analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hello!  My name is John Mitchem.  I am currently a Health and Physical Education Teacher in the Albemarle County Public School System.  This is my first year teaching with a provisional license.  I will soon be 32 so needless to say, I have a very unique journey to this point.  

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sports Medicine from Catawba College.  After becoming a licensed athletic trainer, I worked for a year at Lynchburg College and then 5 years for Waynesboro City Schools as their Head Athletic Trainer and also teaching a year long Sports Medicine class.  At the same time I was coaching club and high school volleyball.  In 2005 I was approached with the opportunity to become the Head Volleyball Coach at Mary Baldwin College.  So I left teaching and athletic training to pursue a college coaching career.  After two successful seasons I left to become the Assistant Volleyball Coach at James Madison University.  While at JMU I also finished my Masters Degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in Athletic Leadership.  As fate would have it, I met an amazing woman during my year at JMU.  I decided that instead of traveling around the country searching for the next greatest volleyball athlete, I needed to cultivate this relationship and start planning our future.   That led me to taking a position with Albemarle County Schools.  I teach K-4 in the morning and then 9th grade Health and PE in the afternoon.  I get the best of both worlds.  

On the personal side of life, I will be getting married on June 19th.  We have a 10 year old Cocker Spaniel named Ricky.  We love to travel!  We enjoy sporting events of any kind.  I am a huge University of Michigan football fan, while Wendy my fiance is a University of Tennessee fan.  
&lt;P&gt;
[[Image:Wendy John.JPG|300px|center]]

&lt;B&gt;Philosophy&lt;/B&gt;

Growing up in the suburbs of The District of Columbia I had the opportunity to attend K-12 in one of the largest public school systems in the country.  When I graduated high school in 1995, Fairfax County Public Schools had 23 high schools.   In the passing fourteen years FCPS has added two high schools and has a current pupil count of 168,742.  I believe I was given every opportunity to succeed in school.  As a teacher, I would like to give my students the same opportunities that were given to me.  These opportunities should be the same if I have the largest school system in the country or the smallest.  I believe with the advent of the internet and the world wide web, barriers are being knocked down every day in the transmission of information.  It is my responsibility to use the internet in the education of students.  

Students learn by doing.  As a teacher, I hope to keep my students on the edge of their seat when it comes to instruction.  I try to remember this Chinese Proverb when I'm planning my lessons:&lt;center&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Tell Me, I'll Forget&lt;BR&gt;
Teach Me, I'll Remember&lt;BR&gt;
Involve Me, I'll Understand&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Kids today love technology!  It so happens that I love technology as well!  Even as a Health and Physical Teacher I enjoy bringing technology to the students.  Some examples are the [http://www.primalpictures.com Primal Anatomy Software] or even as simple as pedometers and heart rate monitors.  I find that students enjoy getting data from these devices and manipulating them with Excel type software.  Global Positioning System (GPS) units are also big hits with the students.  Students enjoy the orienteering exercises and &quot;treasure hunts&quot; that these units facilitate.  I hope you will always find the latest gadget in my kids hands.
&lt;P&gt;
Because of my love for technology and being on the cutting edge, I would not like to see a national curriculum.  I enjoy pushing the envelope with my kids.  I wouldn't want the curriculum to be a step backward for my classroom.  If a national curriculum were to be created it would probably be a step backward from what my kids are learning.  I also think each community has certain resources that should be utilized.  If you live in an area that has mountains then your PE department should be using them for education.  If you are located near a body of water then your activities should include swimming, kayaking, or other water based activities.  Teachers are very resourceful, I do not believe their teaching should be based on a national curriculum that does not take into account the unique situations that teachers in different parts of the country enjoy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Systems Theory Page}}

'''Systems theory''' or '''general systems theory''' or '''systemics''' is an interdisciplinary field which studies systems as a whole. Systems theory was founded by [[w:Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]] and others between the 1940s and the 1970s on principles from physics, biology and engineering and later grew into numerous fields including philosophy, sociology, organizational theory, management, psychotherapy (within family systems therapy) and economics among others. Cybernetics is a closely related field.  In recent times '''complex systems''' has increasingly been used as a synonym. 

==Overview==

Systems theory focuses on complexity and interdependence.  A system is composed of regularly interacting or interdependent groups of activities/parts that form a whole.  

Part of systems theory, ''system dynamics'' is a method for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system -- the many circular, interlocking, sometimes time-delayed relationships among its components -- is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are chaos theory and social dynamics.  

Systems theory has also been developed within sociology. The most notable scientist in this area is [[w:Niklas Luhmann|Niklas Luhmann]] (see Luhmann 1994).
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory as organizations are dynamic living entities that are goal-oriented.  The systems approach to organizations relies heavily upon achieving negative entropy through openness and feedback.

In recent years, the field of ''systems thinking'' has been developed to provide techniques for studying systems in holistic ways to supplement more traditional reductionistic methods.  In this more recent tradition, systems theory is considered by some as a humanistic counterpart to the natural sciences.

==History==

Subjects like complexity, self-organization, connectionism and adaptive systems had already been studied in the 1940s and 1950s, in fields like cybernetics through researchers like [[w:Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener]], [[w:William Ross Ashby|William Ross Ashby]], [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] and Heinz Von Foerster.  They only lacked the right tools, and tackled complex systems with mathematics, pencil and paper. John von Neumann discovered cellular automata and self-reproducing systems without computers, with only pencil and paper. [[w:Aleksandr Lyapunov|Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[w:Jules Henri Poincaré|Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of chaos theory without any computer at all.

All of the &quot;C&quot;-Theories below - cybernetics, catastrophe theory, chaos theory,... - have the common goal to explain complex systems which consist of a large number of mutually 
interacting and interwoven parts. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]], and artificial life (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general complex systems.  The best context to compare the different &quot;C&quot;-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when
Edward Lorenz accidentally discovered a strange attractor with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without computers today.

===Timeline===
*1960 cybernetics (W. Ross Ashby, Norbert Wiener) Mathematical theory of the communication and control of systems through regulatory feedback. Closely related: &quot;control theory&quot; and &quot;general systems theory&quot; founded by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and W. Ross Ashby
*1970 catastrophe theory (René Thom, E.C. Zeeman) Branch of mathematics that deals with bifurcations in dynamical systems, classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances.
*1980 chaos theory (David Ruelle, Edward Lorenz, Mitchell Feigenbaum, Steve Smale, James A. Yorke....) Mathematical theory of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes bifurcations, strange attractors, and chaotic motions.
*1990 complex adaptive systems (CAS) (John H. Holland, Murray Gell-Mann, Harold Morowitz, W. Brian Arthur,..)  The &quot;new&quot; science of complexity which describes emergence, adaptation and self-organization was established mainly by researchers of the SFI and is based on agents and computer simulations and includes multi-agent systems (MAS) which have become an important tool to study social and complex  systems. CAS  are still an active field of research.

If Adventist Youth, Pathfinders, or Seventh-day Adventist Church are passionate hot topic issues for you, I suggest you stay away from books about those subjects and find other things to work on where you can either keep your passion in check or are able to direct your passion towards explaining subjects that can be useful to teach and learn from. You are also free to start a new book on the cult perspective of Adventist Youth, Pathfinders, or Seventh-day Adventist Church if you can maintain a [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]] and if you can ensure its verifiability by including references to reliable sources. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:50, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">About Me

Hello my name is Rebecca Burton, or Becky if you prefer, and I recently graduated with my bachelor's degree in Sociology this May 2009.  I am in Norfolk, Virginia and am currently attending ODU to recieve my Master's degree in middle school teaching. I have a twin sister named Jessica, and she is the one who actually inspired me to look into teaching. She is also doing teaching but is doing prek-6 and got me interested in teaching through her volunteering at various schools. We are very close and I am very excited that I will have her to support and be supported by in both of our teaching careers. I am also engaged, my fiance and I have been together for four years now and are getting married this December! My family is local to the Norfolk area, and I also have a black cat named Sigma who I love to pieces!! I would love to teach sixth grade, that is my ideal grade!! I am hoping that I will enjoy every minute of teaching, I am just eager to get into the classroom! I enjoy reading and shopping, and just relaxing and hanging out with friends.

Education on Philosophy

My philosophy on education does not come from any direct personal experience since my first times in the classroom have been with this course, but I believe that a good teacher is someone who wakes up every morning looking forward to the day ahead of them. A good teacher is not someone who goes to work every day just to make some money and get the paycheck, a good teacher is someone who wants the best out of themselves and out of their students. I believe that a good teacher is someone that you can rely on, look up to, and who motivates you to be your personal best. I believe that students with special needs need to be taught a little differently according to the way in which they each individually can learn best. If students with special needs were taught the same as the rest of the class, then they may be at a disadvantage depending on their learning impediment. I feel that boys and girls should be taught the same way because even though some research indicates that boys learn a certain way just as girls do, to attempt to teach both boys and girls in two different ways would end up creating confusion rather than clarity in most cases. Bilingual education is something I feel to be very important in today's society especially with the increasing speaking of other languages besides English.

I believe that my instructional strategies will pertain to a mixture of lecture and group assignments.  I feel it is important for students to work in groups to learn off of one another, and to also learn how to put ideas together and come to a consensus.  I believe that using both lecture and group assignments is an effective combination for teaching in the classroom. Using lecture allows each individual student to learn in their own unique way, but coming together in group assignments may allow students to grasp the concepts better by listening to their fellow students who may be able to present the information in a way the teacher is not capable of. I want my students to be able to use all different kinds of technology that are available because of the increasing changes in technology occurring everyday. If students are exposed to technology at an early age then they will be more adaptable to using technology throughout the rest of their academic careers. I picture my future classroom with a high level of interaction among student to student as well as between student and teacher. I believe that communication and interaction are important keys to successful teaching and learning. If students are communicating amongst eachother as well as with the teacher, then the door to communication is constantly open leaving no fear or doubt of communicating questions or concerns about the class. I believe that my future classroom will be full of participatory students, willing and eager to learn. Or at least I hope!

'''Association with Wikibook''' &lt;br&gt;
Majority of my participation with Wikibook was through my contribution to the [[Metabolomics]] Wikibook. This is a Wikibook being developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for the purpose of introducing a systems biology perspective to the traditional metabolism course that is part of our one year biochemistry course sequence. The initial concept of establishing the Metabolomics Wikibook was by [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Pac8612 Dr. Paul Craig], professor of biochemistry and informatics at the RIT. Under the guidance of Dr. Craig, the book has passed its beginning stage and is currently in its Project Refinement stage where we've begun to re-evaluate the content materials and reorganize it to reflect the most important content areas.

'''Learning from Wikibook''' &lt;br&gt;
My experience with the Metabolomics Wikibook has been extremely fulfilling. Part of my job with the Metabolomics Wikibook was to determined the appropriate media to apply to the content materials on the Wikibook. Determining the right images to apply required the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. Thoroughly reviewed the material in the section.&lt;br&gt;
2. Search the images that is appropriate for the material. &lt;br&gt;
3. Determined whether the material fits in with the entire section as a whole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This process of seeking images did not only involved the technically process of uploading images onto the book but most importantly thorough reading and learning about the material was necessary in order to seek the right images to apply. Majority of the imaging on with Wikibook is self-made. Therefore, understanding the material was extremely important in order to synthesized the right images for the material. This is why working on the Metabolomics Wikibook is so fulling because not only I was making different media for the book but I was also learning about the material, which helped to expand my knowledge of the varying fields of science. &lt;br&gt;

I like to thank Dr. Craig for giving me the opportunity to work on the Metabolomics Wikibook. Working with web media has been a loving hobby of mine and being able to do what I enjoy doing in my free time has allowed me to re-evaluate my career goals in life. I also like to thank my co-workers of the Metabolomics Wikibook, Nick Norrell and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:DieselSandwich Sophia Lafergola], for sticking to the project and for their input of contents on the book. I've learned a lot from their materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article describes how the laundry separation and washing options should be set.
Special focus is given on a simplified procedure; one which still ensures proper washing yet on a speedy/simple manner.
Some methods describe more separation of laundry and several washing periods (for several types of fabrics), yet this method consumes more time, electricity and cleaning agent. 

==Separation==
When a cloth is dirty and thus removed from the body, it should be separated immediately into a correct bin, so that the sorting of the laundry does not need to be done twice. If the 1st separation method is followed, 2 bins should be placed in the room where the filthy clothes are discarded. These containers include 1 bin for white &amp; heavily polluted clothes and 1 bin for colored clothes.

===Separation method 1===
*White and heavily polluted clothes and fabrics are sorted together. These include white clothing and fabrics as towels (kitchen towels, bath towels, ...), linen, white socks, and heavily polluted clothing as underwear, handkerchiefs, pillow cases, ... Note that most of the heavily polluted clothes are generally white as well so that no color blending can occur, in regions or instances where this is not the case, a alternative method should be used. Also note that heavily polluted clothing refers to the amount of bacteria/microorganisms the clothing generally carries after use, rather than the degree of visible filth.
*Colored clothes. These include pants, shirts, colored socks, skirts, ... 

==Washing procedure==
===Washing method 1 (requires additional ironing afterwards)===
The washing method for washing laundry with a washer machine after the separation method 1 has been followed is the following:
*The separated laundry piles (see laundry separation above) are inserted separately in the machine (thus in 2 runs). When the separation method 1 is used, the white and heavily polluted clothes/fabrics are washed at 60°Celsius and the colored clothes are washed at 40°Celsius.

==Ironing==
Usually, after the separation and washing, the clothes undergo another procedure called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironing ironing]. This procedure de-wrinkles the clothes and again kills off leftover bacteria in the clothes due to the process of rapid heating (to 100°Celsius) and cooling. The de-wrinkling is often unnecessary in the developing world for casual dressing; if the wrinkling is not excessive (in first world countries, appearance is more strictly guarded). In such cases, this step could be thus be skipped, if the wrinkling is kept to a minimum by [http://www.ehow.com/how_2203616_clothes-wrinklefree-ironing.html tricks as adding vinegar] to the washing machine and optimizing air flow. This discarding of the ironing however also has a antibacterial working, meaning that the laundry separation &amp; washing method 1 can not be used. Instead, higher temperatures (nearing 100° Celsius; e.g. 90° Celsius) should be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Electric_motor_cycle_2.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a simple DC motor, showing the repulsion between the poles.]]
Just as a moving magnetic field induces current in conductors, a changing current in a magnetic field induces motion. When this motion is used to ensure that the current keeps changing relative to the magnetic field, the motion will continue, and so we have an electric motor. There are several types of electric motor.

==Simple DC Motor==
When a coil is placed inside a stationary magnetic field, and a direct current is run through the coil, the coil tries to align itself with the field since it becomes an electromagnet. This would be useless as a motor, since it would always move to the same position when you turned it on, and then stop. If, however, we use a split-ring commutator which changes the direction of the current every half-rotation, then the coil would try to align itself in the opposite direction every half-rotation. This means that, once the rotor starts to move, it continues to move. This is a DC electric motor. The permanent magnets can be replaced with electromagnets as well. The main advantage of this type of motor is that the commutator works, regardless of the frequency of rotation.

[[Image:3phase-rmf-noadd-60f-airopt.gif|thumb|right|300px|Animation of a three-phase motor with an electromagnet as the rotor.]]

==Three-phase Motor==
The three-phase power produced by a three-phase generator may be used to power a motor. Each phase of power is connected to one of three coils. This creates a magnetic field which rotates once for each cycle of the power. If a permanent magnet is placed in the middle, at any given time, its north pole will be attracted to a south pole in one of the coils, and will be repelled by a north pole in one of the coils. The converse would be true for its south pole. This means that the rotating magnetic field drags the magnet around with it, causing the magnet to rotate with the same frequency as the magnetic field. The disadvantage of this type of motor is that it goes at one frequency only - the frequency of the current.

The permanent magnet can be replaced with a coil with direct current in it. This creates a magnetic field, the advantage being that there is no need for a permanent magnet which is expensive and heavy. The main disadvantages are that electricity must be used to power the electromagnet, and that a slip-ring commutator must be used to prevent the coil getting tangled up and stopping the motor from running.

[[Image:Induction-motor-3a.gif|thumb|right|300px|Animation of a squirrel-cage AC motor]]
===Squirrel Cage Motor===
A squirrel cage motor works on a similar principle, except that the rotor is no longer a permanent magnet. Instead, a series of metal rods run through the rotor, connected to each other at either ends. The rods run perpendicular to the rotating magnetic field. Once the rotor starts to rotate, an electric current is created in the rods - eddy currents. This creates a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the rotating magnetic at all times. As the rotating magnetic field created by the stator rotates, it pulls the induced magnetic field around after it, causing the rotor to continue to rotate.

A squirrel cage motor relies on the fact that the two magnetic fields are rotating at different rates. If they were not, then there would be no change in flux in the rotor, and so no eddy currents would be induced.

==Questions==

1. How could you adapt the simple DC motor to use AC?

2. Why does a three-phase motor have a constant angular velocity?

3. What is the difference between a split-ring and a slip-ring commutator?

4. How could the angular velocity of a three-phase motor be increased?

5. A squirrel-cage motor relies on eddy currents running along the rotor to function. However, if eddy currents run across the rotor, then the force on the rotor is reduced. How may these eddy currents be reduced without reducing the desired eddy currents?

This page will focus on affordable large sensor digital film cameras (GH1, Scarlet, 5DmkII etc).  If you want shallow depth of field without using a DoF adapter (or 35mm film) then these cameras might be what you need.  This page is ''not meant'' to give complete specs for each camera.  Instead, this page should give a broad overview.

What counts as &quot;large sensor&quot;?  For the sake of argument, let's define &quot;large sensor&quot; as 2/3&quot; or larger.

=Rumours=

==Nikon D400 / D750==

* Rumoured specs: http://nikonrumors.com/2009/04/17/the-next-set-of-rumors-nikon-d400-nikond750.aspx

==Canon pro video camera with APS-C sized sensor==

* It's a pretty sketchy rumour
* Release: mid 2010???  Some rumours that the camera will announced late-2009.
* 12.1 megapixel [[w:en:APS-C|APS-C]] (between 20.7×13.8 mm and 28.7×19.1 mm) CMOS sensor similar to the one in the Rebel XSi
* look similar to the XL H1
* support for EF and EF-S lenses, sport fully manual controls as well as autofocus
* shoot 720p/30/60 and 1080p/24/30/60 to 56Mbit/s MPEG-4.
* price: $8,000
* Dual ASIC Components for real time 12MP Scaling to 1080p 60-30-24 4:2:2 color space with uncompressed 4:4:4 over optional attachment module.
* Spec shows CMOS sensor capable of windowed mode for use with large 20x video zooms. 1/3 windowed mode will yield 1080p without binning.
* Overcrank will be limited to 60p, nothing higher [sic] with a 48p option.
* No global shutter for the CMOS. It will offer better performance than any competing product.
* Timelapse feature recorded 4:4:4 12.1MP on JPEG sequences to SD card. Programmable from one frame a minute to one hour.
* Programmable settings can be transferred on SD card for several cameras. 
* Cinema, WB and K options can be set by SD also.
* Quicktime Wrapper format like that in the 5D Mark II.
* Sensitivity down to 1.5 lux with excellent noise performance. Still in testing!
* Dual phantom power XLR 48khz 24bit inputs. 4 XLR with optional module.
* Work is being done simultaneously on a portable 2/3 fixed lens version. Sensor will be smaller to accommodate a 14x zoom.

* Important discussion threads

==Panasonic pro video camera with large sensor==

* There have been a few rumours about a &quot;pro&quot; Panasonic video camera with a large camera.  This would make sense in the light of some of the features on the GH1 which appear to have been deliberately &quot;disabled&quot; (e.g. the lack of audio level controls, no video output while recording etc).

==Sony Alpha A1000==

http://www.cinema5d.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=4797

Rumoured to be released sometime before 2011, possibly as early as NAB 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. How could you adapt the simple DC motor to use AC?'''

Connect the coil in the stator in series with the coil in the rotor via a slip-ring commutator. This must be in the correct direction to ensure that the fields created by the two parts of the coil are constantly repelling each other, rather than constantly attracting each other.

'''2. Why does a three-phase motor have a constant angular velocity?'''

The vectorial sum of the three currents is constant, so the vectorial sum of the forces on the rotor due to each of the three currents is constant.

'''3. What is the difference between a split-ring and a slip-ring commutator?'''

A split-ring commutator makes the current change direction every half-rotation, whereas a slip-ring commutator merely maintains a connection between the moving rotor and the stationary stator.

'''4. How could the angular velocity of a three-phase motor be increased?'''

Increase the frequency of the three-phase power.

'''5. A squirrel-cage motor relies on eddy currents running along the rotor to function. However, if eddy currents run across the rotor, then the force on the rotor is reduced. How may these eddy currents be reduced without reducing the desired eddy currents?'''

Laminate the plates which connect the rods to each other so that currents are restricted from running in the wrong direction.

== Chapter One Introduction: The Educator as a Professional ==
As a general rule, teachers teach more by what they are than by what they say.  Chapter one introduces the educator as a professional and defines many important concepts of the teaching career.  The question of why teachers choose to teach is answered, as well as what it takes to be a teacher. Requirements for teaching are described, such as passion and creativity, as well as the rewards and challenges of this fulfilling career.
 
Is teaching really a profession, and what makes a good teacher? Are the best teachers the most qualified? Many wonder what the future holds for teachers, or why teachers leave the profession.  These are difficult questions that this chapter attempts to answer. Checklists and guides to becoming a good teacher, as well as the standards of teaching and what constitutes a good teacher are reviewed. Nontraditional education careers, such as coordinators who deliver information to students through unique methods, are introduced, as well as their advantages, disadvantages, and effectiveness. 

After reading all content articles, the reader will most likely gain a greater appreciation of teachers and understand the specific responsibilities and characteristics their jobs entail.

'''&lt;u&gt;Educational Philosophy&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br&gt;


There are several types of education philosophies. Your own personal teaching philosophy will influence the way you teach and interact with your class. The main philosophies used for teaching are: perennialism, essentialism, progressivism, existentialism and social reconstructionism. As an educator you should know your philosophy of education, which can be a combination of philosophical types. Having an understanding of the types of education philosophies will help you to understand not only why you teach the way you do, but also why the teacher own the hall teaches the way he/she does. The No Child Left Behind Act has become a major influence on how classes are taught and what is taught, it can even influence education philosophies. 
 
There have been many philosophical teachers dating as for both as the ancient Greeks. Today their teaching styles are still being used. An example is the Socratic Method, which is a dialectic method of teaching. There are many great philosophical teachers to learn from. Also to be included in philosophy type’s, are teacher-centered philosophies and student-centered philosophies. There are positives and negatives for both teacher-centered and student-centered philosophies. Constructivism is one more theory on how to teach, as well as rote memorization. There are other comparable ideas that will influence your teaching philosophy, this is why it is important for you to know your philosophy of education.

'''In The News:Philosophy of Education'''

By Derrick Long



== Introduction ==


A philosophy of education refers to a methodology behind teaching practices. These range from classical “preconceived methods” to newer more experimental thoughts about teaching. Teaching is one of the oldest and most powerful professions known to man.  Throughout time we have sought to improve methods of teaching in order to improve the quality of our population. One of the guiding forces in education are teaching philosophies. As ways of thinking about education change and evolve so does the practice and profession of teaching.


== Learning Target ==

Readers of this section should gain a sense of the current state of educational philosophy and its importance to the teaching profession.

== US:The Business of Higher Education ==


This article is particularly poignant considering the nature of this “text-book”, it concerns the new business models being brought to Universities throughout the country. With the economic crash and the uncertainty and underfunding that it brings with it colleges and universities have begun adapting a more capitalist approach. One such example is Colorado State University, who elected Joe Blake as its system counselor, not on academic merit but rather on his business prowess. (2009, McGettigan)

“Search committee members were chosen for their knowledge and understanding of complex, billion dollar businesses.” Said, Michelle McKinney, a public relations representative for the board of Colorado State.(2009,Mcgettigan)  

As colleges grow more geared towards profit margins and capital gains the problem is further compounded by reduced public funding and rising education costs. These fiscal burdens are now being passed onto individual students, leaving many students in “home mortgage sized debt”.(2009,Mcgettigan)  

In today’s modern world a college degree is in  increasing demand but the ability to obtain one grows more and more difficult.  Could this emphasis on finance be a novel approach to these growing problems or will turning education into a for-profit venture only exasperate the situation?

== Spitting in the Eye of Mainstream Education ==


This article concerns a California charter school called, American Indian. (Charter schools are schools which are publicly funded, but are allowed to work outside the constraints of the public school system)  American Indian is a school that represents the “Essentialist” philosophy of education in the extreme. The curriculum is strict, the levels of liberal bashing almost caricature, and the discipline is as severe as it can get without having nuns involved. Their educational philosophy “does not preach or subscribe to the demagoguery of tolerance.”(Lansberg, 2009) 

The results ,however, are amazing and the “American Indian” schools have some of the best test scores in California. In American Indian there are no non-essential courses, the arts in general are scoffed at, and testing, not practical application is the emphasis.  There are no T.V’s or computers. All learning is done strictly by the book. To go with this rather utilitarian approach to learning the school has equally strict punishments for misconduct. Humiliation is often used as an enforcement tool. On one occasion  a student caught stealing had his head shaved in front of the entire school, in another a young lady was forced to clean the boy's restroom. (Lansberg,2009)

The article goes on to explain the possibility of cherry-picking being used to artificially inflate the school’s test scores. (Cherry-picking in this situation would be seeking out successful students for the school and denying “trouble” cases)
However, no definitive proof is offered either way in the article and in lieu of actual proof of “cherry-picking” American Indian’s draconian education philosophy seems to be paying off. As of the date of the article's publication American Indian remains one of the few highly effective schools within inner city neighborhoods by utilizing this unique teaching methodology. (Lansberg,2009)

== Students Benefit From Writing Project  ==

This article is about the education of educators. It describes a writing program offered at the graduate level during the summer section at MSU University.(Johnson, 2008) The writing program is specifically tailored to help teachers formulate and refine their philosophies of education. Throughout the semester participating teachers engage in a variety of “cutting edge“learning techniques including acting out parts of plays, writing creatively, and staging murder mysteries. 

&quot;The Northern Plains Writing Project gathers teachers from across the state,&quot; said Robert Kibler, associate professor of English and director of the writing project, in a press release. &quot;Together, we engage in dialogue concerning what we do in the classroom, about our educational philosophies, and about the challenges we face as professionals in an ever-changing profession. We engage in cutting edge research so that we can improve upon what we already do well in the classroom, and so that we can better share what we do well with others.” (Johnson, 2008)
 
The program is free, relatively intense and its main goal is to help teachers by exploring why they teach, hopefully leading to better teachers. The program is tailored to help teachers find new meaning within their careers and bring that new knowledge and invigoration back to the classroom. By exploring new areas of creativity, hands on learning, and teaching as a community the graduate level program helps its participants update their views on traditional education.

== Conclusion ==



Right now, this moment, education is changing, evolving. Someone out there in the nether is contemplating a new way to teach. In our state of Virginia many are still reconciling their teaching methods with the importance of the S.O.L’s, or standards of learning, the S.O.L’s are standardized tests used as a yard stick to measure whether or not students are prepared to move on to the next grade level.  These tests have changed the curriculum for everyone and helped define what can be seen as success within the classroom. They represent a teaching ideology that places importance upon testing well. The introduction of these tests and their effect on teaching philosophies throughout Virginia illustrate the vast and important changes that occur within the teaching profession. 

Many new ideas are being explored to make education more effective. In large states with an urban population charter schools are being created in order to utilize more radical teaching methods in the hopes of raising the test scores of underprivileged, minority students. Across the country, colleges and universities are looking for ways to make education profitable by hiring new staff, consulting marketing teams, and merchandising themselves in the same way successful corporations do.  Our definition of education and our ideologies surrounding it are fluid, ever changing things.

== &lt;big&gt;'''Key Questions and Answers'''&lt;/big&gt; ==


== '''1.	Why is an analogy a useful tool for teachers?''' ==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6CC417;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
  ''“An analogy is one of a teacher's most useful tools. It helps the instructor relate a difficult concept to something the students will already have the infrastructure for, thus enabling the students to cement the ideas in their mind.” ([[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Foundations_and_Assessment_of_Education/Edition_1/Foundations_Table_of_Contents/Chapter_2/Content_Articles/2.1.1]])'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
An analogy is an extended metaphor, which allows the teacher to use an idea, word, phrase, or object in place of another to suggest a likeness between them. Hoffman estimates that the average English-speaker uses over 3,000 metaphors per week and suggests we can occasionally use four metaphors per minute in everyday conversation! 

An analogy is important in the classroom because it allows the teacher to take an unfamiliar idea and relate it to a familiar idea. It can increase student attention, reduce anxiety, improve critical thinking, enhance concept learning, and create a positive classroom environment (Garner, Randy, 2005).

[http://radicalpedagogy.icaap.org/content/issue6_2/garner.html]

== '''2.	What is a simple definition of educational philosophies?''' ==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ECD872;border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;For more information and easy to understand definitions of these five main philosophies, check out this website: [http://www.school-for-champions.com/education/philosophies.htm &quot;http://www.school-for-champions.com/education/philosophies.htm&quot;]. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
	        When looking for a “simple” definition of educational philosophies, I realized there isn’t one! Educational philosophies are a diverse subject, with many opinions. There is not one simple, correct answer to this question. Teachers seem to work better when using a variety of educational philosophies. This is because if a teacher stays locked into just one philosophy, students are not able to grow and learn from different ideas; they are stuck with one idea and way of learning, when they might have learned better from a different method. The variety of educational philosophies are pulled from the five main philosophies of: Perennialism, Idealism, Realism, Experimentalism and Existentialism (Kurtus, Ron, 2001).

== '''3.	What are some ways to assess students’ progress?''' ==
There are several different ways of assessing students’ progress. We learned about four main ways of assessing students during our in-class lecture. The four main assessment methods are selected response, extended written response, performance assessment and personal communication. Selected response would be using multiple choice, true/false, matching and fill-in-the-blank on a test. Extended written response would be having the students show all their work in an essay or math problem. Performance assessment is the ability to perform tasks/skills. Some examples are P.E., music, foreign language, speech, measuring or creating products, art, research paper, lab report, timeline, or diorama. Personal communication is writing in journals, questioning, discussions, interviewing, observations, or oral exams (taken from class notes). 


Another way to assess students’ progress is to use the student progress monitoring system. There is an official site for teachers and parents from The National Center on Student Progress Monitoring. &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
For more information about this project go to The National Center on Student Progress Monitoring website&quot; [http://www.studentprogress.org/&quot;]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;There definition of progress monitoring is, “a scientifically based practice that is used to assess students’ academic performance and evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Progress monitoring can be implemented with individual students or an entire class”(Student Progress, 2007).

== '''4.	What is the purpose of education anyway?''' ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFB5D;border: solid 5px #56A5EC; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
[[File:schoolroomkids.jpeg|center|]]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#006CB9&quot; face=&quot;HELVETICA&quot;&gt;

Webster defines education as “the process of educating or teaching”. It defines to educate as “to develop the knowledge, skill, or character of...” These definitions are not very helpful in understanding why education is important. “In ancient Greece, Socrates argued that education was about drawing out what was already within the student.” Some would say, “The purpose of education is to appropriately prepare our children for their future.” The government says education is covering all the standards, improving performance on government tests, meeting Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and producing a competitive workforce (Foote, Carolyn, 2009). [http://davidwarlick.com/2cents/?p=1668]

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #C5908E;

Where to find information about leaders in educational philosophy: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates]&quot;Socrates&quot;] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato]&quot;Plato&quot;] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophists] &quot;or&quot; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/sophists.htm ] &quot;Sophists&quot;]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

But what really is the purpose of education? If you ask a student their response will be different than their parents or teachers response. This is because everyone has a different opinion on education and why we learn. There are different ideas about the purpose of education. “Ask yourself, what is the purpose of education? No matter who you ask, everyone's answer will be different. If you ask a student, there answer will be unlike their parents whose answer will be different from a teacher's viewpoint. Education is the whole learning process of not only acquiring knowledge but, to a deeper level, for a person to discover more about himself as well as the world which he is living in (Lim, 2005). Students are taught the basics in Math, Science, Reading, and English in order to survive in today's society. Therefore, how students use the education given is the true purpose of education. Some teachers believe that the transmission of knowledge is the primary purpose of education although the transfer of knowledge from school to the real world is something that happens naturally as a consequence of possessing that knowledge (Yero, 2002). Students take what they learn from school and apply this knowledge to their everyday lives. The learning process never ends and students will continue to use the knowledge from school to become better citizens in the world today”(Taylor-Davis, Tasha, wikibook article 2.3.2, 2008).

== '''5.	Why do teachers need a philosophy of teaching?''' ==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6CC417;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt; ''This website explains how to write a teacher philosophy: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/philosophy.html ([[http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/philosophy.html])'' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A philosophy of teaching is written to meet a requirement of teaching portfolios. But, beyond that and more importantly, a teaching philosophy can be used to stimulate reflection on teaching. It can also be used to provide a reflection for teaching, helping them grow and develop professionally (Chism, Nancy, 1996). [http://www.cofc.edu/~cetl/Essays/DevelopingaPhilosophyofTeaching.html] “It is important to have a theory when it comes to education because it will help to develop lesson plans and provide a basis for one's rubric; in turn the students will know how they are going to be assessed” (Lee, Ben, wikibook article 2.2.1, 2008).

== '''6.	How can a teacher use constructivism in the classroom?''' ==
Constructivist teaching is going above and beyond the traditional classroom objectives. The goal is for students to be able to play an active role in the learning process in the classroom. 

'''Some suggested characteristics of a constructivist teacher:'''

#Become one of many resources that the student may learn from, not the primary source of information.
#Engage students in experiences that challenge previous conceptions of their existing knowledge.
#Allow student respones to drive lessons and seek elaboration of students' initial responses.  Allow student some thinking time after posing questions.
#Encourage the spirit of questioning by asking thoughtful, open-ended questions.  Encourage thoughtful discussion among students.
#Use cognitive terminology such as &quot;classify,&quot; &quot;analyze&quot;, and &quot;create&quot; when framing tasks.
#Encourage and accept student autonomy and initiative.  Be willing to let go of classroom control.
#Use raw data and primary sources, along with manipulative, interactive physical materials.
#Don't separate knowing from the process of finding out.
#Insist on clear expression from students.  When students can communicate their understanding, then they have truly learned (Hanley, Susan, 1994).

Though it may not be something that crosses the mind of the everyday person very often, education as an institution has been around for thousands of years. Starting in the Ancient world, in Rome and Greece, philosophers like Plato and Socrates would hold lectures to young male students. Over time, females were allowed to join in on the learning. Beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries, education as we know it today began to develop. Each century following brought with it more and more advances in education.
This chapter has articles that go into detail about the education milestones of the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and, 21st centuries. It also contains a section about the history of teacher education. All of these cover things that all new and experienced teachers should be familiar with.

The articles that follow are:
: •What are the educational milestones of the 17th and 18th Centuries?
: •What are the educational milestones of the 19th Century?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION'''

by Ryan Collins


&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;

Education as we know it today has not always been that way. As with almost everything in today's society it is ever changing and updating itself. Different methods have been used to help improve the way education is looked at by professionals in the field of education. Education is a very important part of the up bringing of people as a whole. Without an education it is hard, for some, to be successful. Wikipedia describes The History of Education as &quot;the history of teaching and of learning, and the history of what might be described as the curricula: what it is that is taught or learned.&quot;


&lt;u&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/u&gt;

The reader will be able to describe the different interpretations of the history of education. The student will also be able to identify the similarities and differences between the classroom of today and the classroom of the past.

&lt;u&gt;The Differences&lt;/u&gt;

As the world evolves and changes so does the way that education is looked at. There are several things that haven't changed much and things that have significantly changed. For instance, every day a different philosophy or teaching practice is applied in a classroom. This is one of the most diverse parts about teaching because it is ever changing. Over the years as the country has matured so has the way education is looked at. Why is the history of  education important to study? Edward J. Power's article ''Persistent Myths in the History of Education'' says that the reason to study it is &quot;that the history of education will sharpen students' professional study with precisely the same objective as, say, techniques of teaching or classroom management&quot;(Powers, pg.142). Basically what Powers is saying that learning about the past is just as important, if not more important, than just learning about the hands on aspect of the profession. It is a big argument among professionals in the departments of education whether or not it is important to teach the history of education. Powers also said &quot;In recent years the history of education has been treated as educational philosophy's untitled and undistinguished cousin.&quot; (Powers, pg. 142) 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
[[File:classroom.jpeg|700px]] 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The teaching styles of today are very similar to those of fifty years ago. Even though they are similar they have several differences. Whether it be from the size of the classes or the way that people with special needs are taught. For instance, there was a point in time when everyone that was attending school was taught in one big room at the same time no matter the age. Today that method more than likely would not work because the subject matter in today's society is so different. The first graders wouldn't understand the concepts discussed in the high school math class. While on the other hand the high school students would become bored with the subject matter of the first grade class. The evolution of the history of education has drastically improved the way that school is thought about by professionals.

Charles Webster says in his article &quot;Changing Perspectives in the History of Education&quot; that the main reason for the study of the history of education is &quot;to familiarize intending teachers with notable steps in the development of the modern system of public education&quot; (Webster). What Webster is saying that it is important because with out the steps that were taken in the education field in the past we would not be at the level of education offered in today's society. It is similar to if Henry Ford had not figured out a better way to mass produce cars, how far would the auto industry have progressed today?

The Encyclopædia Britannica describes the history of education as &quot;tracing the evolution of the formal teaching of knowledge and skills, from prehistoric and ancient times to the present, and considering the various philosophies that have inspired the resulting systems&quot; (Britannica). What they are saying here is that education has been evolving everyday since prehistoric times. It is also saying that many different philosophies have led to the education curriculum being the way it is today.

&lt;u&gt;Why?&lt;/u&gt;

Why are there so many different interpretations of these four words.....&quot;the history of education&quot;? Why are their so many ways to say basically the same thing? This is because every one in the teaching profession has their own opinion on what the important aspects are included in &quot;the history of education&quot;. If you compare the three authors philosophies above, you will be able to identify their different interpretations. They are all correct in their own way, depending on how you look at them. Edward Powers said that the way education in the past was looked at, helps people studying to become teachers today with ideas on how their predecessors did things. The second example is also saying that what was done in the past will help benefit the present and future and finally, it is agreed upon that the many different philosophies have helped bring the present day education system to the high level that it is today.


&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;

In conclusion the way that teaching has evolved over the years will greatly benefit the present and future teachers of the world.  As we continue to study the present &quot;history of education&quot; we will continue to improve our educational methods and practices in an effort to refine the educational system that we pass on to our children and grandchildren. Dr. Carl Sagan once said &quot;You have to know the past to understand the present.&quot; That is exactly what the History of Education is all about.

'''BY JENNIFER NEMO'''



&lt;big&gt;LEARNING TARGETS &lt;/big&gt; 

- To learn about the roots of the U.S. education system.

- Understand the major changes that led to the system we use today.


'''How?'''
  
 
I will accomplish this by interviewing Mrs. Ann Poorman who is a well respected teacher at Southern Cayuga High School for the past twenty years.  Mrs. Poorman is an English teacher who holds an interest in history and the education system.  She is a well studied and knowledgeable person to ask about the history of the U.S. Education system.


'''THE INTERVIEW'''


'''When did the U.S. really begin to form a public education system?'''	

regards to the widespread education of our children in the 20th century we can thank the industrial revolution.  Before the spread of urban life and mass industry very few children had the opportunity to go to school for any length of time.  Children were required to work the fields on the family farm or help with the family business.  In the beginning of the 20th century more people were moving to cities and the need for education became greater than ever.   The children who were educated usually came from wealthy families.  

'''What was the curriculum like?	'''

The curriculum in the beginning of the 20th century was consisted of basic knowledge skills that could be used to work or run an industrial company such as math, reading, writing, and science.


'''So, much like our curriculum today?'''

Yes, however students today have the opportunity of electives.  Foreign language, music, art, technical education, and clubs were not available to the average public school child.  In fact most students never made it to the high school level. 
	



'''What other major changes to the education system have occurred in the 20th century?'''

The invention of the car led to more children having access to school.
Desegregation affected the public school system ensuring that all children receive the same education.
Post WWII the increase in children led to the government spending more on education than ever before.
-New schools were built. Older schools built additions

== Diversity: Revolving Change in America's Classrooms ==

'''Learning Target'''
Reader should be able to review the work of different media outlets, when it comes to diversity in the classroom. Reader will be faced with world wide opinions and measures being taken in classrooms all over America that deal with diversity.


== Diversity in the Classroom ==


As the nation we live in changes, so does the classrooms in which learning is taught. Diversity is often encountered in the classroom whether it is by ethnicity, race, or gender of the students. Many of these diverse situations often encounters problems with stereotype and makes it that much more difficult for teachers to conduct an inclusive classroom. Reports by major newspapers such as the New York Times and media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have carried out developing stories occurring not only in Virginia but in classrooms throughout the United States and even the world which deals with diversifying classrooms.

The New York Times reported on April 22, 2009 in an article titled &quot;Diversity in the Classroom&quot; that due to heavy immigration of people, student demographics have changed in 17,000 counties in the United States ( New York Times, 2009).   This article also states that Hispanic and Asian student enrollment in schools has increased by 5,000,000 since the 1990's. This demographic of student enrollment increase automatically makes a diverse classroom, ethnic wise and race wise. Author Judith Shulman wrote a book to help teachers carry out lessons that help every student: no matter race,country of origin and/or language (Shulman, 2007).

Some students have more difficulties than others if they do not understand the language. Schools throughout America have taken this immigration issue seriously by incorporating a curriculum that has mandatory English classes for non-English speakers. Foreign language education though ignored by many is becoming more of a requirement as the population of the United States increases annually. Diversified classrooms could be very beneficial for students in the long-run. Why? well as the United States becomes more diverse culturally, students are faced with the fact that employment opportunities are going to be offered to that bilingual student.  

In CNN, America's scapegoat for news, there was a report from a student named Marcia Hutchinson who faced stereotypes and discrimination in a British classroom, being from Jamaican decent ( Hutchinson, 2009). This type of bullying could lead to the student suffering severe psychological damage and therefore teacher training should not be taken lightly. Teachers in every classroom around the world are going through what is called &quot;training&quot; in order to learn how to deal with a diverse set of students, enhancing the change to have an inclusive classroom. This not only applies to classrooms in Europe this also applies to America's classrooms. 

Author and early childhood education expert Barbara Biles write an article about how cultural diversity first starts with each individual's cultural and self-awareness (Biles, 1994). She promotes the use of skin-colored crayons in her teaching techniques for preschool students so that they are more self-aware but most importantly, more aware of those around them. This is a process in which the child learns that people are not all the same. Some will be much more different, other will be more alike, nonetheless they need to know that just because someone is different, prejudice should come into role.  When cultural and racial awareness is established in the classroom, it will help teachers bring up some classwork and/or activities to help children &quot;accept themselves and accept others&quot; (Biles, 1994). This awareness will ultimately unify the classroom, but create a person who is less likely to bully others in the future. 

Ultimately, teachers should always be aware that never will they conduct a classroom where each child is exactly the same as the other.  Since classrooms across the United States, including Virginia, are becoming more diverse as the days pass, teachers take into consideration learning new teaching techniques in order to accommodate each child's learning needs and ways. No child learns the same. Some learn my repetition, other by visualizations, others by auditory lessons.Teachers should assess each child's need in order for a fair grading system. These techniques should be incorporated in an inclusive classroom. 

Diversity is often to blame and becomes the scapegoat to children teasing others. Bullying can cause deep psychological trauma and/or issues upon an individual. In this case, a student. Bullying and other hurtful stereotypical accusations made towards others are often the center of media (News) and prime time television. It has been heard of in popular prime time shows like Oprah, or late night documentaries like Dateline or CNN. It is up to the teachers, the head of the classroom, to incorporate a friendly environment for all. Make sure that students get along not only between classroom walls but outside in the playground as well. America could be stronger starting by the classroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello!!! My name is Susan and I currently reside in Fredericksburg, VA.  I just graduated with a BS from Radford University in Athletic Training.  I have also graduated with a certificate in K-12 Health and Physical Education.  I plan to further my education in Special Education and/or a Reading Specialist.  My entire family is in education.  My sister has a degree in English and history and a master's in special education.  My mother has also been in the education system for over thirty years.  I have grown up around it my whole life and I see what a difference it can make, especially in the early years of education.  

I absolutely love the summer time and vacationing.  Last summer I was able to go white water rafting in West Virginia.  It was an amazing experience.  My sister, especially, is always trying to find new and interesting places to see. I also love animals.  I have two cats, Kiwi and Belle.  My sister also has two dogs. Shorty is a lab and corgi mix and Whillie is a mix breed.  When I have free time I enjoy reading books.  I also just love spending time with the family and relaxing whenever I get the chance

Education and philosophy conversations surround us all and there are many theories and ideas as to what really works in any classroom.  I believe through discussions with family, educators, and peers and through my own personal experiences as a student I have developed a strong philosophy that I believe in.   

I believe an effective teacher establishes on the first day of school an atmosphere that declares all children will be successful.  An effective teacher makes it difficult for a student to fail.  In this classroom there is much student-teacher interaction.  Everyone in the classroom is contributing in some way.  The busy classroom environment should include at varying times; the communication of new ideas,  students and teacher posing higher level thinking questions, work in a collaborate setting, and an atmosphere that allows students to feel safe in order to achieve academic success.   The teacher and students present an attitude of contentment, and genuinely enjoy their classroom setting.

The instructional strategies that a teacher uses in the classroom should be varied.  No one method is effective for all students.  All students learn differently, and at a different rate.  A teacher who recognizes these differences will allow for varied approaches to the same topic.  This will hopefully allow each student the much needed success to move on to the next level of learning.   A teacher who cannot differentiation the instruction in the classroom is doing his/her students a disservice and will probably not generate much student success.</text>

It is inevitable that the children in a classroom will be different from each other in many ways. They may all read at the same level, they may all like the same activities and there is even a chance that they are all the same gender. Each of these scenarios is highly unlikely but still possible. One thing is for sure, each child will demonstrate unique needs and characteristics. All teachers are forced to deal with diversity in the classroom to some degree. Whether it is managing the different teaching styles needed by boys vs. girls, or dealing with the high demands of gifted students or those with ADHD, teachers in classrooms all over the country are faced with this challenging task. Chapter 4 introduced some of the many diverse needs of all types of students. In reading the articles in this chapter, you have found that diversity in the classroom does not have to be simply an unwanted challenge. Discovering the various needs and characteristics of our diverse student population allows the teacher as well as the rest of the class to grow and learn from one another.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''By:Lyndsey Williams&lt;/center&gt;




&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#006699&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''LEARNING TARGETS&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''3. Students will be able to identify positive and negative aspects of peer pressure.&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''INTRODUCTION

We live in a society that depends on communication and information.  Our society is surrounded by technology.  The news airs consistently throughout the day, the media is constantly keeping us up to date on the latest news and celebrity gossip,  text messaging has become a norm in society, and one can even find love on the internet.  Our schools have begun to integrate newer technologies, such as computers in the classrooms and teletechnet courses.  Today in our daily lives we rely heavily on the media to deliver fast news and information.  The media focuses on all the important issues that are surrounding us.  The media also focuses on many of the important issues that directly effect our schools and our children.  Poverty, bullying media violence, and peer pressure all effect the students and the schools around us on a daily basis.


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''POVERTY AND THE MEDIA

Poverty is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.  In today's schools poverished children are often lacking the basic necessities to allow them to learn in an effective way.  According to the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (2007), poverty affects the overall well-being of children, from health to behavior, to social environment and education.  Poverished children are at times lacking in their educational abilities.  Poverty affects children and families on a daily basis.  It also effects that school system that are educating these children.  The following article is based out of Portsmouth, Virginia and identifies a school in a povershed area that could possibly be closing because of low test scores.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''BULLYING AND MEDIA VIOLENCE

&quot;Exposure to media violence and bullying stand out as two distinct factors that contribute to aggressive and violent youth behavior&quot; (Werle, 2006).  &quot;Bullying is a form of behavior characterized by repeated aggressive acts against a weaker individual.  Bullying may be verbal, physical, or social, and can include sexual harrassment, racial and ethnic harrassment and intimidation&quot; (Werle, 2006).  Each year thousands of children are victims of bullying.  Nansel ''et al.'' (2001) reported on the results of a nationally representative survey of 15,686 United States youth in grades 6-10 and found that 29.9% of the sample reported moderate to frequent involvement in bullying.  The following news article shows proof that anyone can be a victim of bullying, and can overcome the effects of being bullied.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#663366&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''ANYONE CAN BE A VICTIM OF BULLYING&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=#000 000&gt;Grossman and DeGaetano(1999) define media violence as portrayals of violence in the media that glamorize or sensationalize violent acts toward human beings or animals and show them as acceptable behavior.  Many of the stories on the news and in the newspapers are constantly exposing the media violence that surrounds us on a daily basis.  Parents need to be aware of the violence within the media that is being exposed to their children and need to know how to handle the effects of that violence.  The following is a link to a complete guide for parents on media violence and children.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;'''PEER PRESSURE AND THE MEDIA

According to wikipedia.org, peer pressure is defined as a term describing the pressure exerted by a peer group in encouraging a person to change their attitude, behavior and/or morals, to conform to, for example, the groups' actions, fashion sense, taste in music or television and outlook on life.  Teens and youths today are pressured into a variety of situations which can be negative or positive.  They can be pressured into negative situations such as trying drugs an/or alcohol, having sex, stealing, cheating, and lying among many other negative situations.  Teens and youth can be pressured into positive situations also such as attending church, getting good grades, finishing school, going to college, doing chores for allowance money or even getting a job to buy the things they may want or need.  As positive or negative as peer pressure can be, teens are faced with tough decisions every day. Parents and teachers can only hope they guide their children and students to make the right decisions.

== '''Learning targets ''' ==
The reader should be able to comprehend and answer a few of the frequently asked questions concerning sociological, economic, and culture influences in schools.

== &lt;big&gt;'''How does poverty affect a child's learning ability?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
Studies propose the effects of poverty on children's cognitive development occur early, with poorer children scoring between 6 and 13 points lower on various standardized tests for IQ, verbal ability, and achievement. The study also found that length of poverty was an important factor. Those who lived in persistently poor families had scores lower than children who were never poor. Other studies using different longitudinal data sets found that poverty status has a small negative impact on high school graduation and years of schooling obtained (Brooks-Gunn, J., &amp; Duncan, G. J. 1997).

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;'''What is learned helplessness?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
The phrase &quot;learned helplessness&quot; which refers to learning or perception of independence between one's behavior, and presentation and/or withdrawal of aversive events; was first studied by Seligman and Maier in 1967(Dweck, C. 1975). Learned helplessness might further explain some of the academic and behavioral deficits that characterize students with emotional or behavioral disorders. Individuals with &quot;learned helplessness&quot;  learn that responding and reinforcement are independent, they are slower to initiate responses or do not respond at all.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCCFFF;
border: solid 1px #999FFF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;  &quot;An instructional program for children who have difficulty dealing with failure would do well not to skirt the issue by trying to ensure success or by glossing over failure.
Instead it should include procedures for dealing with this problem directly. This is not to suggest that failure should be included in great amounts or that failure per se is desirable, but rather, that errors should be capitalized upon as vehicles for teaching the child how to handle failure.&quot; (Dweck, C. 1975) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== '''&lt;big&gt;How can violence in schools be prevented?&lt;/big&gt;''' ==
According to the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice a three-level approach to prevention is the most efficient way to reduce the risk of violence. (Dwyer, &amp; Osher, 2000, p. 2). 

	'''Build a school wide foundation''':

This should include, teaching appropriate behaviors and problem solving skills, as well as creating a caring school environment.

	'''Intervene early''':

Provide services and support that address risk factors, especially for those students who are at risk of behavior problems.

	'''Provide Intensive interventions''':

These are necessary for those students whose needs cannot be fully addressed by early intervention. Intensive interventions should always be individualized to a student's needs and strengths.

border: solid 1px #999FFF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;No plan can make a school impervious to violence. However, having a response and prevention plan reduces those chances and helps schools respond successfully to violent incidents that may occur.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;'''What is student mobility?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
Student mobility is students moving from one school to another for reasons other than grade promotion. Some reasons for student mobility include: children of migrant workers, homeless children, children from low-income families, and children in military families. The possible impacts of mobility on studentseducation are significant in that they include: lower achievement levels due to discontinuity of curriculum between schools, behavioral problems, difficulty developing peer relationships, and these children are at a greater risk of dropping out (Education Week  2004).

== &lt;big&gt;'''What are some warning signs of teenage alcohol and drug abuse? '''&lt;/big&gt; ==
Physical warning signs can include fatigue, red and glazed eyes, also a lasting cough. Emotional signs include; a personality change, low self-esteem, depression, and a general lack of interest. At school a student might show decreased interest, a drop in grades, truancy, and discipline problems. A student might have new friends who are less interested in standard home and school activities. The use of illegal drugs is increasing, especially among young teens.  The average age of first marijuana use is 14, and alcohol use can start before age 12.  The use of marijuana and alcohol in high school has become common (American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry 2008).

== &lt;big&gt;'''How well do you respond to peer pressure?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Survey will also let you know others are respond when they encounter Peer Pressure.

== &lt;big&gt;'''What is racism?'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
The definition of racism as most people know it to be is: an individual's belief that their race is inherently superior to those of a dissimilar race. Racism in education is a subject that is challenging to research. Racism exists in this country even though federal and state mandates that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race.  &quot;As a whole, issues of racial avoidance are not at all uncommon. For example, in educational administration, very few individuals have had a critical dialogue about the role of racism in society.&quot; (López 2003 p76) While researching racism in education, the majority of information to be found is on critical race theory (CRT). &quot;CRT scholars suggest that the reason why society fails to see racism is because it is such a common/everyday experience that it is often taken for granted. In other words, racism is part of our everyday reality. It is part of our social fabric and embedded in our organizations, practices, and structures.&quot; (López 2003 p84) Racism in education is going to prove to be an education in itself. As we all learn how face racism not avoid the issue.

border: solid 1px #999FFF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;&quot;When racism becomes &quot;invisible,&quot; individuals begin to think that it is merely a thing of the past and/or only connected to the specific act. Rarely is racism seen as something that is always present in society and in our daily lives&quot; (López 2003 p.70)

&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;big&gt; Regardless of who you ask, most will agree that the U.S. public schools need reform. Teacher pay is low, schools are over-budget, and funding is being lost. As a result, many teachers are being over-loaded with too many students in their classrooms. Students are not being adequately prepared for a future in our modern and ever-changing 21st Century. The education system should be improved to better serve our students. Educational reform is needed.  It is not a task that can be taken lightly nor will change happen over night.  It will require a massive effort from everyone involved in the education system including the government, school administrators as well as teachers and aides.

While exploring this chapter, the reader will become aware of many issues facing Educational Reform. These issues include magnet and charter schools, vouchers, home schooling and the No Child Left Behind Act.  The reader will also learn about the effects of educational reform in the classroom and the effects that school has on a child's life.  This chapter explains the 1983 &quot;Nation at Risk&quot; document as well as the controversial issue of corporate sponsored schools. After reading this chapter, the reader will have a much better understanding of some of the issues surrounding educational reform.  &lt;/big&gt;

Learning Target:  definition of NCLB, criticisms of NCLB


Sidebar:

www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml


Introduction
“No Child Left Behind” (abbreviated NCLB)  is the name of a set of laws concerning education reform that George Bush helped to pass early in his Presidential administration.   According to the United States department of education website, there are four main pillars of NCLB:  1) Accountability for student performance, 2) control on the local level, 3) Effective Teaching Methods, and 4)  Alternatives for families.
	The first pillar means that states are responsible for reporting each year to the federal government student test scores and measures of student improvement or decline.   States are also responsible for monitoring the relative progress of students according to ethnicity, including the monitoring of the progress of African Americans, Hispanics, and Indians.
	The second pillar of NCLB is that there is flexibility at the local level.  This flexibility starts on the state level.  Each state has flexibility at least with respect to how to shape and define the following issues:   standards of assessment, elements of AYP definition, students with special needs, highly qualified teachers, accountability systems, and AYP for unique schools.
	The third pillar of NCLB is placing an emphasis on effective teaching methods.  Through this initiative, the federal government encourages states to use scientific research and statistical analysics to locate and reinforce teaching methods that are effective.   Also through this initiative, the government provides federal funding to support teaching programs that have shown to be effective.  
	The fourth pillar is providing a greater range of options for parents.  One of the most important of these options is allowing parents to transfer their child to another school if the school where their child attends has not met state standards for two straight years.  Also parents have the freedom to transfer their child if the school is deemed to be recognized as dangerous or if their child is a victim of violence.



Article 1 

	“Considering alternatives for federal education and policy in the United States, A Critical Perspective on No Child Left Behind,” by Jacqueline Edmendson and Alexandrio D’Urso offers a critical reaction to the NCLB legislation.  In this article Edmendson and D’Urso are calling for a drastic formation or even a complete discarding of the No Child Left Behind Act.
	Edmendson and D’Urso argue that one of the primary goals of education reform should be to improve access of information for schools and to widen the availability for a diversity of learning methods and behaviors (Edmendson ''et al.'', 2009, p. 86).  Edmendson and D’Urso are critiquing the NCLB program for promoting just the opposite of these goals.  Rather than expanding opportunities for learning, NCLB narrows and limits what can be done in educational contexts (Edmendson ''et al.'', 2009, 86).  This restriction is performed through an increased emphasis on standardized testing and the quantitative results of this testing.   Edmendson and D’Urso criticize NCLB for making consequences that causes teachers and students to have fear (Edmendson ''et al.'', 2009, 86).  Citing some of the views of Al Gore in his book _Assault on Reason_, they believe that creating fear in teachers and students is not the best remedy for improving education in the United States (Edmendson ''et al.'', 2009, 87).  Part of the alternative to NCLB would be a program that focuses centrally on the goal of situating students in communities and democratic life (Edmendson ''et al.'', 2009, 89).


Article 2
	
        Another article responding to the NCLB legislation is “No Child Left Behind, A Legislative Catalyst for Superintendant Action to Eliminate Test-Score gaps?” by Whitney Sherman.  One of the central purposes of this article is to argue that NCLB has not solved many important needs, but that one approach to this problem is looking to modify some aspects of NCLB rather than completely discarding the NCLB program.
	According to this article one aspect of education that has not been addressed well yet by NCLB is the problem of institutionalized racism and a failure to properly celebrate cultural diversity (Sherman, 697).  By requiring schools to compare student performance according to race, NCLB may unintentionally reinforce a mindset of racism.  Such an effect is more prone to occur if any existing achievement gap according to race is not being successfully narrowed or eliminated.  As it stands, there is a widespread condition of school districts that have not improved nearly according to the terms of NCLB (Sherman, 699).   Many of these school districts have essentially remained the same as when they started.  The only difference for some of these districts is that the gap of student performance according to race is now made obvious through the focus on data results.
	Yet, while Sherman sees problems with NCLB and thinks that it is likely to fail in the long-run, she is not explicitly advocating that the United States terminate this policy (Sherman, 698).  There are several measures that can be taken to improve the chances of NCLB to be successful.  First, there is the need for legislation that will motivate superintendents to adopt new ways to identify how culture affects school practice, so that new measures can be taken to strengthen the connection between cultural appreciation and student success (Sherman, 698).  Second, superintendents need to help schools to identify outcomes that feed inequality (Sherman, 697).  Third, the nature of professional development for teachers needs to be improved.  Professional development programs need to be remodeled so that they can better train teachers to educate students in a way that is effective and in a way that lessens the aforementioned problems (Sherman, 698).  Sherman acknowledges that NCLB has increased awareness of where there is need (Sherman, 699), and though such results can reinforce stereotypes about student learning and indirectly support the continued existence of institutionalized racism, such an awareness, if responded to correctly, can help our society more quickly and efficiently diagnose and repair gaps in student achievement



Article 3

	The third article is entitled “No Child Left Behind and the Quest for Educational Equity:  The Role of Teachers’ collective Sense of Efficacy&quot; by Andrea Evans.  This article conducted some research to measure the sense of teachers with respect to their sense of efficacy or effectiveness of the NCLB legislation.  Andrea Evans, the author of this essay, argues that there is a significant amount at stake concerning teacher’s sense of efficacy since research shows there is a direct link between teachers’ sense of efficacy and student performance (Evans, 86).   Teacher’s sense of efficacy and student performance are linked because research shows that teachers’ sense of efficacy governs the actions and decisions teachers’ make (Evans, 85).
	One of the results that has recently emerged during the era of NCLB is that teachers now have a somewhat different standard for how to judge their sense of efficacy.   Before NCLB, there was less of an importance placed on success for students with a certain ethnicity or a certain socio-economic status.  With the NCLB legislation, these kinds of categories are being more closely monitored, teachers are being evaluated based on goals set in terms of these categories.  Research shows that teachers feel less competent and less responsible for students who are coming from poor backgrounds, and the research also shows that teachers have a lower sense of efficacy for students in this category (Evans, 85).  There could in fact be a link between this low sense of efficacy for these students and the fact that such teachers do not feel competent or responsible for them.
	Although this article shows that there is a significant percentage of teachers who have a negatives sense of the efficacy of NCLB, Evans is not arguing that NCLB necessarily should be given up as America’s model for education reform.  NCLB has resulted in teachers having a low sense of efficacy, but this problem is what Evans calls an “alterable organizational condition (Evans, 87).”  If educational leaders can work to help show teachers what’s at stake in their attitude and help teachers to have an improved sense of efficacy, this will improve students’ scores and performance and increase the chance of NCLB being successful.


Critique:

	After viewing each of these articles and others, it is clear that very few if any articles argue that we should fully embrace NCLB exactly as it was first articulated and received.  The first article presented above leaned more on the side that NCLB should be completely rejected and that our country should adopt a completely alternative plan for action that is perceived as more conducive to certain goals such as access to a greater range of information and more freedom for diverse methods of teaching and learning.   The second and third articles above did not explicitly reject NCLB in its entirety but argued that there have been some problems that have resulted from NCLB that need to be addressed and corrected as well as possible.
	One fact that does remain is that the United States keeps a close eye on certain kinds of student achievement than it ever has before.  This kind of awareness is something that is either directly or indirectly acknowledged in each article.  The majority of articles set out to show problems that exist with NCLB and how to possibly respond to these problems, without necessarily discarding NCLB in its entirety.  NCLB has not been in place for more than 10 years.  As NCLB is given a longer time to work, such problems can be discussed more and proposed solutions for dealing with these problems can be given time to work.  Adjustments can be made.  With time, then, it seems that NCLB can bring nothing but improvement for student education.  If we do not meet NCLB’S lofty goal of a 100% passing rate in 2014, it is not unreasonable to aim for an improvement in overall student performance and a smaller gap for achievement according to the preset categories.

               D.  federal legislature focusing on accountability, control for local districts, teaching  
                    methods, and alternatives for parents

2. Which of the following options do you think would be most appealing for Whitney Sherman:
             A.  Obama decides to lobby to discontinue NCLB
             B.  Keep NCLB but eliminate the “AYP” feature
             C.  Improve professional development for teachers
             D.  Campaign for George Bush’s brother Jeb to become the next president 

3.  The third article proposes which of the following:
            	A.  Teachers tend to have bad sex lives and this interferes with their ability to focus on 
                     the job setting
            	B.  Teachers can improve their attitudes towards student performance,  particularly with 
                    respect to poor students and minorities
             	C.  Teachers’ collective sense of efficacy was never a problem before NCLB was enacted
                D.  Teachers’ sense of inefficacy and student performance do NOT mutually reinforce each 
                    other  

4.  We can conclude from these articles that:
	
        A.  Probably few people now accept that NCLB was perfect from its beginning
 	B.  Most people think NCLB should remain as it is
        C.  Most people think the government should set NCLB aside
	D.  ODU should start a fraternity abbreviated “NCLB”

'''INTRODUCTION''' &lt;br&gt;
If you spend any time watching the news, the situations occurring in U.S. public schools seem bleak.  We are cutting budgets, overloading teachers with too many students, not providing them enough resources, and narrowing curriculum without uniformity.  We are still far from any type of reform, and in the meantime, schools are failing students.

Unfortunately, while total reform may be necessary, this is a multifaceted issue entrenched in debates at the federal, state, and local municipal levels.  The argument has been over vouchers, magnet schools, charter schools, home-schooling, and presently there seems to be no agreeable solution.  So much time is spent debating that we ignore brilliant research right in front of us; shining bright lights on successful instructional methods.  We ignore our teachers and their needs, as money gets irresponsibly shuffled to administrators and then totally lost to local school districts.  This is not a problem that we can simply throw dollars at without oversight.  Real solutions are needed that prepare students to be competitive in the global marketplaces of the 21st century.  We need a system that ensures an equal and quality education for all.  What are these solutions?  Should we look more closely at creating a federal curriculum?  Should we operate schools more like traditional businesses with healthy free market competition?  Can we eliminate schools that do not maintain standards and provide extra funding for those who do?  Can we provide teachers with a structured accountability system that purges jobs for those who do not make the cut, but increases salary for those who excel?  Although these are valuable questions, no one seems able to move past typical bureaucratic red tape.  Nevertheless, it is up to us to decide whether information in today's news will force us to engage change and become activists for reform.

February 25, 2009, a $787 billion stimulus package was passed through Congress, without a single Republican vote.  $53 billion was initially allocated for education and training, and is beginning to see its way into our state and local school districts.  Approximately $100 billion will find its way to our state schools by  July 1, 2009. &lt;br&gt; www.recovery.gov

'''FEDERAL NEWS'''&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
'''5/5/09 Fox News''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Arne Duncan and No Child Left Behind''' &lt;br&gt;
The United States' new Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, promises to review NCLB.  He admits that NCLB has had some success at addressing low-achieving, diverse student populations, but there are still many distinct failures with the legislation.  Duncan would like to start by first changing its name.  He believes the NCLB title is toxic, and has proposed that elementary students submit recommendations as to what it should be called instead.  Regardless of its title, Duncan is a man on a mission.  He plans to review all of the short fallings written in this legislation.  According to Education Week Newspaper, 1/3 of schools failed to meet yearly progress goals last year.  Duncan has made it clear:  He will not brush those schools under the rug any longer.  He told the Education Writers Association in Washington that NCLB was very loose on overall goals, but very tight and prescriptive on how to accomplish those goals.  He claims the idea is fundamentally backwards.  In addition, Duncan will attempt to create more uniform country-wide standards in the subject areas of math and language arts.  He also defends a position that music and fine arts should not be eliminated from curriculum because of other required instruction.  Lastly, he is an avid defender of public charter schools and plans to allocate more stimulus money to those schools who are paving the way for true education reform. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF9966;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';&quot;&gt;
'''According to the U.S. Department of Education, 1/4 of high school freshmen still drop out.  NCLB has had no effect of this statistic.''' &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;br&gt;

'''Federal Curriculum?'''&lt;br&gt;
There is much controversy surrounding the establishment of a federal curriculum, comparable to other countries models of successful education.  States argue that NCLB is already the largest federal encroachment, where education has always been primarily the state's jurisdiction.  The federal government argues that our children cannot afford to have such disparities in instruction between state's guidelines.  Nonetheless, Arne Duncan is still pushing for national standards in math and language arts instruction.  How is this different from our current NCLB standards?  If a national uniformity is passed, then students from every state would be tested the same way in chosen subject disciplines.  According to the Washington Post (2009), &quot;Forty-six states and the District of Columbia have already announced an effort to craft a single vision for what children should learn each year from Kindergarten through high school.&quot;

'''VIRGINIA NEWS''' &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
'''9/25/08'''&lt;br&gt; '''VDOE Press Release'''&lt;br&gt;
Superintendent of Public Instruction, Billy K. Cannaday Jr. states, &quot;Nearly all Virginia children now attend schools that are exceeding the Commonwealth's minimum expectations for student achievement.  So many schools are now moving beyond minimum standards for competence and proficiency and towards academic excellence.  It is a credit to the educators, elected leaders, policy makers and parents whose sustained support for reform has been essential in raising student achievement&quot; (VDOE Press Release, 9/25/08). 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9999FF;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';&quot;&gt;
The Virginia Department of Education (2008) states, &quot;Ninety-five percent of Virginia's public schools are now fully accredited and meeting state standards for student achievement in english, mathematics, history and science based on 2007-2008 assessment results&quot; &lt;br&gt;(VDOE Press Release, 9.25.08). &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
---- 
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
'''2/20/09''' &lt;br&gt; '''Virginia Education Association''' &lt;br&gt;
The Virginia Education Association is graciously saying thank you to the federal government for its cut of the stimulus package.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act comes at a time when Virginia schools seem to need it most.  According to VEA, the stimulus is a &quot;breathtaking injection of resources at a most dire time. According to one estimate, the bill will provide an average additional $870 per pupil nationally over the next two years. It will also create or save 267,355 teaching positions and an additional 40,000 instructional staff this year&quot; (VEA, 2009, n.p.).

'''5/29/09''' &lt;br&gt; '''The Virginia Pilot'''&lt;br&gt;
Social Studies Sol's?  To take or not take?  Should we continue testing third graders on their cumulative history knowledge from kindergarten?    This a just one interesting debate occurring in the administration offices at the VDOE.  Early childhood history instruction focuses on topics from Ancient China, American Indians, the Roman Empire, and the West African Empire of Mali.  Now, Virginia is considering the elimination of this particular SOL because NCLB does not require it.  Should we devalue the importance of history education in our student's early years?  The jury is still out on this debate. &lt;br&gt;
----

'''IT'S ALL ABOUT TEACHERS'''&lt;br&gt;
Regardless of the policy debates occurring between states and the federal government, teachers still have the most important job:  to make positive changes everyday in the lives of their students.  The question we should be most concerned with now, is how to gain better resources for our classrrooms. This topic seems highly disheartening however, as studies with recent statistics show extreme teacher layoffs and budget cuts all over the United States. 
** Additional Resource:  Refer to Education Week Newspaper, 2/25/2009, Vol. 28 Issue 22, p1-13.
**Article provides a current update on issues surrounding teacher layoffs.  It can be accessed directly from http://www.edweek.org/. 
&lt;br&gt;
Nonetheless, the job still must go on.  While legislative debates may continue forever, teachers still need to be able to work harder and smarter for their students.  They need to leave the controversy out of the classroom and remain focused on the one thing that is most important, the students!

'''FINAL THOUGHTS...''' &lt;br&gt;
At the end of the day, we can all do our very best to aide or participate in the educational reform process.  However, all that really matters is that our future generation is safe, happy, and learning the skills necessary to survive successfully in this ever-changing world.  Policies will be debated, students will grow up and move on, changes will occur.  All that is left is whether we have done the best we can for our students and our communities.

Socrates said long ago, &quot;the mission of education is to help people become both smart and good&quot;.   
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

With the right advocates and professionals involved, we should be able to accomplish this mission!  We should start now!

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and present it professionally. The technology should become an integral part of how the classroom functions -- as accessible as all other classroom tools.&quot;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''What is Technology Integration?'''

Technology Integration is the use of technology resources, such as computers, software applications, the Internet, cameras, etc., in daily classroom practices. Technology must be routine and apparent for integration in the classroom to be achieved. Using technology as a resource in the classroom helps the student to blend their learning techniques (Bledsoe, 2008). When integration is used, students seem to more actively engage themselves in the learning process. Technology Integration in the classroom requires reshaping, redesigning, and re-visioning traditional teaching and learning relationships (Georgina and Olson, 2008). 
What are some types of technology integration?
Along with computers and software programs, there are several different ways that teachers integrate technology into the classroom. Below are a few examples along with a description of each.

Podcast: a program, as of music or talk, made available in digital format over the Internet (Merriam Webster, 2009).

PowerPoint Presentation or Slideshow: a display of a series of chosen words and/or pictures done for artistic or instructional purposes (Merriam Webster, 2009). 

IPOD: a pocket size device used to play music files (Merriam Webster, 2009).

Instant Messaging: a means or system for transmitting electronic messages instantly (Merriam Webster, 2009). 

Webcam: a camera used in transmitting live images over the World Wide Web (Merriam Webster, 2009).

== '''Magnet Schools and Charter Schools''' ==


'''What is a magnet school and what does it offer?'''

A magnet school is part of the public school system and exists outside of zoned school boundaries. Instead of attending the school they are closest to, students may choose to attend a magnet school. Magnet schools attract students because they generally have something special to offer over a regular school, which makes attending them an attractive choice to many students. Most Magnet Schools concentrate on a particular area of study, and offer an alternative mode of instruction (Rossell, 2005).

'''What is a charter school and what does it offer?'''

A charter school is a publicly funded school that has been granted a charter (a document outlining its terms and conditions) exempting it from selected state or local rules and regulations. It is a new, innovative public school that is accountable for student results. It delivers programs for educational excellence and the needs of the community. A school's charter is reviewed every three to five years and can be revoked if certain guidelines are not met (National Education Association, 2009).

== '''Vouchers''' ==


'''What is a voucher?'''

A voucher is a coupon that is issued by the government to a parent or guardian in financial need that is to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school (Merriam Webster, 2009). With a voucher, parents can pay for the education of their child at the school of their choice, rather than the public school to which they are assigned.

'''Why is there controversy surrounding vouchers?''' 

Vouchers are a subject of heated controversy because there are many variables to be considered. The main question that arises is who should receive school vouchers? Should specific groups be targeted, or is every child eligible? 

'''What are the supporting arguments for vouchers?'''

Supporters of school vouchers believe that parents should be given the right to choose the best educational environment for their children. Advocates argue that vouchers would give all parents, regardless of their socioeconomic status, the opportunity for their child to receive a better education (Costrell, 2009). By making the educational system afree market enterprise, the public educational system would then be forced to provide a higher level of education to compete with other schools. Supporters also state that school vouchers would bring more diversity and equality into the schools, as there would be students from all races and backgrounds attending. (Bolick, 2008).
 
'''What are the opposing arguments for vouchers?'''
 
One central argument against vouchers is that they violate the first amendment, specifically the separation of church and state. Private schools are predominantly religious institutions, which makes any government funding to these schools a violation of the first amendment. (Bolick, 2008). Opponents also argue that there is no need for school vouchers because public schools are generally on equal footing with private schools.  When completing the same coursework, opponents say that students perform equally in both institutions. Because of this, they argue that there is no need for the public to send any child to a private school. Another argument is that the voucher program will drain money from the schools that need it most, and public schools may become dumping schools for the difficult to handle (Costrell, 2009).

== '''Homeschooling''' ==

[[File:Homeschooler with Project.jpg|300px]]


'''What is homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling is to teach (one's children) at home. (Merriam Webster, 2009), and also means to be taught in a particular culture. With homeschooling, the parent is the teacher and along with academics, they can teach certain philosophies to their children that they believe are valuable. 
'''
What is the government's role in homeschooling?'''

Virginia state law requires that a homeschooling parent meet at least one of four specific requirements. Virginia Code 22.1-254.1 outlines these four requirements:
The teaching parent holds a high school diploma.
The teaching parent meets the qualifications for a teacher prescribed by the Board of Education.
The teaching parent provides a program of study or curriculum which may be delivered through a correspondence course or distance learning program or in any other manner.
The teaching parent provides evidence that the parent is able to provide an adequate education for the child (The Virginia Department of Education , 2008). 

'''What are the pros of homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling is valued by many parents for a variety of reasons. Parents are able to teach their children academic material as well as values, beliefs and philosophies. Children can also be taught at their own pace, and can sometimes accomplish more in a few hours than what a regular classroom can accomplish in one week. Homeschooling provides the child with educational, emotional and physical freedom (Shaw, 2009) . 

'''What are the cons of homeschooling?'''

Homeschooling is not for everyone. There may be time restraints on the family, as learning outside of a school environment can consume valuable time. There may also be financial restraints, as there is often at least one unemployed parent with the time and ability to homeschool. There are limited sports and other extracurricular activities for the child to participate in, which are important for the socialization of the child. A homeschooling family must be willing to live outside the box (Shaw, 2009).

== '''The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)''' ==

[[File:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|300px|]]


'''What is the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)?''' 

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was signed into law in January 2002 by President Bush. It is a federal law to improve education for all children. This law challenges states and school districts to improve the academic achievement of public schools considered to be at risk for failure (US Department of Education, 2009). 

'''What are the standards of the NCLB?'''

There are four main standards, or pillars, of the No Child Left Behind Act. They are: stronger accountability for results, more freedom for states and communities (Under NCLB, states and schoold districts have unlimited flexibility in how they use federal education funds), proven education methods, and more choices for parents (US Department of Education, 2009). 

'''Why is there controversy behind the NCLB?'''

There are teachers, schools, and educational organizations that believe the No Child Left Behind Act is flawed. Money concerns are a main factor, as adequate funding to support this law is essential. Another issue leading to this controversy is the fact that some teachers feel the need to sacrifice one subject for another under the NCLB testing requirements. Some believe that under the NCLB act the federal government may have too much control, and some changes may need to be implemented.(How to Fix, 2007).

What is a school? Merely a box where we store our unruly youth? A giant kiln we shove our children into to harden, hopefully, into productive adults? Schools are not arbitrarily designed institutions. There are layers of organization involved on every level of government to insure that the children, our future as the late Michael Jackson would say, receive the best education possible.   Organization is the mortar that holds our educational system together.  Public education has been made possible through the streamlining of our educational system by various hierarchies, regulations, and associations. Without the order offered by these conventions schools of any kind would be highly ineffective, if possible at all. 


This chapter will introduce various levels of Organization present in our Educational System:


'''Funding'''

'''School Hierarchies'''

'''The Role of Government Within Our Schools'''

'''Professional Organizations'''

'''Teacher Evaluation Systems'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Organizational Changes Make Headlines'''==


By: Kim Hedley

== '''Learning Objectives''' ==
1. Students will be able to name the state that has adopted the 'Pay for Performance' program and note at which school level it is being tested.

2. Students will be able to explain the three criteria used to determine teacher's success and amount of additional pay in the 'Pay for Performance' programs.

3. Students will be able to list three examples of failure in the Detroit Public School System.

4. Students will be able to identify U.S. Secretary of Education and his position on mayoral control of the Detroit Public School System.


== '''Introduction''' ==

School organization consists of many different levels of governance, various board members, superintendents, principals, parents and students, to name a few (Barr &amp; Dreeben, 2007). These different groups work together in an effort to maintain a successful educational atmophere and create successful invdividuals. When one of the links is missing, or not contributing properly, the system may begin to fail. Unfortunately, several school districts throughout the United States are finding that the organization is failing and therefore, so are many of the students. As a result of low test scores, decreasing graduation rates and poor use of financial resources, the government has intervened to reform many of these districts. This intervention consists of several tactics that aim to increase teacher effectiveness and ultimately increase test scores. One example of this effort to increase the quality of education is known as 'Pay for Performance' (Lavy, 2007). Steps have also been taken to re-organize individuals within specific school districts, enabling mayoral control, in order to help ensure proper supervision and begin increasing student success rates (Dawsey, 2009). Throughout the article I will will provide examples of both of these types of reform that are currently taking place. I will also explain the significance of the events and the debates that have followed many of the recent decisions.

=='''Teacher Evaluations''': ''Pay for Performance''==

In most schools around the country, a teacher's salary is based almost completely on their educational background as well as experience (Schencker, 2009). For many teachers, pay is not dependent on their student's test scores or graduation rates; however, for five elementary schools in Utah, this is beginning to change. Recently, lawmakers in Utah passed a bill that will allow the selected schools to receive a total of $300,000 per year for two years (Schencker, 2009). The money is to be divided between the five chosen schools. During the first year of the program, each school will use a portion of the funds to create a plan that will measure teacher and student successes (Schencker, 2009). Following the completion of the first year, using the methods decided upon by the school, teachers will be awarded additional money for the success of their students. An article in the Salt Lake Tribune states, “The amount of pay will depend on each school’s plan. According to the law, the programs must base 40 percent of the pay on student progress, which will likely be measured by test results; 40 percent on instructional quality; and 20 percent on parent, student or community satisfaction” (Schencker, 2009). In my opinion, this new &quot;Pay for Performance&quot; plan definitely has the potential to not only increase the quality of education for students but also raise the standard and motivation for teachers. In my experience with teachers, I have found that many are already putting forth their best effort despite the lack of monetary incentive; however, for those who need a reason to give a little more, this could be the answer. This is a controversial idea with arguments for and against the program. Victor Lavy (2007), professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, offers many positive aspects for the program while also finding several potential flaws. 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 1px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt; 

Those who agree with the pay incentive state that the financial reward has the potential to increase teaching quality and student success. Along with this, it is also noted that more highly qualified teachers would most likely remain in the system and be able to follow clearly defined goals and expectations (Lavy, 2007).
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


In addition to all of the potential positive feedback this pay increase could possibly bring, there are also many flaws that are difficult to overlook. If teachers are offered an increase in pay as a result of students test scores, the possibility for negative behavior on the part of the educators must be considered (Lavy, 2007). Teachers may begin to focus solely on their students' test performance and lose track of the overall educational quality. The challenge of the program is to devise a way to measure student and teacher performance and incorporating all aspects of education (Lavy, 2007). Several principals, quoted in the Salt Lake Tribune article, offer opinions about the &quot;Pay for Performance&quot; idea. One example, the principal at Wasatch Peak Academy, Sandra Shepard, states, &quot;I think it's a great time to look at what we're doing and make it better...I believe teachers all teaching in classrooms next to each other, getting the same pay at the same rate, may not be improving education&quot; (Schencker, 2009). 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFFF;
border: solid 1px #0000FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

The Salt Lake Tribune article offers the opinion of another vice principal as well. Dawnanna Topham is quoted as saying, &quot;I think what would really turn teachers off or make them not accept performance pay is if it's based solely on test scores. As long as [teachers] know it's only a portion of it, I think they will be OK&quot; (Schencker, 2009). 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000033&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=='''Administrative Changes''': ''Possibility of Mayoral Control in Detroit Public School System''==

“National disgrace.” These are words used by U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to explain the Detroit Public School System (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). This Michigan school district is in dire need of radical changes, according to Duncan; emergency financial manager Robert Bobb and Mayor Dave Bing are also in agreement that changes must occur (Mrozowski&amp; Esparza, 2009). Due to problems like decreased enrollment, low graduation rate and financial fraud, the city’s school system has been under intense scrutiny by federal, state and local education officials (Dawsey, 2009). Duncan has $5 billion available in stimulus money to offer to those school districts making drastic changes. Included in the list of changes, he admits he would like to see mayoral control of the Detroit school system. (Dawsey, 2009) On Wednesday, May 13, 2009, Bobb requested that the federal government place the school district under special circumstances and grant additional emergency financial support to help facilitate rapid changes (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). These emergency funds are generally reserved for areas that have been struck by natural disasters. Because this is not the case in Detroit, it could mean that the request will not be honored (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009).  

A mayoral takeover of the Detroit Public Schools is one suggestion to help aid in the struggling situation. Duncan has supported this idea, although many others are very hesitant to believe that this is the answer to the problems (Dawsey, 2009). The choice could be left up to the people of the city of Detroit to decide if the bill makes its way to the ballot for a November vote (Dawsey, 2009). Those who support this idea look to Robert Bobb's recent changes for hope. He has already begun making transformations that include closing 29 schools, firing principals at low-performing schools as well as diminishing $305 million from the district deficit (Dawsey, 2009). On the other hand, those who oppose this suggested change see the previous mayoral takeover that was supported by Gov. John Engler, in 1999, as a failure (Mrozowski &amp; Esparza, 2009). Parents of students in struggling districts, like Detroit, have mixed opinions about the subject (Sarrio, 2009). Some agree that significant action needs to be taken in order to reform the educational system, while others fight against mayoral control. These parents who disagree in the change argue that they are given less power and authority in their child's education (Sarrio, 2009).  The possibility of a mayoral takeover of the school system continues to be a highly debated issue with lawmakers, politicians and interest groups all weighing in (Dawsey, 2009). One thought, however, remains agreed upon, serious measures must be taken to revamp the Detroit Public School System to bring it to a functioning level without corruption and failure (Dawsey, 2009). I believe that it is imperative to have functioning school systems to support today's youth. This includes organizing the system in a way to make decisions that will benefit the students and increase the quality of education. If the mayoral takeover process could be smooth and successful, then I agree that it should occur. Significant changes need to be made, especially in troubled districts like Detroit, in order for the students to succeed. 



== '''Conclusion''' ==

Over the past several months, many changes have been made in the organization and structure of the educational system. The goal in each of these decisions has been to increase the educational quality, teacher performance and student success. Using methods like the &quot;Pay for Performance&quot; program that offers monetary incentive for successful teachers is one way of making changes. In addition to this, re-organizing the school district authorities to run the schools efficiently is another current way to help fix some problems. With these tactics, and many others, the organization of the education system is ever changing and growing. My hope is that changes continue to be made throughout the years to build effective schools and teachers and successful students.

In order to organize our education system, we must research where the faults lie and formulate a plan of action.  There are several ways to do this: “Pay for Performance” will encourage teacher productivity and encourage teachers to strive to be the best; equality in school funding so that urban districts have the same opportunities as suburban districts; understanding the roles of specific offices within the school district gives parents and teachers a place to voice their concerns; understanding the roles that state and local government play provides necessary leverage in decisions; teachers unions impact school policy; and teacher evaluations help administrators and teachers access strengths and weaknesses in delivering instruction to the students.

&lt;center&gt;Written by: Hunter Smith&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/font&gt;



&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFFF;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&quot;Fools!&quot; (His clenched fist striking the lectern before him.) &quot;We must prepare today's youth for a world whose terrors are etched upon ancient clay tablets recounting the fever-dreams of the other gods—not fill their heads with such trivia as math and English. Our graduates need to know about those who lie beneath the earth, waiting until the stars align so they can return to their rightful place as our masters and wage war against the Elder Things and the shoggoths!&quot;– Fictitious Arkham school board member, Charles West.&lt;/big&gt;

'''Learning Objectives'''

- Readers should realize the potential of an alternative for our education system, and associated advantages/disadvantages.

- Readers should develop a base understanding of the concept of state derived curricula in contrast to a federally adopted and enforced one.

- Readers should be able to understand two of the primary options and opinions regarding national academic curricula.


=='''What is a National Curricula?'''==

A National Curriculum is a framework used by some country's schools to ensure that teaching and learning is balanced and consistent. It lays out a guideline for the subjects taught, the knowledge, skills and understanding required in each subject, and the standards or attainment targets in each subject. Teachers are to use these to measure a child's progress and plan the next steps in their learning. The government also regulates how your child's progress is assessed and reported.


'''Pros of such a system in the US:'''

- Establishes a unified educational system. All states are on the same page. If a student moves to a different school district, it is much less troublesome to catch up.

- It would allow adequate state by state education comparisons, because all standards would be the same.

- Certifications for teaching could be nationwide, due to standards being the same.

- Bring about new forms of assessment for post-secondary education outside of SAT, SOL, ACT, etc.


'''The Dreaded Cons:'''

- Unavoidable disagreements about who decides what information is important to teach, and what isn't. (Question: Do you think this would differ from how it is now?)

- This would potentially effect private schools, charter schools and homeschools– by dictating what must be taught.

- Other aspects, especially teacher salaries, would need to become uniform and regulated.

- Allows the federal government more control over school funding instead of the state.

- Different regions would value different cultural aspects of education over others.

=='''Introduction&lt;/font&gt;'''==
The education curricula can vary from country to country as much as it can from institution to institution. There’s differentiation upon what qualifies being worthwhile knowledge, and the definition of conventional subjects becomes entirely subjective. While very few countries are found at the extremes of total uniformity or complete diversity, Italy, France, Japan, much of southern and eastern Europe (before 1990), and many countries outside the industrial world lean tend towards standardization, while the curricula of the United States and Canada have encouraged differences between schools (McLean).

&lt;br&gt;
In American, each school has complete control over its curriculum, though not over the textbooks used. There is no official system of external examinations for the entire country. Public debate about standards in American schools in the late 1950s and again in the early 1980s led to curriculum projects funded by federal government, encouragement for higher level “fast-track” courses, and state-level assessment of student competence. More popular universities now demand that their entrants achieve high marks in nationwide, privately run tests such as the SAT. The American school has traditionally served all young people in one neighborhood and aims to develop local community awareness and to offer the acquisition of knowledge and skill in all areas relevant to an adult citizen. The well-founded American pragmatic tradition seems to discourage the more narrowly academic education of other countries, and instead aims to develop local community awareness and offer the acquisition of knowledge and skills in all areas relevant to an adult life (McLean).

&lt;br&gt;
In countries that have a national curriculum– a list of subjects is prescribed for each grade of education, each with an allotted number of hours per week or year. In Japan, the curriculum has been as standardized and external as any in the world, with prescribed textbooks as well as national content; though, student assessment is still left to teachers. There has been a movement to encourage more individuality and student choice since 1992 with the introduction of life environment studies in primary schools to encourage creativity and independent learning. Upper education courses must cover all basic areas, including Japanese, history, geography, civics, mathematics, science, art, and foreign languages, as well as offering specialist options (McLean).

&lt;br&gt;
It is also worthy to note that countries that tend to have national curricula tend to also place emphasis on entrance exams. For example, Japanese students have to take entrance examination for junior high school, high school and university, if they change (or sometimes advance) to a new institution (&quot;Japan's Education System&quot;).

=='''Proponents of a National Curriculum'''==

(http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200801/miller-education/2)

In this article, Matt Miller (2008) acknowledges that nationalizing education has never been a popular idea in this country, but he argues that the time has come:

&lt;br&gt;
''“Nationalizing our schools even a little goes against every cultural tradition we have, save the one that matters most: our capacity to renew ourselves to meet new challenges. Once upon a time a national role in retirement funding was anathema; then suddenly, after the Depression, we had Social Security. Once, a federal role in health care would have been rejected as socialism; now, federal money accounts for half of what we spend on health care. We started down this road on schooling a long time ago. Time now to finish the journey.” 
''


Set academic standards, whether they are state or national, shape what is taught to students, and more importantly, how teachers teach. In education, there has always been a debate over what to teach our students. Curriculums (whether national or not) should be developed with the mindset of challenging not only students, but the teachers as well. 

(http://www.ncsu.edu/chass/extension/ci/idealcurriculum.html)

Here, James Beane (2009) suggests that a unifying curriculum can provide the possibility of bettering education in under-resourced schools; one version is easier to deal with on a national level than fifty state versions.

He thinks that a national curriculum should enable students to experience and practice democracy. It should create an environment where students learn together, apply various knowledge and methodologies to solve problems and give opportunities to critically assess problematic issues.  Beane feels that schools have an obligation to promote democratic social integration. In place of a capitalistic, competitive structure, the classroom should be based on democracy, diversity and equality. He acknowledges that such concepts are advocated, but not always practiced in schools nor in society in general.

=='''Adversaries of a National Curriculum&lt;/font&gt;'''==
(http://www.hslda.org/docs/news/200905110.asp)

The Home School Legal Defense Association is adamant in its belief that educational decisions should be left up to the states and local school boards, not the federal government. Furthermore, for the past several decades, they view America’s education system as having become centralized and more disconnected from parents and local control. ''&quot;This has weakened academic quality in general, and made the federal government’s grip on the education system tighter. Local control over education is always better than centralized federal control. We are extremely concerned by any calls for nationalized standards, especially since it is unclear what room would be left for educational freedom, or how homeschoolers will be affected.&quot;'' They denounce any attempt by Congress to create nationalized standards, curriculum, or testing, considering it to be unconstitutional, and harmful to students and families. They hold to the notion that Home school families demonstrate that parents, not bureaucrats in Washington, best know their children and what they need to learn.

=='''My take on it all...&lt;/font&gt;'''==

I don’t see the harm in trying new things with our education system. There’s obviously no way to please everyone, and what’s most important is the best interests of the students. There’s definite room for improvement in public schools in virtually every conceivable area. There’s the inkling that if the federal government gets more involved that things will just get worse, but they’re certainly didn’t get any better in my scholastic lifetime in the state’s hands. I think James Beane has an interesting approach– the concept of doing away with standardization entirely and approaching teaching from a much more interactive and personal experience level. However, I do not think we are ready for that much of a leap of faith. Give it another fifty years or so, when schools become obsolete and we simply have interactive transmitted educational discussions broadcast into our homes via holograms. But I would like to see more room for creativity to flourish in the classroom. With technology integration, curriculums are destined to go through some extreme changes and focus mainly on developing a student’s concrete skills.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot; face=georgia FONT SIZE=2&gt;
'''What are &quot;The &quot;Three R's&quot; and how do they relate to teaching?'''

In this case, the &quot;Three R's&quot; were originally quoted as being &quot;reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic&quot;(American Heritage). Reading, writing, and arithmetic were originally thought to be the basis of all education. Since then, teaching has evolved to a point where these are the core, but many other equally important subjects are taught. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
For more information on the Three R's of the Environment, click:

http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0775891.html
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''Is there a &quot;Fourth R?&quot;'''

The concept of a &quot;Fourth R&quot; is debated among teachers. Some of the suggestions relating to academics are Relationship, Rhythm (music), and Art (Olah, 2009). Most teachers see all of these as being equally important to the original &quot;Three R's.&quot; These three hopeful additions are things that are necessary for one to become a well-rounded individual. Three other very well known R's that many teachers present to their students are &quot;Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.&quot; The environment is one of the most pertinent topics today and is discussed in many classrooms between a teacher and his or her students (Olah, 2009).



'''What is &quot;Formal Curriculum&quot;? What is a &quot;Hidden Curriculum&quot;? How do they differ?'''

A formal curriculum is the typical lesson plan that a teacher makes on any given day which covers all of the academic topics that will be covered in class. A &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; (also referred to as informal curriculum or character education), on the other hand, is an implied curriculum which addresses character traits.  Formal curriculum is explicit to the student because its goals are made clear by the teacher before teaching begins. &quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; is considered implicit because it happens beneath the surface of a lesson and is meant to subconsciously improve students' character (Bibbs, Jr, 2009).
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;

https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/phil-157-fall2008/2007/09/15/the-hidden-curriculum/
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''How does &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; affect students?'''

&quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; allows teachers the ability to not only teach their chosen lesson, but also other life skills. &quot;Hidden curriculum&quot; is often referred to as &quot;character education&quot; because that is precisely what it does (Bibbs, Jr, 2009). Through this implicit instruction, teachers can impart important relationship, time management, and social responsibility skills on to their students.



'''What is a &quot;standardized test&quot;?'''

A standardized test is a &quot;standard&quot; test on specific subject matter that is given and graded in a uniform way (Jones, 2009). Examples of such tests are the Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL's), the ERB, the PSAT, the SAT, the PRAXIS I and the PRAXIS II, and AP exams. These types of tests never differ no matter what school, city, or state they are administered in.



'''What are the advantages and disadvantages of standardized testing?'''

In the academic world, there are many arguments for and against standardized testing. Some feel that the tests are &quot;too standard&quot; to truly assess students, while others feel that all students need to be assessed the same way. The main argument for standardized testing is cooperation; cooperation not only at the teacher:student level, but at many other levels (Jones, 2009).  The main argument against standardized testing is the view that schools narrow their curriculum to support the test (Jones, 2009). 



'''What is the view of those who support standardized testing?'''

There are many who support standardized testing as the best way to assess students. One point of support is the small amount to time that it takes to grade these types of tests, especially when using Scantron sheets which are read by a computer (Marcotte, 2009). Supporters also believe that standardized tests create the highest levels of accountability for teachers.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''What is the view of those who oppose standardized testing?'''

There are also many who oppose standardized testing. The main view of the opposition is that a single test is not enough to assess the depth of students' knowledge (Marcotte, 2009). Those who oppose feel that students who only experience standardized testing are denied access to a more diverse curriculum (Marcotte, 2009). Many people feel that standardized testing has caused a “dumbing” down on the American education system (Kohn, 2000, p29).



'''What are AP and IB classes? How do they affect students and teachers?'''

AP classes, or Advanced Placement classes, are classes in which high school students complete college level work for the chance to receive college credit (based on a qualifying test score) (Gauss, 2009). IB classes, or International Baccalaureate classes, are those in which the students study multiple topics and see how they relate (Gauss, 2009).  Both of these types of classes are at a much higher level than typical high school classes and require not only brighter students but better teachers as well.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;




'''What is College Preparatory education? Who are its main targets?'''

College preparatory education is a course of study that prepares students for learning at a college level and sets them up to be successful in college (Lewis, 2009). Its main targets are low-income and minority students because those groups are the two that are least likely to attend college (Lewis, 2009). The goal of college prep programs is to help these and all students succede in college. Classes that are typical to the college prep course work would be Honors and AP classes.



'''What is Vocational education? What are its main targets?'''

Vocational education teaches students skills that will help them attain careers (Lewis, 2009). Vocational education is for students who will not be attending college immediately after high school or attending college at all (Lewis, 2009). Classes that are typical to the vocational education course work would be Cosmetology and Nursing classes.

http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/index.html
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''What are advantages and disadvantages to college preparatory courses?'''

The main advantage of college prep courses is that they truly prepare the students for the difficulty and amount of work that they will encounter in college (Filson, 2009). Another advantage is, if the student scores well enough on his or her AP exam, he or she can receive college credit for that course. The main disadvantage of college prep courses is that some students find that they are still not prepared to handle college courses (Filson, 2009).



'''What are advantages and disadvantages of vocational education courses?''' 

The main advantage of vocational education is that it is a perfect option for those students who are not interested in attending college, but want a job instead (Filson, 2009). The main disadvantage of vocational education is that is often receives a negative connotation because the students who chose this track often did not do as well in high school as their college prep counterparts (Filson, 2009).

The student(s) will be able to discuss and analyze the characteristics associated with an effective school as demonstrated through the performances of students, teachers, and administrators.


== Introducation ==

As we enter the world of education in the twenty first century, schools today are faced with many challenges.  These challenges are all encompassing.  They include effective teaching, safe and orderly environment, classroom management, planning and instruction, and the overall professionalism and attitude of people in a school building.  Today's schools are a reflection of the community that they serve.  With the laboring economy that effects us all, the work that has to be accomplished to create an effective school is more difficult then ever in the history of education.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

   

== Chapter FAQ's ==
&lt;big&gt;Q: What are effective schools?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  Lawrence, Lezotte, &amp; McKee (2002) states that &quot;Effective Schools are schools that can, in measured student achievement terms, demonstrate the joint presence of quality and equity.  Effective Schools demonstrate high overall levels of achievement and no gaps in the distribution of that achievement across major subsets of the student population&quot; (p. 15). In order to establish an effective school atmosphere there must be a collaborative working environment between school personnel, parents and the community.  A safe school environment is mandatory, and all academic initiatives must ensure student participation.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Foundations_and_Assessment_of_Education/Edition_1/Foundations_Table_of_Contents/Chapter_9/Content_Articles/9.3.2

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is a Mentor?&lt;/big&gt;

A: A mentor is someone a student can look up to and role model after.  A mentor is someone who is a trusted counselor or teacher and/or an influential senior and supporter (Mentoring, 2009).  Teachers and students can benefit from having a mentor assigned to work with them on a regular basis. In Virginia, schools are required to have mentoring programs for new teachers to assist with classroom instruction, planning, classroom management, discipline procedures, and the overwhelming amount of paperwork required.  New teachers were leaving the profession after just a few years in the classroom. Effective schools are able to maintain their professional teaching staffs.  Teacher longevity in the classroom is essential for student success.

Many effective schools also provide student mentors.  Teachers work with targeted at-risk students who have continually performed poorly in the classroom, have a poor attendance record, or display signs of possibly dropping out of school.

&lt;big&gt;Q: What are Effective Teachers?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  Wong &amp; Wong (1999) state that &quot;An effective teacher has three characteristics defined as having positive expectations for student success, is an extremely good classroom manager, and knows how to design lessons for student mastery&quot; (pg. 64).  These three characteristics associated with an effective teacher are considered extremely important and must be put into place before an effective classroom can be achieved.  An effective teacher is able to establish a good working relationship with the students in his/her classroom.  This sound working relationship is essential.  Once this relationship is established, a teacher can expand the curriculum and provide a learning environment that allows students to grow to their fullest potential.  

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is a Safe and Orderly Environment?&lt;/big&gt;

A: The Student Wellbeing Branch (2006) states that safe schools are effective schools.  Safe schools include a definition of bullying, an anti-bullying policy, and strategies for schools and parents on prevention and management. Students need to be educated in a safe haven.  Without this, learning will not take place.  Parents, students, teachers and administrators must work together to establish sensible and workable guidelines and daily procedures.  All teachers must buy into the process and be consistent.  There should be few rules, but many procedures for students to follow.    

&lt;big&gt;Q: What is Classroom Management?&lt;/big&gt;

A: Effective schools have teachers who are effective with their classroom management skills.  Classroom management is the ability of a teacher to organize everyday tasks, lessons, and assignment in such a way that students are actively engaged throughout the class period.  Wong, H., &amp; Wong, R., (1999) states that &quot;classroom management refers to all of the things that a teacher does to organize students, space, time, and materials so that instruction in content and student learning can take place&quot;(p. 26). Teachers in an effective school understand what must take place in the classroom in order for students to learn.  Classroom management defines how well a teacher is organized.  This includes easy transitioning from one activity to another, a variety of teaching activities, differentiation of instruction, student involvement in the lesson, and the lesson organize that the students are the active learners in the classroom.   

&lt;big&gt;Q: How to have effective planning?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  In effective schools everyone, including all professonal and classified staff members, have to develop a plan.  Those who do not plan find the school will have many behavior problems, off-tasked students, and general chaos (Breaux, 2003).   In order for a teacher to be plan effectively, the understanding of the student data is essential.  Once teachers and administrators understand and use the student data they will be able to plan for academic strengths and weaknesses of the class.  Data should be broken down into many categories to truly comprehend what is happening in a school.  This means teachers and administrators should look at test scores, attendance records of specific ethnic groups and student gender. This knowledge will give school personnel the ability to effectively plan their lessons and provide quality teaching strategies in the classroom.   

&lt;big&gt;Q: Is attitude everything?&lt;/big&gt;

A:  Attitude is everything!! In effective schools all building level personnel must have the attitude that all students will learn and be successful.  Breauz (2003) &quot;Students should be treated with dignity while teachers carry themselves as a professional at all times and be the most enthusiastic person in the classroom&quot; (p. 7).  No school can be effective if the teachers and administrators do not possess the attitude that all students will be successful.  No program, no lesson, no learning activity will be effective without the presence of a good attitude.

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Foundations_and_Assessment_of_Education/Edition_1/Foundations_Table_of_Contents/Chapter_9/Content_Articles/9.5.2


&lt;big&gt;Q: How the community is affected?&lt;/big&gt;

A: Good school and community relations are an essential need to establish an effective school environment.  Teachers and students must feel the support of their community.  Dunlap &amp; Alva (1999) discuss &quot;Why is parent involvement so highly valued? Research shows that a correlate of increased levels of parent involvement is an increase in student achievement (Epstein, 1995; Flaxman &amp; Inger, 1992; Hickman, Greenwood, &amp; Miller, 1995), as well as improved student attendance and reduced dropout rates (Berger, 1991; Greenwood &amp; Hickman, 1991). These are desirable outcomes from an &quot;educentric&quot; perspective, however they fall short of fully addressing the National Educational Goal to &quot;increase parental involvement and participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic growth of children&quot; (p. 1).  Community involvement is needed when talking about effective schools.  It behooves school personnel to involve their community in their academic world.  Schools should understand the academic needs of the community and incorporate programs that will allow students to either continue with their education or enter the world of work.  When students graduate and have nothing to look towards in their immediate future, then there is a lack of communication taking place between the two entitites.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Imagine, you just walked across the stage with the rest of your class. You find yourself thinking what to do with your degree in education. You could always try to find a job teaching in the local high school. Once you have found a job you will have a certain idea in your head about how you want to run your classroom. This chapter will discuss some of the different opstacles you might face in your classroom. Whether it be the way that your students learn or how to handle children with disabilities. This chater willl also discuss the differences between discovery learning and direct instruction. Also in this chapter we will touch on topics such as whether teachers are &quot;born&quot; or made&quot;. One of the most important topics in the chapter talks about the high expectations for all students, and not expecting less from some students and less from other students.

&lt;Big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;Big/&gt;

----
Education in the news these days is scary. Budgets being cut, loss of teaching jobs, lack of programs, increased classroom sizes are some of the main topics.  We must ask ourselves, &quot;where does this leave our children?&quot; 

Unfortunately, too much emphasis seems to be placed on standardized testing and not enough on creative curriculums.  Along with a generation of students who are Internet savvy, give &quot;old-school&quot; teachers a new hurdle to overcome.  Teachers are required to teach to a test.  However, time constraints do not leave time to ensure that students understand the material and retain the information.  Teachers must constantly find new and effective methods to present the material.  Because the computer/electronic age does not allow for a laissez-faire style of teaching, students are subjected to a more rapid-fire teaching.  As teaching and learning change, the education system must be revamped to ensure that teachers have all the tools necessary to be effective in this new generation classroom.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Big&gt;'''Characteristics of an effective teacher'''&lt;Big/&gt;

----
Keeping up to date with new technology has made a major impact on the art of becoming an effective teacher and rising to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  The challenge of becoming an effective teacher is to teach students using a variety of methods.  One professor at Kent State suggests, &quot;using classroom parties to teach students about measurement.&quot; (McLean, J., 2009).  There is a new course at Kent State this year, according to Jackie McLean, that &quot;is designed to help future English teachers learn how to use new technology in their classrooms...students will learn how to use blogs, wikis, podcasts and Nings&quot;( McLean, J., 2009).  In this age of technology, in order to effectively teach and reach students on their levels, teachers must keep up with the times and keep learning about new things themselves so that they can provide a quality education to their students. 

National Board Certification helps recognize &quot;effective&quot; teachers, who have advanced in their profession.  Kurt Landgraf, President and CEO of Educational Testing Service (ETS), states teachers must have &quot;commitment to students and learning; knowledge of subject matter and pedagogy; management and monitoring of student learning; systematic thinking about classroom practice and learning from experience; and participation in learning communities&quot;. (Landgraf, K., 2009)

                      &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #00A550;

                        HENRY B. ADAMS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Big&gt;'''Accountability Measures'''&lt;Big/&gt;
----
&lt;font color=&quot;#&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;In 2002, former President Bush signed into law, an accountability Act to promote equal education for all called the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot;. (Wikipedia, 2009).  Under this act, teachers and schools are being held to a higher standard when it comes to test scores. In order for schools to receive federal funding, students must show an improvement in their test scores. The ball is placed back in the court of the educators. Their effectiveness at teaching the required subjects to promote understanding and greater retention of knowledge to succeed on required tests is mandated at the federal, state, and local level.

In the news, President Obama is taking on the challenge of fixing the American education system by expanding on the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot;, called the &quot;Federal School Turn-Around Program&quot; (MMIX. The Associated Press, 2009).   According to Associated Press education writer, Libby Quaid, &quot;President Barack Obama intends to use $5 billion to prod local officials to close failing schools and reopen them with new teachers and principals&quot;.  (Quaid, L. 2009).  This sends a clear message to all teachers and schools, that they must improve or face the consequences of losing their jobs. 

The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an organization that measures accountability in teachers.  The NBPTS is an organization that measures what teachers should know in order to teach effectively, before becoming certified. It has been nationally recognized as one of the best organizations to answer the question of effective teachers.  

Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, takes his message of education standards on the road when he speaks at a forum organized by the White House on June 9, 2009.  He praises the NBPTS and proclaims, &quot;We need a critical mass of National Board Certified Teachers. These are the best teachers who set a very high bar”. (National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), 2008)
 
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Big&gt;'''Helping teachers become effective'''&lt;Big/&gt;

----
Keeping this in mind, are teachers solely to blame or our school districts failing teachers by not providing adequate resources and environments to teach? The George Mason University in Virginia along with other school districts, developed a network called ''The New Science Teachers' Support Network'', whose main goal is to &quot;help uncertified science teachers succeed at teaching and remain in the profession.&quot; (Sterling, D. &amp; Frazier, W., 2008, p. 1).  After researching different aspects that teachers face, they found that part of the problem of retaining effective teachers is because the teachers do not get the support they need from the administration whether it is in resources, the classroom environment, or leeway for curriculum to be taught.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Big&gt;'''Evaluating an effective Teacher'''&lt;Big/&gt;

----
How can we tell if a teacher is effective? Are there set standards that measure teacher effectiveness? Should we have a federally mandated set of standards that measure teacher effectiveness?  Since the NCLB was introduced, many states have been scrambling to provide their interpretation of higher standards for education, proven records of teacher effectiveness as shown in test scores, and worthiness of federally funded monies to provide much-needed sources for their schools.  However, how can we be sure that they are not inflating their competency in order to receive the compensation for improvement?

Kevin Carey argues that &quot;requiring every state, district or school to approach professional development [for teachers] in the same way, makes little sense.&quot; (Carey, K. 2006) He basis his theory on the fact that our students are not a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; type of learners.

The New York Times released the statistics for the year in New York City's public schools and showed a big improvement in math.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg &quot;trumpeted the results as evidence that mayoral control had produced revolutionary improvements and brought city students within spitting distance of state averages after years of mediocrity.&quot; (Hernandez, J. 2009)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;Big&gt;'''Concluding thoughts'''&lt;Big/&gt;

----

We all have our own preconceived notions about what makes effective teaching, but it does not always coincide with what the federal government says we should be doing to promote learning with high standards.  However, do we have a right to throw out creativity in favor of higher test scores? Everyone learns differently and at different rates. Do we want to have a future society of robotic humans? Do we want individuals who have been pushed throughout their school years to accelerate at the same speed and course? Or do we want to have a future of individuals that are in constant motion to learn new things and ways to accomplish them? That is the question we should be answering right now.

'''What makes an effective teacher?  Teachers, parents, and administrators alike have been asking that question for many years and the truth of the matter, is that there is no one answer.  The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) has issued a report entitled &quot;What Makes a Teacher Effective?&quot;  .http://www.ncate.org/public/teachereffective.asp?ch=48  NCATE found evidence that well-prepared teachers are not only more knowledgeable and more likely to remain in teaching but that they also produce higher student achievement.  California State University at Northridge's article &quot;Teachers for a New Era&quot;, 2006, lists 8 tenets of an effective teacher and a list of 14 practices and skills that effective teachers utilize.   http://www.csun.edu/tne/effective%20teaching%20jan%2006%20FINAL.pdf 

'''How do I become an effective teacher?  That's a really good question!  There are two thought provoking articles entitled &quot;Are Teachers Born or Made?&quot; in this chapter. Interestingly, how a teacher received their certification has little relationship to how effective they were in raising student's scores according to a study of 10,000 New York City teachers after six years of test results.  (Keller, 2006).'''''

'''Direct Instruction &quot;is a model for teaching that emphasizes well-developed and carefully planned lessons designed around small learning increments and clearly defined and prescribed teaching tasks.&quot; (National Institute for Direct Instruction, 2009).  Direct instruction is the most common way to teach using lectures, textbooks and presentations to provide information directly to the student.  The teacher has a specific purpose and the lesson is planned out.  

'''Discovery Learning, according to Rezak, (2009) is a &quot;powerful instructional approach that guides and motivates learners to explore information and concepts in order to construct new ideas, identify new relationships, and create new models of thinking and behavior&quot;.  Examples of discovery learning include interactive and hands on experiences such as planting and growing seeds into plants.'''

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt; '''What is differentiated instruction and why is it important?  ''' &lt;/font color&gt; ==


'''Differentiated Instruction is defined as recognizing that students come into the classroom with varying degrees of background knowledge, readiness, language, learning preferences, interests and abilities.  Methods of differentiated instruction include whole class discussion, group, pair and individual work. (Hall, 2007).    Differentiated instruction is important because it is a proactive teaching approach that seeks to meet the individual needs of students and maximize their learning success.  The flexible teacher seeks to adjust the curriculum and presentation of material to the differing learners rather than expecting the learners to adjust themselves to the curriculum.  Per  Ellis and Worthington, 1994, differentiated instruction practices have been validated in teaching research conducted from the mid 1980's to the present.

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt; '''Why is cooperative learning important in a classroom?  ''' &lt;/font color&gt; ==

[[File:Children reading 1940.jpg]]

'''Cooperative Learning is defined as &quot;the collaboration on a task by a small group of students who resolve differences of opinion, share responsibility, consider one another's ideas, and work toward common goals&quot;. (Berk, 2008)  By creating groups of students in a classroom with varying abilities, knowledge and background, students typically strengthen their classmate's weaknesses and work together toward a common goal.  Cooperative learning is important in the classroom for several reasons.  Students are forced to talk openly with each other.  Students must depend on each other.  Each member of a group is held accountable for a portion of the assignment.  Interpersonal skills are developed and members reflect on how well they worked with each other. (A Guide to Cooperative Learning, 2008).  Some examples of cooperative learning have been developed by Dr. Spenser Kagan called Kagan Structures. (Kagan, 2008)  One of these includes  RoundRobin, where each learner takes a turn orally presenting the material that they have learned.  Jigsaw, developed by Elliot Aronson, Professor Emeritus at the University of California in Santa Cruz, places students into groups with various social and ethnic differences each with the same goal to succeed, and so the hostility becomes muted as the students are forced to work together to achieve success.'''

==&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;&gt; '''Should I have high expectations for my students in my classroom?   ''' &lt;/font color&gt; ==

'''The Pygmalion effect or self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when a student performs how their teacher expects them to perform.  This theory can have a far-reaching effect on every student's learning achievement. Rosenthal and Jacobson published a study in 1968 that took place in a public elementary school.  They gave the students an intelliegence test at the beginning of the school year and told the teachers that several students had been identified as being able to make rapid, above-average intellectual progress in the coming year.  In actuality, Rosenthal and Jacobson randomly picked these student's names and any differences between these children and the rest of the class existed only in the teachers' heads. (Newman and Smith, 1999).  A second intelligence test was administered at the end of the year. The students who had been predicted to make accelerated progress showed, on the average, an increase of more than 12 points on their IQ scores, compared to an increase of 8 points among the rest of the students The teachers' subjective assessments, also indicated that these &quot;special&quot; students were better behaved, more curious, had greater chances for future success, and were friendlier than their counterparts. Rosenthal and Jacobson concluded that a self-fulfilling prophecy was at work. Their teachers had unconsciously encouraged the performance they expected to see. They spent more time with these students and were more enthusiastic about teaching them and unintentionally showed more warmth to them. (Newman and Smith, 1999).  

'''There are two major effects of the self-fulfilling prophecy, the Golem Effect and the Galatea Effect and describes how teacher prejudices can affect a student's performance. (Rubie-Davies, et al.)  The Golem effect is the negative impact on student's performance that results from low teacher expectations towards them. Simply put, low teacher expectations lead to low student achievement (Rubie-Davies, et al.) The Galatea effect is the positive impact on a student's performance that results when a teacher expects great things from a student and the student rises to meet these expectations.  (Rubie-Davies, et al.) To learn more about the Golem and Galatea effects in the classroom and how they can affect student's performance, visit articles 10.6.1 and 10.6.2 entitled &quot;High Expectations for All Students&quot;.'''

* Readers should be able to identify three factors that influence teacher expectations among student populations.

* Readers should understand how expectations are variable for a given student, regardless of learning ability.

* Given an example, readers should be able to identify realistic and unrealistic expectations of students with cognitive disabilities.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



== '''Background of Topic''' ==

Prior to students stepping into a classroom, teachers have already begun to formulate expectations of not only the individual student, but perhaps the entire class.  Recent studies have shown that teachers have both high and low expectations for all students and there is a great possibility that these expectations are teacher centered (Rubie-Davies, 2006).  According to Brophy's study (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006)) there is a +/-5% achievement difference per year based on student reaction to teacher expectations.  Throughout a student's academic career this would add up to a significant impact on overall achievement.

Factors that influence teacher expectations are often socio-economic, race, or gender biased. However, many also formulate expectations based on a student's achievement level.  Weinstein ''et al.'' (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) used the ''Teacher Treatment Inventory'' to investigate student perceptions of the differential treatment of classmates considered to be high and low achievers.  Based on response, students felt that teachers had a positive relationship and greater interaction with high achieving students compared to low achieving students.  

Contrary to Wienstein's research, Babad (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) has shown that teachers felt they show more compassion and emotional support for low achievers.  Babad (as cited in Rubie-Davies, 2006) discovered that students perceive these interactions as being exaggerated and pretentious.  Perceptions such as these lead to the formation of unfair expectations.

Students with cognitive disabilities are held to a different level of expectations based on their  individual abilities.  In the following interviews, we will learn how a fifth grade student with a learning disability perceives himself in his classroom and discusses his feelings about his teacher's expectations of himself and his classmates.  His mother shares her personal expectations as well as her opinion on past and current teacher expectations of her son.  Lastly, his fifth grade teacher will share insights on general teacher expectations as well as those specific to this student.

== '''Introduction of Experts''' ==

Teacher expectations of students with learning disabilities can range from non-existent to mediocre to abnormally high.  In the following interviews you will be introduced to a fifth grade student, his mother, and his homeroom teacher.  

'''Harry R.*''' is a fifth grade student in a local elementary school.  In 2007, Harry was tested and diagnosed with moderate dyslexia and dysgraphia.  '''Dyslexia''' is a learning disability in which people have difficulty with specific language skills including reading, writing, and spelling.  Individuals are poor spellers and writers, and often confuse letters and numbers when they are reading.  According to the International Dyslexia Foundation (2008) the primary issue is word recognition and reading fluency.  Dyslexia is often passed from generation to generation (IDA, 2008).  '''Dysgraphia''', a learning disability that affects how well students use written language and is characterized by disabled handwriting, often accompanies dyslexia (IDA, 2008).

During the primary years (K-2) Harry struggled with reading and was brought to tears on many occasions.  In second grade, his parents made the decision to relocate him from a private school to the current public school he attends in order to receive the services of a reading specialist.  Harry describes his struggles with reading, what he thinks about past and present teacher expectations, and what changes he has seen in himself since his diagnosis.

'''Gloria R'''., Harry's mother, has been a continuous supporter of her son throughout his academic struggles.  She speaks of her own expectations for Harry as well as comments on past and present teacher expectations for both Harry and all elementary students.

'''Mrs. R. Crowder''' teaches Harry Writing, Reading, and Math.  She has been teaching for forty years and has developed a very specific set of expectations for all of her students.  Mrs. Crowder shares a few of her general expectations as well as those specific to Harry and his abilities.

(*Named changed to protect student's identity.)

== '''Student Interview''' ==

'''Question''':  Tell me about what it was like learning to read.

'''Harry R.: ''' It was very hard.  Sometimes it felt like I was dumb.  I couldn't understand all the words on the paper.  They looked mixed up.  As soon as I would figure out a word, I couldn't remember what it meant.  Writing was hard for me.  I couldn't spell words so I just wrote down the way I thought they were spelled. 
 

'''Question:'''  What are some things that your teachers told you while you were having a tough time?

'''Harry R.: ''' My teacher in second grade told me I needed to work harder.  I could be a better reader if I really worked at it.  I wanted to give up.  When I asked for help they told me I needed to look at it more and I would understand it.  Everyone else in my class was reading chapter books but I wasn't.  There were too many words and the print was really little.


'''Question:'''  Did you ever think something was wrong with you?

'''Harry R.: ''' I thought I was broken.  Like my brain was defective and it couldn't be fixed.


'''Question:'''  What are some things that you did to help you improve your reading before you found out you were dyslexic?

'''Harry R.: ''' Well, that's easy.  You were my tutor for 2 years.  


'''Question:'''  Do you remember those things I kept making you do over and over again?

'''Harry R.:'''  Yeah.  Phonics flash cards, games, tracing letters with my finger, learning those words on the ring, grouping words with like sounds.  Lots of stuff.  Oh, you taught me how to write in cursive too.


'''Question:'''  A few summers ago you were tested and found out that you were dyslexic.  How did this make you feel?

'''Harry R.: ''' At first I thought it was a bad thing.  But then I realized it was a good thing.  It felt like a giant weight had been lifted off of me.  I realized that I wasn't really broken and I could improve.


'''Question:'''  I helped you get a 504 plan before the beginning of fourth grade.  How has that helped you?

'''Harry R.: ''' All of my tests are read to me except for reading.  (I think that's weird don't you?)  I take plain English math tests too.  My teachers give me more time on my work and I get to work in a little group so I won't be distracted.  My grades have gotten better.  I have made Honor Roll since the beginning of fourth grade. Overall I think I am a better student.


'''Question:'''  Do you think that your parents have high expectations for you academically? 

'''Harry R.: ''' What's &quot;academically?&quot;

'''Question:'''  You know, like school work.  Do you feel pressure to do well in school?

'''Harry R.: ''' Yeah.  Momma still worries if I get a bad grade.  I guess she knows I can do the work but sometimes I still get confused and make mistakes.  Mrs. Crowder says I rush and forget to read directions closely.  Then I make careless mistakes.


'''Question:'''  Can you see a difference in the kinds of expectations Mrs. Crowder has for you than your past teachers?  Does she expect more or less of you than your classmates in spite of your dyslexia?

'''Harry R.: ''' Mrs. Crowder pushes me to do my best because she knows I can do the work.  I am really good in Math and got a 600 on my math test in 4th grade.  I know she expects me to get a 600 this year.  I think I will.  She pushes me in writing too.  I hate to write and this year I had to take the writing SOL test.  I was nervous but I could use my Franklin Speller.  I think I passed.  And you know I won honorable mention in the &quot;Letters for Literature&quot; contest this year.  

I think she expects the same of me that she expects of everyone else in my class. Mrs. Crowder supports me and gives me confidence in myself.

== '''Parent Interview''' ==

'''Question:'''  Harry was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2007.  Before he was formally diagnosed, had you decided &quot;this is it, this is all he will ever be able to do?&quot;  Did you make peace with what appeared to be diminished learning abilities and lower your expectations of Harry academically?

'''Gloria R.: ''' Alan (Harry's father) and I have never given up on Harry.  There were times in the beginning when our frustration matched or rivaled Harry's.  I felt helpless but I knew that there was something wrong with him that could be fixed.  He had so many other interests and excelled in specific areas.  He is very inquisitive. Harry loves science and nature...he loves to be outside.  He can tear apart or put together anything.  But he just couldn't get the hang of reading.  I  have always felt that Harry was very intelligent.  So no, I have never lowered or considered lowering my expectations of him. 


'''Question:'''  Did any of Harry's previous teachers make excuses for his reading difficulties?  Do you think they had lowered their expectations due to their observations?

'''Gloria R.: ''' Oh definitely, definitely.  His first grade teacher kept telling me that he was just developing a little slower than the other students.  She said that little boys are slower at learning some things than little girls. Looking back, I honestly think she was using that as an excuse because she didn't want his reading troubles to be a reflection on her as a teacher.  

Before we changed schools in second grade, Harry's teacher kept telling us that he needed to work harder.  The problem was that he worked so hard with so few results that both he and I would end up in tears every night because of the  constant struggling.  Again, I think his teacher didn't want Harry's reading to be a reflection on her as a teacher.  When we decided to enroll him in public school, his teacher broke down and said she was a failure.  I guess I can see where she was coming from but Alan and I were only doing what was best for Harry.


'''Question:'''  Once Harry was diagnosed, his academic performance began to change as did his attitude.  Do you think that it is fair to say that both you and his teachers increased your expectations of Harry?

'''Gloria R.: ''' For sure.  After Harry got his 504 in place everything began turning around.  Once he saw that he could be successful his confidence level soared.  He was excited to go to school everyday.  He put forth more effort than ever before.  It was like his &quot;want to&quot; switch was turned on.  We began to see a whole new child.  I always had high expectations for Harry in school, but once I saw him bask in the light of success I wanted him to keep it up.  I would like to think that he doesn't feel that Alan and I pressure him to do well.  It's just that I thought it was always there... now show us what you are made of.  

As his teacher last year, you pushed Harry to do his best.  I always found it refreshing how you expect the same from all of your students.  I remember what you told your class at the beginning of the year:  &quot;Try your best and you will be successful.&quot;  You never singled out a specific group or child, but you looked for the best in all of your students. And they tried their best not only for you and the other fourth grade teachers, but for themselves. Harry has told me that sometimes when something was really hard he didn't want to give up. It was important to him to do his best.  Fortunately, that drive has traveled with him to fifth grade.


'''Question:'''  In your opinion, should and do teachers formulate student expectations based on socio-economic, race, gender, or cognitive ability biases or should student expectations be equal for all learners?

'''Gloria R.: ''' I do believe that there are teachers who build their expectations according to the type of children they teach.  A child that has a horrible home life with little parental support may not be expected to be as successful as a child living in a stable environment.  To me that means you don't give up on them or expect any less.  Instead you need to find ways to bridge the gap.  Discover ways that you, as the teacher, and other school staff can help this child.  The color of a child's skin or whether they are a boy or a girl shouldn't matter either.  

As far as a child with a cognitive disability is concerned, I think that all children should be held to certain expectations.  A child with a severe mental or physical disability may not be able to learn as quickly or as much as another student, but they do have the ability to learn on some level.  Those are the students who often try the hardest.  I know that Harry's disability makes him unique.  Even with a learning disability, his teachers hold him to the same general behavior and academic expectations as they hold other fifth graders.

== '''Teacher Interview''' ==

'''Question:'''  In your opinion, should and do teachers formulate student expectations based on socio-economic, race, gender, or cognitive ability biases?

'''Mrs. Crowder:'''  I do not believe that a teacher should modify student expectations based on a specific set of conditions.  An African-American female and a white male should not be held to any set of expectations based on skin color or gender.  A child receiving free lunch is no different from a child paying for his lunch each day.  I expect all of my students to try their best academically.  Lots of teachers concentrate on academic expectations and forget about behavior.  In fifth grade I remind my students to be good decision makers because they are role models to the younger children.  Making poor decisions directly impacts student behavior, which ultimately impacts learning.

I believe that children with cognitive disabilities should be held to the same expectations as other students, within reason.  Depending upon the severity of the disability, it is impossible to expect a child to perform under the same standards as a normal learner.  The same disability may also influence the child's behavior, which limits expectations.  Factors including severity of the disability, motivation of the learner, and the willingness to teach all learners will dictate a teacher's expectations.  

Do teachers formulate expectations based on biases?  Sure they do and early on I was just as guilty as the rest. I like to think that in the past forty years I have honed my expectations as a teaching professional.  


'''Question:'''  What are some expectations that you have of all of your students?

'''Mrs. Crowder:'''  I expect my students to try their best, be positive role models, treat others fairly, tell the truth, and show respect to both peers and adults.  I expect my students have an open mind with which they learn many new things.  Of course with the SOLs, I expect my students to learn the concepts necessary to be successful on standardized tests.  The outcomes are not always what I would like them to be, but I am happy if they tried their best.  Effort is the biggest part of the battle.


'''Question:'''  Let's talk about Harry R.  Is he a unique example of a student with a learning disability?  Do you modify your expectations of him in any way?

'''Mrs. Crowder:'''  Harry is definitely a unique case.  I do not hold him to the same expectations in Reading and Writing as I do my other students because of his dyslexia.  His grades are above average in all subjects, more so in Math and Science.  In fact, he was tested for the gifted and talented program and I am recommending him for Honors Math in sixth grade.  Aside from his reading difficulties, Harry is an above average student.  

Looking back, I suppose I do modify my expectations of Harry.  I know he has great ability.  Often I get frustrated with him because he does not take his time, gets confused, and makes careless mistakes.  He does great things.  His writing has improved tremendously and he did pass his Writing SOL test.  That's something that we all were biting our nails over!  I encouraged him to enter the writing contest earlier in the year and he chose to write to Henry Winkler.  He is the author of the ''Hank Zipzer'' series.  He won an honorable mention for Virginia.  His self confidence soared due to his success.  

One of Harry's loves is magic.  This entire school year he has toted around a copy of a biography on Harry Houdini.  I mean, this is a high school level read!  It took him six months to read that book, but he was determined to finish it.  This year he performed for the second time in our school talent show, incorporating ideas and tricks from Houdini's biography.  His determination is unbelievable!

Undoubtably, yes! I expect huge things from Harry now and in the future.

== '''Commentary''' ==
Harry R. opens our eyes to how teacher expectations can vary based on an individual.  Although he has a learning disability, his personal expectations are very high.  He bases these expectations on feedback from his teachers and his parents.  Harry uses the word &quot;pushes&quot; when he describes Mrs. Crowder motivational strategies.  While he recognizes that extra push, he still believes that he is treated like every other student in his class.  I perceive that extra push to be symbolic of a higher level of teacher expectations.

Gloria R. speaks to the expectations of Harry's past and present teachers.  She notes that in earlier grades some teacher's expectations were lowered for Harry and makes a connection to teacher performance.  This reiterates research that shows that expectations are often teacher centered (Rubie-Davies, 2006).  Gloria R. recognizes the connection between Harry's academic improvement and the increase in expectations from his teachers.

As a veteran teacher, Mrs. Crowder shares a few of the general expectations that she holds for all of her students regardless of their learning ability.  She recognizes that Harry had diminished reading and writing abilities and does not hold him to the same academic expectations in those areas.  Harry's giftedness in other areas, in conjunction with his ability and drive, have lead her to hold him to a higher level of expectations.

In my opinion, it is important for new and current teachers to formulate expectations not based on bias, but on the student as an individual.  All students, regardless of achievement labels, should be held to similar general expectations. The exception to this should be based only on the severity of a cognitive disability and its impact on learning and behavior.  Teachers must think of the student first and ignore self interests.

3.  Nancy is a fourth grade student who has a specific learning disability which makes it difficult for her to learn in math class.  Her grades are average to above average. She loves to read and excels in art.  Nancy is a hard worker with great ability and puts forth her best effort in the classroom each day.  Given this information, the teacher's expectations of Nancy are most likely to be:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;55%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #B5EAAA;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;B. Extremely high because of her giftedness in art.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;C. Lower in math due to her learning disability, otherwise the same as her classmates.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;D. Very low because she has a learning disability.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


















4.  Marcus, an African-American twelve year old, is mildly mentally retarded and suffers from cystic fibrosis.  He attends a public school and is taught in the least restrictive environment (LRE).  He loves to go to P.E. class with the students in his homeroom and is well behaved.  Although he has limited physical and cognitive abilities, Marcus always puts forth his best effort and has a wide smile on his face.  Which of the following best describes the expections that Marcus' P.E. teacher should have for him based on his abilities? 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #B5EAAA;
border: solid 10px #8BB381; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=left&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;A. The teacher doesn't want Marcus in the class at all because he is afraid that he will get injured.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;B. The teacher has the same expectations for Marcus that he has for the entire class.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;C. The teacher should have high expectations because of his enthusiasm for P.E.

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;D. The teacher should have lower expectations for Marcus regarding physical activities due to his disabilities, but the same behavioral expectations as the rest of the class.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;big&gt;What does classroom management consist of?

How does someone have effective classroom management?&lt;/big&gt;

                                 [[File:powerful.JPG|300px]]


All of these questions and more will be answered when reading through chapter elevent, classroom management.  This chapter covers many topics that can be viewed trhough In the News, Experts Take Sides, Chapter FAQ's, and The Scoop from Someone Who Kows.  In the News discusses disciplinary Deficits, Classroom Management techniques used by teachers that seemed to be effectived, and technology.  Using technology to reach students even when they are at home and may need assistance on homework or have questions.  Experts Take Sides discusses in depth interventionism, non-interventionism, and interactionalism.  Not to worry if these terms are not familiar because our authors have done a great job of taking the reader through the definitions and completing a full understanding of these words.

Once the reader has reached the Chapt FAQ's there is a full synopsis of denfinitons/concepts/terms that are discussed having to do with classroom management.  At the end of this detailed over view there is brief quiz.  The last special feature article is The SCoopr from Someone Who Knows.  The reader is taken through many different issues daling with classroom management such as classroom climate, Effective Class, Reaching Students, and Establishing Discipline.  Ones the special feature articles are completed there are many content articles that are just as useful and full of information on classroom management. 

Classroom Management is always a concern in every classroom.  It is important for teachers and administration to have a good understanding of what is needed to have good classroom management.  This chapter provides you with a great base knowledge and provides ideas and topics for the reader to try or research even further.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Learning Targets &lt;/font&gt;==



Students should be able to:


&lt;ul&gt; 1. Differentiate between the interventionist, non-interventionist, and interactionalist discipline models.&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt; 2. Identify characteristics from the interventionist model. &lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt; 3.  Identify characteristics from the non-interventionist model. &lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt; 4.  Identify characteristics from the interactionalist model. &lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt; 5. Choose the most effective model depending on the circumstances of the classroom.  &lt;/ul&gt;



== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;==


According to Buckley and Cooper, the responsibility of teaching is divided into two parts: instruction and management.  While it is the responsibility of the teacher to facilitate a child in learning, he or she must also know how to effectively manage a classroom.  &quot;Mastery cannot take place where chaos, disrespect, and unhealthy attitudes exist&quot; (Perry, Taylor, 1982).  It becomes difficult for both the teacher and student to operate in an environment where order is lacking.  Rudolph Drekurs, an assistant to Psychologist Alfred Adler studied teachers and identified four theories behind misbehavior: attention seeking, the struggle for power, revenge, and using disability as an excuse  (Hyman, Bilius, Dennehy, Feldman, Flanagan, Lovoratano, Maital, &amp; McDowell, 1979). Therefore, proper methods must be in place to keep classrooms controlled, engaged, and eager to learn.  Particularly for inclusive classrooms of today, it is imperative that teachers be prepared for students from all backgrounds, differing skill sets, and varying behaviors.  Though instructors may display characteristics of all three, it is believed that predominance occurs in one of three discipline models: interventionism, non-interventionism, and interactionalism.  The question is which discipline style is viewed most effective?



== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Rules/Reward - Punishment or '''Interventionist'''&lt;/font&gt;==


Interventionists believe that environment and/or external-conditioning ultimately shape the development of a child (Sert, 2007).  As a result, these instructors assume full control of the students' environment by setting strict rules and following through with consequences if inappropriate behavior occurs.  These teachers generally have more experience, are older, and place emphasis on authority. Their expectations for the pupil are made clear.  Routines are well established, and systems well organized. Interventionists focus on modifying behavior through reinforcement, conditioning, and material tactics to reverse unacceptable behavior (Witcher, Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, Collins, James, &amp; Minor, 2008). This model may prove beneficial for children with behavioral problems who require routine, clarity, and clear expectations to perform well.



== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Relationship - Listening or '''Non-Interventionist'''&lt;/font&gt;==


Non-Interventionists share a more humanistic approach.  They believe students' behavior is a direct reflection of internal processes that need to be expressed.  These internal feelings are a means of focus in understanding a child's development.  Unlike the Interventionist style, minimal authority is administered, providing the student more control of their environment and behavior.  These teachers tend to be empathetic, and are more willing to compromise.  Their approach is supportive vs. authoritative.  Indirect tactics such as visual cues are given to encourage the individual to self-correct unacceptable behavior (Witcher, et al., 2008).  This model may prove beneficial to children who have an established locust of control, and can be trusted to self-regulate.  It affords them freedom, and is most rewarding.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Confronting - Contracting or '''Interactionalist'''&lt;/font&gt;==


Interactionalists maintain a balance between the interventionists and non-interventionists extremes (Sert, 2007).  They lie somewhere in the middle, with the idea that development is a direct result of &quot;interaction between internal and external forces&quot; (Witcher, et al., 2008).  With this style, there is a constant interaction between the teacher and the misbehaved pupil. The responsibility of behavioral control is a shared task between teacher and student (Sert, 2007). This relationship is key in holding the student accountable for his or her own actions eventually facilitating independence. If and when appropriate, the instructor will confront unacceptable behavior by taking into account both the internal and external factors.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA2268&quot; face=&quot;&gt;The Most Effective?&lt;/font&gt;==


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9AFEFF;
border: solid 10px #CA226B; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;big&gt; &quot;Studies which explore learner autonomy and brain research support the main assumption behind the interactionalist approach.  There is evidence that students who are supposed to share responsibility with the teacher hold clear conceptions of good teachers and what specific behaviors they should have&quot; (Sert, 2007).&lt;/big&gt; 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


In addition, Thomas Gunning reported that highly effective teachers exhibited exceptional organizational skills, established efficient routines, and instilled &quot;a sense of responsibility&quot; in their students. As a result, students' learned self-regulation. They became less passive and more interactive in classroom activities (Gunning,2008). This is a prime example of the interactionalists approach. To extract the desired behavior from students, attention to both the external forces (classroom environment) and internal forces (child's sense of responsibility) were tended to. As observed, classroom management plays a pivotal role in the journey to becoming a highly effective teacher.  To achieve this desired outcome, an effectual discipline model must be in place. Ultimately, it is important to remember that every student varies with a different set of circumstances. Following assessment, it is up to the instructor as to what techniques he or she will pull from either extreme.  

Dr. Katherine Mitchem, a professor of special education at West Virginia University designed a series of strategy steps to facilitate instructors in their journey to becoming excellent classroom managers and ultimately &quot;highly effective teachers.&quot;   Mitchem promoted a balance between humanistic and assertive techniques reminiscent to those of an interactionalist. If followed, these techniques will support your efforts in achieving an effective experience for all parties involved.

== &lt;font color=&quot;#CA226B&quot; face=&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;==


To achieve proper levels of classroom management, a combined effort from both the instructor and student is required. A balance between the  extreme discipline styles is most desired to effectively manage a classroom and create a positive learning atmosphere.  Remember that each child is different and may require more from one discipline model vs. the other. Through trial and error the instructor will be able to identify techniques from each extreme to formulate a balanced approach in facilitating the student. &quot;People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care&quot; (Mitchem, 2005). Ultimately, reaching a student requires more than &quot;methods&quot; and &quot;approaches,&quot; they must know and understand that you believe in them.  Following these guidelines is sure to put you on the path to becoming a &quot;highly effective teacher&quot; !

'''Introduction'''

----
The news constantly informs us of current events that happen instantly. Since the introduction of the World Wide Web and cell phones, people have instant access to news every second. We rely heavily on news presentations or articles to be accurate and reliable as possible. However, sometimes news stations or sites have bias embedded within themselves. We as readers/listeners need to recognize bias and learn how to discard of it. Overall news that is delivered is helpful, insightful, and most of the time justified. It is what most of us wake up to in the morning and how we learn of life changing events. However, television has often been blamed, with justification for the increase in violence among children (Curwin &amp; Mendler, 2001).Various research has been performed on this topic and the results are staggering. Everyday we are related to news, either by telling it, posting it, or reading it. Fortunately, for educators, we have access to other teachers' postings, comments, and suggestions that enable us to become better at our profession. One of the greatest assets that we must possess is to have our classrooms in order. Today's technology allows us to manage our classroom easier while the suggestions of other educators enables us to have control. I was once told that if you do not have control over your classroom then you do not have a chance as an educator.


'''Disciplinary Deficit'''

----
Recently an excelling high school senior stated that classroom management needed to be improved in his school. This statement received high reguard from a retired high school teacher who was shocked at the boy's opinion. He pondered the thought of why classroom management was not getting enough attention. He came up with several reasons ranging from parental discipline to No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Here are some statements he made concerning his reasons, &quot;The partnerships that used to exist between teachers and parents are fast becoming a fading memory.&quot; &quot;Ironically, when school discipline is weakened to accommodate state and federal No Child Left Behind goals, students ultimately pay a great price for our acquiescence.&quot; (Udel, 2009). These are two powerful statements that are totally opposite of each other. One concerns parents while the other concerns state/federal guidelines. He also touched on the fact that elminating consequences is a problem for classroom management as well. If there are not any consequences then why not break the rules? Even though he sounded dishearted about the situation he still felt as though many educators are working hard to eliminate classroom disruptions and that not all classes have these problems. (Udel, 2009) Curwin &amp; Mendler (2001) stated that today's educators are dealing with a different type of student and parents are admitting they have no control over their children.They also found research that proved private schools to be better at educating than public schools because of their ability to maintain discipline.

&quot;There are impressive accomplishments taking place in our schools and there are many devoted and creative teachers, staff and students working together to make them happen. Certainly not all classes are marred by interruptions. However, we should have the wisdom to listen to our students when they tell us that there is a problem and the courage to act in their support.&quot;

'''Edward Udel'''
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''War &amp; Court'''

----
&lt;font color=&quot;#&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;Some educators may describe their classroom management practices as stern and compare them to other classrooms. However, I discovered two educators who had completely different terms. The first educator explained that she conducted court sessions in her classroom. One day every other week different students, who act as lawyers,defendants, and jury members, go to court. These court sessions were designed to have students monitor their own behaviors. It mocked the &quot;three strikes your out&quot; policy whereas the third appearance in court resulted in losing your role. The teacher stated the following, &quot;With roles, came the expectation of being above disruptive behavior.&quot; (Artiles, 2009) The second educator compared his class to war. His chief belief was that you must have your students on your side. He said that if you have 28 out of 30 students under control then you will not have discipline troubles.(Genghis, 2004) He also suggested having students fill out questionnaires at the beginning of school so you can get to know them. He said you can use this to your advantage in many different ways. These are two very different ways of implementing classroom control, but both seem to work well for the teacher. 
&lt;/font&gt;

(Genghis, 2004)
 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''Technology'''

----
Technology allows us to access more information from farther distances around the world. In modern classrooms you will find computers, smartboards, and other electronic devices that aid in different types of learning. Recently a community college in Oklahoma integrated Moodle(an online classroom management system, like blackboard) into the classroom. The Learning Resource Center director, Katherine Combs, stated &quot;This system keeps students and instructors connected, so that if a student is struggling with the material and the instructor is unavailable, he or she can connect with other students and/or additional resources from home.&quot; (Harper, 2009) LanSchool is a classroom management software provider that allows teachers to randomly select a student and start classes in seconds, not minutes. (PR-inside, 2009) The educator that mentioned war earlier in the article said that technology such as a camcorder, thermostat, and bull horn work efficiently to get your classroom under control. (Genghis, 2004)This just proves that there are '''many''' things that you can use in your classroom that would aid in management and control. One interesting study was performed on younger generation teachers and their technology abilities. It was initially thought that &quot;digital natives&quot; (the younger group that has grown up with technology) would be more comfortable using digital technology than previous generations. However, different research has shown this not to be true. Keep in mind that most of the teachers in the study were first year teachers with no experience. Even though they showed excellent social-communication skills using digital technology they still were unable to perform as well as others had expected them to. (Lei, 2009)

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FF0080;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&quot;Given the fact that digital natives, as students, are already playing an active role in using technology in classrooms, it seems reasonable to expect them to be more ready to use technology for teaching as preservice teachers than previous generations of teachers—the digital immigrants.

&lt;u&gt;Things to know about Classroom Management&lt;/u&gt;


Written By: Rebecca Burton

'''Learning Targets:'''

1. The student(s) should be able to describe the characteristics, theories, and arguments associated with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

2. The student(s) should be able to identify the different types of educational practices associated with classroom management: positive discipline, negative discipline, cooperative learning and brain based learning.

3. The student(s) should be able to define the key ideas outlined in the locus of control praise debate.

'''Chapter FAQs:'''

'''Q: What is positive discipline and what are some practices used in the classroom to implement it?'''

A: &quot;Positive discipline (or PD) is a discipline system used by schools that focuses on the positive points of behaviour&quot;(&quot;Positive Discipline and APA&quot;,2009). Some practices commonly used in the classroom to implement positive discipline include recognition and rewarding of good behaviors. Recognizing good behaviors can distract from the bad behaviors and may encourage students to engage in good behaviors to obtain rewards or the attention of the teacher. Having mutual respect for both teacher and student is a critical factor in successful positive discipline. Asking for students' input, using encouraging body language, ignoring actions that are undesirable, using consistency, encouraging children to redirect negative behaviors to positive behaviors, and making positive comments are all additional ways in which positive discipline can be implemented in the classroom (Doescher and Burt, 1995). 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
One professor at Old Dominion University, Katharine Kersey, created 101 principles of positive discipline to use in the classroom, at home, or wherever. Here is a link to Professor Katharine Kersey's Guide to 101 principles of positive discipline which provides more information of positive discipline and ways to implement it! http://www.odu.edu/~kkersey/101s/101principles.shtml.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



'''Q: What is negative discipline and what are some practices used in the classroom to implement it?
'''

A: &quot;Negative discipline can be described as punishment that denounces a child's behavior&quot;(&quot;Negative Discipline and APA&quot;, 2009). The use of negative discipline often involves consequences given for bad behaviors, and sometimes involves withholding rewards as well. There are many ways in which negative discipline is implemented in the classroom however the most common ways are demonstrated through the use of time-outs, referrals, suspensions, and even spankings. Withholding rewards is a common form of negative discipline as well. Withholding rewards often gives students the incentive to stop the undesired behaviors they are exhibiting because they seek the item(s)they are being prevented from having. Negative discipline is often seen as a last resort, after all forms of positive discipline and praise have been attempted. 

'''Q: What is intrinsic motivation and what are some examples?'''

A: Intrinsic motivation can be described as motivation that comes from within the student themselves. Some examples include feelings that drive the student to motivate themselves such as pride, enjoyability, sense of accomplishment and responsibility. Intrinsically motivated students often tend to push themselves harder when it comes to academics, especially on individual assignments. This is mainly because they feel that striving to be your personal best is what counts the most, and feel a great sense of responsibility and pride when they achieve their desired goals.Intrinsic motivation can be seen in other avenues outside the classroom as well such as the workplace, community projects, sports,games, and even in relationships.

'''Q: What are some arguments for intrinsic motivation?'''

A: Proponents argue that internally motivating factors that an individual possesses can often be considered an effective tool for learning. Intrinsic motivation can create excitement in students when learning new things, which in turn can cause them to look forward to learning new information in the future. There is also a greater sense of meaning and accomplishment in a student's academic performance and background due to a sense of personal accomplishment and responsibility. Proponents also argue that if a student is intrinsically motivated in the classroom,then they will most likely carry that sense of intrinsic motivation into other aspects of their life and into their future pursuits as well (DeCharms, 1968; Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978).

'''Q: What are some arguments against intrinsic motivation?'''

A: Opponents of intrinsic motivation believe that behaviors are instead motivated by extrinsic factors. A psychologist and researcher at Ohio State University, Steven Reiss, believes that there is &quot;no real evidence that intrinsic motivation even exists&quot;(Reiss, 2008). Opponents believe that extrinsic factors are more motivating because often they involve goals to strive for, such as a paycheck or other incentive, that motivates individuals to work harder than would intrinsic motivators. This is mainly due to the American society's importance placed on materialistic things and financial obtainment. Due to these factors, many individuals are motivated by external factors instead, causing them to base their behaviors on the material outcomes available to them. 

'''Q: What is Self Determination Theory and how is it related to intrinsic motivation?'''

A: Self Determination Theory, (STD), surfaced around thirty years ago and was primarily implemented through the research studies of Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. The general idea of their theory involves three basic needs that people must have in order to survive. These include: a sense of autonomy, the need for belonging, and also the need for competence (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2001). Self Determination Theory can be related to intrinsic motivation because both theories believe that the individual can motivate themselves into doing whatever task they need to accomplish. 

'''Q: What is extrinsic motivation and what are some examples?'''

A: &quot;Extrinsically motivated behavior is defined as engaging in an activity to obtain an outcome that is separable from the activity itself&quot; (DeCharms, 1968; Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978). Some examples of extrinsic motivation include: stickers, candy, gifts, money, and other physical materials that could be given as rewards for desirable behaviors. An example of extrinsic motivation can be seen in the picture below, where a teacher has given a female student the opportunity to play with a ball as a reward for her behavior in class.

[[File:Intrinsic_motivation.jpg|200px|center]]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''Q: What are some arguments for extrinsic motivation?'''

A: Proponents of extrinsic motivation believe that it is more effective than intrinsic motivation in situations where tasks are not appealing to students, or if the task itself is too difficult. Extrinsic motivators are also useful when students show little interest in a specific subject. If external motivators and rewards are offered, then the students may try harder resulting in a more positive outcome on the material (Stockdale &amp; Williams, 2004). Proponents also argue that extrinsic motivation will follow students most of their lives, because they will be able to apply extrinsic motivation to their jobs and other aspects of life. 

'''Q: What are some arguments against extrinsic motivation?'''

A: Opponents of extrinsic motivation believe that once the external reward is no longer present, then the motivation will disappear as well (Vockell, 2008). Some opponents also believe that extrinsic motivators are not actually motivators but instead are bribes given to encourage a desired behavior of the reward giver. Also, opponents warn that in some cases students may become too dependent on extrinsic rewards and therefore may not do well on certain tasks if there is a lack of external motivation. If a student is given a reward for every time he/she does well on an assignment, then that student is not feeling intrinsically motivated to try and do better on the next assignment because the student will only push themselves if they know they are guaranteed a reward at the end.

'''Q: What is Cooperative Learning and what are some examples?'''

A: Cooperative Learning involves small groups of students working together. When students engage in cooperative learning, they are resolving differing opinions, sharing equal responsibilities, considering opposing ideas, and working towards common goals (Berk, 2008). Students also demonstrate a willingness to observe and enhance weaknesses seen in their peers, mainly through their individual strengths.  Students begin to feel like a part of a team, rather than socially isolated and picked on. Cooperative learning is also an essential skill that most students will need as they pursue their academic and professional careers. Many employers and teachers look for in a student/employee for behaviors that are typical of cooperative learning. This is because many seek students/applicants who are able to work well with others, form independent ideas, and work together to achieve a common goal, such as a work goal for the week or a group assignment in a class. 

'''Q: What is Brain Based Learning and what are some examples of implementation?
'''

A: Brain Based Learning revolves around the idea that learning will be more effective for students if activities are conducted in an atmosphere compatible with the way the brain learns. The main principle states that learning will be more effective if the learner's environment is natural, challenging and non-threatening. Some examples of brain based learning include: lessons that are interactive, students having a personal meaningful challenge, and intensive analysis of different ways to approach a problem (Caine, 1991). Brain Based Learning follows the basic principle that learning must be conducted in an environment in which the student feels comfortable and not anxious so that the brain can be at optimal functioning. When the student is relaxed and not stressed, the student is more open to learning and retains the information better as a result. Therefore, it is often beneficial for students to learn in environments in which they can learn in the best way they individually can.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

'''Q: What are the key ideas of the Locus of Control praise debate?'''

A: One argument states that the giving of rewards inhibits the natural desires of the student because of the presence of the reward itself. The belief pertains to the student not wanting to succeed well in school due to a lack of personal responsibility, but instead does well in school because of the external rewards he/she will receive. However, rewards have been considered successful motivators as long as performance quality remains the basis for the rewards (Cameron &amp; Pierce, 1994). In contrast, it has been suggested that intrinsic motivation decreases over time with the use of external rewards, therefore creating a dependency on external motivators. If the student is consistently given external rewards, then when those rewards are taken away the student will experience difficulty in completing assignments.

&lt;big&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/big&gt;

As teachers, we all have educational philosophies in our minds pertaining to our classrooms.  How will the environment feel? What will it look like?  Classroom management means managing both student behavior and the physical learning environment. It is an important issue and is a concern for all teachers. We need to make sure that lessons run smoothly, despite disruptive behavior by students.

&lt;big&gt;'''Areas of Classroom Managemant'''&lt;/big&gt;
 
According to Karen Zauber, from the National Education Association, teachers need to consider four areas of classroom management:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establishing classroom climate - the look and feel of your room &lt;li&gt;Conducting class efficiently - managing time and students &lt;li&gt;Reaching all students - delivery, encouragement, teaching techniques &lt;li&gt;Establishing discipline - creating an atmosphere of consistency and mutual respect.&lt;/ol&gt;(Management Tips for New Teachers)

Research has shown that &quot;teachers' actions in their classrooms have twice the impact on student achievement as do school policies regarding curriculum, assessment, staff collegiality, and community involvement(Marzano, 2003a).&quot;  One of the teacher's most important jobs is managing the classroom effectively.  Students cannot learn in a chaotic, poorly managed classroom.

Teachers can establish clear expectations for behavior in two ways:  by establishing clear rules and procedures, and by providing consequences for student behavior.  It is important to reinforce acceptable behavior while providing consequences for unacceptable behavior.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Sample Rules:  BE KIND TO OTHERS, RAISE HAND TO TALK, and WORK QUIETLY.&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Also, teachers should establish rules for basic situations to keep order in their classrooms.  Examples:  passing papers, going to the bathroom, sharpening pencils, and safety routines.

&lt;big&gt;'''Disruptive Students'''&lt;/big&gt;

Being a new teacher with a class of 20 students can be overwhelming.  However, just a small number of students will usually disrupt class.  This is a difficult situation for teachers and more so for other students.  Time spent on inappropriate behavior takes time away from teaching and causes distractions(Teaching and Learning: Disruptive Students).

There are 3 key ideas in handling disruptive students: 

* Know your students
* Use the schools resources
* Use practical application in discipline
(How to deal with disruptive students)

Knowing your students and being able to relate to them is very important.  Their background, family life, interests, hobbies, talents, etc. will help in the communication process.  Parental involvement is also important.  Talking with the guidance counselors, and previous teachers can also help one understand their students and may shed some light on their problematic behavior.  Using these resources can help you to better understand how to handle a disruptive student.  Finally, apply practical discipline.  Find something &quot;important&quot; for the student to do and take the focus off the inappropriate behavior.  Praise child in front of classmates.

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #CC9933;
border: solid 10px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#800517&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Example:  If a student is running down the hall instead of staying in line with other classmates walking to lunch, give him/her a job as the &quot;leader.&quot;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;big&gt;'''Scoop From Someone Who Knows'''&lt;/big&gt;

Beth Close has been a Kindergarten teacher for 12 years at Tazewell Elementary in Virginia.  I asked her the following questions. ''What is the hardest part about managing your classroom?''  She said, &quot;Meeting the individual needs of each student at the same time.  Every child is different, and they learn in different ways.&quot;  ''How do you handle disruptive students?''  She said there was a variety of strategies she has used over the years.  One that has worked well for her is using a piggy bank with pennies as a reward system.  The student receives a penny each day for good behavior.  At the end of the week, they get to buy something out of the treasure chest.  This gives students an incentive to have good behavior.  She said, &quot;Students with inappropriate behavior first receive a warning, then a time out, then a note send home, then a phone call home, and finally they are removed from the class.&quot;  She has also used the old fashioned name on the board routine, and a color system...red light/green light. I also asked her, ''What would you do if a student refuses to do what you ask?'' Beth said this automatically calls for a 5 minute time out. She has no tolerance for this kind of behavior.  The last question I asked her was concerning how students treat each other.  ''What do you do when students are disrespectful to each other?''  This situation calls for a child to be removed from the classroom and to sit alone for a few minutes.  Beth says that consistency is the key, as well as the same punishment and reward for each student.

It is refreshing to get the scoop from someone already out in the field, living the experience everyday.  We imagine what the classroom setting will be like, but will not really know until we are there ourselves.  The information provided is meaningful because she already knows what works and what does not.  It was nice to see that all of her answers are parallel to what the research says.  Which is, being consistent and fair is one good way to promote good classroom discipline.        


&lt;big&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/big&gt;

It seems that the phrase &quot;expect the unexpected&quot; really applies in managing a classroom.  As teachers, we need to be flexible in responding to the unexpected.  We also need to be consistent in the application of discipline, not raise our voices and try to remain calm and rational.  We need to be fair to all students.  The combination of establishing clear expectations for rules and procedures, and providing consequences with incentives or by punishment and learning the best ways to handle disruptive behaviors are the important issues in managing an effective classroom.  We need to evaluate each circumstance and ensure that the consequence fits the crime.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classroom Management: Additional Resources ==

Written by Angela Dart

A teacher walking into their very first classroom with engaging lesson plans, educational posters on the wall, and a strong sense of confidence that they will do well in their first school year. However, as soon as 30 students enter the classroom talking, laughing, screaming, fighting and crying through the door, all confidence is lost. Years of studying instructional strategies, assessment, and child development are suddenly gone and the once confident teacher is now a nervous one. Classroom management is considered one of the toughest aspects of teaching because it deals with a variety of issues, such as instructional strategies, classroom organization, assessment, behavioral management and parents. While only true experience can make an educator an expert in classroom management, there are many additional resources for pre-service and new teachers, as well as veteran teachers. 


'''TeacherVision: Classroom Management'''- TeacherVision is an extremely informative and beneficial websites for new and experienced teachers. For a monthly fee, teachers can utilize 20,000 pages of lesson plans, printables and resources. This sections covers classroom management, including instructional strategies, assessment, classroom organization, behavior management, and working with parents. Visitors can view and print up to 3 lesson plans, printables and resources, and have a free 7-day trial. http://www.teachervision.fen.com/classroom-management/resource/5776.html?detoured=1


'''Classroom Management: Principals Help Teachers Develop Essential Skills'''- Many new teachers become very discouraged during their first year of teaching because they do not have a strong foundation in classroom management. However, this article addresses how a principal can be beneficial and appreciated during teachers’ first school year. This article, found on Education World.com and written by Gary Hopkins, is strongly recommended for novice teachers. http://www.educationworld.com/a_admin/admin/admin299.shtml


'''RubiStar'''- One of the most popular 4Teacher tools, RubiStar allows both teachers and student to create a large variety of rubrics for any subject and assignment. Teachers can create their own rubric or use a template as a starting point. After completion, teacher can post their rubrics to be viewed by other classrooms or save and print for their own personal use. RubiStar is not only extremely user-friendly for all people in a classroom but is also free of charge to use. http://rubistar.4teachers.org/index.php


'''Behavior Management Tips'''- One of the most difficult, yet important aspects of classroom management is behavior management. Some teachers fear that they may be too lenient while other may fear being too harsh. A feature article on Teacher.NET by Jan Zeiger addresses these concerns by giving tips on behavior management. This article is valuable for any teacher, regardless of their experience. http://teachers.net/gazette/FEB02/zeiger.html 


'''Classroom Architect'''- Powered by 4Teachers, this free online tool allows teachers to create a classroom layout for a positive learning environment. After selecting the room’s dimensions, and dragging objects across the room to represent furniture, teachers can save or print their layout without spending hours before or after school rearranging furniture. http://classroom.4teachers.org/


'''Dealing with Difficult Parents'''- Dealing with difficult students can be a very awkward and challenging issue. Dealing with difficult parents can be an even more problematic and daunting experience. However, there are ways of managing intimidating parents at conferences. Mike Moore gives several tips on how teachers can be assertive in the classroom. http://www.inspiringteachers.com/classroom_resources/tips/parent_communication/dealing_with_difficult_parents.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ethics and Law of Contemporary Schools in the Media'''

By: Stephanie Craig

'''Learning Targets'''

•	The reader will be able to list at least two current issues in the Media dealing with the ethics and law of educational institutions. 

•	The reader will be able to describe the main student rights being infringed upon according to recent issues in the media.

'''Introduction'''

Ethics and law in the public school domain often carries a negative view in today’s media. The news, in recent years, focuses more on the denial of students' rights than any other legal issue that public schools face. Increasing violence in contemporary schools is a serious problem, but one that the media often only covers after an incident has occurred. While a great amount of attention is given to a major violent act in public school, the media also focuses on the negative aspects of schools’ prevention programs. Options like Zero Tolerance Polices, which are blanket rules for serious offenses that do not consider individualized circumstances and almost always end in expulsion, are viewed as negative because they deny a student’s constitutional right of due process. 

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6600FF;

“While the due process rights afforded students in disciplinary proceedings do not have to mimic the judicial model, they must be adequate to ensure the fundamental purposes of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments--a fair hearing before an impartial decision maker and perhaps the presence of an attorney.” (La Roche, 2005)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


Other significant issues in the current media include: a teacher’s code of ethics, teacher-student relationships, and censorship versus free speech, the denial of first amendment rights. 


'''First Amendment Rights of Students'''


[[http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1909]]


The above link is to a story released by the Student Press Law Center on June 3, 2009. This article inspects a speech that Erica Corder gave at her high school graduation in Colorado. As valedictorian, Corder was asked to give a speech at her graduation, which is customary for most public high schools. Since graduation is a school sponsored event, the Principal Mark Brewer reviewed Corder’s speech before it was to be given. Brewer approved Corder’s speech, but on the day of graduation Corder veered from her reviewed speech. Instead of reading the prewritten speech, Corder included a statement, which “asked the crowd to learn more about Jesus Christ”(Stewart, 2009).


School Officials felt Corder's statements may have offended the audience members, therefore ordered her to make a public apology before she was given her diploma.  In response, Corder sued the school for infringement of her first amendment right to freedom of speech. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Corder, stating that the school was in not in the wrong to force her to apologize. The accusation of infringement of freedom of speech was circumvented by the court emphasizing that Corder’s veer from the pre-approved speech was the issue not necessarily the religious material.  



[[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,344350,00.html]]


The above link is to an article posted by FOX News on April 1, 2008, and written by Todd Richmond, a member of the associated press. In this story, a student in Wisconsin sues his high school for infringing not only on his freedom of expression but also his religious freedom. This student received a zero in art class for an assignment in which he would not remove religious references. The teacher, Julie Millin, had her art students sign “a policy for the class that prohibited any violence, blood, sexual connotations or religious beliefs in artwork” (Richmond, 2008). 


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6600FF;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;b&gt;“The lawsuit claims Millin told the boy he had signed away his constitutional rights when he signed the policy at the beginning of the semester.”(Richmond, 2008)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



The lawsuit argued that the school had other religious symbols posted, so his use of religion should not be a problem. The student referenced Buddha, and Hindu figurines in a history room where the teacher passionately teaches her students about history of religion. Also, the school allowed “demonic” masks, the medusa, and the grim reaper to be displayed. Overall, the lawsuit argued that the school’s policies were infringing on his freedom of religion.    



'''Teachers’ Ethics: Rights Students Cannot Afford to be Denied'''


[[http://www.sltrib.com/lds/ci_12528496]]


The above link is to an article written by Stephen Hunt, and posted by the Salt Lake Tribune on June 5, 2009. This article is about Jose Bernardo Fanjul, a teacher in Salt Lake City school district, who was acquitted of five counts each of first-degree felony forcible sodomy -- punishable by up to life in prison -- and five counts of second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse”(Hunt, 2009). The case was dropped due to the character of the 16 year-old female student in question, since she had previously perjured herself to cover up sexual activity with the school’s guidance counselor. However, there was suspicious activity by the teacher who had given the student presents, spent hours on the phone with her, and even tutored her privately at home. 


In this case there are three important issues at hand: first off, if the teacher was innocent, he must now face the destruction of his character and career due to these allegations, second, if the teacher was guilty, the school is failing to protect the student's basic right to personal safety, and third, regardless of guilt, where is the ethical line limiting the extent of a student teacher relationships?  


[[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/nyregion/04abuse.html]]


The above link is to an article posted by the New York Times on June 4, 2009, which was written by Paul Vitello. This article discusses a bill being proposed by the New York Senate to include public institutions in the expansion of the statute of limitations. This means that private and public institutions would have the same legal consequences should abuse occur or be alleged. This article is a current look at what actions the government is starting to take to stop child abuse in schools. 


 
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #6600FF;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;b&gt;“Thus, a child abused by a teacher in a public school would have 90 days after turning 18 to file a claim. By contrast, under current law, a victim of abuse at a private or religious school can file a civil claim within five years after turning 18.” &lt;/b&gt;(Vitello, 2009) 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



One worry is that the extended limitations will mean a loss in evidence, and witnesses making it harder for a teacher to prove their innocence. Shouldn’t the government be working to protect the rights of teachers as well as students in alleged cases of abuse?


'''Conclusion'''


As shown in the media articles above, much is being done to defend and maximize the rights of students in public schools. However, little is being done to address the safety and rights of our teachers. There are increasing numbers of lawsuits against teachers for even patting a student on the shoulder. Educational theories urge teachers to take a personal approach, but teachers are being looked at suspiciously for having a private conference with a student.

People nowadays like to be together not in the old-fashioned way of, say, mingling on the piazza of an Italian Renaissance city, but, instead, huddled together in traffic jams, bus queues, on escalators and so on. It's a new kind of togetherness which may seem totally alien, but it's the togetherness of modern technology. 

''J.G. Ballard'' 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Introduction ==

Technology has become increasingly popular and effective in the classroom, despite it being a new and controversial concept. Many educators support technology in the classroom stating that it makes learning more engaging for students of the digital age, especially the interaction of Web 2.0. Technology makes it possible for students to communicate with other students of different cultures around the world, creating a diverse classroom. However, there are also educators who disagree with the integration of technology and education, claiming that it distracts students from learning.  Critics raise the issue that many schools cannot afford to have a large technology integration or program. Regardless of these arguments, social networking is extremely popular among students with millions of users interacting every day, from all over the world. This provides an opportunity for educators to use sites built for communicating among friends, into sites where students can communicate with other students about education.

== What Is Social Networking and How Does It Work In the Classroom? ==

Many people in America have most likely heard of the term “social networking” or have heard of a site that does social networking, but do not know what exactly social networking is. Social networking is a community where family, friends, and colleagues connect online. People discuss countless topics, ranging from how their day was to career field discussions. Since social networking sites are online, users are diverse in age, gender, race and culture. However, many if not most people who use social networking sites consist of middle school, high school and college-age students spending as much time social networking as they do watching television. With the majority of users being in an educational setting, it provides an opportunity for teachers to making learning engaging and interactive. 

One of the most important aspects that an educator can teach is that learning can take place inside and outside of a classroom. Learning is a lifelong process, and if students recognize this, they gain a broader lesson from their teacher than in a textbook. Social networking makes it possible for classrooms to connect and for student to learn outside of the classroom. Teachers are already using emails and websites to keep their students informed with notices, notes, projects, exams and assistance. While email and classroom websites can be informative for students and their parents, social networking allows students and teachers to use what they have learned in the classroom, apply their knowledge, and display it to their peers, no matter where they are physically located. The versatility of social networking permits educators to use any subject and making it engaging for all students. For example, many teachers would enjoy bringing a real-life scientist in their classroom but cannot because of availability and financial reasons. These teachers could use Facebook for their class to have a live discussion with the scientist. Students are given an engaging experience without the limitations of finance, time and geography.

== Advantages and Disadvantages of Social Networking in the Classroom==

Although social networking is still somewhat of a new concept, research has shown that there are many advantages of using it in the classroom. Students who live in rural areas or are unable to attend their school of choice because of geography are now able to receive a high-quality education through social networking and virtual schools. Classroom would also become learning environments with global diversity. Sister schools around the world would be able to communicate with each other in real-time, allowing students to gain a perspective of their world through learning. There are also advantages for educators using social networking. The National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future has developed Teacher Linked In Networked Communities, which is an initiative to have teachers feel part of their community through social networking and become part of a diverse “learning team”. These networks would be a new approach to professional development where educators would discuss feedback, new ideas, and instructional strategies with colleagues. Besides being used for building knowledge, social networking sites have also been used to strengthen the relationship between students and teachers. Alyssa Trzeszkowski-Giese, a high school English teacher from James W. Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia, discovered that Facebook helped put a “face” not only on her students, but on herself as well. 

Social networking has shown many beneficial factors to improve education for children, however there are also many setbacks. One of the first issues schools always address is “Can we afford this?” While Massachusetts school districts actually benefit financially from virtual education, others like Florida schools district cannot. Florida school districts and many other cannot afford to spend their budget on computer and internet access for all students and teachers. Another major issue of social networking is that schools are now connected to students constantly, forcing them to take disciplinary action when students do negative public actions, such as underage drinking, and cyberbullying, which is the verbal attacking people online. The internet allows people to remain anonymous to some extent, resulting in people saying things they would most likely not say in person. The Internet provides open communication between students and educators, but it also forces teachers and administration to set their boundaries. Just as teachers have to set limits in the classroom, they must also do the same online by putting a limited amount of personal information on their user pages. Teachers also have to consider what age group they may want to interact with, for example, an fifth grade teacher may be hesitant to have students who are in third or seventh grade interact with her students online.

== Unanswered Questions ==

Educators, school administrations, students, communities, and researchers have raised and determined many questions about social networking and how it is used in the classroom. However, there are still many questions that still need to be answered:

''Current and pre-service educators are learning how to integrate technology into the lessons. With social networking becoming more prominent, what other aspects should they learn?''

''Are the schools right to resist technology in the classroom, or are students correct that they can benefit from the integration?''

''Policies are being developed to prevent cyberbullying, but can cyberbullying really be stopped by students?''

''Financially speaking, is it better for students to attend school online, or in an actual building?''

''With social networking and technology eliminating the problem of geography and physical location of meeting people, is this the end the traditional brick-and-mortar school?''

* The reader will be able to define Technology Integration.
* The reader will be able to identify and describe key concepts as they relate to Technology.

  
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; font size=2&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''What is Technology Integration?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Technology Integration is allowing students to use technology and computer skills in meaningful ways to enhance education.  Integrating technology into the classroom improves not only the learning process, but the outcomes as well. These classrooms use a more student-centered approach and are much more engaged in classroom activities. They are not being taught technology, it has been integrated in such a way, that it is transparent. (&quot;Technology Integration&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)

Shaffner (2002) defines technology integration as &quot;the use of technology resources -- computers, digital cameras, CD-ROMs, software applications, the Internet, etc. -- in daily classroom practices, and in the management of a school.&quot; 



&lt;big&gt;'''What kind of skills does technology integration build?&lt;/big&gt;

Technology integration in the classroom helps build many 21st Century Skills. These skills include personal and social responsibility, planning, reasoning, critical thinking, communication skills, cross-cultural understanding, decision-making, and knowledge of when and how to use technology appropriately. (Shaffner, 2002)


&lt;big&gt;'''What are the teacher standards for integration of technology into classrooms?'''&lt;/big&gt;

The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has issued five standards that teachers should uphold to successfully integrate technology into classrooms.

These include:

1. Facilitate and Inspire Student Learning and Creativity

&lt;big&gt;'''What is project-based learning?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Wikipedia defines '''project-based learning''' as &quot;the use of classroom projects, intended to bring about deep learning, where students use technology and inquiry to engage with issues and questions that are relevant to their lives. These classroom projects are used to assess student's subject matter competence compared to traditional testing.&quot; (&quot;Project Based Learning&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)


&lt;big&gt;'''What is Web 2.0?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;'''Web 2.0''' refers to what is perceived as a second generation of web development and web design. It is characterised as facilitating communication, information sharing, interoperability, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and web applications. Examples include social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs and folksonomies.&quot; (&quot;Web 2.0&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)
[[Category:Foundations and Assessment of Education]]


&lt;big&gt;'''What is a &quot;Wikiversity&quot;?'''&lt;/big&gt;

According to a definition from Wikipedia.org, a '''Wikiversity''' is an online community that allows users can find and share information, answers to questions, and general knowledge. Wikiversity's motto/slogan is &quot;Set learning free&quot; with an emphasis on &quot;learning by doing.&quot; Learning groups may form in order to collaborate on a group projects. (&quot;Wikiversity&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, para. 1)


&lt;big&gt;'''How are student written texts created?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Students, along with teachers or professors, come together to write a text which others can read and learn from. The students are learning while they teach. The students do not have the purchase expensive textbooks and it has been proven very effective. They are able to peer-review each other to get the best possible text.

&lt;big&gt;'''What is a virtual school?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;The most accepted definition of a '''virtual school''' is an entity approved by a state or governing body that offers courses through distance delivery and most commonly using the Internet.&quot; (Barbour &amp; Reeves, 2008, p. 402)

There are many benefits from virtual schooling, such as better access, positive learning opportunities, more flexibility and better efficiency. (Barbour &amp; Reeves, 2008)


&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;What does the term 'Digital Natives' mean and can our classrooms keep up with them?&quot;'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Digital Natives''', or the &quot;Net Generation&quot; is a new cohort describing the youth of our society that have been using technology all their lives. This gives them better technical skills and learning preferences geared to a digital age. 

However, traditional education will not be adequate to support Digital Natives. Education reform is needed to keep up with the ever-changing &quot;Net Generation.&quot; More research needs to be done so that educators can identify appropriate learning strategies for the Digital Natives.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; The Scoop From Someone Who Knows&lt;/font&gt;==

Technology in the classroom has changed in many ways since I was in high school.  The Internet did not exist, and computer classes were not a requirement.  As I study to become a teacher, technology is cutting-edge and an integral part of almost every classroom today.  Teachers use a variety of different tools to assist them in the classroom, including Smartboards, virtual field trips, Webcasts, and of course the Internet.  

To better understand what role technology serves in the classroom, I spoke with my sister Dorri Herrmann-Smith.  She has been teaching high school English Somerset, Pennsylvania for four years.  I chose to interview her because she is usually the person to whom I ask all of my teaching questions.  

'''Me:  Do you think technology is a help or distraction in your classroom? '''&lt;br&gt; 
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  Definitely a help!  Not a distraction.  I think it engages the students.  If you think about it, using technology is something that they do everyday.  I feel like when you incorporate it into the classroom, you’re connecting with them.  

'''Me:  Like what kind of technology are you talking about?'''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  Everything!  Internet searches, emails, podcasts, navigation of the Internet in general.    

'''Me: What different types of technology do you typically use with your students?'''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  I just got a SMARTboard!  I love it, its so much fun!  I’m going to training for it because I’m not familiar with half it can do.  You can play games with the students, show PowerPoint’s.  It's very interactive for the students.  The kids love it!

We do virtual field trips.  We visited the Globe Theater in London and looked all around one afternoon.  It was amazing!  We sat right in our classroom and did it.  We also did a tour of a museum in Ohio by Webcast.  The tour guide at the museum could see my class and we could see her simultaneously.  

I’m getting a Wikispace, which essentially is a blog to use with my students.  Just like Wikipedia and the Wikibooks you were telling me about, the class can all update it and it is fully interactive.  

The other week we had a homebound student and we Skype'd with him during class.   Have you used that?  It’s free.  You should get it.   

Recently my school purchased two Kindles.  Entire books can be uploaded to the device and the students can read the information.  

'''Me:  That’s amazing, I heard they were expensive.  There have been so many changes since we were in school!'''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  Yeah, no more dusty blackboards.

'''Me:  Do you feel that things like computers and the Internet are necessities in today’s classroom?'''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  Yes, definitely necessities.  I use email all day long with other teachers.  Grading is all done on the computer.  Like I said, I’m getting ready to get a Wikispace.  Students can email me night or day with questions, whereas in the past they may have been intimidated to call us teachers on the phone.  Of course, parents also email me quite a bit.  I often find interesting websites online that I get the students to look at and incorporate them into homework or classroom assignments.  There is a website called http://www.turnitin.com where it will catch plagiarizers.  I use that all the time.  It’s not free, but I caught two cheaters!

'''Me:  So, are students required to access the internet for classes?  What if they don’t have the internet at home? '''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  We haven’t run into that problem yet.  I’m sure we could do something to help that student get online.  We would work with them to make sure they got the work done.

'''Me:  What do you think of virtual learning?'''&lt;br&gt;
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  I think it all depends on the motivation level of students!  We get students who drop out and do online classes.  That’s a joke.  Who writes the papers?  It could be anyone.  As a replacement to high school it may not work.  We have a pregnant girl; she is going to do some classes online.  She’s motivated and probably will do well.  

'''Me:  How do you feel that technology will evolve in classrooms?'''&lt;br&gt; 
Ms. Herrmann-Smith:  I think that everything will be online, more than it already is.  Kids will be more responsible for getting online to check things for classes.  It will be expected for them to have internet access and check their individual email for schoolwork.

==&lt;font color=#387C44&gt; Conclusion&lt;/font&gt;==

I think it was interesting speaking with my sister regarding the various types of technology that she uses daily.  It has given me insight about how teaching is different from what I witnessed while attending school years ago.  In our school, we were treated to usually one or two field trips per year.  I can only imagine how simple and enjoyable a virtual field trip would be.  According to ''American Teacher Magazine'', it is cost effective and not only is it possible to see museums and events in other cities and towns, it is also possible to look into the past!  Colonial Williamsburg offers an online tour that allows students to take part in a scavenger hunt while learning about history in the process.  (American Teacher Magazine, 2009)

My sister mentioned to me in our interview that they had used Skype to communicate with a homebound student. I was aware that this tool being utilized for long distance communication and Internet chatting, but had never considered its place in the classroom. Not only is this software free, it can be used to record conversations to be played back at another time. Imagine how interesting it could be to connect an English class to an author of a book that they read, or an art class to a work of art that a class has studied!  Carolyn Foote,  A high school teacher in Austin, Texas was able to connect her class with an author of a popular book.  The author, Cynthia Leitich Smith feels that “books and technology don’t have to compete.  They can be celebrated together.” (Foote, 2008)

My sister also mentioned Webcasts. Webcasting is becoming more and more popular with educators.  Although there can be costs involved with on-demand learning programs that teachers can order for their classrooms, the ease of ordering up any kind of educational program imaginable is indispensable for the modern classroom.  (Miller, 2006)

Visit: http://smarttech.com/ to find more information about SMARTboard technology! 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

SMARTboard technology is a very unique learning tool.  According to Michele Davis of ''Education Week’s Digital Directions'', it’s possible to write with a special pen, erase what you wrote with a digital eraser, and even move objects around.  Your work can be saved into document formats including Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.  It looks just like a regular whiteboard, but the pens and board are digital.  (Davis, 2007)

How will technology evolve in classrooms?  Did anyone think fifty years ago that technology would exist that would enable teachers to teleconference with other educators across the country, or even the globe?  Perhaps, but now we know it’s a reality and many of us will have the opportunity to use these advances when we begin teaching in our own classrooms.  One interesting forward-thinking platform for education is entire three-dimensional worlds where characters can exist in a different reality.  Gilly Salmon, a professor of elearning in Britain explains that in the virtual reality game ''Second Life'', actual colleges and other learning environments are created by users.  (Salmon, 2009)  One learning tool I have discovered in the game is language classes.  The professor and students all have speakers and microphones which allows for real-time communication.  

[[File:University_of_princeton.png|center|400px|Princeton University in Second Life]]

Decades ago, science fiction movies portrayed videoconferencing to be a tool of the future.  Today, it is commonplace in our homes and in our classrooms.  What does the future hold for technology in school?  Many advanced tools are available to today’s teachers.  No matter what the subject, students can learn and excel with technology that their parents could never have dreamed of!

== What is an assessment? ==

Wikipedia says,&quot;an assessment is the process of documenting, usually in measurable terms, knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs. &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assessment

There are six types or kinds of assessments that I will identify. They are: 

1) Formative Assessments

2) Summative Assessments

3) Objective Assessments

4) Subjective Assessments

5) Informal Assessments

6) Formal Assessments


'''What is a Formative Assessment?'''
Teachers use the formative assessment method when they want to accommodate their teaching and learning to meet the students needs. Examples would be teacher observations and classroom discussions.

'''What is a Summative Assessement?'''
Summative assessments are used for final exams, statewide tests, and college entrance exams such as SAT's and ACT's.

                To learn more about formative and summative 
                assessments go to website: http://fcit.usf.edu/
                assessment/basic/basica.html- Click on How Classroom
                Assessments Improve Learning by Thomas R. Guskey.

'''What is a Objective Assessment?'''
Objective assessments are questions that has only one correct answer. Objective assessments include true/false, multiple choice, and matching questions or statements.

'''What is an Subjective Assessment?'''
 Subjective assessments can have more than one correct answer.  These assessments are usually extended-response questions and essays.

'''What are Informal Assessments?'''
Informal assessments include teacher observations, rubrics, peer evaluations, self evaluations and discussions.

'''What are Formal Assessments?'''
Formal assessments are quizzes, tests, or papers that students receives a grade based on their performance.


                        Rather than sorting students into
                        winners and losers, assessment for
                        learning can put all students on a
                        winning streak.
                                         Rick Stiggens


'''Assessment Through the Student's Eyes''' 
Teachers and students can learn from assessments. Assessments give understandable information in a way they can use to improve their performance, and when teachers and students improve their performance they can only enhance their learning.
According to Black &amp; Wiliam, &quot;extensive research conducted around the world shows that by consistently applying the principles of assessment for learning, we can produce impressive gains in student achievement, especially for struggling learners.&quot;

                            
== THE ASSESSMENT EXPERIENCE ==

The assessment experience gives a look into how a student feels when they are assessed.

FOR STUDENTS on WINNING STREAKS FOR STUDENTS on LOSING STREAK

                       Assessment results provide:
-continual evidence of success -continual evidence of failure

                           The student feels:
-hopeful and optimistic - hopeless
-empowered to take productive action - initially panicked, giving up

                           The student thinks:
-It's all good. I'm doing fine. I - this hurts. I'm not safe here
want more success. I'm confused
-Feedback helps me. - Nothing I try seems to work.
-Public success feels good -Public failure is embarrassing

                  The student becomes more likely to:
-seek challenges - seek what is easy
-seek exciting new ideas - avoid new concepts ==


-take initiative - avoid initiative

                         These actions lead to:
-self-enhancement - self-defeat,self-destruction
-acceptance of responsibility - denial of responsibility
-feeling that success is its own reward - no feeling of success
-curiosity, enthusiasm - boredom, frustration, fear
-resilience - yielding quickly to defeat
-strong foundations for future success - failure to master 
                                                prerequisites for future 
                                                success

== THE FIVE KEY DIMENSIONS OF CLASSROOM ASSESSMENTS ==
According to Stiggens, Arter, Chappuis, and Chappuis, there are five key dimensions of sound and productive classroom assessments. They are:

1) Quality assessments arise from and are designed to serve the specific information needs of intended user(s). Assessments are used by teachers, administrators, and students to help them find out what kind of strategies to use.

2) Quality assessments arise from clearly articulated and appropriate achievement targets. Simply put, students need clear and specific instructions as to what is wanted from them to help them learn.

3) Quality assessments accurately reflect student achievement. No matter what kind of assessment that is used it should be one that gears toward achieving student success.

4) Quality assessments yield results that are effectively communicated to their intended users. Teachers, administrators, and students should be able to understand the results that are made.

5) Quality assessments involve students in classroom assessment, record-keeping, and communication of result. Students are more involved and held accountable for what they learn.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Learning Target'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Students will be able to determine eligibility for Virginia Alternate Assessment Program.
&lt;BR&gt;Students will be able to identify the five components of the VAAP.
&lt;BR&gt;Students will be able to describe proper evidence collection.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Background'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;P&gt;	The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) is a portfolio assessment designed to evaluate the performance of students with significant cognitive disabilities (Virginia Department of Education, 2008).  The VAAP is an alternative to formal Standards of Learning (SOL) testing and is available to students in grades 3 through 8 and grade 11 who are working on academic standards that have been reduced in complexity and depth.  The content, derived from SOLs, is modified and referred to as the Aligned Standards of Learning (ASOLs).  Individual student achievement of academic skills is the single focus of this portfolio assessment.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Introduction of “expert”'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;P&gt;	Wendy Street is a special education teacher for Louisa County Public Schools (LCPS), located in Louisa, Virginia.  Ms. Street is the 2009 Educator of the Year for Louisa County.  She holds a Master’s of Science in Education with a concentration in Special Education from Old Dominion University.  She serves as the Special Education department chair for Thomas Jefferson Elementary School  and as a Louisa County Public Schools Peer Reviewer for VAAP portfolios and Individualized Education Plans (IEPs).  In the classroom, she teaches students with significant cognitive disabilities who fall on the autism spectrum.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Interview Questions'''&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;P&gt;'''Are there specific criteria that must be met in order to participate in the VAAP rather than SOL testing?''' 
&lt;P&gt;Yes, a student must meet certain eligibility criteria.  The student must have a current Individualized Education Plan or have one being developed.  An Individualized Education Plan is a plan specifically written for each child to meet their unique educational needs to ensure a free appropriate public education under the federal guidelines (Virginia Department of Education, 2001).  written statement designed to meet The student must demonstrate significant cognitive disabilities and require intensive, frequent, and individualized instruction in a variety of settings to show interaction and achievement.  The student must be working toward educational goals other than those prescribed for a Modified Standard, Standard, or Advanced Studies Diploma.  

&lt;P&gt;'''What are the components of the VAAP?'''
&lt;P&gt;
The VAAP consists of five components—

&lt;BR&gt;1.	Determination of Eligibility - The IEP team uses VAAP eligibility criteria to examine how a student with significant cognitive disabilities accesses instruction and how he/she demonstrates knowledge and skills.

&lt;BR&gt;2.	Use of ASOLs - ASOLs provide students with significant cognitive disabilities access to cross-grade level SOL content that has been modified.  Appropriate content level standards have been identified for each content area: reading, math, science, and history/social science.

&lt;BR&gt;3.	Collection of Evidence (COE)-Students must compile a collection of work samples to demonstrate their knowledge and skills on the ASOLs for which they have received instruction.

&lt;BR&gt;4.	VAAP Content Area Cover Sheet-The student’s COE must include a cover sheet for each content area within the collection.

&lt;BR&gt;5.	Affidavit of Student Performance-One must be completed for the entire COE.  The affidavit ensures that only the student completed all of the evidence presented and that it was completed under the supervision of the special education teacher of other school personnel such as a paraprofessional.

&lt;P&gt;'''What can be included in the COE for the VAAP?'''
&lt;P&gt;COE can include work samples, audiotapes, videotapes, anecdotal records, interviews, data charts/graphs, and captioned photographs.  Work samples must address all concepts stated in the ASOL and must be graded correctly so that the student’s proficiency on the content is clear.  Work samples may include worksheets, tests, quizzes, writing samples, and any other student-generated work.  Audiotapes are often used for the student to answer questions, read a selection, or describe a procedure.   If audiotapes are used, a script should be included in case the tape breaks of does not work properly.  Videotapes are used to show a student working on a skill or concept.  They also often contain an interview of the student to assess knowledge on a specific topic.   If a videotape tape is used, a signed release form granting permission to use must be included.  A script of the videotape should be included as well in case the tape malfunctions.  An anecdotal record is an ongoing log of student performance written by the student or teacher.  Anecdotal records should include the date of performance, a description of the observed skill or procedure, and the student’s level of achievement.  An example of a good anecdotal record would be, “On March 1, 2009, John Doe sorted a box of 20 objects by size, shape, and color with 100% accuracy.  John was able to complete this activity independently.”
Interviews might be conducted by the teacher to assess understanding of a concept.  The teacher would ask the student questions related to the targeted topic and the student would answer.  Interview questions should be short and clear to give the student the best opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge on the given topic.  Interviews may be submitted as a written document or videotaped.  Data charts and graphs submitted should contain specific information regarding the targeted ASOL, the date of performance, and the student’s level of achievement. 
Photographs submitted must be captioned with a statement indicating student performance of ASOL knowledge and skills.  The statement should be a detailed summary of the activity occurring and the student’s level of achievement. 

&lt;P&gt;'''What are the benefits of using portfolio assessments such as the VAAP?'''
&lt;P&gt;Portfolio assessments provide a means of evaluation for a population of students with significant cognitive disabilities who are unable to be assessed using the SOL tests even with accommodations.  Portfolio assessments can be a creative and pleasurable experience.  They are used to show a student’s progress over time and improvement in specific areas.  Using ASOLs help students learn more functional life skills.  They also give some students the chance to evaluate their own work as some students are included in the process of selecting evidence to be submitted.  Benefits for teachers include developing organizational skills as a result of organizing evidence of performance and compiling a warehouse for teaching ideas for future use.

&lt;P&gt;'''What are the disadvantages of using portfolio assessments?'''
&lt;P&gt;I cannot think of any disadvantages of using portfolio assessments to assess students with significant cognitive disabilities.  In fact, I think using portfolio assessments for students with test-taking anxiety would be beneficial as well.  It would help lessen the gap between assessment scores and classroom performance.

Ms. Street had an interesting take on assessment.  While most of our reading deals with assessment of general education students, Ms Street’s background is in special education.   Her VAAP portfolios actually look like photo albums of student assessments.   Seeing  the photographs shows how a teacher can use photographs as assessments for everyone.   With general education students, they love to use technology.  Whether its digital camera or the new “Flip” video camera students can document assignments and provide you with another means of assessment.

Ms. Street’s information regarding the purpose, criteria, and content of a VAAP assessment coincides with the information provided by other researchers and educational experts.   Ms. Street agrees with J.M. Blackbourn that portfolio assessments allow students to demonstrate their own skills of what they have learned rather than specific skills determined by test constructors (Blackbourn et al., 2004).  However, she does appear to be more of a proponent of portfolio assessments than most.  When asked about the disadvantages of portfolio assessments, she stated that she could not think of any.  After reading other articles describing portfolio assessments, Penelope Valdez states that portfolio assessments require too much planning time, are hard to organize, and take too much time away from instruction in the classroom (Valdez, 2001). 

&lt;P&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Multiple Choice Questions'''&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1.	The VAAP is used to assess students with

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''ABOUT ME'''&lt;/big&gt;

HI my name is Ryan Collins.  I am currently a rising sophomore, majoring in Music Education at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University].  I currently play saxophone in the university's Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble, Pep Band, and the newly formed [http://www.odu.edu/mmb Marching Band].  I realized that I wanted to be a teacher my junior year in high school.  I contribute this to the new band director we got that year.  He showed me that what we were doing could be fun and could take you many different places.  He opened my eyes to parts of the musical world that i had never been exposed to before.  Also in the spring of 2008 I achieved the rank of [http://www.nesa.org Eagle Scout] in [http://www.scouting.org The Boy Scouts of America].  That also took me many different places.  I attended [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Scout_jamboree_(Boy_Scouts_of_America) The National Boy Scout Jamboree] in 2005 and [http://www.scouting.org/highadventure/philmont/doublehranch.aspx Double H High Adventure Base] in 2007, Where we backpacked over fifty miles over the course of six days.  I believe those trips helped me become the person I am today. This summer along with taking ECI 301, I would like to start learning to play the flute and clarinet.  I will also be going to Ireland for about a week and a half with my family.  Aside from music I like to go Snowboarding and Wake-boarding when ever I can.  Also hockey is my favorite sport, [http://redwings.nhl.com/index.html Detroit Red Wings] all the way.  I would love to start playing hockey again.


&lt;big&gt;'''MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY'''&lt;/big&gt;

I have always liked school, but everyone had that one class that they dreaded going to because the teacher was unbearably boring. The way that each class is run should be different depending on the subject matter. For instance a history class will not be taught the same way that I will teach a band class. In a band class the assignments will be more hands on versus a lecture setting. I think that the class should move along so that the students do not become bored with the material. An example of how I would do this is by not spending a great amount of time &quot;practicing&quot; parts for students, but rehearsing the whole ensemble.

As far as students that are classified as special needs I do not plan to treat them any different than the rest of the class. Just because they have this disability does not mean that they should be treated any differently. There are many different people that have been successful in the music field that have been physically and mentally disabled. As far as parent involvement I have seen firsthand that without help from the parents of students in the band program, it is almost impossible to run. I know that I will try to keep my rehearsals busy to keep the students interested. I will also try to program music that will not only broaden their musical horizons but challenge their skills. 


&lt;big&gt;'''THE FUTURE'''&lt;/big&gt;

After I finish my course work here at [http://www.odu.edu Old Dominion University] I have been thinking of a few things that I would like to do. I would like to conduct my own band program either at the middle or high school level. Depending on the job market after I graduate, if I can't find a job I would like to continue my studies at [http://www.umich.edu The University of Michigan]. I would either like to major in Saxophone Performance or Graduate conducting. Hopefully I would be able to get a graduate assistantship. In the mean time I could always substitute teach, which would get me more in class experience. But who knows what the future will have in store for me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ABOUT ME:  

Hello!! My name is Lyndsey Williams.  I have lived in Virginia my entire life in the Hampton Roads Area. I currently live in Norfolk, but I am moving to the Chicks Beach area of Virginia Beach in August and I am very excited.  I have a three year old Black Lab/Airedale mix dog named Lola who brightens up my life everyday.  I also have a wonderful boyfriend named Michael, who as of August first, will be my new roommate! I have a Bachelor's degree in psychology with a minor in human services counseling from Old Dominion University.  I am currently working on my teaching licensure at ODU and will hopefully be teaching kindergarten when I have it completed.  I currently work at Maryview Medical Center in Portsmouth, Virginia.  I am a Mental Health Counselor in the Behavioral Medicine Department working on a daily basis with children and adolescents.  My job is very challenging, but I thoroughly love what I do each day.  I also work at a private Christian school with preschool children and will begin teaching a four year old class in the fall.  I am very excited to open up a new chapter in my life.  I love working with children and look forward to completing the licensure program.

INTERESTS:

I love to cook and am always looking up new and interesting recipes.  I also love the beach, especially when it is not too crowded and I can take my dog out to burn off some energy.  She is EXTREMELY hyper, but she keeps me on my toes.  I am also addicted to shoes and try very hard not to buy every pair I come across.  I am a very friendly person who enjoys spending time with my friends and family when I am not working or studying.

PHILOSOPHY OF TEACHING:

I have always enjoyed working with children.  I am an older sister who, as much as my brother hates it, has always been a little mother hen.  I feel a good teacher is someone who has a love for learning, who comes to work everyday not for the paycheck but because they love what they do and could not imagine their life without their students.  I have recently begun my observation in a kindergarten class and I am sad when the day is over.  I see the teachers I have been working with and how they are so excited and happy to be at the school and I feel this is where I am supposed to be at this point in my life.  I am looking forward to the near future.
I work everyday with at-rick children and feel everyone should be given the same opportunities.  There is always going to be students who need extra attention and teachers' need to prioritize to fit the needs of each child in the classroom.  I always enjoyed group assignments, so I feel I will most likely use them in my classroom as well as different learning stations.  When working with younger children one needs to always have something happening in the classroom.  I feel a happy classroom will help contribute to having happy students.  I look forward to being able to decorate my classroom in bright colors and have learning tools covering the walls.  I will also have plently of room to hang all the wonderful creations made by the students on the walls.  The classroom I am currently working in uses a variety of computer programs which are very helpful to the students.  I see myself incorporating different technologies into my lessons.  I also look forward to adding some creativity to the lesson plans assigned for my grade level.</text>

      <comment>/* Toner Density */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Did you know it only takes a few easy step to save toner resources?

Here are a few ideas to get you started.

==Banner Pages==

If you reduced the practice of printing banner pages you could potentially reduce  company consumable cost by 20%. I found and interesting statistic from Gartner research that says  A 1,000-person organization could cut up to 1.6 million pages and save $33,500 per year by eliminating banner page printing. (McNee p.1) To make up for the short fall of not having banner pages, I would recommend implementing user authentication at all devices. This user authentication could be biometric based. This practice will also conserve resources by helping eliminate printed job not being picked up.

==Color Printing==
Color printing costs are 4 times as high as a standard black and white printing. The reason is that the color printer is more costly is that the printer uses four cartridges to make a document. Color impressions can run as high as $.25 per page for some jobs. (Weilerstein pg.2) A full color 10-page document can cost as much as $2.50. Most office staff may not have a legitimate need for color printing.  This is not to say that no department needs to print in color. Certain documents like graphs and diagrams need color to differentiate between numbers and columns. Color printers are a necessarily evil at most organizations, however we could drastically reduce cost if we evaluate where these printers are placed. For instance the advertising department probably needs full color, but the accounting department may not. We should also create a document and send it by e-mail organization wide and suggest alternatives for color printing. A few examples might be power point presentation really don’t need to be printed, they are easily viewed on the screen.

==Toner Density==
Toner density is the amount of toner applied to each page. If organization reduduced toner density they could realize savings of 5% to 10% reduction in toner consumption. (McNee p.3)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''About Me:'''&lt;/big&gt;

My name is Holly and I hope to graduate in the spring from ODU. I will graduate with a Bachelor of Fine Arts 
with a concentration in Graphic Design, with teacher licensure. (a bit of a mouthful!) 

I hope to teach elementary art by day and create drawings and do graphic design by night! Art is 
my first passion and I think teaching children to enjoy and appreciate art will be very rewarding. 

I am a Virginia Beach native and recently read a facebook quote by one of my friends I thought
to be very funny and appropriate. &quot;Virginia Beach is the only place you can come to visit and 
experience all four seasons in one day!&quot;

&lt;big&gt;'''Teaching Philosophy:'''&lt;/big&gt;

I believe teaching is successful when teachers make learning fun and exciting for students.
As an art teacher, I want to make my students excited to learn about art history and how 
to create art using different mediums. I want to teach children to appreciate art! 

Teachers have a responsibility to their students to teach them as much as they can. I know
schools are geared for the SOL's now, however I think teachers should teach even past the
SOL's, they are comprised of a limited amount of information that teachers can go above 
and beyond!</text>

'''MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY'''

To me, teaching is the greatest profession. Teachers are what makes society great, and they are often not given the credit that they deserve. Since the begining of organized education, teachers have gained more and more respect from those in other porfessions, but teachers are still not reveared by the public-at-large in the way that they should. One can only hope that within the next decade, the public will continue to see the importance of teachers and award them the credit that they so honestly deserve.

The best educator is one who can not only keep his or her students throughly engaged but also can be a definitive informant. The best educator is also one who can successfully run coherent class discussions without allowing the class to vere too far from the topic at hand. The best educator commands respect without being a tyrant and is not only an authority figure but a friend to his or her students. Last, but not least, the best educator is one who, from the bottom of their heart, loves teaching new generations life skills that will help them succed in life.

As an educator, I hope to be all of these things. I hope to be an impact in the lives of all of my students. I hope that I remain in their memories, not because of how &quot;totally hard&quot; my class was, or how &quot;super mean&quot; I was, but because of the enthuiastic attutide that I was always able to maintain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! My name is Bianca Penny-Harley  

I was born in New Jersey raised in Puerto Rico since the age of 8. I'm fully bilingual which I consider very fortunate to be. Although English is my first language orally, I consider Spanish my first language. My vocabulary and my writing skills in Spanish are much better. 

At the moment my family consists of me, my husband Sean and my two cats Boots and Puss. 

[[File:B_and_S.JPG|250px]]   [[File:Boot_and_puss.JPG|250px]]


I have lived in Virginia Beach now for 5 years and although I miss the loud and in your face culture of Puerto Rico; not to mention the weather, I am very happy here. I have a Bachelors degree in Business Administration from the University of Puerto Rico with a concentration in hospitality and restaurant management. My biggest passion is art. Below are some pictures of my artwork, you can see more of it at http://bpenny12.deviantart.com/

[[File:Touch_of_life.jpg|150px]]   [[File:New_born.JPG|250px]]

Besides painting some of my other hobbies are singing, bike ridding, bowling and watching interior design shows. 

Hopefully in the future I will be teaching Spanish in Middle and High School, maybe to adults as well later on. After tutoring my brother through his Spanish classes in middle and high school I noticed that I actually enjoyed it. I realized that after working many years in the hospitality industry my time was very limited with family and friends because of the crazy schedules, plus I hated working weekends. After actually seing how my brother learned the language that I love so much and that he actually enjoyed the process it made me want to give that feeling to many other people and that is what motivated me to start a teaching program.  

My educational Philosophy...
I believe that what makes a good teacher is someone who is passionate about actually having his or her students succeed; leaving the classroom with understanding of the material and an appreciation of the information they have just gained. Good teachers stimulate forward thinking and personal growth throughout the school years. Regardless of what I would be teaching I would like to be the kind of teacher that stimulates students to want to learn and enjoy the process of learning. From personal experience I strongly believe that the student body should be diversified but controlled. Students with special needs should be handled in specialized schools for their benefit. Students should not be grouped by ability; this creates a foundation of segregation within the student body. I strongly believe in bilingual education. Coming from a bilingual education myself I consider it a privilege. Knowing another language allows student to be influenced by new things from other cultures. It allows the student to become more diversified as well as become a better well rounded citizen of the world. Having a second or third language also opens doors to many opportunities in the future since many countries are becoming more integrated by the day. Ebonics does not belong in the school systems. It is a street language within a community that I do not consider important enough to be in the school system. No student should be treated any different but &quot;at risk&quot; children should be handled with a more subtle approach.

In the future I picture my classroom environment to be fun and challenging. Student interaction is a must. I am the first to say I am not big on working in a group sometimes but there are many benefits and skills to be learned from them. Student-teacher interaction should be kept friendly but professional. There needs to be a clear distinction between child and adult and who is in charge in the classroom. Parents should be involved throughout the entire time there child is in the school system especially in the earlier years. The parent’s involvement dictates many times how well a student does within a class. Since I am fairly new to teaching I mostly plan on using techniques that work. Student projects that are related to what is in the now and what is real to them, motivating them to learn not because they have to but because they find it interesting and relative to their world. I think that when you treat children with respect it is reciprocated unless other problems are present. Students need to feel important and part of a class. When they feel this way they participate more, are not afraid to state their opinion whether it is correct or incorrect and therefore to learn the material internalizing it.</text>

Hi Bianca, 
I was so interested in your experience in being bilingual.  I think that it is so important for children to be exposed to languages to really allow them the opportunity to realize that is is possible to find common ground with anyone through communication.  I took Spanish and French in school and really got a lot out of my Spanish teacher because she was from Puerto Rico and spoke only to us in Spanish.  It was constant immersion that helped us to pick up on the conversational part of learning a language that most students find difficult.  I know that you will be successful in reaching your students and give them a great foundation to love the language and the beautiful island that you love!  
Jill

Hiya.  I love your artwork, thanks for posting it.  You have lots of varied interests!  I could use some help with my Spanish.  I took it at TCC, but I forgot most, of not all of it and I need to take two more classes!  I'm not sure if you meant all children with special needs should be in a special school, I don't agree with that.  I think classrooms with children with all levels can be taught together effectively in most situations.  In my opinion, schools should function like the real world and people with all kinds of abilities should spend time together in school.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==DEFINING THE LAW OF ALMIGHTY GOD==
To understand the Law of Almighty God, we must first define what it is before we can see how it applies to our lives. A Dictionary definition says it is &quot;a rule established among a community and enjoining or prohibiting certain action, the system made  up of these rules, its controlling power, the order produced by it, its administration&quot;  etc. ..  (The Australian Oxford Dictionary)

So we have the word defined as a rule or set of rules which prescribe or prohibit our actions to conform to a certain order or pattern of behaviour. Now, when considering the Law of God, upon what are these rules based?
What is the purpose of them and what pattern of behaviour do they establish?

==BASIC LAWS==
Yahweh God has constructed the whole creation to function on set laws or principles.  Science is a study of how and why these principles operate from the smallest atom to the galaxies out in space. If the laws of the universe were not constant, there would be chaos. Because they are constant, time, days, months, years and seasons can be relied upon to be constant and form a structure for society. Likewise, because the laws of physics remains constant we can harness these forces for our use.

There are many natural laws which govern our behaviour, things like gravity, atmospheric pressure, condensation, chemical changes of matter, photo-synthesis, light rays and sound waves; all these things influence our lives and limit our activities on this earth. If we break these laws, we reap the consequences.
Whether we violate them ignorantly or intentionally, we will still be subject to the same effects from so doing.

When Yahweh God made man, He also established principles upon which we would be constructed in His likeness and image.  We were made to be a living soul in a physical body with the interconnecting link between the two carried in our blood-stream  -  &quot;the life of the soul (flesh) is in the blood&quot;  (Leviticus 17:11)
He made us to function physically by breathing air, eating fruits and herb-bearing seeds and the drinking of water.  All these are basic bodily needs (Genesis 2:7-10).

==MORAL LAWS==
Then we come to the part which concerns us, the moral laws of God. Those principles which were meant to govern us. To use an allegory here, when an inventor makes something, it functions according to the way it is made and the only time an inventory needs to be consulted, is when something malfunctions in its operation.
And so it was with Adam. Adam functioned according to the way he had been made in the image and likeness of God.  That is, he naturally acted in the holy, righteous pattern in which he had been made, reflecting Yahweh God's likeness. Therefore a code of ethics was unnecessary because he was living according to God's laws for him. The law of God was functioning in and through him and therefore it could be said, that he was living within the boundaries of the law or, abiding in the law. Because he was abiding in the law of God, he was also in harmony with and synchronised to the One who made him and abode in the relationship of His love.

He was not a violator of the law until he wilfully disobeyed and stepped outside of the confines of the law. He then became a law-breaker and the relationship with Yahweh God was broken and the union severed.
As a result his operating mechanism malfunctioned and was in need of repair.

The standard of moral lifestyle and behaviour was passed down generation to generation in the godly line until the flood and thereafter through the patriarchs who maintain the worship of God. it only became necessary to make a codified written law after the descendants of Abraham's lineage went into captivity in Egypt. Under the suppression of the taskmasters of Egypt the Israelites were not able to keep the traditions and they became superseded and/or overlooked and they were living in transgression of the laws of Almighty God. And so, &quot;the law was added because of transgression.&quot;  (Galatians 3:19)
All of the laws given at Sinai became a national constitution for a people who needed to be taught right from wrong on God's standard. Among the group who came out in the exodus, were slaves from other nations who had responded to the reality of the God of Israel as demonstrated through the ten plagues, and chose to identify themselves with the people of God and place themselves under the blood of the lamb.

The codified, written laws were in the form of an outline of the outward behaviour of righteousness for mankind who were now  in their fallen state since Adam, without the corresponding nature within which would naturally overflow into that lifestyle. It was like a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional reality - a list of &quot;do's&quot; and &quot;don'ts&quot;, to serve as a guideline, parameters for man's behaviour according to the original image in which Adam the head of the human race was created.

==THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW==
As Paul said, the law was given as a &quot;schoolmaster&quot;, a term which was used for a type of guardian/instructor that would teach, train and oversee a youth in their formative years until they were mature and their character was formed. This is the  stated purpose of the Law, to provide guidelines until Yeshua the Messiah should come who would exemplify the Law in Himself as a living reality, a three-dimensional image of man functioning in the image and likeness of God (Galatians 3:19-25).

Now, through faith His &quot;life&quot;, or nature, is imparted to us, so that we might once again as a redeemed people, have the internal reality of the image and likeness of God, from which to live. Through that impartation of His life, we have been made new creatures in Him (2 Corinthians 5:17), however, there is a transformation process which is necessary from the old nature with which we were born physically, to the new nature from which we are born spiritually.  The scripture repeats the &quot;do not's&quot; of the Law to us, as well, which is necessary for our guidance, until Christ is formed in us, by fully &quot;putting on&quot; the new nature  (Colossians 3:5-10).

Once we are mature in Messiah and have been conformed to His image, we no longer need the constant reminders of the Law; the Law having already trained us in righteousness through our submission and obedience to the instructions given through it.

He, as a loving Father has given His instructions to us to lead us back to 'life' as compared to the spiritual death which results from going our own way. If left to ourselves, we not only become lawless, we self-destruct. Selfishness and self-indulgence is the root of all the conflict and trouble in the world, on an individual and a corporate level, and the only solution for the corrupt state of mankind is the Cross of our Saviour, Yeshua the Messiah. The change must come first from within each person and then, by them learning to walk in His ways, i.e. His laws, His principles for living, into their lifestyle.

This is the combination of His Word and His Spirit in our lives.  Although the living Word (Messiah) has been imparted into our lives through faith, the scriptures as the Written Word are necessary to correct the old, fallen nature which is still resident within us.  Although it has been put out of operation, it can still be activated through areas of our personalities which have not been transformed to be Christ-like.  The impartation of His life, as a deposit of His Spirit within us, is nurtured to grow through feeding upon the Word of God which is through the scriptures.  When there is a reference to the scriptures in the new covenant writings, it is the Law that was made known for the previous covenant that is referred to and was being used.

As Paul said to Timothy,
&quot;All scripture (laws previously given) is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine; for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete (mature), thoroughly equipped for every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:16).  Note that the gospels and letters were not regarded as scripture at that time and these were not compiled as we have them today. Each assembly may have had one gospel and a few letters which were finally collected to be made into a new covenant canon of scripture, so the 'scriptures' here being referred to, are the scriptures of the old covenant - the law and the prophets which Yeshua said would not be done away with until everything in them was fulfilled  (Matthew 5:17-19).

The listing of images on this page is not usefull. I think we should remove this page. There are thousands of Blender related images on commons.wikimedia.org, why should the images be listed here seperately?

I agree, I don't have any interest in updating it, either [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 21:58, 20 July 2010 (UTC)


I don't have any interest in updating it either, but I think that the first thing a person new to blender would want to see are images. Leave it alone, even in it's current state. the most important thing on this page is the fact that new users can view more images on 
[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Blender_3D]


Ok, i will change it to be links to catagories of pictures, both at wikibooks, and at the commons.  some of the catagories are here [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Using_proper_copyright_RE:Blender]], but their are others that have been used, I will see about discovering them, and adding a usefull category to the ones that don't have one [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:00, 25 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;u&gt;
== Life on Arcanists ==
&lt;/u&gt;'''

On early March 2008, 13 year old Zappy_Flash was casually surfing the net when he came across Arcanists on Funorb.com. Little did he know that a few games had gotten Arcanists to be his favorite game. 
The first day after going over the tutorial quite a few times, he encountered his first few battle and also a year long lot of  friends. 
The first battle consisted of a one on one battle against Arcanists User: Jref8, who teamed with Zappy for the next few days.
After not having seen Jref8 for a few days, Zappy encountered a bunch of new pals and teammates. The team included Arcanists Users: Slashy_8, Mini_Micro8, Brobrobro_6, Zelavenger and 
Stuff_U33. All were met on over 5 games and ended up playing together for sometime.

Over the next few months Zappy played many people both wining and losing while learning what he could have done better. Playing a lot with Good friend, User: Funny_Fruit1. He enjoyed playing team but also had fun playing FFA. He played against hard out players like N_0_V_1_S,  X_ G_O_D, R3match and more. Although losing to them has gained more confidence in playing and challenging himself more a non-member.


'''Nicknames, accounts &amp; Imitates'''

To most people, everyone calls Zappy_Flash just plain Zappy. To Zappy's closer friends they know him as Zappeh.  Other nicknames Zappy is usually called by is Zap, Zap Zap or Flash. As a joke he was once called Nappy_Rash.
Zappy's Definate accounts are Zappy_Flash, Zappyflash, Zappeh_Flash and Zcyler (old account)
Imitates of Zappy come from a variety of Zappy_Flesh to Flash_Zappy and more


'''Origin of the Lobby'''

By September 2008, Zappy had come across the lobby, in the middle of a country VS country argument. He eventually joined in &quot;because it looked like fun&quot; and by the end of the argument he made a new friend by the name of Hero_Antony1. After a while, Zappy continued to play the usual games of arcanists though by October 2008 he had recently started to get bored of just playing. He once again came back to the lobby were a bit of Roleplaying was happening and joined in and found his best and closest friends on Arcanists: Awesemo109, Arcane_Chick, Cooljared90, Crymson_Xyra, Idrnk2mch, Sparda_X2. After that day he found the Lobby more exciting and his flame for enthusiasm for arcanists. 
Other Users he's quite good friends with is Saphirablur, Catnap14, Noobmolympic, Reaper X 10, Corkless, R Ising S Un and a whole lot more.

'''Other Arcanists stuff'''

By April 2009 the lobby had started to get boring and not many people came on as they used to.  Zappy soon found Scholae Palatinae and got on it as often as arcanists and has also started to play and enjoy arcanists once again.

== '''Personal Life''' ==
'''
Out of the 8 siblings Zappy has, only 3 of them play Arcanists: Twin Sister Zparky_Flash and and younger brothers twins Leon_Sparky and Zippo_Zone.
Zappy goes to school from 8:25AM to 3:25PM from Monday - Friday with the favorite subjects of P.E, ICT and Art. He tends to play a lot of sport that ranges from Basketball and Soccer to Track and Field. In the car or Bus he plays Pokemon D/P/PL on the DS as well as Guitar Hero. He loves playing with his Siblings as well as their Pets at home (badly wanting a ferret) When at home, he chills out in the Arcanists lobby or on the SP Forums.
Apparently he may have a problem on his right eye as he tends to run into poles, or slowly reacts towards that side. His latest accident happened at a basketball game where he was elbowed on his right cheek feel unconscious and almost got a concussion, making his gum a bit swollen.

|}

To find out which version of the software you currently have, you can click on '''Help''' and '''About''' in the Question Writer Menu Bar,  the version number will also appear on the top left of the application window.


To install a new version you have to take 2 steps:

#Uninstall the old version
#Download the new version

===Uninstall the Old Version===
Before you can load a new version of the software you should uninstall your existing version.  This can be done automatically via your computer's operating system (eg Windows Vista or Windows XP) or manually.  We recommend that you try the automatic uninstall option first.

====Automatic Uninstall====
You can usually uninstall the software satisfactorily by using 

Control Panel -&gt; Add/Remove Programs (Windows XP / 2000)

Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; Uninstall Software (Windows Vista)

Choose the 'Question Writer 4' entry and the software will be uninstalled.

====Manual File Deletion====
You should always try to automatically uninstall the software first when removing the software. Following that, you can also try to manually delete all the files associated with Question Writer.

You'll need to choose your system setting 'Show Hidden Files And Folders / System Files'. There are steps on how to do that here
[http://www.xtra.co.nz/help/0,,4155-1916458,00.html]

Remove the following directories from your file system -

'''C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4'''

'''C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4 Basic'''

(Windows 2000 / Windows XP)

'''C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Central Question Ltd'''

(Windows Vista)

'''C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Central Question Ltd'''

Replace 'Your Name' with your user name or the profile name with which Question Writer was installed.

===Download the New Version===
This is relatively straightforward.  You will find a link to the download on the newsletter or email that we sent informing you of the update, or on the relevant Blog article.  In addition the download link on our website will always download the latest version of the software: [http://www.questionwriter.com/download.html]

When you click on the link the download will start automatically (unless your browser prompts you to take some action).  Once the file is downloaded, you can simply open or run the file and the Question Writer Installer will install the program - you will be prompted to answer some questions about where the files should be stored and who should be given access to the software (if there is more than one person using your pc.)

Question Writer will automatically detect if you have a valid license and install it.  If your license is not valid for the upgrade, you can purchase an upgrade online.

== Photo of different species used? ==

This entry makes use of a phot from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cirsium_vulgare_flowers_Anstey_Hill.jpg. This photo is puported of another plant species, Cirsium vulgare, so brings into doubt the reliability of this article.
:Yes, it looks like an incorrect substitution was made by a bot. I have fixed it now. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 18:17, 24 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me'''

My name is Sandra Ciaston, and I'm in the Licensure Only PreK-6 program at ODU.  I have a B.S. in Bus. Admin. from Oregon State University and worked for the Treasury Deparment for 11 years before deciding to stay home and raise my 3 kids.  They are all in school now and I'd spent so much time volunteering in their classrooms and loving every minute of it that one day the light bulb went off and I thought &quot;I want to teach!&quot;  The children are who inspire me, but it's my parents who I aspire to be like.  They are both retired elementary educators and I grew up in their classrooms helping with everything from correcting papers to designing bulletin boards to reviewing books.  From them I learned that teaching is not just a job.  It takes a special caring person who is truly dedicated to helping their students succeed to be a great teacher and they are both the finest examples of that.  

I am an &quot;older&quot; student, but that just means I have more life experience. ;)  

I live here in the great metropolis of Suffolk with my husband, three kids and one fat hamster.  

'''My Educational Philosophy'''

I have done a lot of teaching over the years, in church, as a volunteer in my children's classrooms, and for the Treasury Dept., but have never had my own classroom.  I would like to be an &quot;active&quot; teacher, and by that I mean someone who constantly engages the students through activities and interactions.  I want to make learning interesting and even exciting, even when the subject isn't.  Because there is so much diversity in today's classrooms with regards to needs and abilities, I foresee alot of group learning.  Hopefully there will be a good amount of technology available for the students to use.  When age appropriate, I think all students should learn how to self-review and self-assess.  Critical thinking skills are so important to succeed in today's world!  Reading skills are paramount.  It's not enough to learn from a book, what do you do with that knowledge?  How is it applied to something else?  I hope to motivate the students to keep thinking about the next step.  What if...

I also feel that students have the right to a classroom that fosters a good learning environment where they feel comfortable asking questions and expressing their ideas.

I hope that I will be able to teach in a school that allows teachers to use the assigned curriculum as a guideline only and encourages creative teaching in order to reach as many students as possible in the classroom.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">financial ratios help us for better understanding of business'  previous and future financial position and it s operating result, specially when we have tow year or more financial statement of a business. also, these ratios help us find critical items in auditing  because there are relations between the financial statement items. For example suppose that in a company in second year sale, accounts payable and inventory were decreased in the other hand accounts receivable  and expenses were increased a simple analysis with financial ratios can tell us what happened and will happen for company. some answers can be: 
1- the operational activities have decreased .
2- the company has lost the market.
3- the sale prices has decreased
4- inventory has damaged 
and ...
if we have the numbers we can better find out the cause 
financial ratios dividend in to :
1- liquidity ratios
2- leverage ratios 
3- activity ratios
4- profitability ratios

      <text xml:space="preserve">Noob Note:

&quot;5. To be able to render using this environment, you may need to enable YafRay. Press F10 and change the &quot;Blender Internal&quot; to &quot;YafRay&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Rendering: left with Blender, right with YafRay&quot;

I don't get it.. If Blender Internal doesn't support it, how did you get the left image? I don't have Yafray, can I make something like that (colored GI) with just Blender Internal? I'm completely lost, trying to use a fake GI (icosphere dupliverts stuff) outside a ball with some alpha and transparent shadows to get a similar effect, and it's &lt;s&gt;a pain in the _ to get it working!&lt;/s&gt; alive, finally! Bwahahaha! I feel so proud of making it work I am even considering making a tutorial! Unless, of course, I can't understand my own spaghetti code, I mean, scene...
P.S.: Unless also there's a much easier way like on the left render.</text>

[[File:GIMP-Toolbox-TransformCrop-Icon.png]] '''Shift + C'''

The Crop tool can be used to crop or clip the image, working on all layers of the image (both visible and invisible). It can be used for removal of borders, or unwanted areas of the image to centre the focus on the work.

To crop the image to selected size, double-click inside the box, or press '''Enter'''. The crop box can be resized by dragging at the edges and corners. To move it, click and drag on the crosshairs at the centre.

* '''Current layer only''' - works only on the current layer
* '''Allow growing''' - allows to expand beyond borders
* '''Expand from centre''' - expands selection, using starting point as the centre, instead for the corner
* '''Fixed''' - allows you to modify the actual shape of rectangle
* '''Position''' - placement of the selection to crop
* '''Size''' - size of the selection to crop
* '''Highlight''' - highlights the actual selection, by darkening everything that surrounds it
* '''Guides''' - select the types of guides shown within of selection
* '''Auto Shrink''' - shrinks the selection to the nearest rectangular shape available on the image layer
* '''Shrink Merged''' - if this option is enabled, then Auto Shrink will use the pixel information from the visible display of the image, rather than from the active layer

== Current layer only ==
Crop tool will only work on the currently selected layer, instead of working on all existing.

== Allow growing ==
Allows Crop tool to expand beyond borders of the image/layer, and crops along with the outside area.

== Other options ==
All other options work as described in [[../Rectangle Selection/]] article. See sections [[../Rectangle Selection#Expand from centre|#Expand from centre]] to [[../Rectangle Selection#Shrink merged|#Shrink merged]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==THE LAW AND THE COVENANT==
The purpose of the Law is to instruct us in God's righteousness which was manifest in the life of Yeshua the Messiah and as part of that instruction, to provide us with principles of conduct (doctrine), and reproof and correction of ungodly behaviour  (2 Timothy 3:16).

Just as the scripture tells us to train up our natural children in the way they should go, so we as spiritual children need to be instructed and trained in the way of righteousness  (Proverbs 22:6; 1 Peter 1:23, 2:1-3).

However, we are under a different covenant with a different priesthood and so there is a change in the application of the Law.  The Law of God has not changed, it is eternal, but our relationship to it has changed.
So we need to consider how these changes in the covenant and the priesthood affect the application of the Law.

==THE NEW COVENANT==
When the scripture prophesies about a new covenant in Jeremiah 31:31-33, the word used is 'renewed' (chadashah), not 'new'  as in newly created or 'new', as to it's age.  The word &quot;chadashah&quot; refers to something that has undergone a reformation in character and purpose, or a simple reappearance on a different scale.  In the new covenant scriptures, the Greek word is kainos, and means &quot;new as to form or quality, of a different nature from what is contrasted as old&quot; (Vine's Expository Dictionary). It does not mean &quot;new in age&quot; (neos). 
So it was not prophesied to be a different covenant but a new improved form of the previous covenant which had already been upgraded several times to allow for changes in the nation's responsibilities.

In ancient treaties, if one of the party's situation changed, then part of the covenant could be amended (or renewed) as required to adapt to the new situation, but everything else remained in effect exactly as before. 

The New covenant is a compilation of all the former covenants made with Abraham, Moses, and David which were encompassed by and fulfilled in Yeshua the Messiah. He fulfilled them in Himself, thus making a 'new' covenant of the former ones in an &quot;improved&quot; form, for the benefit of the participants int he covenant.  The terms of the previous covenant was obedience to His Law which at that time was written on tablets of stone made personal by the means of the fringes on their garments  (Numbers 15:38-39). Now, the terms of the covenant are the same, except that the law is written on human hearts.  It has been internalised by an impartation of His Spirit, making it a &quot;better&quot; covenant  (Deuteronomy 4:13; John 15:9-14; 2 Corinthians 3:3).

Just after enacting the new covenant with His disciples in the Last Supper, Yeshua stated the terms of the covenant. It was to be based upon them obeying His commandments and the promise on His part was that He would send the holy Spirit from the Father to dwell in them (John 14:15-18).  The 'new', improved covenant was in them having His Spirit within them and His Presence with them to personally guide, instruct and empower them (John 14:18, 20, 25-26; 15:26-27).  

The covenant was also an upgrade from servant-hood in the old, to being &quot;friends&quot; in the new as partakers in the advent of His coming kingdom and glory.  But it was all based upon obedience to His commandments, just as it was in the previous, original  issue of the covenant. 

A covenant always has terms and promises which each party commit themselves to fulfill. 
Notice how many times Yeshua stressed the point of obedience to the commandments - 
in John 14:15, 21, 23, 24; 15;10, 14)
&quot;If you love me, keep My commandments&quot;
&quot;He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me&quot;
&quot;If anyone love Me, he will keep My word&quot;
&quot;He who does not love Me, does not keep My words&quot;
&quot;If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love&quot;
&quot;You are My friends if you do whatever I command you&quot;
And the covenant was sealed with His prayer in Chapter 17 of John, that they would be united in one Body with the godhead and be partakers of His glory.

==THE NEW EXPECTATION==
God's laws, His principles for man to live by, are eternal and unchanging but the measure of responsibility in His covenant that He gives to man, can vary upon his spiritual growth and maturity. Because the Law is now internalised in man's heart by faith, there is a higher expectation upon those in covenant relationship with Him, to love with the same type of love with which He loved.  Previously, it was to love one's neighbour as oneself.  Now it is to love as He loved us - a self-sacrificial type of love. This was the new commandment given for the new covenant, not displacing the other commandments, as Yeshua still referred to the Father's commandments which He had kept as those which He had embraced and now imparted to them (John 15:9-10).

Because of the better promises of receiving the divine nature, there is an expectation and responsibility upon the new covenant believer to manifest the more elevated quality of the divine nature in their life (2 Peter 1:1-7)

The bond of the covenant is a love relationship and it is out of this love relationship that we are to obey Him.

Israel was brought into the bond of the covenant at Sinai which was in the form of a betrothal contract, the terms of the covenant being the keeping of His Law out of their love for Him (Deuteronomy 6:6; 30:11-14).  

Because of the weakness of the Law by itself to enable fallen man to keep the commandments, they broke the covenant many times (Jeremiah 31:32).  The Law had no power to change the heart of man because it was a &quot;fleshly commandment&quot; whereas the new covenant imparted the power of His eternal life, as quoted, &quot;the power of an endless life&quot;, to enable us to walk in the Law (Hebrews7:16).

&quot;For on one hand there is an annulling (to put of no value, to set aside - Vines) of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.&quot;  Hebrews 7:18-19

The previous covenant was ineffective or 'weak' - i.e. it was powerless because it &quot;made nothing perfect' in the condition of fallen humanity. It gave the outline of Yahweh God's requirements without the power to perform it.
We have two different terms used here - 'commandment' and 'law', differentiating the commandment to obey, from the whole context of the Law of Yahweh God, which is eternal and unchanging. Now, in the new covenant, the commandment to obey is empowered by a changed heart fulfilling the prophecy of the new covenant, 
&quot;I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be My people&quot;  (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10b)

The new covenant believer is no longer &quot;under the law&quot; in servitude to the Law, but is enabled to live &quot;in the law&quot; through His life. The Law, in its written form in the old covenant could not give life and therefore did not effect righteousness (internally) in those who kept the law (externally). &quot;For if there had been a law which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the Law.&quot;  (Galatians 3:21)

The living embodiment of the Law, Yeshua the Messiah, now indwells the believer so that if he abides in the relationship which he has with the Redeemer and walks in the Spirit of the Messiah who indwells him, he will fulfill the 'works' of the law, the outward acts of righteousness in the liberty of the Spirit.
&quot;But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law&quot;  (Galatians 5:18)

&quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Yeshua the Messiah, has made me free from the law of sin and death.&quot;  
The life of the living &quot;Law&quot;, of the Messiah has released us from the penalties of the broken Law (Romans 8:2). Therefore, when we live in His Law, we are living in His love, in union with the Father and the Son.

&quot;As the Father love Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.&quot;  John 15:9-10

This is the benefit of the &quot;better&quot; covenant, based upon &quot;better&quot; promises  (Hebrews 7:19,22; 8:6).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Please Add Links==
Both readers and writers will need these links as they read and write.

Please Add
*Official Developer Documentation links
*External Tutorial links.

these are very valuable, and everyone will benefit by you adding your links.

== Plans ==
I think I started off with the wrong approach before, this book should start at the beginning and walk people through using GTK+, it has a very complicated system for a person who is not use to it.

== Print version ==

An [[w:Immutable interface|interface]] is the public methods of a class. They are declared with the &lt;code&gt;Implements&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

To create an interface:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Interface Interface1
   Function Function1() As String
End Interface
&lt;/source&gt;

To use it from a class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
Public Class MyClassFromInterface
    implements Interface1()
    ' by pressing enter the IDE creates automatically the implemented interface elements:
    Public Function Function1() As String Implements Interface1.Function1
        ' ...
    End Function
End Class

See [http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk-tutorial/stable/x159.html Theory of Signals and Callbacks Tutorial].

==Real Life Analogue==
Think of a fortress with gates, the gates remain open unless someone is attacking.  How does the fortress know of an attack, It has Signal Towers that burn a fire, and a person watching the towers, to sound a warning bell and the guards close the gate.

We need some code that works and follows the real life analogue.

      <comment>/* Complex Types */  added a link to the online glib docs</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Glib type system aims to simplify programming cross-platform programs, we will spend a small amount of time explaining why.

==Basic Types==
See [http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/2.20/glib-Basic-Types.html basic types] in the Glib API.

===Why Reimplement Fundamental Types===
Glib re-implements the fundamental C types in order to ensure cross-platform protability, this also makes it easier to program on multiple platform, because you can be sure of what your data looks like in memory.

==Complex Types==
See [http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/stable/glib-data-types.html complex data types glib implements].

Glib implements some commonly used non-scalar data types.
*Doubly and Singly Linked Lists.
*Balanced B-Trees.
*Enums

      <text xml:space="preserve">See the [http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/ GObject Developer Docs].

See [http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/howto-gobject.html creating a Gobject] for an example on deriving objects.

GObject is implemented in Glib and builds Objects in run-time (unlike C++ and many other object oriented languages which do this at compile tim).
*similar to C++, using vtables.
*explicit upcasting and downcasting.
*Capable of meeting the three tenets of OOP. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming The Wikipedia Article]).

==Example==
create a person that says &quot;hi my name is xxx&quot;. when person::talk is implemented

create an example dr_phil that inherits from person and says &quot;And hows that working for you?&quot; when person::talk is called.

this should provide us with deriving a first object, which is a pain to learn. and how inheritance works in Glib.

===What needs to be explained===
*type check and type cast macros
*the purpose of get type
*the order in which objects are instantiated
**creating object
**construct and desctructor methods
**the difference between class and instance
**virtual functions

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;u&gt;Ethical issues with ECGs&lt;/u&gt;:'''
ECGs can be a very powerful diagnostic tool. However, they can occasionally yield misleading or false information. 
Taking drugs such as warfarin can prevent life thretening blood clots from forming. But, if it's taken in the wronge dose it can cause fatal bleeding. 

Doctors may occasionally decide it's inappropriate to diagnose and/or treat patients:

1. If it's against someone's religion or belief system,

2. If it's against a patients wishes, or

3. If there's no benefit to the treatment, or the side effects outweigh the benefits.

      <comment>general cleanup, typos fixed: straight-forward → straightforward using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You need to know the advantages and disadvantages of using each method and suggest, with reason, which methods could be used in particular situations.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''X-rays'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

X-rays are powerful, short wavelength electrochromatic waves. They can be used for:

Bone fractures and dental decay- clear images can be produced quickly.

Lung examination- damaged tissue and fluid build up visible.

Narrowing of coronary arteries, using X-ray opque dye- obstruction can be detected in the coeonary arteries of the beating heart. 

Disease of digestion tract, using X-ray opque dye- obstruction can be seen.

'''Advantages'''

Widely available

Quick and straightforward to use

'''Disadvantages'''

Harmful, particularly to gonads and unborn children.

Can cause localised tissue damage, cancers or damage that is passed on to the next generation

Soft tissues cannot be easily distinguished

2D images only. 

&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''CAT scans'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Radioactive tracers'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Ultrasound'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
Advantages
The main advantages of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are that:
•they do not involve exposure to radiation, so they can be safely used in people who might be particularly vulnerable to the effects of radiation, such as pregnant women and babies,
•they are particularly useful for showing soft tissue structures, such as ligaments and cartilage, and organs such as the brain, heart, and eyes, and
•they can provide information about how the blood moves through certain organs and blood vessels, allowing problems with blood circulation, such as blockages, to be identified.

Disadvantages
The main disadvantages of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are listed below.
•MRI scanners are very expensive; a single scanner can cost over a million pounds. This means that the number of scanners that a Primary Care Trust (PCT) can afford to fund is limited. Therefore, if your condition is non-urgent, you may have to wait several months to have a MRI scan.
•The combination of being put in an enclosed space and the loud noises that are made by the magnets can make some people feel claustrophobic while they are having a MRI scan. 
•MRI scanners can be affected by movement, making them unsuitable for investigating problems such as mouth tumours because coughing, or swallowing, can make the images that are produced less clear.

Can widgets be themed individually and in a reasonable way? I don't believe that will be possible until GTK+3. this book is not speculation, will be removed if I find otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About This Book==
[http://www.gtk.org GTK+] is a cross-platform Graphical User Interface programming library, it is most commonly used in programs intended for the GNOME desktop environment.  


GTK+ is supported in
*UNIX/Linux
*Mac OS
*Microsoft Windows

==Prerequisite Knowledge==
We will assume you have a solid foundation in C programming, enough to use functions, pointers and work with multiple files.

==Aims==
*In order to make our first release we should set ourselves a few small goals. Maybe you could suggest one or two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understand that stars and galaxies are detected by the electromagnetic radiation which they emit, whilst planets are detected by reflected sunlight ==


Stars, galaxies and planets are all visible to us here on Earth, but the reasons for our ability to see these stellar bodies differ:

* Stars and Galaxies - these themselves emit electromagnetic radiation, and can therefore be detected using this source

* Planets - these are not themselves sources of electromagnetic radiation, and are therefore only detectable via the sunlight which they reflect

== Sketch and interpret a graph to illustrate the variation with wavelength of the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere for the electromagnetic spectrum. ==


The ability of the different types of electromagnetic radiation to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and therefore be detected on Earth varies within the spectrum. It can be broken down into three absorption categories: opaque (undetectable on the Earth's surface), partial absorption (some radiation makes it through, some doesn't), and transparent (radiation easily passes through the Earth's atmosphere).

* Opaque - includes: X-rays, Ultraviolet, and Long Wave Radio

* Partial Apsorption - includes: Gamma, Infrared, Radar Radio

* Transparent - includes: Visible, UHF Radio, Short Wave Radio

Follow this [http://en.wikivisual.com/images/8/83/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_transmittance_or_opacity.jpg link] for an example of this graph.

== Explain how the composition of stellar atmospheres may be obtained from stellar spectra ==

We can find out which chemical elements stars are made of from the radiation we don't receive from them. To explain this we need to consider the atoms of the emitting substance. an atoms comprises a very small, massive nucleus surrounded by a much larger volume which is sparsely occupied by electrons. When an atom absorbs energy, one or more of these electrons may become 'excited', i.e., jump to a higher energy level. if an excited electron then returns to its original energy level, energy is released as radiation. The wavelength of the radiation emitted by a particular electrons depends on precisely the amount of energy it releases as it returns to its unexcited state. the larger the amount of energy released by an electron, the higher the frequency - and the shorter the wavelength - of the radiation it emits

Stellar spectra include: continuous spectra, emissions spectra, and absorption spectra.

* Continuous Spectra - radiation of all frequencies within a certain range. When atoms are very close together, as in a solid or the dense matter of a star, there are so many different interacting forces that the electrons in atoms make jumps of all sizes within a certain range.

* Emissions spectra - a set of individual lines from which individual elements can be identified by their particular lines. When atoms are well separated, as in a gas, each type of atom emits its own distinctive wavelengths of radiation, which can be separated using a diffraction grating.

* Absorption spectra - the spectrum produced by the radiation from a star, or more specifically, the radiation from the atoms in the atmosphere of a star. It is a continuous spectrum with dark lines missing - Fraunhofer lines. These lines are representative of the elements present in the atmosphere of the star. Of the radiation emitted from the stars surface, some is absorbed and re-emitted in all direction by atoms in the atmosphere, meaning much less of this wavelength radiation is travelling in the original direction of travel, and therefore much less is reaching us, producing a dark line, a negative version of the characteristic emission spectrum of the atmospheric element.

These chemical elements can be identified by comparing the dark lines in the aborption spectra with the emission spectra of the individual elements present in the stars atmosphere.

== Understand what is meant by the Doppler Effect ==


Doppler Effect - the change in wavelength of a source due to the relative motion between the source and an observer.

== Recall and use Δλ / λ = v / c ==


A source of wavelength λ emitted at speed c takes λ/c seconds to emit one complete wave. If the source is moving away from the observer at v ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the wavelength observed will have increased by Δλ, therefore:

:: Δλ / λ = v / c

== Understand what is meant by red-shift and by blue-shift and appreciate simple differences between red-shift and terrestrial Doppler Effects ==


Red-Shift - the observed increase in wavelength (reduction in frequency) caused by an emitter of radiation and a detector moving away from each other

Blue-Shift - the observed decrease in wavelength (increase in frequency) caused by an emitter of radiation and a detector moving towards each other

Terrestrial Doppler Effects on light are so small that they are barely noticeable, and so are only observed for sound and water waves (for example, the sound of a motorbike). The speeds of recession for planetary Red-Shift are a great enough proportion of the speed of light, c, to produce noticeable effects on light waves.

&quot;Red-Shift is the Doppler Effect for light.&quot;

The '''common snowdrop''' (''Galanthus nivalis'') is the best-known representative of a small genus of about 20 species in the family [[../Amaryllidaceae/]] that are among the first bulbs to bloom in spring.

==Description==
&lt;!--Physical description of the plant.--&gt;

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--Sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
===Single flowered===
* ''Galanthus nivalis'' Poculiformis Group - inner segments are almost same length and shape as outer ones, usually unmarked and without a &quot;sinus&quot; (notch); includes such cultivars as 'Sandhill Gate'
* ''Galanthus nivalis'' Sandersii Group - marks on inner segments are yellow instead of green; includes 'Sandersii' and 'Lutescens'
* ''G. nivalis'' Scharlockii Group - &quot;donkey's ears snowdrop&quot; with elongated spathe split down center, resembling upright ears

===Double-flowered===
* ''G. nivalis'' f. ''pleniflorus'' 'Blewbury Tart' - upward- or outward-facing flowers with dark green markings in the center
* ''G. nivalis'' f. ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno' - doubles, usually quite untidy rosettes of extra segments of uneven length
* ''G. nivalis'' f. ''pleniflorus'' 'Lady Elphinstone' - a version of 'Flore Pleno' with yellowish coloring inside the flowers instead of green; may revert or vary from year to year
* ''G. nivalis'' f. ''pleniflorus'' 'Pusey Green Tip' - with small green tips to the outer segments

Double-flowered forms such as ''Galanthus nivalis'' f. ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno' may be less attractive to the eye of the purist. There are numerous cultivars (cultivated varieties), single and double, differing particularly in the size and markings of the flower, the period of flowering, and other characteristics of interest to keen (even fanatical) collectors known as &quot;galanthophiles&quot;. 

'''Other notable species:'''
* Crimean snowdrop, ''[[../Galanthus plicatus/]]'', 30 cm tall, flowering January/March, white flowers, with broad leaves folded back at the edges
* Giant snowdrop, ''[[../Galanthus elwesii/]]'', a native of the Levant, 23 cm tall, flowering January/February, with large flowers, the three inner segments of which often have a much larger and more conspicuous green blotch (or blotches) than the more common kinds.

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--Discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
Propagation is by offsets removed when the plants are at rest, immediately after the leaves have withered; or by seeds sown either when ripe, or in spring. Professional growers and keen amateurs also use such methods as &quot;[[w:twin-scaling|twin-scaling]]&quot; to increase the stock of choice varieties quickly.

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage.--&gt;

==Pests and diseases==
&lt;!--Discuss pests and diseases.--&gt;

Blender can render still images and video to many different file formats. Here is an alphabetical list:

* '''AVI Codec''' - AVI codec compression. Available codecs are operating system dependent. When an AVI codec is initially chosen, the codec dialog is automatically launched. The codec can be changed directly using the Set Codec button in AVI Codec settings.
* '''AVI Jpeg''' - AVI but with Jpeg compression. Lossy, smaller files but not as small as you can get with a Codec compression algorithm. Jpeg compression is also the one used in the DV format used in many digital camcorders.
* '''AVI Raw''' - Audio-Video Interlaced (AVI) uncompressed frames.
* '''BMP''' - Bit-Mapped Paint is an early lossless format.
* '''Cineon''' - format produced by a Kodak Cineon camera and used in high-end graphics software and directed toward digital film.
* '''DPX''' - Digital Moving-Picture eXchange format; an open professional format (close to Cineon) with meta-information about the picture; 16-bit uncompressed bitmap (huge file size). Used in preservation.
* '''FFMPEG''' - Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group is a collection of free and open source software libraries that record, convert and stream digital audio and video in numerous formats. You must have the proper codec installed on your computer for Blender to call it and use it to compress the video stream through FFMPEG, but there are preset formats to choose from, such as DV, SVCD, and DVD.
* '''Frameserver''' - Blender puts out frames upon request as part of a render farm. The port number is specified in the OpenGL User Preferences panel.
* '''HamX''' - Blender's own self-developed 8 bits RLE (Run Length Encoded bitmap) format; it creates extremely compact files that can be displayed quickly. To be used only for previsualization of animations (Play button).
* '''Iris''' - the standard Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) format used on Unix OS machines.
* '''JPEG''' - Joint Photographic Experts Group (name of the consortium which defined it), an open format that supports very good compression with little loss of quality. Only saves RGB value. Re-saving images results in more and more compression and loss of quality.
* '''JPEG 2000'''
* '''MultiLayer''' - an OpenEXR format that supports storing multiple layers of images together in one file. Each layer stores a renderpass, such as shadow, specularity, color, etc. You can specify the encoding used to save the MulitLayer file using the codec selector (ZIP (lossless) is shown and used by default).
* '''OpenEXR''' - an open and non-proprietary extended and highly dynamic range (HDR) image format, saving both Alpha and Z-depth buffer information.
* '''PNG''' - Portable Network Graphics, a lossless image format often used in web design. 
* '''QuickTime''' - A proprietary multimedia framework for video and images.
* '''Radiance HDR'''
* '''Targa'''
* '''Targa Raw'''
* '''TIFF''' - Tagged Image File Format created by Aldus for desktop publishing.

If the selection seems daunting, here are pointers:

If you need transparency in your images (i.e., an alpha channel that allows any part of the rendered image to have varying degrees of opacity), or you will be compositing, you generally want to use:

* Multilayer 
* PNG
* OpenEXR
* Targa

Of the above four formats, you will find that PNG and Targa images can be opened and edited by most any bitmap editing application, such as GIMP or Photoshop. However, OpenEXR and Multilayer offer more options within Blender, and may produce smaller, lossless files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Necessary Components==
* 1 ruler
* 4 square magnets
* 9 steel balls
* Some sticky tape

Put 2 steel ball each in front of the rule as if they were sticking to each other.

Put the last steel ball at the behind of the rest of the steel balls, for example:

0  = Steel Ball.
[] = Magnet.
~  = Rule.

Steel ball that fires. ---&gt; 00[] 00[] 00[] 00[] 0 &lt;--- Last steel ball.

Push the last steel ball into the magnet and watch the steel ball that fires move away from the rule at a very high speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey guys! My name is Heather. I currently reside in a small town in southwest Virginia called Cleveland. I obtained my bachelors degree in Biology from Radford University in 2007 and now I am taking education classes to become certified in teaching. I am married to my high school sweetheart and we have a beautiful baby boy named Lincoln. He just turned six months old and is trying so hard to crawl. Becoming a mother has changed my life to say the least. Before Lincoln I was very impatient, self-centered, and fly by the seat of my pants type of girl. Now I have patiences, put my son before me in every aspect, and have to throughly plan everything. I enjoy softball, wakeboarding, and scrapbooking. Even though I am slowly creeping up on 30 I feel better than I ever have. I am very thankful for my family and the experienes that I have had throughout my life thus far. Hopefully I will finish my education classes by the end of year and be a certified high school biology teacher by fall of 2010.:)



'''Education Philosophy'''
I firmly believe that a teacher is one of the most influencial people in the world. I still remember two of my favorite teachers and the techniques that they used in their classroom. I enjoy being in the classroom challenging young minds and molding them into young scientist. I am more of a &quot;hands on&quot; type teacher. I feel that most people learn by performing. Lab experiements are great learning techniques because they incorpate textbook material into a live situation. I am all for group work as well. I think working in groups adequetly prepares students for jobs later in life because most of the time we all have to work together to complete a task given by employers. Group work also introduces new ideas to other students that aid in completion of an assignment. 

Upon entering my classroom you would find it to be very well organized with posters on the wall pertaining not only to science but life as well. There would be work stations for students to perform lab experiements along with different types of microscopes. I would hope to have a smartboard located in my room so I could show clips off the internet and have students interact with technology. Science and technology go hand in hand so students need to be introduced to as much technology as possible. I believe that as educators we need to collaborate together to acheive a positive atmosphere for our students. We are role models and we need to dress, act, and socialize in a proper manner. We also need to share ideas on how to manange certain problem students and help those with special needs. I try to treat special needs students the same as I treat regular ed students. Just because they have a learning or phyisical disability don't mean that they can't be taught the same material as regular ed students. The school system is vital in all aspects. It is an educational dwelling place which we should hold in our hearts forever. As educators we should never forget that we lay a solid foundation for students and mold them into the people that they are today and the people that they will become.</text>

gcc -o&lt;file to output&gt; &lt;input&gt; `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

*notice the `` characters, they are telling the command line to process this first and then use then place the output here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ohma-stublink|Vinca minor}}
'''''Vica minor''''', usually called '''Periwinkle''' or simply '''Vinca''', is a spreading evergreen vine commonly grown as a ground cover. It bears a large set of flowers in mid-spring, and then flowers sporadically the remainder of the year. Various cultivars are available in the trade, with flower colors ranging from white through pink, reddish-purple, lavender, and dark purple. Cultivars with variegated leaves are also available.

== Culture ==
''V. minor'' grows well in both full sun and fairly deep shade, though a bit thinner in shade. It spreads as a vine, rooting both at the nodes and between the nodes. It does best in a rich soil, but tolerates poor soils. It is drought tolerant once established, but does not do well in wet soils.

As a ground cover, ''V. minor'' spreads rapidly, but does not grow dense enough to suppress weeds. It can also be very difficult to keep weeded if spreading perennial weeds gain a foothold (such as ''[[../Duchesnea indica/]]'', ''[[../Artemisia vulgaris/]]'', ''[[../Cirsium arvense/]]'', [[../Vetch/]], etc.), since the wire-like vines of the plant form a dense tangle that makes it difficult to remove the weeds without also doing damage to the plant itself.

== Introduction ==

Hi to all you WIKI-savvy readers out there.  This is a charming little introduction into my life, where you have the privilege of learning a little something about me.  My name is Angela Beck; and I am a early-twenties, spunky, red(ish)-haired beach bum.  If you are intrigued then, by all means, continue reading.  I live in an apartment in Norfolk, VA, and this is the city where I attend Old Dominion University.  Go Monarchs!!  My major is Music Education, with an emphasis in vocal performance.  I plan on continuing my education while teaching at a secondary level and performing.  When my life is not consumed by constant rehearsing, studying, and working, then I enjoy reading sappy romance novels, going to country music concerts, and hanging out with my very best friends.  I was just initiated into Sigma Alpha Iota, which is a fraternity for women of music, as an officer.  

Music has always been a huge part of my life.  It all began with the influence of my mother, who was a former musical-theater actress in New York City.  I have always had a passion for the arts, and as I have grown older I found that I have an artistic soul.  Music is everywhere now, and we tend to take it for granted.  It is on the radio in your car, in the elevator as you change floors, at every sporting event, and graces the screen for television shows and movies.  As a society we do not even notice when music is playing in the background, and have a deep feeling of absence when it is missing.  Music is the only thing which has lasted through the ages, and has a vital role in every society around the world.  As long as there has been recorded time, there has  been music.  I feel that something so vital in this world, should be taught and respected.  I want to teach music, because music is so much more to me than a background track.  I want to share this with young people, so they can learn to pass on and appreciate this intricate history.

== My Philosophy of Education ==

When it comes to education, there are very different things you do in a formal classroom setting and a music classroom.  For the sake of this article, I will be discussing instances in a formal classroom.  With the huge growths in technology, it is very important for students to become familiar with technological programs and systems, in order for them to be able to function to the best of their ability in the work place.  The purpose of education is not only to help grow children into well-rounded people, but also to train them to function in the real, adult world.  This world is becoming more and more technology based.  In terms of instructional strategies, it is important to be able to teach one subject in many different ways.  Every student has different learning abilities and ways of learning, therefore, an effective teacher should make sure to use varieties of teaching tactics in the classroom.  It is also important that most students are held to a certain standard.  It is the teacher's job to help each student to reach this standard.</text>

      <comment>/* My Teaching Philosophy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Introduction''' ==

My name is Edgar Hernandez, but everyone calls me Bebe. Im from Luquillo, Puerto Rico and I have been living in Norfolk, Virginia for the past two years. I have played baseball all my life and it was the main reason to move to Virginia and attend Old Dominion University. I was inspired to teach by many of my teachers during the course of my student career. There is always the good teachers and there are the ones everyone dislikes, but from all of them I learned something different. I want to be the teacher that makes the difference in a kid's life, and why not do it by teaching spanish to students in the United States. This way ill be giving them a tool that they will need for the rest of their lives. From my struggles from moving from a spanish dominated island to the mainland of the Unites States and from the everyday issues concerning immigration I feel it is beneficial to all if students learn a foreign language. 


== '''My Teaching Philosophy''' ==


I feel that teaching strategies and/or philosophies vary from the personality of each educator. My philosophy of teaching is simple yet complex. I want to apply a curriculum of foreign language education composed to basic pronunciation, grammar as well as making the student culturally aware of the world around them. Inspired by the growing immigration rate the United States faces and the quantity of bilingual job demands in the nation, I feel is beneficial for my students to learn a different language. It would help them find a better job, be culturally aware and enhance their communication skills. My classroom will have a diverse yet even number of assignments between lectures and groups. I feel that when teaching a foreign language education, group works amongst students is helpful. Lectures will be incorporated so that each student s can learn something, therefore when working in a group each student can incorporate what they know to the benefit of their group. 

I feel that an assessment of self evaluation is important in the beginning of our class period. If the majority of the students are visual or auditory learners. I feel that I can incorporate these features in class to help each student tot heir own learning needs and study habits. I could: include pictures in over-head projectors or my power point notes and presentations. Or I can play tapes for pronunciation for those who learn better by listening.</text>

Hi there!  I'm new to editing and I'd like to place my vote for a proposed Wikijunior book about the Alphabet.  I'm willing to help with the book.  As near as I can tell the voting page has been &quot;locked??&quot; and your name is one of the last ones to have edited that page (I think).  Did you lock it?  If yes, may I ask why.  If no do you know who did and why they might have done that?  If you wouldn't mine emailing me a copy of any reply you might have, I'd appreciate it--Thanks.  christystockman _AT_ yahoo _Dot_ com   --[[User:Christystockman|Christystockman]] 07:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
                             
== Deletion against community consensus ==
Hello Jon,

I'd like to ask you to revert your deletion of {{bad link|Transwiki:List_of_tongue-twisters}} (done at 18:29, 29 May 2006) because the result of the debate was '''Transwiki''' (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_tongue-twisters]). I'm afraid it would be somewhat unfair to act against community consensus. On the discussion page, nobody at all proposed, supported or agreed on deletion.

This list was a considerable collection made by several people during years, something that is certainly of interest by illustrating the differences of languages in terms of [[:w:phonology|phonology]], [[:w:morphonology|morphonology]] and [[:w:morphophonemic|morphophonemic]], and I doubt how it could be &quot;not suitable for wikibooks&quot;.

Thank you! [[User:Adam78|Adam78]] 14:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have sent you an email containing the deleted text and noting why it is unsuitable for wikibooks and should not have been sent here by wikipedia in the first instance. I am willing to extend this courtesy to others (provided they are not too many), but really an admin on wikipedia should undelete the content from there to allow the page to be transwikied to a suitable location. If the email does not arrive (it was somewhat large), please let me know, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:23, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

== {{bad link|Illustrated Guide to the world of Spira (FFX and FFX-2)}} ==

:Done!!! I tagged all images and pages that I moved with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{deletebecause|cs7-author requests delete - moved to FF Wiki}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; which puts them in the category for speedy deletion, hope it helps! [[User:Renmiri|Renmiri]] 20:46, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== You're WAY out of line! ==

Deleting a complaint from a fellow writer/editor is beyond the pale. You should be ashamed of yourself. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 00:28, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I wouldn't say you were out of line, but for future reference, you should be a little more reserved when you declare a particular user as a vandal. Entering into an edit war was certainly not appropriate behavior from a user using an open proxy, but the edits he was making were benign enough. I would have listed him on [[Wikibooks:Problem users|Problem Users]], but I would not have blocked him without some sort of confirmation from another user. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:51, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

This is an example of a user who has previously vandalised wikipedia coming over here with a series of open proxies to make disruptive, trolling edits (as easily shown by the complete lack of discussion by the user prior to my blocking, and then using open proxies to post the old wikipedia complaints of &quot;administrator abuse&quot; as soon as the disruptive account is posted. Wikimedia also has a policy of blocking open proxies on sight, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with your action, I only feel that it was maybe a bit to hasty. We could have avoided the whole discussion entirely if you waited for a second opinion on [[WB:VIP|vandalism in progress]]. The fact that this same open proxie has previously vandalized wikipedia does not necessarily imply that this particular user was that vandal. General policy states that we shouldnt bite the newcomers, and that we should be hesitant to label as a vandal a new user. Even though this user did engage in an edit war with you from an open proxy, his edits were benign and some would even say beneficial. Again, the fact that he didn't discuss the issue on any relevant talk pages before rolling back your edits is suspect, but only indicative of a newcomer, and not of a vandal. Being bold is a prized attribute here, but being hasty and reckless are not. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:29, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

On reflection - yes, I could have been slower, or introduced more discussion earlier, to allow for confirmation of my initial view that this was not a new editor acting in good faith. I will certainly bear that in mind going forward. However, in this instance, my initial suspicion proved correct - it was someone, familiar with Wikimedia wikis, who was using open proxies (and I guess you're aware of [[m:WM:NOP]]) to come here to disrupt wikibooks. Once blocked, after a warning, said user moved to another open proxy to continue the trolling.

However, I will certainly bear in mind how to deal with such a similar event in the future - and will probably act slower and investigate fuller unless there is widescale disruption. I accept that next time it may be a new ''bona fide'' editor that I am dealing with. 

Getting back to this user, however,once (s)he is identified as using open proxies (and engaging in troll-type behaviour) it is quite correct to have no truck at all with this user (and I'm tempted to block the obvious sockpuppet account, [[User:Julie]], although I probably won't do so unless it is used for further disruption).

I would add that, where we do have a troll, I think it is irrelevant as to whether that troll raises issues that some Wikibookians may wish to discuss between themselves. The disruptive user should go, leaving ''bona fide'' Wikibookians alone to have that discussion if they so wish. Anyway, thanks for your note, I am suitably chastened (although mindful that in this case, I was dealing with a genuinely disruptive user). All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:47, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:Trust me, I know policy, and I agree with your decision. But, this is the second time in recent memory (with the other being the fiasco over the alt.internet.wireless FAQs) that you have acted hastily and created a stir. I would not be so quick to judge [[User:Julie]] as a sockpuppet, or a user editing in bad faith. While we should not feed the trolls, we most definatly should not bite the newcomers either. The argument to use BCE/CE over the BC/AD labeling convention is a valid argument, and so far [[User:Julie]]'s contributions on the subject, though posted without a signature, are respectful, in apparent good faith, and therefore admissable. I started a discussion on the matter on the main talk page of that book, and have already received some good replies. I am not here to chastise you, but instead I want to let you know that I am supportive of your bold actions, so long as they are for the best and they do not cause undue strain on the community at large. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:45, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

Ah, got your reply (wasn't watching this page). What went over the line from my view was deleting another person's input on the lounge page (which I assume is the local version of the village pump). It contained no cursing, YELLING, etc., and so should have at least recieved a curt answer, rather than being deleted. (I still have no idea what the war is about, as neither of you linked the book in question.) [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 19:35, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

== archiving ==

[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archive 20#CommonsTicker.21|5 days]] is a bit quick, isn't it? :/ I'll just assume wikibooks has no interest whatsoever in a project that can easily help them better manage their Commons images, then... [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 10:28, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

:Geez, you should see the [[commons:Commons:Village pump|Commons:Village pump]] if you thought the Staff Lounge page was long... :P
:It takes a small amount of work to set up, but after that it just runs itself (barring any unforeseen problems). Because this is an English project, we don't even have to write any translations for the interface. There is detailed information [[m:User:Duesentrieb/CommonsTicker#Creating_a_Ticker|here]] explaining what to do (basically how to set up [[Wikibooks:CommonsTicker]] and the template for it to use). It's good if you can use IRC to talk to Duesentrieb just through the set-up. en.wikt has theirs running now and their admin thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread. en.ws has just requested one. (en.wp can't run one until the toolserver/corrupt database problem is fixed.) --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 14:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

== The Peanuts stuff ==

Way over at Wikipedia, the powers that be decided to transwiki all of my Peanuts annotations to Wikibooks.  Since that was an official policy decision, I assumed that means that they qualify for inclusion, so I've started making tha pages.  Should I not do that?

Here's a page.  See the top banner: [[w:The Complete Peanuts: 1955 to 1956 Annotations|The Complete Peanuts: 1955 to 1956 Annotations]]

Also, Wikibooks has a special annotations section.

--- Reply to last message:  Ah, yes, I was mis-informed.  OK, delete away.
-KXL

: How exactly does your claim that &quot;they ought to have the feel of a textbook, rather than just be a series of what are essentially footnotes&quot; fit in with existing Wiki-&quot;books&quot; like [[Accelerando Technical Companion]], which sure looks like a collection of footnotes to me.  Or, indeed, with the '''enforced policy''' &quot;Wikibooks includes annotated texts&quot;?  In short, did you discuss your arbitrary decision to delete this content with anyone else, or does it just reflect your own personal prejudice?

== Category:Candidates for speedy deletion ==

Jguk,
I put a large majority of the modules in [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] there, and if you are going to delete them, could you pay special attention to the comments I left for the delete, and let me know if they are alright? For exapmle, in some modules with one or two sentences, I just left the comment &quot;no content&quot;- maybe I should leave a more specific comment? Also, the wikibooks [[Gmail]] has been listed at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], so don't delete that yet- I'll revert the speedy delete templates on each page. Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

== Help, please... ==

I'm having a hard time adjusting from WP to WB... do you have time to walk me through a couple things? Assuming you're willing, here's a few questions:

1. Is there a way to set up a TOC on the main page of a WB so that it automatically adds new chapters when they're created? If not, how does one find new chapters that might have been created?

2. Is it better to set up a glossary of terms in a wikibook, or just use &quot;w:&quot; links when a term seems like it needs a bit of explanation?

3. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with what I'm working on ([[Horticulture|A Wikimanual of Gardening]]). As I move the WP how-to stuff over here, I feel the next step should be to rm the stuff in the WP article and leave a link to the appropriate chapter of that book. Am I asking for trolly edit wars here? (Well, I'm not asking, but will it be percieved that way?) Any advice on handling that part?

4. During our little scuffle last week, I noticed that you responded to me here (on your talk), rather than on my talk. Is that the normal thing on WB? (I don't like &quot;watching&quot; other people's UPs... makes me feel like I'm eavesdropping).

-[[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 18:03, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for your quick and informative reply. Have questions about it though... would you mind watching my page so we can continue the discussion there? [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 19:02, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

== Revert of Lazyquasar's home page. ==

Thanks for the attempt to correct vandalism.  For reasons I will not go into my computer drops the account cookie from time to time.  I have changed my page back to let friends and aquaintenances that I will not be wasting time here for a while.  Perhaps if the stacked board ever approves stable URLs I will be back, perhaps not.  It looks like the special appointed committee and other existing project partisans are slowly eviscerating the idea of an online university.  Please leave my message announcing a walkabout as is this time.  Thanks again.  [[user:lazyquasar]]

== [[Template:Main Page content]] ==

I changed the one heading from &quot;Wikiversity books&quot; to &quot;Wikiversity Schools&quot;. I didnt realize that this change had previously been made, and that you had reverted it back, until I looked in the page history. The resources being linked to under this heading are the actual school pages of wikiversity (akin to the bookshelf pages here at wikibooks proper), and each page linked to is in the format &quot;School of X&quot;. I think that is makes more sense to name them &quot;schools&quot;, and not &quot;books&quot;. If you still disagree with this, then we can start a discussion on the template's talk page, and try to find concensus. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== RE:My book guide ==

You raise a good point, in that entire guide I never once explicitly mention the target audience. I tacitly assume, I think, that the target audience will simply be &quot;students&quot;. However, different subjects are taught differently to different groups of people. For instance, Engineering students learn things differently from physics students, who learn the concepts differently from math students, etc. I'll go back to the guide and add in a section about a target audience. Thanks for the feedback! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:24, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==
Hi Jon,

I noticed you created a category for my book, [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  Since I'm the primary on that, I was wondering what I should do from here on out.  Why make a category for a single book?  I'm just looking for guidance here, and wanted to know what you had in mind.

== Nomination for checkuser rights ==

BTW, since [[User:Uncle G]] has seemingly dropped out of sight and [[User:Derbeth]] has apparently received the 25 necessary votes to get checkuser status, we need an alternate candidate for checkuser rights to help fill the requirements of having this sort of privilege on Wikibooks.

I hope you would consider accepting your nomination on [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] for checkuser rights.

While I do have many disagreements with you, I do appreciate the efforts you have made on Wikibooks and you are not a random troll trying to patently destroy this project.  I also find it very healthy to have a diversity of opinions and have appreciated your comments on the various talk pages and even the mailing list.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:03, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

:I just wanted to let you know personally that my '''neutral''' vote on your nomination doesn't mean I dislike you or that I want to punish you or anything, I'm just being cautious. When you start getting upwards in votes, and no more issues are raised, I will gladly change my vote, and petition others to vote in your favor as well (assuming you accept your nomination, which I think you probably should).

I'll have to make some better templates for [[Horticulture|A Wikimanual of Gardening]] so you don't have to keep categorizing them. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 15:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Control Systems]] ==

I see that you added this category to every page in the [[Control Systems]] book. I think it's a good idea to mark these pages with this template. However, I wonder if we should put the template into the {{tl|Control Systems Page}} template, that is already at the top of every page in this book. I've already been using page-header templates in other books to put a category designation on every subpage. Which method do you think is better? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:40, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== Page locks for transwiki archives... ==

Hi Again,

Yet another question about transwikied material that I'm using for source materials in [[Horticulture|A Wikimanual of Gardening]], namely, I'd like to see the original versions protected, rather than edited (an IP user has done this once or twice. I would be putting these under &quot;Volume/Chapter/Transwiki&quot;. Is that a good idea?

== PHP Programming ==

Given the functionality of a page such as [[Special:Prefixindex/PHP Programming|this one]], in addition to cross-linking in the main pages of most PHP articles, is it necessary to add category tags to each individual page related to PHP?  Imo, it would be better to add the category tag to the main page of each wikibook project related to PHP instead of linking every single page with PHP on it.  As the number of PHP-related pages grows, it will become increasingly difficult to get any real use out of the category page as it will have more and more pages listed with little to no context.

Or is the functionality I described above better suited to Portals?  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 19:32, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

== Adding categories ==

I'm curious...

Why are you adding categories to a whole bunch of pages that there is already a logical link to them?  Certainly it isn't hard to get from most Wikibooks to their &quot;parent&quot; page or a table of contents in most cases without having categories.

I certainly don't mind putting the Wikibook &quot;title page&quot; in a category or something like that, but this seems counter productive and useless information by adding every module page into a category that is essentially just a book name anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe if I can answer this point here. The aim of categorisation is to allow any user to drill down to any module on wikibooks through using categories. 

:As each module can be in more than one category, categorisation allows for relationships between different modules to be identified. It also has the benefit of listing out all pages in each book and of making it easy to follow all recent changes made to pages in a book (including new ones added) by using the &quot;related changes&quot; function on the category page. Admittedly for some modules, these benefits are less than for others. However, in no cases does categorisation present an impediment (ie there is no downside to categorisation). For some subject areas, categorisation will, I think, become a key way of locating material, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 04:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

:: By categorising each page in a book when categorising the book would be sufficient, you overcrowd the categories page, making it less useful.

:: I asked in my first comment on your talk page whether this practice had been discussed somewhere. The reason is that I believe that every book and every page will need a different categorization scheme and rushing off to categorize everything by some simple criteria isn't neccessary the best way to assing books and pages to the most fitting categories.

Your adminstrator right are not a toy - think twice before you delete.

And just in case you don't know what a transclusion is, that's one:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Learning the vi editor/Moving around}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which results in

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
| {{:Learning the vi editor/Moving around}}
|}

Shure on it's own it looks a little lost but look at it in context: [[Learning_the_vi_editor/Vim#Moving_around]] or [[Learning_the_vi_editor/Basic_tasks#Moving_around]]. If you delete a transclusion source you cripple the pages which include them!

== Thank you for editing help ==
Hi, Jon.  Thank you for help in editing for [[Water Resources Directory]] with its many pages.  My intention for this large book project is to contact many water resources professionals, who are not Wikibookians (but soon will be), to ask them to contribute.  But this project can't move along until the dreaded [[VfD]] sword is removed from the book.  Could you please help out by voting to keep?  Thanks very much for considering. I noticed your discussion with Rob Horning about the educational content for Wikibooks at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Inclusion_criteria/Proposal  --  [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 21:27, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
:*Thank you, Jon.  This is a big help, and now I can move the project forward. -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 11:52, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

== Categories (2) ==

Hi Jguk,

There are a number of redundant categories in the How-to sections... hope you don't mind me consolidating them (it looks like you had created at least some of them). I've been thinking about a good structure for this section: see [[User:SBJohnny/howto_guidelines_worksheet]] for details (feel free to edit, of course). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:56, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

:Please reorganise away, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

Hi again,

There's been a few cases where things have been miscategorised (unrelated books starting with the same letter being categorised together... don't worry, I know how it happens). I've cleaned up the smaller ones as I went along, but I've been tagging the larger categories to {{bad link|Category:How-to categories needing cleanup}}, should you be in the mood for a rote task. (They're not all how-tos... one I just found while on NPP, but the first ones were, so I figured I'd keep them all in one place). 

BTW: any thoughts on my RfA? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== Note to all admins ==

As i mentioned at the voting proposal, I want to send out a simple message asking all active admins to come take a look at the discussion. I say &quot;admins&quot; specifically, because the addition of committies, arbitration/mediation, or other structures would affect the the duties and responsibilities of admins (as well, perhaps, as the admin selection criteria). Here is the text of the note that I am going to send out, let me know if it is fair:
:I would like to personally call all active wikibooks admins and users to come take a look at the proposed version of the [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal|General Voting Rules policy]] that is currently under discussion. The current text of the policy puts a focus on &quot;consensus&quot; as the primary method of making decisions. However, it has been asserted that such a policy would allow disruptive or stubborn users to &quot;block&quot; votes, or prolong them indefinately. This policy has the power to affect all users here at wikibooks, and it is imperative therefore that all users read the proposed text of the policy, and join in [[Wikibooks talk:General voting rules/Proposal|the discussion]]. 
Thanks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

::By all means go for it. Kellen's rewording looks to have merit in it - it does not, of course, pick up on Robin's concerns directly, but it doess set out the options someone has if a decision goes 'against' them, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

I took the liberty of separating out the multiple subversions we have had about this proposal:
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] My original version of this policy.
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Jguk's version 
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] RobinH's revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Kellen's version
This way we can look at them side-by-side, and (hopefully) weed out the versions we dont like, and improve the versions we do like. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:35, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Proposed reform]] ==

After we get the [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] policy enforced, I would like to start reworking policy to fill in the holes that (i think) we have here. I like alot of your proposed changes on this page, and I would like to work with you to make alot of them happen. I know there are some other users as well who have expressed interest in working on many of these policy changes. If we could team up and work out a priority listing of changes that we can work on, we can start to take care of them one at a time. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:30, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

==Proposal to make [[Roman Catholicism]] no rights reserved==
As the creator of the book and principal editor so far, I propose to make the [[Roman Catholicism]] book no rights reserved. Would you be OK with that? If so, please mention it on my talk page and/or the module's page. Since several other people have edited it, it will either be necessary to get the other editors' OK's or to not use their additions. Hopefully I can get the OK from the admins. [[User:JBogdan|JBogdan]] 16:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

Hi Jguk... are you popping in from time to time? The uncategorised pages list is quite long again...

:Helpful and levelheaded as always, Jguk, thank you for your reply! You do make some very good points: (1) we shouldnt be making policy decisions with a bad taste in our mouths, (2) we should rewrite it to be more friendly, and (3) I need to work on my participles. I've mentioned before that I am not dead-set on having the ownership stuff included in the decision making policy (although [[User:Darklama]] is, i think). It seems we need to excercise more thought in this matter before we make any changes. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

==Do you want to volunteer as a potential member of editorial boards? ==

See [[Wikibooks:Volunteer_editors]]

Also [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]],[[Wikibooks:Wikipublish]] and the discussion in the staff lounge. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:04, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

&lt;pre&gt;I would like to volunteer
 all my services to the 
starcraft wiki-book. It needs a lot of new pages 
and as it stands, has poor coverage of UMS maps.
There are few things I know more about than sc.
I also ask that you choose to disregard on
the main wikipedia, I have no remorse for what
I did and those guys deserved it, but I really
want to help with the sc wikibook.&lt;/pre&gt;

== [[Wikibooks:Blocking Policy]] ==

I saw your message on the new blocking policy proposal, and I wanted to personally get in touch with you about it. There have been instances lately (and i wont list any names) where admins have have been more &quot;bold&quot;, and less interested in community or courtesy. I can't fault people necessarily, for following the '''be bold''' mantra that we are always chanting. The problem arises because there is the [[Wikibooks:Be bold]] guideline, but there is no counterpoint talking about when it isn't appropriate to be bold. What I want to avoid is people saying &quot;I think this other admin is wrong, so I was bold and corrected him&quot;, or &quot;I didn't want to wait for community concensus to use my admin tools, so i went ahead and used them anyway&quot;. These kinds of statements are dangerous and should not be tolerated.

Another point that you brought up is the issue of some wikibookians using all this additional policy as a way to find fault with admins. The more rules we create, the more likely it is that an admin will violate those rules (even by accident). I understand this concern, but at the same time i feel that admins should be held to a higher standard, and that we can tell people &quot;thou shalt not&quot; when we give them all the shiny new buttons of adminship. When in doubt admins shouldn't use their powers, and it is always better for us to say &quot;don't use your powers in the following few situations&quot; then it is for us to mandate that admins ''must'' use their powers in particular ways. 

I hope this helps to ease some of your concerns. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:39, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

Hello,

As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]

Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.

To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!

Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.

Hope to hear from you.
Regards [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 19:47, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Me ==

Hello everyone! My name is Angela Elizabeth Dart, and I am a senior attending Old Dominion University for a Licensure in PreK-6. I have an A.S in Social Science from Thomas Nelson Community College in Hampton, Virginia and I hope to complete my Master’s degree after completing my Bachelor’s. I currently live in Newport News, Virginia; however, I was born in Brunswick, Georgia. Since my father has worked in and for the military, I have lived in New York State, New Jersey, Alabama, and even Germany. My family consists of my mom and dad, and my younger brother David, who is currently going to Thomas Nelson Community College. I also have a German shepherd named Dakota, who I got as a puppy during my stay in Germany. My hobbies include reading and writing, and I also enjoy doing crafts such as cross-stitching. Since I am not a very good at drawing or painting, cross-stitching seems to be like a good alternative. I enjoy being outside, but I also love computers and technology in general. I spend most of my time on my computer and the internet, and I really enjoy searching the internet for various student and teacher resources. My favorite subjects, besides the educational courses, are social sciences and English. I also love learning different foreign languages; in high school, I took Japanese, French and German. 

When I first became a college student, I had no plans of doing anything in education. I actually pursued a degree in Social Science, because I originally planned on becoming a child psychologist. I love children and helping them in any way that I can. Although I love the subject of psychology, I felt that I would be more beneficial as an educator than a psychologist. Therefore, after completing my A.S, I transferred to Old Dominion University to become a teacher. While it will be many years before it can become a reality, my goal in life is to open my own school for children, particularly underprivileged children. My dad, who is attending Regent University for a Doctorate’s and is currently working on his dissertation, is slowly convincing me to earn a Doctorate’s of my own to become a principal or superintendent. 


== Philosophy of Education ==


My philosophy on education is that each child has the ability to be unique and “stand-out” as a student and a person. The only aspect that is required is that the child has at least a strong support system in the classroom where he or she can freely express themselves, display their strengths, adjust their weaknesses and learn not just an academic lesson, but lifelong lesson as well. Classrooms are extremely more diverse than they were 20, and even 10, year ago, by race, ethnic groups, children with special needs, and even gender. I believe that children’s background do play an important role in their academic success. However, I also believe that a child’s background should not define what or how they learn. Instead, it should be the student themselves who define what and how they learn. In many cases, educators use stereotypes and misconceptions to teach certain students. While they may have good intentions, they are harming the student more than helping them because they are only exposing them to a small portion of learning. 

The whole purpose of learning is to learn more, because learning is a life-long process. By doing using misconceptions at a critical stage of a child’s life, students grow thinking that a limited amount of information is acceptable, when they should be constantly expanding their knowledge. In my honest opinion, a good teacher is someone who is constantly encouraging and challenging their students at the same time. Classrooms will be consisted of below, on, and above grade level students and often, teachers may limit these three groups of students based on their readiness level. I do believe that each student has their limits, one may be of just passing, and another may be on the next grade level. However, it is the obligation of that educator to push their students beyond their limits so that when the children go home, they do so with a sense of accomplishment. It also teaches students that when there are completing a task, they should always do so to the best of their ability.    

When it comes to diversity, I think it takes very gifted educators to recognize the diversity among their students and use it to bring the students together, despite their different backgrounds. In the past, the term diversity usually referred to children with disabilities and special needs. However, diversity now refers to children with disabilities and special needs, as well as immigrant children or children of immigrants, “at-risk” children, and even gender. Students who have special needs do require more attention and assistance of the instructor, but it does not mean that the instructor has to alienate the class for the special need student or alienate the special need student from the class. Even though they have more severe disabilities than the class, they are still students and should be as actively involved as possible. Boys and girls also should not be taught differently from each other. Often misconceptions or unreliable research makes teachers discredit students based on their gender. I believe that educators should occasionally read professional journals and articles about the thought process between boys and girls, because they may be able to play to the strengths of students. However, this should be done very carefully because each child is different, and thus, learn different. Educators should essentially take note of research but not depend on it. 

Another important aspect of my educational philosophy are the instructional strategies I will employ in the classroom. One of the first things that I will have to be aware of as an educator is to know when my activities are teacher-centered and student-centered. Some lessons and concepts will most likely have to be teacher-centered. However, the majority of activities that I teach should be student-centered. Otherwise, my class will depend on me to give information instead of using methods to find information themselves. As a teacher, I should be scaffolding more than directing more.  I will also have to balance the amount of activities that are individual and cooperative. As a student myself, I prefer working alone, however, I am also aware that there will be situations that will require me to work with several people. Likewise, there will be students who prefer working in groups, but will have to learn how to work by themselves. Therefore, a balance must be established so that children recognize that their preferred working style is fine to have, but there are also times when we must do the opposite as well. As far as student requirement, the only aspect I will require is for every student to do the best that they can. Each student is different, and it is unfair to place the one requirement on all of them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When getting a vehicle started from scratch with a base tune the first thing you need to tune is the main fuel table. It is also wise to look at your cold enrichment and throttle enrichment to make sure they are okay (meaning supplying a safe A/F ratio). Having the throttle modifier up will fight any changes you make to the base table. So, unless you have the modifer off at low throttle percentage, all your numbers will always be changing. After looking over the enrichment tables start tuning the base fuel table. The first thing you will want to do is tune neutral (to hit the low or no load cells) all the way up to max RPM. After that, start to work up slowly in load and work through the RPM ranges making sure to keep the numbers as smooth as possible. After all, the low load and part throttle mapping is done and you can tune WOT. If the vehicle is not knock limited or has high octane fuel then for tuning I recommend 11:1 for the A/F ratio. This is not a sell value but a span of best A/F ratio over time but flame speed is the fastest at just enrichment of 11:1. The slower the flame speed the more chance you have of abnormal combustion. depending on the vehicle more fuel may be needed at WOT to aid in the cooling effect, especially vehicles that have a huge thermal load put on them from a turbocharger. After the fuel map is done you can move to the ignition map.

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. It's free and requires no personal information. Here are some advantages:

* A username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* Your own personal user page and talk page.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will directly attributed to you.
* The use of your own [[Help:Watching pages|watchlist]] to monitor pages that you are interested in.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].

Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].
Be sure to sign your talk page comments with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

| {{#if:  | |&lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;
{{mbox|type=warning|This template must only be used on '''User [[Help:Talk page|discussion]]''' pages.}} }} }}

Thanks for your reply on my talk page. I've replied to it there. Since you're a returning user, I do encourage you to sign up. It makes communciation easier, gives you a few more tools and if you're worried of privacy, actually does more to ensure it since your IP address isn't shown.

Take care and happy editing, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:20, 23 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

I grew up in Richmond va. Then, I moved to Newport News to go to Christopher Newport University. After recieving my BA in Music, I moved to Norfolk to go to ODU and get my teacher's license. I have no idea what motovated me to be a teacher, it just seemed like a good idea at the time. I can remember some good teachers, such as Mrs. Hearst the crazy chorus/ strings teacher. And I guess it's a good thing that children don't grow up uneducated. Currently, I work at Schlotzsky's Deli. I enjoy walks on the beach, midnight strolls, and candle light dinners.

A good teacher's first goal should be to care about every student. The teacher should see the full potential in the student and remind them of it. They should listen to the student. They should be able to motivate the students to do work. A good teacher organizes the material so that it makes sense to the student. They should be able to teach the big picture, the details, and how it connects to the larger world.

There are instructional strategies, classroom environments, and assessments that I would like to use in my classroom. Lecture and group assignments should be balanced. I am against extra credit, because extra work is a consequence, not a reward. On nice days, class should be outside, and students should be able to move around every so often. In younger grade levels, parents should be highly involved. Oral assesment is very important. They can guess on multiple choice, and look things up for essays. It is a very important and difficult skill to be able to judge yourself, and it should be stressed, but younger kids may not be able to handle it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me'''

My name is Debbie Nielson, but my user name is Scarlett1 so there is no confusion.  I am currently living in Bremerton, WA and I am going through the teacher prep program K-6, through Old Dominion University. I am a dual major with psychology as my second major. My husband has been in the Navy for over 15 years and we have been all over the world. We bought our first house 2 1/2 years ago and love it. We have a 16 year old daughter and a 6 3/4 year old daughter (her words adamantly). We have two dogs, a female red-nosed pit/chocolate lab mix, and a male Bichon Frise. We also have a dwarf bunny named Pixie. Currently, I am working as the store manager for a pizza chain managing about ten or more employees and working about 60-70 hours a week. As for hobbies, sleep is a good one. I enjoy people, places, and things that make me laugh. I think laughter is the key to longevity and good health.

'''My Inspiration'''

I want to be a teacher simply because I enjoy watching children learn and want to be a part of their learning process. Children amaze me in what they say and how they interact with one another. My youngest daughter, for instance has changed her name a couple of times, with the latest being ''Chocolate''. My parents were educators most of their lives.  My mom taught kindergarten, fifth grade and eighth grade learning disability classes for over 30 years before retiring.  My dad was an elementary school principal until he retired after 30 years...however, he has gone back and is still currently working as a principal for a charter school. My dad told me the other day that &quot;teaching is the greatest gift you can give to the world and you will never regret a moment&quot;.

[[File:Scarlett1 girls.jpg|200px]] &lt;center&gt; ''The Girls'' &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


'''My philosophy of education'''

All children can learn when they are given the right tools. 

''My philosophy on learning''

There are different ways in which, children learn. I think it is beneficial to figure out the student's learning style. I would like to have a classroom that is not based solely on lectures. I believe being active in one's learning process is more interesting and favors better retention in the end. I would like to see my students become involved in all aspects of the classroom from group assignments to individual assignments. I think doing self-reviews and peer-reviews are important for students to see the overall picture of the assignment. I am an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinker. I taught a reading class about Egypt and the pyramids. Along with lecturing, I brought in sand, paint and other objects for the students (these were high school students)to make their own pyramids. I also had them write a letter in hieroglyphics. Finally, as a treat, we watched Stephen Sommners &quot;The Mummy&quot;.

''My philosophy on curriculum''

Curriculum is an important issue to me. I believe that there should be a required curriculum for all schools, however, I do not think that creativity should be banned and the curriculum strict. Without creativity, in my opinion, students will become bored and learning is lost. If the subjects are taught in a mundane way without any variation to make them interesting, the time summer rolls around will usually, forget them. Some schools today focus more on science, math, and English than PE, art and music. Having a well-rounded selection of programs not only makes the school popular, but I believe students receive a better education. I have heard many times, that schools need to focus on the &quot;important&quot; subjects so that they can compete with Japan or China in terms of test scores. It is my belief that students will be more motivated and less stressful if they have classes that focus on their creativity and abilities, as well as academics.

''My philosophy on technology''

Technology in the classroom is imperative because it is a way for students to visit outside of the classroom. There are so many different kinds of technology available to schools that it would be a shame not to utilize them. Teaching students how to work with different kinds of technology will help them to become marketable in the future. It has been my observation, that children pick up the knowledge of how to use technology at a young age sometimes faster than adults do. As a result, this will benefit them greatly after they graduate and move into the workforce.  

''My ideal classroom''

I picture a classroom where the desks are all in a circle so that everyone is facing each other...
I picture a classroom where the students get to take turns giving the lesson and interacting with one another...
I picture a classroom where pneumonic's are used as a way to remember things...
I picture a classroom where there will be drama, music, and physical activities to go along with the lesson plan topics...
I picture a classroom where each child will have a &quot;buddy&quot; to work on special projects with...
I picture a classroom where students will not only learn a subject, but '''why''' it is important to learn the subject...

      <text xml:space="preserve">NIGHT SERVICE FOR SHAVUOT
 
1.  INTRODUCTION

Shavuot is known as Z'man Matan Torateinu, the celebration of the giving of the Torah.  

On Passover, we celebrate the miraculous Exodus of the People of Israel from Egypt.  At the end of the seven weeks of spiritual preparation as they journeyed to Mount Sinai, Yahweh God presented them with the covenant contract which we know as the Torah/law and in so doing they became His kingdom of priests on the earth, His holy nation.

Tonight we commemorate the original giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai which is the written terms of the covenant agreement of our betrothal unto Him, and rejoice in the light that His Word gives to our Way.  We also rejoice in the giving of the Living Word to us in Yeshua the Messiah which we have received through the outpouring of the Spirit that he sent after His ascension to sit at the Father's right hand on the day of Pentecost/Shavuot, seven weeks (50 days) after His Resurrection.   The experience at Sinai was a 'miqra', a rehearsal of what took place at the commemoration of that event in 30AD when Yeshua the Messiah wrote the Torah upon the fleshly tablets of our hearts by the manifestation of His Spirit in tongues of fire.  (Acts 2: 1-4; 2 Corinthians 3: 3)

This day is the anniversary of the Birth of the new covenant Assembly.

When they stood at Mount Sinai, Moshe &quot;brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.   Now Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire.   Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.  And when the blast of the shofar sounded long and became louder and louder, Moshe spoke, and God answered him by a voice.&quot; (Exodus 19:17-19)

2.  BLOW SHOFAR  -  One long blast

This is the first shofar of the prophetic year, Yahweh Himself sounded the shofar as He will also when He returns.  The final shofar, the last trump, the Great Shofar, is blown on the Day of Atonement and finalises Yahweh's redemptive plan for mankind.

3.  CANDLE LIGHTING  -    (Shavuot begins after the start of the Biblical day, so as to give the forty-nine completed days)

Blessed are You Yahweh our God, Who has given us Your Word to be a lamp unto our feet and a light to our path. (Psalm 119:105) As You came on Sinai with Your lightnings  - light up our lives with Your Presence and renew Your Spirit within us, we pray.

Blessed are you Yahweh our God, King of the Universe, You have given us Your Torah of Truth, and have planted everlasting life within our midst and enabled us to reach this time.  Amen

4.  SHAVUOT GREETINGS  -    &quot;Chag Shavuot Sameach&quot; (Happy Celebration of Shavuot/Pentecost)

5.  OPENING PRAYER

6.  SCRIPTURE READING  -   Numbers 28:26-31;  Psalm 24: 3-10;  Revelation 19:7-8

7.  CEREMONIAL HAND-WASHING  -  Rachatz

&quot;Yahweh said to Moses - go to the people and consecrate them  -   let them wash their clothes&quot;  (Exodus 19:10)

For us that speaks of our spiritual garments - that they are washed and clean.
As we have been Counting the Omer, we have been going through a process of sanctification to come to this day with the joy and expectation of meeting with Yahweh.  

Yeshua the Messiah came by water and by blood and it is the Spirit that bears witness.  As we go through the washing in this water, in an act of faith we apply the cleansing power of the blood to our lives and it is the Spirit Who bear witness, to cleanse us and sanctify us to enter His holy Presence this night.  (1 John 5: 6-8)
(Hand washing in bowl of water)

Blessed are You Yahweh our God, Who has ordained the washing of the water by the Word to sanctify us (Ephesians 5:25)

8.  PRAYER

Reader   -  	Praise Yahweh to whom all praise is due. 
Congregation  -  Blessed be Yahweh to whom all praise is due forever and ever. 
And in Your great compassion I will come into Your house.  
There will I bow, there will I fear Your holiness.  

9.  BLESSINGS OF THE TWO CHALLAH LOAVES  -  (to be set aside)

These two loaves represent the firstfruits of the first harvest season, of God's spiritual harvest from the earth. They represent His two witnesses in the earth, the Houses of Judah and Ephraim or Jew and Gentile as it is today.
We set these wave loaves and all they represent, apart and consecrate them as a testimony and a tribute to the Lamb. 

&quot;For You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth.&quot;
&quot;Blessing and honour and glory and power be to Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, forever and ever!   Amen&quot; 
											 Revelation 5: 9-10, 13)
Blessed art Thou, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us in the blood of the Messiah, and commanded us to separate the challah. 

10.  MESSAGE

When Yahweh thundered from Sinai, His voice took the form of visible sound waves and actually formed as liquid, audible tongues of fire which looked like streaks of lightning that encircled the camp of Israel and came to rest on each individual person present.  God’s voice as a &quot;fiery substance&quot; split into first seven voices, and then into seventy tongues, of the 70 known languages on earth at that time and the people saw the thunderings (sound waves) and lightnings (tongues of fire - plural, not singular thunder/lightning) and each of the nations represented there heard the Torah in their own language. The Rabbis say that the 'tongue' of fire came to each one seeking their acceptance of the Torah and then like a laser beam engraved the two tablets of stone. At Pentecost the Word was engraved upon the tablets of the human hearts   (Exodus 20:18;  Shabbat 88b; Shemot Rabbah 5:9; Midrash Chazit;  Midrash Tanchuma 26c)
Israel had a Pentecostal  experience in the wilderness! 

When the Spirit was poured out on the believers in the Messiah, who had waited according to His instructions in the upper room, they knew the story of the words of fire resting on each individual.  They knew the story of God’s voice speaking to all mankind in every language.  Therefore they understood the significance of it all in the miracles, signs and wonders that came upon them with the tongues of fire.  The speaking in every tongue was replicating the Sinai experience of receiving the Torah, not on a mountain top, but in them, making them living witnesses of His power and glory in the earth.
The demonstration of power that was manifested at Sinai was poured into human vessels making them vessels of the living word.

&quot;But we have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest, and the sound of the mighty shofar blast and the voice of Yahweh's words which were so overpowering they could not endure it.  But you have come to Mt. Zion and to the city of the Living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Yeshua the Mediator of the new covenant&quot;   (Hebrews 12:19-23 Free translation)

We have come to the new covenant which has given us an impartation of His Spirit to prepare us for the coming harvest of souls,  a Firstfruit offering from the earth which will be presented in the heavenly sanctuary at Messiah's coming. (I Corinthians 15:20-23).
This is what is pictured by the two loaves of bread offered to God on the day of Shavuot/Pentecost!

The outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost 30 AD, is likened to the &quot;former rain&quot; that ripened the Spring harvest that was gathered as an initial harvest of the apostolic era.   

But the Husbandman is waiting for the precious fruit of the earth until it receive the former and the latter rain (James 1:18; 5:7) 
When the harvest is ready, in the eyes of the Father, the Messiah will return.   But, He cannot return to this earth until the latter rain has brought the final crop to maturity and the &quot;first-fruits&quot; are ready to be reaped.  His return cannot occur until there are &quot;firstfruit'  sheaves to be made into wave loaves for the offering, that is, until the Bride has made herself ready!  (Revelation 19: 7)

There will be a final outpouring of the Spirit of grace to bring the harvest to maturity.  This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and it is for this spiritual enabling that we are told to petitions Yahweh, the Lord of the harvest ‘in the time of the latter rain.’ In response, ‘Yahweh shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain.’ ‘He will cause to come down . . . the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain’&quot; in the first harvest.  (Zechariah 10:1; Joel 2:23)

Pray for the tongues of fire to consume all that is fleshly, all that has its origin in the natural realm of this world.
Pray for the tongues of fire to inscribe upon your heart the image and likeness of Yeshua, the Holy One of God. 

Tarry and wait until you be endued with power from on high and are worthy to be chosen as His firstfruits from the earth and rule and reign with Him in His kingdom.

MORNING SERVICE FOR SHAVUOT

1.  INTRODUCTION
In the morning of Shavuot in 30 AD, at 9.00 am. the priest offered the two prepared wave loaves before Yahweh in the Temple as instructed in the Torah which was a commemoration of the time Yahweh manifested His glory on Mount Sinai and called the nation to be His Firstborn of all the peoples of the earth (Exodus 4:22; Psalm 89:26-29).

At that same time, the scripture tells us, Yeshua exercised His High-priestly ministry at the right hand of the Father and dispatched the Ruach, the holy Spirit of Yahweh upon the waiting disciples in the upper room.  (Luke 24:52-53;  Acts 1: 4-5; 2: 1-4)

They had imparted to them the &quot;firstfruits&quot; of the Spirit, the initial deposit which was to bring them to maturity as sons of the living God.   (Romans 8:22-23;  Ephesians 1:13-14)

2.  BLOW SHOFAR        -        One long blast

When Yahweh blew the shofar at Sinai, the rocks and the trees split apart, the whole mountain quaked and melted with His manifestation into the physical realm.   The next time He blows the shofar the Lamb will stand on Mount Zion with His firstfruits offering of those who are without fault before the throne of God. (Revelation 14: 1-5)

3.   CANDLE LIGHTING 

Blessed are You Yahweh our God, Who has given us Your Word as a lamp unto our feet and a light to our path. (Psalm 119:105) 
Blessed are you Yahweh our God, King of the Universe, You have given us Your Torah of Truth, and planted everlasting life within our midst        Amen

4.  SHAVUOT GREETINGS        -  Extend the blessing of peace to one another  -  Shalom Aleichem!

5.  OPENING PRAYER

6.  SCRIPTURE READING        -         Revelation 1: 4-8;  4:1-11; 20: 4-6

7.  CEREMONIAL HAND-WASHING        -        Rachatz
Yeshua prayed the Father to sanctify us by the truth - &quot;Your Word is truth&quot;

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments
(Hand washing in bowl of water)

8.  BLESSING OF THE TWO WAVE LOAVES 

Blessed art Thou, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us in the blood of the Messiah, and commanded us to wave the bread of firstfruit. 
(Two loaves are waved. One loaf left to right and one loaf up and down over the first loaf)

Blessed art Thou O Yahweh, Who gave the Torah to our fathers on Mount Sinai in those days at this season. And Who gave us Y'shua, Your blessed only begotten Son to fulfill the Torah, And Who did send Your Holy Spirit, Ruach haKodesh, as a first-fruit of the Resurrection of Y'shua. 

We bless You Yahweh our God, that according to Your sovereign will You brought us forth by the Word of truth to be a kind of Firstfruits of Your creatures.  (James 1:18)

We present these two wave loaves to You as a symbol of our lives dedicated to be Your witnesses in the earth.

We pray for the restoration of Your House, the two sticks of Ephraim and Judah to come together in these days that we might offer to you an offering in righteousness.

Blow the great shofar to free us, and lift up the banner to gather us in from our exile (galut), and gather us together from the four ends of the earth. Blessed are you, Yahweh who regathers the scattered of his people Israel.

9. MESSAGE

At Sinai, Yahweh gave to us His &quot;ketubah&quot;, the terms of our betrothal contract with Him, written by the finger of God upon the sapphire tablets, in the form of the ten commands.   Now we have that betrothal agreement inscribed upon our own hearts by Yahweh Himself as our guarantee of the anticipated Marriage celebration to come.

&quot;And God spoke all these words saying,  .. ... .. ...   &quot; (Read Exodus 20: 1-17)
&quot;Now therefore if you will indeed obey My voice and Keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people .. .. ..  And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&quot;   (Exodus 19: 5-6)
And the people said, &quot;Whatever Yahweh speaks we will do and learn&quot; (Exodus 24: 7)

The Bible tells us in that at Mount Sinai, God betrothed Israel to Himself  (Jeremiah 2: 2)  Israel entered into a covenant relationship with God, and agreed to be obedient to Him. 

The ketubah, or written betrothal contract, is understood to be the Torah (Exodus 19:3-7; 24: 4,7) which detailed the mutual terms of the marriage contract between Yahweh and Israel as obligations between a &quot;husband and wife&quot;.   (Jeremiah 3:14)

We as believers in Y'shua the Messiah  are spiritually betrothed to Him.  At His second coming, He will marry His new bride, Redeemed Israel.  We will enter the full marriage and physically dwell with Him during the Messianic age known as the Millennium, with all the promises of the covenant brought to realisation.

Ketubah Poem - Optional

My Beloved went down to His garden, to His bed of spices,
To delight in the princess, and to spread over her the canopy of His peace;
&quot;King Messiah made for Himself a Palace&quot;

My beloved, My doe, Come with Me to My chamber, my hall,
For your sake I have left all the legions above, and their host;
&quot;And I have betrothed you unto Me forever.&quot;
Said the Awesome One,
You Who from the time of love I have heard,
And I love Him with an Eternal love,
&quot;May He kiss me with the kisses of His Mouth!&quot;

And the Groom swears to fulfill them all for His congregation,
And to bequeath &quot;Substance&quot; (&quot;Yesh,&quot;) to those who love Him
And who do His will,
&quot;Yahweh swore with His Right Hand.&quot;

And the Bridegroom Acquired five Possessions,
And among them were the Torah and the Testimony,
And the Treasure betrothed,
&quot;And He laid the corner-stone.&quot;

Let the Bridegroom rejoice with the Bride,
He takes for his possession,
And let the heart of the Bride rejoice
With the husband of her youth,
And let her say to the one who sings His praises,
&quot;Happy is the People for whom it is so!&quot;    

10.  PRAYER OF DEDICATION 

The disciples prepared themselves prior to the reception of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost by earnest prayer, confession and forsaking of their sins, and consecration of themselves to God. 
Offering of ourselves   Romans 12: 1 

11.  BLESSING THE BREAD AND WINE   -   Kiddush

The two loaves representing the Firstfruit-Offering of Jew and Gentile was made of the best quality grains of wheat, ground together and sifted into very fine flour.  All the chaff and foreign matter was removed to become, no longer individual grains, but a corporate Loaf permeated by the leavening influence of the Ruach of Yahweh.  

In partaking of this Bread we are declaring ourselves part of the covenant people as One Bread offered to the Father.  
 
As part of this corporate Body and members of one another, we are not only in covenant with Yahweh, but also with one another. Messiah is the &quot;bread of life,&quot; and we -- those in His true Assembly -- are also &quot;one bread,&quot; through Him.   Partaking of this true &quot;bread,&quot; therefore, makes us one in Him, and members of each other.  It is a symbol of our divine fellowship in, with and through Yeshua the Messiah.  We are instructed to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace so that there will be no schism in the Body.  To do this we must examine ourselves so that we come together as one Body without issues between us which break the unity of the spiritual Body of Messiah.

Leader holding bread: Blessed art You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth.
(Share the loaves)

At Passover He redeemed us and told us to count the days  -   This is our annual rehearsal for our betrothal as His Bride. The outpouring of His Spirit was our engagement ring in promise of our future union. In a ketubah contract of marriage, if the Bride accept the terms of the marriage contract, she drinks the cup of wine offered to her.

Tonight, we drink the cup which symbolises the wine of His Spirit in renewal of our covenant vows of betrothal unto Him. 

This is the cup of our betrothal To Y'shua  Who loved us and gave His life for us to purchase us for Himself.

When He initiated the betrothal, He said, 
&quot;In My Father's house are many mansions, if it were not so I would have told you.   I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto Myself that where I am there you may be also.&quot;   John 14:1-2     -   He's gone to prepare a nuptial chamber and will return and take us into the Marriage Supper with Him.
There'll be the sound of the Shofar and we'll hear the cry &quot;Behold the Bridegroom comes - Go ye out to meet Him&quot;

We want to be ready for that day  -  adorned in garments of righteousness and glory ready for our Bridegroom.

Leader holding cup:  Blessed art You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine. Amen. 
		                                                
Let's drink the cup!

&quot;Your Maker is your husband, Yahweh of Hosts is His Name, and Your Redeemer the holy one of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called&quot;   Isaiah 54: 5

12.  THE HALLEL   -  Psalms113-118 Short Version

13.  SONGS &amp; WORSHIP

14.  KADDISH

Congregation: Glorified and sanctified be God's great Name throughout the world, which He has created according to His will. May He establish His kingdom in your lifetime and during your days, and within the life of the entire house of Israel, speedily and soon; and say Amen. 

May His great Name be blessed forever and to all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified and exalted, extolled and honored, adored and lauded be the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, beyond all blessings and hymns, praises and consolations that are ever spoken in the world; and say, Amen. 

May there be abundant peace from Heaven, and life, for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen.  
 
He who creates peace in His celestial heights, may He create peace for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen. 

&quot;Now unto Him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever,  Amen&quot;   (Jude 24)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Japan achieved a high economic growth after the World War II, the country has changed demographically and advanced socioeconomically [0]. Due to this growth Japan is facing various social issues which need improvements. Some of these issues are: environmental protection, consumer rights, welfare, aging population, low birth rate [1]. One other important issue is creating a gender-equal society. Especially as their population is aging and the birth rate is going down, the need for women with equal rights becomes more important as women are more needed than ever before.


== Economical numbers ==
 

Some numbers to show the need for improvement of a gender-equal society.

The birthrate in Japan is 7.64 births per 1000 population (est. 2009). Compared with countries around the world Japan is at number 223 of in total 224, only China is worse [2].  

The total fertility rate at this moment is 1.21 children born per woman (2009 est). Compared with countries around the world Japan is at number 218 of in total 224 [3]. This number tells something about the potential growth of the population of a country as this figure is calculated per woman and it refers to the births every woman on average gets. When this number is above two it means that the population is growing, as the number two is needed to replace every couple. The figure for Japan is already for years below, meaning that the size population is decreasing and the age of the population is getting older. 
The life expectancy at birth is very high in Japan, the number is 82.12 years, male 78.8 years and female 85.62 years (est 2009) [4]. Compared with other countries around the world Japan is at number 3 of in total 224, quite the opposite in comparison with birthrate and total fertility rate.

The sex rate of the total population is 0.95 male/female (est. 2009) in Japan, meaning that in total there are more women than men in Japan [5]. Especially at older age there are more women than men, which is also the effect of the life expectancy that is higher for women than for men.


== Ranking of Japan on gender-equal ==


From above mentioned numbers it can be concluded that Japan’s population is ageing fast and shrinking. Next to these economical numbers there are also rankings about the status if a country is gender-equal. Japan ranked 91st out of 128 countries in the World Economic Forum’s annuals ranking of gender-equal countries [6]. This is the lowest ranking among all high income countries except for South Korea and five Middle Eastern countries. Japan scores high at education and health but it scores low at the gender income gap, the lack of women in legislation, management, parliament and ministerial positions [7]. 

Japan ranked last out of all nations in the study performed by Grant Thornton International about a study into the gender gap between men and women in executive positions [8]. In general Asian companies have more women working in executive functions but Japan is the exception in Asia. This exception seems to be the result of the “cultural perception about women in business and women’s role in the family as compared with others parts of Asia” [9]. 


== Women in the Workforce ==


As the population is ageing and the growth is declining there is a change in the Japanese labor market. Due to the declining growth a shortage of young labor occurs. Next to this the consumer boom and increasing demand for higher education for children influenced employment of women [10]. 

The female workers are treated far from equal in comparison with men in the workforce:
-	Average Japanese women working full time earn 60% less than the average Japanese man working full time does [11];
-	About 90% of all the part-time workers are females [12];
-	Fewer than 10% of professional managers are women [13]; 
-	10.7% of senior corporate and political positions are held by women [14].

Last few years signs of improvements can be seen for younger female students seeking employment. But, while one succeeds to find employment, many harsh conditions still exists for female employees. There is still a large gap in salary and promotion between men and women, but also the denial of maternity and menstrual leave is still an issue.
On top of this, the reality for women is often no matter how hard they strive for recognition, they are not given the chance to exhibit their abilities. This is also met with sexual harassment and of being forced into leaving or being moved around. Many female students must face these harsh discriminatory realities.
Unfortunately it seems that the financial crisis has a negative impact on the gender-equal approach. It’s much harder in general, both male and female, to get a job but it’s even harder for a woman as a man gets priority in hiring of better jobs. According to various people I spoke in Japan: “A man in general has a better prospect and better promotion opportunities. Women in general get a lower job, even if they finished the same education as man, but they also have lower promotion opportunities”.

== Education ==


Education is very well in Japan and it is easy accessible for both men and women. “While in 1950 only one out of every three girls and one out of every two boys received a high school education, since the mid 1970s almost all Japanese children have attended High school, and two out of five high school graduates have gone on to higher education” [15].

Next to the education, the expected roles of Japanese women in life are changing. Japan is slightly adapting the Western roles more and more as women receive a higher education but also they have more access to alternative information through the internet. However, the traditional values and norms of family-centered care giving are still deeply integrated in the Japanese society.

During my stay in Japan we attended various courses in different Universities. In one class there was a group setting in two circles, all the men were sitting on the first row and all the women on the second row. Was this a coincidence or a cultural aspect?


== Culture ==


Modern Japanese women often experience an internal conflict between their traditional roles and their current role as their current role need a change of the Japanese culture. They feel guilty and think of themselves as selfish while failing their duty as wife and mother while chasing a good job opportunity in the workforce [16].

The Japanese culture is very traditional and can still be seen on the street but also in a business environment. There is a lot of respect for older people and people with a higher rank. Also conforming to group norms and putting needs of others ahead of self are highly valued [17]. With respect to gender issues: Japanese women are trained by their mothers from early age to “make the best of whatever life gives” [18], and this is what they do. Japanese women do not complain, they just make the best out of life. 

The patriarchal family system in Japan demands that women should obey men, that the young women should obey the old, and that daughters-in-law should obey mothers-in-law [19]. Men on the other hand are pampered by their mothers and they expect the same treatment from their wives [20]. Next to this long working hours are expected from the companies people work for, mainly men with full time jobs. This makes it hard for men to help out at home as they are almost never home, leaving the childcare and housekeeping to their wife.


== Improvements of the workforce ==


There are improvement on three fronts in order to make it easier for women to have a family but also to have a job. The three are: financial incentives, non financial support measures and public views [21].
The financial incentives are improved child care allowances, preferential tax and pension treatment for households with children [22].

The non financial support measures are an improved childcare system and the extension of the childcare leave. The childcare leave is paid for 12-18 months in Japan [23]. This is really an improvement and it will help a growth of the birthrate but also make it easier for women to work and have a family. Also the ability to work part-time is an improvement. However, for the working part-time some issues need to be solved. While working reduced hours, an employee is not allowed to write overtime. Working part-time means that any overtime worked is unpaid, effectively penalizing workers who are anxious not to cause any trouble for their co-workers [23]. 
The public views focuses on public views on having children. More positive aspects should be communicated in order improve the culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you have written down the information that you personally know, the next step it to find out what your family remembers. Show your notes to siblings and parents, and collect their input on the tree. Recording the interviews will allow you to review what they say later. Talk to the oldest members of your family, bearing in mind that some memories may not match facts that you find out later. Write down a list of questions to ask and collect as many names and dates as possible. If you have unidentified photographs, go through them with older family members to try and put names to faces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me:'''   My name is Amy Crowder and I am proud to be a native of Southside Virginia.  I am 34 years old and live in South Hill, Virginia.  I previously attended Virginia Tech (1992-1997) and studied Urban Affairs and Planning.  For five years I served as the County Planner and Zoning Administrator in Bath County, Virginia which is home to the famous  Homestead resort.

I returned to Southside Virginia in 2003 to assist my mother in caring for my grandparents who were living with her at the time.  I signed up to substitute at two of Mecklenburg County’s elementary schools.  It was while I was substituting that I discovered my new found love of teaching.

During the 2007-08 school year I taught 4th grade Science at LaCrosse Elementary School.  This combined my two loves-teaching and science- and I was officially hooked!  I am now heading towards the completion of my B.S. degree at ODU and looking forward to a M.S. in Special Education.

The irony of this all is that I swore I would never turn out like my mother and become an old crotchety school teacher.  I can honestly say that I am proud to follow in the “old Mrs. Crowder’s” footsteps.  This is her 40th year teaching and she is determined to work 4 more years.  My classroom stood next to hers and I am ready to go back as soon as I complete my course work.

I devote any extra time to the students of LaCrosse Elementary.  I am the manager of the school bookstore, assist with the preparation of VGLAs for special education students in grades 3-5, and facilitate the 4th &amp; 5th grade “Feed Your Need to Read” Book Club.  If I am not working for pay as a substitute and I am working for free for the children.


'''My Teaching Philosophy''' 
I believe that all students have a right to equal educational opportunities.  Students with diverse educational needs must have the opportunity to learn, interact, and explore within all classroom environments.  I believe that as educators we must make the effort to reach all children using a variety of teaching methods and strive for a classroom of inclusion, not exclusion.

I believe that the use of technology, when integrated in a positive and useful way, allows student and teacher minds to expand in numerous ways.  The use of technology in curriculum development, interactive lessons, and assessment can bridge learning differences amongst students and create an exciting and successful classroom.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Peekaboo.JPG|thumb|400px|center|I spend my spare time playing peek-a-boo with houses.]]

== About Me ==
Oi. My name is Hunter Smith. I was born in Norfolk, I’m twenty-two and I have lived in Virginia pretty much all my life.

I primarily enjoy reading– pretty much anything and everything, but particularly cheesy science-fiction/fantasy or graphic novels. Some of my favorite authors: Gene Wolfe, Neil Gaiman, Haruki Murakami, Jack London, Poe, Kurt Vonnegut, Patrick Rothfuss, George RR. Martin, Bryan Lee O’Malley, Flannery O’Connor, Joan Didion and Hunter S. Thompson. I would like to say I write as much as I read, but that would be an outright lie– but perhaps that’s a goal to strive toward as I intend to be a well-developed author at some point in my little life.
My other hobbies include playing an obsessive amount of video games (I traveled to Seattle last year to meet with a group of fellow gamers and go to a expo), watching movies (a large amount of them being obscure or terrible), and listening to the worst music possible.


[[Image:OutsidePAX.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Outside Seattle's 2008 Penny-Arcade Video Game Expo.]]

== My Philosophy on Education ==

Throughout the years, I’ve found the most effective method of teaching is to directly involve the students. Whether it be interaction stemmed through integration of technology or simply having open discussions and debates within the class room. I find the most enjoyable classes and thought provoking courses I have had, involve teachers with ebullient personalities who use humor and ask questions of their students. If you keep your students involved, interested and, more importantly, thinking– it becomes easier for them to interpret the subject at hand.

When I've pondered the facets of what I'd like to bring into my own methods of instruction, I think first and foremost about taking a modern approach. I'd want to meld what I'm teaching into the most approachable content possible and showcase it's relevance with current topics/events. I'd do so through discussions, bouncing ideas back and forth with the class. Not only that but I'd want to challenge the average curriculum. The English curriculum in general excludes a lot of modern and past prose that I feel is possibly overlooked, simply because as it's outside of the canon. Differential theory courses like Horror Theory intrigue me, delving into specific areas outside the norm.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello everyone!! My name is Mary Hobbs. I live in Blackstone with my three sons. I am employed at Nottoway Intermediate School, 5th and 6th grades, as a teacher's assistant working with special education students, among other duties, but this is my main position.  My hobbies are spending time with my sons, family members, friends, shopping, and reading.

When I graduated from high school, I had no idea of what I wanted to do. Going to college was the last thing on my mind and I really did not give it that much thought.  I did not know what I wanted to major in. My job is the reason I became interested in teaching.  As a teacher's assistant I had to be &quot;qualified&quot; for my job, so I started taking the classes and this is where I am now.  I have stopped and started, but I am determined to go all the way this time.  

I would like to teach either fifth or sixth graders because I have worked with these grades since working in the school system. I would like to teach Language Arts/Reading and/or Social Studies (VA History). My curriculum for Language Arts would focus on reading, vocabulary, and spelling.  I would love to teach Social Studies (VA History) just because I love history.  If I had to teach math, I could go as high as some algebra, and science just bores me.  But when I get into taking the classes for these subjects, my mind could change.

My philosophy of education is that every child that comes to school can learn, even if they don't want to.  I believe that if a teacher can find that one topic or subject that catches a student's interest, they would be hooked on learning.  

Another philosophy is that I think the teacher should some kind of sense of humor.  I would want the students that I teach to know and feel that they will learn in my classroom.  I want the students to feel good and upbeat about coming to my class.

Some of the technologies that I would use in my classroom would be the SmartBoard, because it is hands-on, the Jeopardy Game because it would be used to review for tests and bring some fun into the classroom, and computers could be used because of interactive games the students could learn from.

I would use tests and quizzes to assess the students progress or not.  Some students learn fast, and some learn slow.  I will adjust my teaching methods to accommodate the students.  I would not exactly separate the students into groups just modify the classwork.

In closing, I have worked in the school system for nine years and those years, I have come to realize that if I can fill in for a teacher and follow his/her instructions for the class(es), then I can do it for myself.  I have come to earn the respect, trust, and confidence of my fellow co-workers and the students.</text>

      <comment>/* ACT 1. SCENE II. Another street. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Othello is one of Shakespeare's four great tragedies. The tragic hero, Othello, becomes consumed by jealousy when his ensign, Iago, convinces Othello of his wife's infidelity.

==[[s:The Tragedy of Othello, The Moor of Venice#ACT 1. SCENE I. Venice. A street.|ACT 1. SCENE I. Venice. A street.]]==

This play opens with a bang as the author sets up the characters and action in one movement. First we are introduced to Iago and Roderigo, who are talking outside [[/Senator Brabantino|Senator Brabantino's]] balcony. They speak of Othello as if he were something other than human, an outsider, an animal. He is presented as the dark violator of the purity and innocence of the senator's daughter [[/Desdemona/]]. The imagery is of a horse copulating and begetting other horses, of creating the &quot;beast with two backs'. If the audience believes what Iago says about Othello he is seen as a despicable villain.

We are given a window into the darkness that lies within [[/Iago/]], who is possibly Shakespeare's most malevolent character. Iago openly professes his hatred for the Moor. At the same time Iago is powerful in his ability to manipulate others as we see him leading Roderigo by the hand to the senator's window. This comes in to play later in the play as Iago continues to connive others in order to appease his own jealousy and desire for vengeance.

Iago's words about Cassio reveal a bit about his proposed movivation: Othello passed Iago up to give an important promotion to Cassio. Iago describes Cassio as a mathemetician or theoretician, someone who knows only theory and no practise. We can see Iago in contrast as someone without scruples, who is willing to use any means to achieve the (evil) end he desires.

We are left wondering, who is this mysterious man, Othello ? Are the things he is accused of true ? And feeling apprehension about his accused violation of the young Desdemona.

This scene contains one of my favorite lines: 

'''Brabantio:''' Thou art a villain. 

'''Iago:''' You are--a senator. 

This displays both Iago's quick wit, total cynicism and shamelessness in wrongdoing even in the face of authority. Besides being very funny.

Also in this scene we see Roderigo as a bit of a bumbler, a follower and at a loss when not directed by Iago. 

Notice that Iago leaves before his presence can be detected. Throughout the play he works to be an invisible force working against the best interests of the other characters, especially Othello. 

Iago is a destroyer and detests authority.

==[[s:The Tragedy of Othello, The Moor of Venice#ACT 1. SCENE II. Another street.|ACT 1. SCENE II. Another street.]]==

Iago is suddenly a different man, prostrating himself before Othello and professing a foolish lack of self-defending iniquity. 

When the senator arrives to confront Othello, the Moor's following lines quickly show him to be a person of noble character:

'''Othello:'''&lt;br&gt;
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.&lt;br&gt;
Good signior, you shall more command with years&lt;br&gt;
Than with your weapons.

Othello is not afraid or defensive, rather he is respectful towards the elder senator. Another man would wet his pants at the sight of a group of men with swords drawn in his opponence, but Othello delivers them a toungue-in-cheek, tension-diffusing response. Even when the senator charges ahead with threats and accusations the Moor is unshaken, inviting the senator to another place to speak.

In all the audience is presented with an Othello entirely different than the one suggested by third person in the first scene.

==[[s:The Tragedy of Othello, The Moor of Venice#ACT 1. SCENE III. Preparation for War and Settling of a Family issue|ACT 1. SCENE III. Settling a Family Issue.]]==
The duke and the senators discuss the  movement of the Turkish fleet and conclude that its direct is Cyprus. When Barbantio and Othello arrive, the duke insist that Barbantio support the claim that Othello bewitched Desdemonia with evidence. At Othello's suggestion, the Duke sends for Desdemonia.

==[[s:The Tragedy of Othello, The Moor of Venice#ACT 3. SCENE III. The garden of the castle.|ACT 3. SCENE III. The garden of the castle.]]==


[http://www.shaksper.net/archives/files/moral.shakes-1.html Shakespeare was a Stoic] refers to Iago's line

     Who steals my purse steals trash...

by referencing Karl Polanyi, in The Great Transformation: 

     The outstanding discovery of recent historical and
     anthropological research is that man's economy, as a rule,
     is submerged in his social relationships.  He does not act
     so as to safeguard his individual interest in the possession
     of material goods; he acts so as to safeguard his social
     standing, his social claims, his social assets.  He values
     material goods only in so far as they serve this end.

 |parent=Sociology
 |description=Books in this subject area deal specifically with '''[[w:Futurology|futures studies]]''': the science, art, and practice of postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. Futures studies seeks to understand what is likely to continue, what is likely to change, and what is likely to be new. Part of the discipline therefore involves an understanding of past and present, to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and welcome to my introduction of Mellody,to you. I am a non-traditional student here at ODU (I might graduate before I turn fifty) working towards a bachelors degree in biology with emphasis in marine biology and ecology.I graduated from TCC in 2008, and just finished my first year here at ODU.I have recently decided to add teacher licensure to my degree instead of a minor in some odd thing. I just recently received the privilege of being named Vice President for Delta Sigma Lambda the sorority for returning women here at ODU.  I am the proud mother of three girls; currently 27, 25(Cal State East Bay 2007), 21, and two grandkids, the only children I have living with me now are Astro (golden retriever) and Diamond (mixed breed)our SPCA dog. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, have lived in Phoenix AZ, Corpus Christi TX, and I now call Virginia Beach home. My husband was transferred to Virginia from Texas, where I worked at an oil refinery. Since there was no place for me to transfer to here in Virginia I decided to go to school. I am also a VoiCeS volunteer for The Chesapeake Bay Foundation.

My educational philosophy? WOW that is a big idea, LIFE is an education, I truly believe you are never too old to learn. That being said I do believe that a classroom environment is an excellent place for children to learn. As a future biology teacher I wish to share my enthusiasm on the beauty of life around us, and the important role humans have as caretakers, on this third planet from the sun that we call Earth. 

As a future secondary level teacher I hope to emphasize college prep for those who are capable. For those who cannot attend college for whatever reason a vocational program would be encouraged. I believe that everyone should contribute to his/her community.  Therefore I hope to have my students work together in groups learning and teaching each other.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''About Me''' ==
Hi! My name is Kim Hedley and I am 23 years old. I was born in Virginia Beach and have lived here my entire life, except for college of course. I have three brothers (I am third in the line up) and we are all very close in age. Having three brothers has certainly been a challenge but it is one that I am grateful to have been given. Trying to keep up with the three of them and competing in pretty much everything we do, has definitely made me a stronger person. I have been very involved in athletics since the time I could walk. I have played a number of sports and the competitive streak doesn’t end there; it continues to pretty much all facets of my life. I spend a lot of my time at the beach and also enjoy running, reading, playing tennis, and relaxing. 


== '''My Education''' ==

I attended Kempsville High School here in Virginia Beach where I played both soccer and field hockey. I graduated in 2004 and went on to attend the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. There, I majored in Kinesiology and minored in Psychology. I also had the chance to play field hockey for the Tribe and I loved it. Being a Division 1 athlete was definitely an arduous task, but one that was well worth the time and effort. It offered a very demanding schedule and not much free time, but I wouldn’t have traded it for anything. I had the opportunity work closely with the women’s lacrosse team for three of my four years. Since the main season for field hockey was in the fall and lax was in the spring, I was able to help out in little ways each year. Spring semester of my senior year, I was invited to go along with the lax team to Australia! We visited Melbourne and Sydney on our eleven day trip and saw so many amazing sites…it was an unforgettable experience.

I thought about attending graduate school after graduating from W&amp;M in May 2008, but decided not to go right away. At that time, I wanted to pursue a career in Occupational Therapy. I chose to take the year off and work at the Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters. There, I worked for about six months in the Rehab Department with speech, physical and occupational therapists. I really enjoyed my time there and learned so much from the knowledgeable staff. In this time, I also realized that it was not the career I wanted to continue with. It was not surprising to any of my friends and family that I began thinking about teaching. (It was really no surprise to myself either!) My mom is a teacher and I have been exposed to it all my life. I guess this is what drove me to exploring other opportunities; however, I realized that teaching had been my passion all along. And this brings me to now… I am taking a few classes in order to get my teaching license and couldn’t be more excited about getting started!


== '''My Educational Philosophy''' ==

Although I have not yet started teaching, I have certainly given a great deal of thought to what kind of teacher I want to become. My main goal is to simply be a good role model for my students. I plan to teach pre-K through six, my ideal grade being second or third. I believe that teaching children about the importance of responsibility and respect are crucial. Because each child is different, I hope to be able to understand the differences and help each one learn in his/her own way. Learning takes place not only in the classroom but in many other places and ways as well. I hope to bring other aspects of life into my daily teaching; including technology, experiments, hands on activities, etc. All of these methods of learning will help to build a greater awareness of the environment that the children live in. 

In addition to these ideas, I also hope to create a diverse and comfortable atmosphere for my class. I believe that children with special needs should be included in the classroom. With this diversity, the children (as well as the teacher) can all grow and learn from one another. I plan to have the children work in group settings as much as possible. This will allow them to interact and problem solve with their peers, an important skill for everyday life. I also hope to use a system to teach rewards and consequences. I will emphasize positive reinforcement which I believe will enhance confidence and self-esteem. Building a bond with the parents of the students is also an important task. By doing this, I hope to have these ideas carried out at home as well. I think that expanding the learning experience to as many settings as possible is a necessity. My goal is to ignite a desire for learning in each of my students that they are able to carry out, whether it is in the classroom, on a playing field, in nature or at home. By sparking this interest early, I believe that success for the student is inevitable.</text>

My name is Derrick and I am twenty-three years old. It has been an oddly disappointing little life I’ve led. Let me be honest.  I was expecting better. I was promised jet packs, magical swords, lasers, cackling super villains and girls with impossible proportions wearing improbable and improper clothing. These things have not come to pass. In these twenty three years I have been faced with only the soul crushing banality of reality. I try to make the best of it. I read mostly, I try to write a thousand words a day, most of them, poorly. And so it goes. I trudge, lollygag, and dilly dally through this underwhelming existence. Nowhere do I see Excalibur waiting for me. Nowhere do I see anything but concrete and frail human beings tittering and tottering. So I make the best of it. 

In short, I have been irrevocably tainted by fiction. I’m trying to become a real boy and failing, horribly. I enjoy the following: foods of all sorts/lamenting and celebrating my Asian-ness/ Reading/ Writing/ Videogames, where in I curse creatively/ Girls who dress like they’ve taken some color theory courses/ Comics/ Making mixes for women who will never love me/ Learning to draw and sculpt better. 

I hope to teach college level creative writing. I picked up education as a minor because my mother insisted I be somewhat practical, and she pays the bills and happens to be a 5’2 ball of flip fury. (Flip is a derogatory term for Filipino. I’m brown; it’s alright if I say it.) Originally, I wanted to be a doctor in the great tradition of giving in to filial pressure. But I cut open some corpses and thought better of it. Eventually, I took some creative writing courses and got enough good feedback I thought, what the hell, I’ll ruin my life.  I do not inherently want to teach all that badly, but I don’t think it would suck all that much, either. I’ve been told it’s a fantastic gig if you can land it and tolerate the typical slop that is slapped upon your desk as if it were manna from heaven. In short teaching is my safety net. I will either be a somewhat snarky but endearing college professor or an embittered, spiteful high school teacher, who uses his course as a means to punish the world that has failed to recognize his genius. 
My favorite authors include: Alan Moore, Brian K. Vaughan, Kurt Vonnegut, John Gardner, Neil Gaiman, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsburg, and Junot Diaz.




Alright, so onwards to the teaching philosophy:  mostly, I just hope to not be a jerk-off. Can I type jerk-off on here? I want to be an actual human being, and as an English teacher I’d love to shake up the traditional canon a bit. Let’s face it; reading is dying a slow and terrible death. And what’s killing it is not the so called low-brow, fluff like Twilight. What’s killing our beloved lady of the letter, is the holier than thou pretentious way the material is approached. Students might actually enjoy English if say, they weren’t reading Beowulf for the fifteenth time, or getting vague justifications for every text they read. “It’s a friggin great book, it’s right there in the name, kid “, is the average response a student can expect from a teacher.  

It’s insanely hard to not find something enjoyable in the world of literature, yet most curriculums are dedicated to this masochistic goal. I can see the root of the problem now, a large angry Anglo-Saxon, like some final boss in an NES game, his jowls quivering as he pounds one ham like fist against a table of dark, expensive wood shouting, “Those little snots think they can get into my world? Think reading is enjoyable do they? By God I’ll show them. Quick, put the Yellow Wallpaper on every damn syllabus you can find.” (Presumably this man is the president of Education, possibly the king.) 

I would like to have my students read comic books with me. I would like them to read something from the last forty or so years, that may, possibly, be enjoyable. I don’t ever want to hear someone say reading is boring again. Because it’s not, it’s the best. If you don’t agree with me, we’re going to have to arm wrestle. We’re going to have words. I have some books to lend you. I would like to be progressive and hip, and get a high rating for hotness on ratemyprofessor. Hopefully, I can nerd up whoever enters my class room and have them flipping through the remnants of a mutilated tree corpse in no time. I want my students to appreciate the classics because they understand and love them, not because they are told to.  I would have them be creative and funny, rather than automatons who bark the collective agreement of the literati about what constitutes fine art. I hope to foster a small army of idealistic, brilliant, tragically doomed students.</text>

      <comment>/* Backup — there is an easier way */ non-jargon term</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Backup — there is an easier way ==

Many people and small organisations skip the essential task of backing up the data files on their computers; often because the professionals describe this as a large, complex and difficult task. Well, it does not have to be.

Windows' own built-in backup program is not very good, but there are free and better alternatives; for instance  [http://www.educ.umu.se/~cobian/cobianbackup.htm Cobian BackUp].

At [http://www.translogic.no/ TransLogic] we have a simple routine for backup copying. It is quick, efficient, inexpensive and safe, and you can do it every day without problems.

At about 12:00 noon (lunchtime) and again about 17:00 ([[w:End of Day|end of day]]), we take an [[w:incremental backup|incremental backup]] (meaning a backup of all the files that have been changed since the previous total backup).

Once a week (typically on Friday afternoon), we take a total backup.

We copy these files onto a [[w:Digital Versatile Disc|DVD]] (you can use a [[w:Compact Disc|CD]] if you have a minor amount of data to be stored). You get 2–3 DVDs for one dollar, and we have space for 3–5 backups per disc (1 for a total backup). This means that each backup costs us less than 25 cents and takes us two–three minutes (we start the backup process when we leave for lunch and it is completed when we return to work). You can, of course, use a [[w:USB flash drive|memory stick]], or external [[w:hard disk drive|hard disk]] instead of [[w:optical disc|optical disc]]s.

Once a month we put the total backup in the [[w:safety deposit box|safety deposit box]] in the local bank.

This simple routine will give peace of mind, and you will never have to use the excuse that the files were lost because the computer failed or was stolen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me'''

My name is Rachel, and I was born and raised in Portsmouth, Virginia or &quot;P-town&quot; as some would say.  I recently moved to the Virginia Beach area and absolutely love it! The pace of life is much slower and incredibly laid back compared to what I'm used to. In 2005, I graduated from Radford University with a B.S in Psychology and am currently pursuing an M.S in Elementary Education PreK-6. I've been a nanny to three wonderful children ages seven and under for two years. Their father, who recently passed away, was a Computer Science professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.  He always spoke of the fulfillment he received through teaching.  Ultimately, his influence and the influence of his children led me to this profession. Aside from school and work, I've learned the importance of relationships so I spend most of my time with people I care about.  I love reggae, playing the piano, old Sinbad standup, skydiving, and travel. Several years ago I trekked through Europe with some girlfriends until I was completely broke...I recommend it to anyone.

'''Teaching Philosophy'''

My personal philosophy of education stems from both my experiences in high school and my mother.  I was homeschooled until the eighth grade and completed the rest of my schooling in the public school system.  To this day, I applaud my mother for doing a phenomenal job educating my brothers and I. Sean and I were extremely ADD, where my youngest brother, Chris, could've read in the center of a racetrack without distraction.  My mother taught us each, individually, using methods catered to our various learning styles.  We saw early on that I required a multi-sensory approach in learning.  Anything and everything that could be taught using sight, sound, touch etc...was beneficial. The repetition of receiving the same information in different formats sky rocketed my level of comprehension.  Mother also had the difficult task of conquering my fidgeting problem. She was aware that I had to be mobile or I'd zone out.  Hence, interactive activities were incorporated that required me to move about the room.  We would do relay races using phonic flashcards, or learned fractions while baking a cake. Any positive behavior was consistently acknowledged to keep me encouraged and engaged.  Though Chris, the youngest brother didn't require such measures, he thoroughly enjoyed being a part of them. I'm aware this 3 to 1 ratio was unrealistic versus the typical classroom setting. However, mother's methods (with some assistance from Adderall) were key in equipping me to survive any setting.  Once I reached high school those methods were tested.  Teachers like my mother were few and far between. But I relied on my strong foundation and other learning techniques to adapt and succeed.  

That being said, I think it is absolutely imperative to teach for the masses. Particularly in today’s inclusive classroom, teachers need to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each student and be able to facilitate those individual needs. Offering a blanket approach, but making minor adjustments to cater to different learning styles is important. It demonstrates to the student that they too can be part of a group without feeling left behind. By incorporating varied approaches a student has multiple opportunities to comprehend the material. I would bring what's being taught to life, whether it's creating a play around a story, monitoring the growth of vegetables in the classroom, or playing arithmatic bingo. Integrating interactive ways of learning provides a fun environment where a student feels included and safe to learn.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The basic 'Hello World' Example looks like this:
&lt;code&gt;

     window 1,&quot;Hello World!&quot; 
     print &quot;Hello world&quot;
     do
     Handleevents
     until ( gFBQuit )


&lt;/code&gt;

Strictly, just 'print &quot;Hello World' would work, but the text in a window is better.

Let's go over the code:
&lt;code&gt;window 1,&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

This line creates a window with the ID number 1 and a title of &quot;Hello World&quot;. The ID number is used when showing, hiding, and referring to that window in general.



&lt;code&gt;print &quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

This does ''not'' actually print anything out of the printer, just puts those words (Hello world, in this case.)  in the current window, that is in this case, the most recently created one: window ID 1. 

&lt;code&gt;do

handleevents

until ( gFBQuit )&lt;/code&gt;

These lines tell Future BASIC to - until ' gFBQuit ' - 'handle events', that is, to check if the mouse has moved, check if the user has quit, etc. etc. The ( gFBQuit ) is just a synonym for 'The user pressed Quit, or Cmd-Q'.

== Introduction: ==
'''

Hello wiki-readers! My name is Marta Cardoza and I am a Junior at Old Dominion University finishing up my Interdisciplinary Studies Pre-K to 6 degree. Ever since I was in elementary school I wanted to pursue a field dealing with children. During seventh and eighth grade, while trying to decide between elementary teaching and pediatrics, I began to volunteer in programs held at Thelma Crenshaw Elementary School in Chesterfield County and vacation bible school at St. Augustine Catholic Church. Pediatrics soon seemed impossible due to my fear of needles. in high school I began to observe elementary teachers during summer sessions where I realized my focus would be kindergarten students. It would be a dream come true if I work at any of the schools after graduation.

On a personal note, I was born in El Salvador and moved to the United States with my parents when I was two. I have visited El Salvador since the initial departure and I enjoy every visit! I can always remember the fresh fruit, family time, and different culture that it has to offer. Upon my return I appreciate the struggle my parents went through to offer my young sister and myself a bilingual experience.


'''
== Philosophy of Education: ==
'''

Through the use of various activities I am hoping to have the students learn the content taught. Understanding the needs of students should be a teacher's priority. In a kindergarten class teachers often struggle to decifer whether a student has special needs, but it takes various observation activities to determine the need.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ABOUT ME'''

Hi Everyone! My name is Ashley High. I received my BS in Psychology with a minor in Human Services from ODU in December 2008. Since then, I have started working at a preschool in Poquoson, VA called Playtime Learning Center. I really wanted to get some experience before I decided that I definitely wanted to come back to school to get my Masters in Education PreK-6. So far, I'm loving my new job! At first, it was a little overwhelming at times, but I am growing and learning so much everyday, and it only gets easier and more rewarding.
I have been married to my husband, Adam, for 3 years. Adam has been in the Navy for almost 7 years. We have 1 dog, Bailey, and 2 cats, Little Bit and Patches. We bought our first house in December 2006 in Hampton, VA. By far, my favorite season is summer because I love all the fun things that come with it. I love yard work, planting flowers, cooking on the grill, riding our jetski and going to the beach!

'''MY EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY'''

In the short time that I have been working in a preschool, I feel like I have learned so much. I believe that a classroom that uses a student-centered approach is a must. A teacher must be very tuned-in to the kids and know what will make them successful. That said, I believe that growth and success should always be the ultimate goals. A teacher should also be flexible so that the needs of the students are met. I think that it is beneficial for special needs students to be placed in the same classrooms as all the other students as long as there is control and the other students are not interrupted. The needs of each special needs student should be evaluated. Some students may be able to handle the regular classroom, others may need an extra aide to work individually with the student, and others may benefit more in a special needs class. I just don't think that all special needs students should be grouped together and put in a class to themselves when some of them may be able to fuction and be successful in another setting.

I also believe that with the ever-changing modern society we live in today, our schools need to keep up. Technology integration is important. I think that all schools should have technology workshops as needed so that the teachers are aware of new technologies that can be used to improve education. Having a computer in a classroom is not enough. There are so many new resources that can be used and should be used. Students should not only be taught how to use technology, but should also use technology as part of regularly scheduled assignments. To be successful later in life, it is important that children start using technology early as well as regularly.




''&quot;The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.&quot;'' 
-William Arthur Ward


''“Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.”''
-John F. Kennedy</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Cell Death'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Definition
**Physiology: physical death of a cell
**Radiobiology: loss of ability to proliferate indefinitely (clonogenic death)
*Types of cell death
**Apoptosis: highly regulated (programmed) process
**Autophagy: digestion of parts of cytoplasm to generate basic nutrients and to eliminate damaged proteins and organelles
**Necrosis: death due to extremely unfavorable conditions
**Senscence: permanent loss of ability to divide
**Mitotic catastrophe: death following aberrant mitosis
*Timing after RT
**Pre-mitotic: 
***Typically within several hours after RT
***Usually limited to thymocytes, lymphocytes, spermatogonia, and other rapidly proliferating cells
***Typically via apoptosis
**Post-mitotic:
***Cells may progress through one, two or more cell cycles
***Death may be via several mechanisms, including necrosis and apoptosis
*After RT, most cells die by mitotic death
*RT dose
**Mean lethal dose for loss of proliferative ability &lt;2 Gy
**Dose to destroy cell function in non-proliferating tissues &gt;100 Gy

==Apoptosis==
*Active cell death, which requires energy, RNA and protein synthesis
*Fast phagocytosis of well-circumscribed cellular fragments
*No inflammation, no tissue damage
*Occurs within 4-6 hours (secondary apoptosis may be seen later at 24-96 hours, in cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe) 
*Function
**Development of multicellular structures (e.g. sculpting of tissues, regulating neuronal development)
**Immune response and lymphocyte development
**Cancer
*Detection
**Microscopy: Small darkly stained nuclei, free 3' DNA ends by TUNEL assay
**Gel electrophoresis: DNA ladder 180 bp intervals
**Flow cytometry: DNA fragmentation with propidium iodide
**Cytoplasm: Cytochrome c staining
**Caspase activity: PARP staining
*Triggers
**Extracellular signals: Fas, p75, TNF
**Toxic stimuli: viruses, chemicals
**DNA damage: p53
**Plasma membrane damage: sphingomyelinase
*Three phases
**Induction: 
***External pathway from receptors on cell membrane
***Internal pathway via mitochondria
***Sphingomyelinase pathway from plasma membrane damage
**Execution: Caspases, which exist as dimers and are proteolytically activated
**Degradation: Membrane, cytoplasm, and DNA destruction
*Extrinsic pathway ([http://genomicobject.net/member3/GONET/apoptosis.html Overview])
**Not induced by RT
**[[w:Fas_ligand|Fas ligand]] attaches to [[w:Fas_receptor|FAS receptor]] (&quot;Death receptor&quot;), which is internalized. Similarly, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ([[w:TRAIL|TRAIL]]) attaches to death receptors DR4 and DR5
**Adaptor molecule [[w:FADD|FADD]] attaches to the internalized FAS/DR4 to form death inducing signalling complex (DISC)
**Within DISC, inactive pro-caspase 8 is converted to active [[w:Caspase_8|caspase 8]] (FLICE)
**Activated caspase 8 then activates [[w:caspase_3|caspase 3]] through two separate pathways
***Direct pathway, when concentration of caspase 8 is high: caspase 8 cleaves pro-caspase 3 directly, and activates it
***Indirect pathway, when concentration of caspase 8 is low: caspase 8 cleaves Bcl-2 interacting protein (&lt;u&gt;Bid&lt;/u&gt;), which results in release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. 
***This joins the Intrinsic pathway below
*Intrinsic pathway
**Induced by RT after DNA damage, and p53 activation
**p53 in turn activates the pro-apoptotic members of [[w:Bcl-2|Bcl-2 protein family]] (Bax, Bak, Bim, Puma), which are in balance with anti-apoptic members of this family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL). Together they govern the permeability of mitochondrial membrane, especially to calcium
**In response to elevated calcium, [[w:cytochrome_c|cytochrome c]] is released from mitochondria into cytoplasm, and complexes with [[w:Apaf-1|Apaf-1]] to produce the [[w:Apoptosome|Apoptosome complex]] (hectamer)
**Apoptosome complex recruits and activates [[w:caspase_9|caspase 9]] from procaspase 9
**Activated caspase 9 within the apoptosome complex activates [[w:caspase_3|caspase 3]]
**Caspase 3 activates multiple factors:
***DNA Fragmentation Factor ([[w:DFFA|DFF]]) causes DNA cleavage 
***Caspase 7 activates PARP (PARP activity can be used as an indicator of apoptosis)
***Caspase 6 targets nuclear lamins
***Cytoskeletal proteins
**Apopototic cell is ultimately removed by phagocytosis, leaving no trace
*Sphyngomyelinase pathway
**Radiation damages plasma membrane
**Can be triggered by IR in absence of DNA damage
**Acid sphyngomyelinase becomes activated, and hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide
**Ceramide activates mitochondrial apoptotic system (see Intrinsic Pathway), probably by interacting with Bax
**This pathway is particularly expressed in endothelial cells, and may contribute to radiation-induced vascular injury
*Caspase types
**Initiator: caspase 8 (extrinsic), caspase 9 (intrinsic), caspase 10 (extrinsic)
**Executor: caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 7
*Promoters
**[[w:Second_mitochondria-derived_activator_of_caspases|Smac]] (Diablo) inhibits IAPs
*Inhibitors
**Bcl-2 counteracts effects of Bid (extrinsic) or Bax/Bak/Bim/Puma (intrinsic)
**IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) block activation of caspase 3 by Apoptosome complex
**NFkB pathway activates transcription of IAPs and Bcl-2

==Necrosis==
*Passive cell death
*Triggered by non-physiological circumstances that disrupt normal cellular homeostasis (e.g. hypoxia, poisoning, etc.)
*Caused by membrane dissolution
*Cellular material, including degradative enzymes, released into surrounding tissue, leading to inflammation and tissue damage

==Autophagy==
*Programmed cell death
*Response to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, crowding, senescene, genotoxic stresses, or simply mechanism to eliminate damaged organelles
*Organelles and other cell components, including portions of cell membrane and cytoplasm, are sequestered in autophagosomes. These fuse with lysosomes, causing degradation of contents (self-digestion = autophagy)
*Distinct morphology from apoptosis or necrosis
*Increased endocytosis, vacuolation, membrane blebbing, and nuclear condensation
*No caspase activation

==Senescence==
*Depends on p53/p16 driven G1 block
*Thought to be driven by telomore shortening</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe it is saying that she [Lesbia/Caludia] would not prefer to be married to anyone over Catullus. That is why he says &quot;what a woman says to her passionate lover, ought to be written on the wind and swift-flowing water.&quot; He is saying that she is lying in a contemptuous way.

To marry for men in latin is not simply &quot;ducere&quot; but &quot;uxorem ducere&quot;

Petat is not a potential subjuntive: potential subjuctive is an indipented subjuctive, that we find in main clauses; here we are in a dependant clause, an hypotetical one, and the present subjunctive express possibility (not irreality, in that case we would find the imperfect) in the present.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Growth Factors'''&lt;/big&gt;


==ErbB==
*Family of 4 receptor tyrosine kinases
**ErbB-1 ([[w:Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor|EGFR]])
**ErbB-2 ([[w:her2|her2]])
**ErbB-3
**ErbB-4
*Transmembrane proteins, existing as monomers at surface
*When a ligand binds, dimerisation arm becomes untethered, and the proteins dimerize
*Tyrosine kinase activity


==EGFR==
[[Image:MAPKpathway.png|thumb|right]]
*Ligands: 
**[[w:Epidermal_growth_factor|Epidermal growth factor (EGF)]]: produced by platelets, macrophages, salivary glands, kidneys
**[[w:TGF_alpha|Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α)]]: produced by macrophages, brain cells, keratinocytes
**[[w:HB-EGF|HB-EGF]], [[w:Amphiregulin|Amphiregulin]], [[w:Betacellulin|betacellulin]], [[w:Epigen|epigen]], [[w:Epiregulin|epiregulin]]: produced by various cells around the body


'''Review:''' PMID 15142631, Herbst R, IJROBP 2004

==EGFR Pathways==
*EGFR -&gt; Ras -&gt; Raf -&gt; MEK -&gt; MAPK -&gt; myc -&gt; transcription
*EGFR -&gt; Ras -&gt; Raf -&gt; MEK -&gt; MAPK -&gt; RSK -&gt; S6 -&gt; transcription
*EGFR -&gt; PI3K -&gt; AKT -&gt; mTOR


==PTEN==
*PTEN gene encodes a phosphatase, which uses PIP-3, which is also produced by PI3K above. Loss of PTEN therefore increases PIP-3 levels, leading to inappropriate AKT activity, and subsequent protection of cancer cells from apoptosis
*PTEN is a tumor suppressor
*PTEN loss confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors

&lt;big&gt;'''Hypoxia'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*Oxygen &quot;fixes&quot; (makes permanent) damage caused by free radicals (ion pair -&gt; free radical -&gt; DNA damage -&gt; O2 fixation by making permanent DNA-peroxide bond)
**Must be present during or immediately (~5 msec) after RT
*Oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) ~2.5x
**Decreases with increasing LET: photons 2.5, neutrons 1.5, alpha 1.0
**Similarly, decreases with increasing RBE
**For photons, increases with dose and dose rate. If dose/fx &lt;2 Gy OER ~1.5x, if dose/fx &gt;2 Gy OER ~3x
*Measurements of oxygenation
**Evaluated directly by polarographic Eppendorf oxygen probes
**Exogenous: Nitroimidazoles (reduced and irreversibly bound under low O2 tension), EF5, carbon black
**Endogenous compounds: carbonic anhydrase (CA9), HIF, GLUT1 (need biopsy)
**Noninvasive imaging: PET F-18-miso, PET Cu-64-Cu-ATSM, SPECT I-123-azomycin arabinoside
*Hypoxia markers:
*O2 concentration
**Air 155 mmHg, 100% oxygen 760 mmHg
**O2 tension in tissues varies between 1 - 100 mmHg, venous blood ~30 mmHg. Many tissues normally borderline hypoxic
**Cell survival very sensitive to low level O2. At 0.2% O2 (1 mm Hg), survival curve noticeably different
**At 0.5% O2 (3 mm Hg), survival halfway to aerated 
**Most rapid change between 0 and 30 mmHg
**Virtually no change in survival curve from venous to arterial to 100% oxygen
*O2 diffusion distance in metabolic active tissue 100-200 µm
*Hypoxia varies 
**Spatially: within tumor
**Temporary: chronic (diffusion-mediated due to distance from blood vessels) vs acute (perfusion-mediated due to transient fluctuations in blood flow due to malformed vascular supply)
**From patient to patient
*Hypoxic fraction
**Can estimate by extrapolating back from shallow portion of the biphasic survival curve (steep portion is for oxygenated and shallow portion is for hypoxic cells)
**Ranges from 0-50%, on average ~15%
*Reoxygenation
**RT preferentially kills oxygenated cells. Hypoxic cells survive, but typically become re-oxygenated within 24 hours, just in time for the next fraction
**Therefore, if re-oxygenation is achieved, hypoxic cells do not have a significant effect on outcome of fractionated RT
**Lack of reoxygenation is potentially a concern for single fraction SRS/SBRT treatment approaches
**The extent and rapidity of re-oxygenation varies dramatically from tumor to tumor, and depend on proportion of chronic vs acute hypoxia present
*Hypoxic conditions may play a role in malignant progression, by decreasing apoptosis, increasing genomic instability and gene amplification, and by promoting angiogenesis
*Radiosensitization of hypoxic cells
**Improved oxygen delivery: Hyperbaric oxygen, perfluorocarbons, carbagen
**Tobacco cessation
**Drugs: nitroimidazoles (misonidazole showed limited effect, nimorazole significant improvement in a Danish H&amp;N trial) for chronic hypoxia, nicotinamide for acute hypoxia
**Concurrent chemo: Mitomycin C, Tirapazamine
*Angiogenesis (see more below):
**Pro-angiogenesis: HIF-1α, VEGF, PDGF, FGF
**Anti-angiogenesis: 
***Natural: VHL, TSP-1, Angiostatin, Endostatin, Heparin
***Drugs: bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, thalidomide

==Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)==
*HIF proteins are a constitutively expressed family, including HIF-1α, HIF-1β, and HIF-2α
*[[w:EGLN2|EGLN2]] enzyme acts as a cellular oxygen sensor. It is a prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)
**Under normoxic conditions, it hydroxylates [[w:Hypoxia_inducible_factor_1a|HIF-1α]]  using available oxygen
**Hydroxylated HIF-1α is recognized by [[w:VHL|Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)]] protein, and marked for degradation by ubiquination
**Under hypoxic conditions EGLN2 does not have access to oxygen, and thus does not hydroxylate HIF-1α
*HIF-1α subsequently binds to HIF-1β, and the complex acts as a transcription factor on DNA hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). Targets include
**[[w:Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor|VEGF]]: promotes angiogenesis
**[[w:GLUT1|GLUT-1]]: promotes glycolysis and oxygen-independent ATP production
**Stimulation of erythropoiesis
**Increase in apoptosis by interaction with Bcl-2 protein family and p53
*However, HIF-1α levels are also influenced by [[w:Ras_(protein)|Ras]] and [[w:PI3K|PI3K]] pathways, so that HIF-1α activity may not directly correlate with hypoxia

*'''Duke 2005''' PMID 16098463 -- &quot;Pleiotropic effects of HIF-1 blockade on tumor radiosensitivity.&quot; (Moeller BJ, Cancer Cell. 2005 Aug;8(2):99-110.)
**Radiation increases HIF-1 activity in tumors, both sensitizing and protective:
***Radiosensitization: promotes ATP metabolism, proliferation, p53 activation
***Radioresistance: stimulates endothelial cell survival
**Net effect of HIF-1 blockade highly dependent on treatment sequencing, with &quot;radiation first&quot; being more effective due to preventing development of radioresistance effect
**Comment from '''MSKCC''' PMID 16098459


==Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)==
*Family of proteins resulting from alternate splicing of mRNA from a single VEGF gene
*Bind to tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGF-R) on cell surface, causing them to dimerize
*VEGF-R2 appears to modulate most known cellular responses
**Angiogenesis (endothelial cell migration, mitosis, creation of blood vessel lumen, fenestrations, etc)
**Chemotaxis for macrophages and granulocytes
**Vasodilation through NO release
*VEGF-R3 appears to mediate lymphangiogenesis
*Anti-VEGF therapies
**Monoclonal antibodies: [[w:bevacizumab|bevacizumab]] for cancer indications, [[w:ranibizumab|ranibizumab]] for macular degeneration
**Small molecule TKIs: [[w:sunitinib|sunitinib]], [[w:sorafenib|sorafenib]]

== ABOUT ME ==
Hello Hello...Lets see... I have always kind of been that independent, &quot;Jill of all trades&quot; type.  I’m still learning how to actually use power tools (lol), but I’ve always managed to figure out everything I’ve put my mind too.  I received an undergrad degree in Psychology (04') that never really got me anywhere, except for the free counseling of all the loved ones around me.  I don't blame them, after all, I am a logical individual, but I also have a quirky, creative flair.  I have lived three places in my life.  I’ve traveled more.  I’m originally from Western MD, then the Shenandoah Valley, and now here.  Time passes so quickly.  It’s crazy that I’ve been here eight years already.  My family still loves the mountains, but I just love the beach.  Between all of us, I get the best of both worlds.  When I visit home, I get to ski and ride four wheelers.  I’m a fool for sun and sand though.  Somehow, I’ve managed, over the past few years, to find peace and balance in my life.  I work at a restaurant in VB Towne Center (very good seafood).  Luckily, my job seems to pay the bills, as I have been fortunate enough to purchase my own little condo two years ago.  I am currently pursuing my PreK-6 licensure, but long term see myself somewhere in school counseling.  I can never determine the age group I really want to work with.  

Between work and school, I have soooo many hobbies it's amazingly difficult to squeeze them all in.  I have two dogs that are mouthier than any dogs I know.  Really, they are mouthy hound dogs.  I love, love to cook and have my wine (am I allowed to mention that here?).  :)  I love to creatively write, read, exercise, be outdoors, shop, garden, and be with the people I love.  I am a hardworking type and am looking forward to a new semester.  As with all my classes so far, I trust this course will better prepare me for a new occupation.

== EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY... A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS ==
Not too often in my life do I find it difficult to answer questions.  However, when one asks me, “why do I desire to teach or what would I like for my students”, it is daunting to only state a few, brief components.  It is comparable to not having all the ingredients to a great recipe.  Nonetheless, there is a foundation or base for all cooking; as there is also a foundation or base for a solid education.  As I’ve grown from my direct experience in the kitchen, I desire to grow in that direction in my classroom. 

One of the most advantageous skills we can learn in this life is the ability to self-regulate.  For some of us the acquisition of that skill may take longer than others.  At a young age we develop quite a consciousness of emotions.  We observe responses from others, we observe behavior, and we have intuitions about environmental stimuli.  We see and feel emotions long before we comprehend them.  However, it is not long before we all understand that we need emotional competency in order to participate successfully in society.  Our emotions are a valuable ingredient in the recipe of our academic, and life success.  

Early childhood educators need to understand the significant role they play in the healthy, emotional development of their students.  Self-regulation is imperative to learning and teachers have the responsibilities of fostering strong, kind, and stable characters in their classrooms.  Teachers can affect this emotional development of their students in various ways.  They should be clear with expectations and consistent in their actions. They should never punish or find themselves in vicious cycles of negative reinforcement.  They should explain emotions and model effective coping strategies.  They should work diligently to always provide a positive, reinforcing environment for each student.  

Although the ability to regulate our emotions is what truly enables us to begin the learning journey; it is still just the beginning.  Students need to be able to explore personal interests.  They need to work independently and collaboratively to discover answers to questions; without being confined to narrowed, stringent curriculum.  While incorporating a more integrated, project-based approach, children are more thoroughly engaged and are able to move beyond minimum curriculum standards.  Children become better goal setters because they are more accountable and autonomous in the classroom, just as they are in life.

Teachers have the responsibility of providing their students with authentic assessments and genuine feedback.  They must use effective assessment techniques to monitor and chart individual progress. With goals of successfully accomplishing a more integrated approach, it is essential for children to discover their own strengths and weaknesses.  It is vital for teachers to assess and offer genuine feedback so that students can work within their individual potential and progress accordingly.  

Although safety in my mind is presupposed, it is necessary to mention the importance of feeling safe and being safe.  Teachers need to ensure that children always feel comfortable and never vulnerable.  Research supports ideas behind building a community of learners in the classroom.  Once a strong community has been established, children tend to take more risks.  They trust enough to move from their comfort zones into more challenging tasks, without focusing on fears of failure.  The classroom and other students, in essence, becomes a safe haven for them to explore according to their own inquisitive nature. 

Everyone has their own ideas about what the exact components are for creating a successful classroom environment.  Teachers can vary slightly or vastly in their overall approaches, but some things still remain necessary.  Teachers need to be equipped with hard work, diligence, patience, and passion.  These particular credentials should be non-negotiable.  Teachers hold an extremely valuable position in society.  They are liable for shaping the minds and spirits of our future through our children.  They are responsible for creating virtues and academics.  They are responsible for laying the groundwork to a solid education.  It is a true challenge, but also a great calling.  I will utilize every resource available to ensure each child in my classroom receives the very best.</text>

Hi. Although I was most interested in the &quot;Create a book&quot; tool on my Wikipedia Stephen2nd account, this tool has now disappeared from that page. So, I'll try it from here.

'''The Science and Art of Heraldry:''' Since the reign of [[Henry III]]: English [[heraldry]] has been regarded as a [[Science]], by being in possession of a system, a classification, and a technical language of its own. It is still the essence of a heraldic language to be concise yet complete, expressive, and abounding in suggestions. Repetition of any important word is scrupulously avoided; and, where it would be required, another form of expression is substituted in its stead. Much meaning is left to be implied and understood. &lt;ref&gt; English Heraldry: Boutell ([[1904]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1989]], an Englishman with the birth-name of Stephen Mowbray McDermott, whilst researching his family history, accidentally discovered his names of STEPHEN &amp; Mc &amp; DERMOTT en-Cyphered on\in the [[Garter]] and [[motto]] of the: [[Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]]; This article exemplifies these ''cryptographic'' words/names as '''Ciphers in the Royal Arms'''.

==[[God]] and my right hand:==
[[File:Hands of God and Adam.jpg|thumb|left|[[1509]]ad: [[Michelangelo]]: Ceiling of [[Sistine Chapel]]: [[Right Hand of God]]]]

[[Image:Richard3England.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Richard III]]]]

:Existing before all known languages, fingers, hands and '''''Arms''''', have always been a means of communication, to simply point is internationally understood: The picture ''St. [[Thomas Becket]] faces King [[Henry II]] in a dispute''; is thus described due soley to the images of their hands and fingers. The portraits of Kings [[Henry VIII]] and [[Richard III]], both emphasise their '''''Right Hand''''' little fingers. Richard III is also depicted as grasping the [[Heraldic badge]] of [[St. George and the Dragon]]; suspended from the Chain of the [[Order of the Garter]] in his right hand, with specific emphasis on his '''''Right Hand''''' little finger: The emphasis of '''''Right Hand''''', little finger and Garter, convey hidden communications. 

:These same emphases are repeated by King [[Charles I]]: &quot;Charles the Martyr&quot; by W Marshall illustrating the “[[Eikon Basilike]]”, also shows King Charles grasping the Chain of the Order of the Garter, and specifically emphasising his '''''Right Hand''''' little finger; depicted pointing to the letters: '''IN VERBO TVO SPES MEA''': ('''''In Thy Word is My Hope'''''): 
:Charles also appears to be in [[thought]] about [[God]], also thinking about a [[symbolic]] [[crown]], whilst holding a [[crown of thorns]] of the [[Son of God]]; this crown of a circularity [[wreath]] symbolizing a never-ending circle of [[eternity]] or [[Crown of Immortality]]; See: Bilblical origins [[Right Hand of God]] or God's '''''Right Hand''''': &lt;ref&gt; Holy Bible: Acts 7:55, Mark 14:62 of the New Testament and Psalm 63:8 in the Old Testament;&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to his [[Divine Right of Kings]]: '''DIEU''' et mon DROIT: ('''GOD''' and my RIGHT): Hand on a [[Bible]] '''''Right Hand''''' raised; defines a legal [[Oath]] before God.

:Eikon's emphases may be explained in reference to the Royal Arms of King [[Charles I]]; which can be seen above the main entrance of the Kings Manor, St. Leonards Place, [[York]], near to [[York Minster]]. [[Henry VIII]] and [[Charles II]] stayed at the Kings Manor, as did Charles I ([[1633]] &amp; [[1639]]): Depicting a first use of his Unicorn supporter, the Royal Motto; [[DIEU ET MON DROIT]], has the [ '''N''' ] of '''MON''' carved in reverse.  The Garter motto is also re-defined, as exampled in the '''Royal Arms''' of King [[Charles II]] (dated: [[1682]]): (Christow Church, [[Devon]]): GARTER motto: '''MAL PENSE HONI SOIT QUI''': Uniquely, he letter [ '''Y''' ] is missing, also the letters '''PENSE''' are between the lions paws, (i.e. ''Paws for thought''): and the letters '''HONI SOIT''' are between the Unicorn’s hooves:&lt;ref&gt;Heraldic &amp; Genealogical Notes From Devon Churches: Mike Brown: Dartmoor Press: ([[2002]]):&lt;/ref&gt; NB: &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot; means &quot;'''God and my right'''&quot;, also; “'''God and my ''Right Hand''''':”&lt;ref&gt;Kearsley’s Complete Peerage” ([[1799]]) - Translation of Mottos: (xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Historical Encyclopedia (Pg 227).by M E Snodgrass, ([[2003]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Questions and Answers Notes and Queries” (Pg 109) by M de Albuquerque ([[1906]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americana – (Pg 437): American Historical Society ([[1926]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of American Genealogy (Pg 112) by RB Ferrall ([[1981]])&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. motto of [[George III]] &lt;ref&gt;Kearsley’s Complete Peerage” ([[1799]]) - Translation of Mottos: (xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt;):

===Cyphers in the Garter:===

:According to the Kings Council Judge; Arthur Charles Fox-Davis of the Inner Temple, the armorial historian and author; &lt;Ref name=&quot;Heraldry&quot;&gt;Art of Heraldry; Encyclopedia of Armory. A.C. Fox-Davis. ([[1908]]) ISBN: 0906223342.&lt;/Ref&gt; “''Much '''ingenuity''' seems to have been expended in devising badges and [[motto]]es which should convey an index of the name and family of the owner”''. A concept repeated in the [[HMSO]] Encyclopedia: &lt;Ref&gt;The Royal Encyclopaedia: Crown copyright ([[1991]]). ISBN: 0333538102: &lt;/Ref&gt; ''Royal Arms: “Their functional purpose is the heraldic identification of the person, which should clearly identify a particular person”: '' The particular name on/in the '''Royal Arms''' since before [[King]] [[Edward III]], and { '''on/i''' ''n'' } the current [[Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] ([[2009]]) is: “'''Stephen Mc Dermott'''.”

:Fox-Davis also elaborates the fact that: “'''''there are two ciphers one within and one without the Garter''.”''' This statement is in direct reference to his image of “'''The Royal Arms of Great Britain, as determined by the Warrant in the reign of Queen Victoria”:''' (Plate: CXIV): With reference the concept of circularity, as pertaining to the Garter; The Royal Warrant depicts eleven Royal Heraldic badges, ten of which have no Garters, and one which is encircled with a Garter. The (main) Royal Arms Garter is encircled with the Chain of the Order of the Garter, itself, containing thirteen linked Garters, which revolves each individual Garter in turn, overall a full 360 degrees. All fifteen images of the Garter contain the Royal motto of the Garter; '''HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE''': Each of the interlinked (30 total) Chain-Garters, is centered with an [[English Rose]].

:The term; “''there are two ciphers one within and one without the Garter'',” is ambiguous. Fox-Davis only infers that the two ciphers are the monogram (V.R.) of [[Victoria]] Regina. However, only one of the (V.R.) Badge-Ciphers can be defined as; within a Garter. This Cipher within a Garter; is previously unknown, along with the Royal Badge of the [[Union Jack]] symbol of [[Britain]] on a shield, which was previously determined as the [[Duke of Wellington]]’s [[Augmentation]], acquired by [[Prince Albert]] Sax Coburg-Gotha in [[1852]]. The two Ciphers (V.R.) of Victoria Regina, may clearly identify a particular person, but, this is only one specific Cipher in reference to the Garter. However, in terms of ingenuity (''in reference to heraldic identification, and an index of a name and a family''): There are fifteen Cyphers, of the same name - ''Within the Garter itself'', and also fifteen Cyphers of the same name elsewhere in the Royal Arms - ''Without the Garter''. A Cypher of another name (Re: &quot;'''ONI'''&quot;) ''Within and Without the Garter'' in the Royal Motto: also, ''seven'' ingenious cyphers heraldically defining terms ('''Mc''') - ''on &amp; in &amp; Within &amp; Without the Garter''.

:NB: Such '''''ingenuity''''' redefines [[Cypher]] as [[Cipher]]: ''''Secret or disguised manner of writing, whether by characters arbitrarily invented, or by an arbitrary use of letters or characters in other than their ordinary sense, by making single words stand for sentences or phrases, or by other methods intelligible only to those possessing the key; a cryptograph'':

===De-Ciphering the Garter: ===
[[File:Beyondhand.gif|thumb|left|150px|R/H finger pivot on MON = DERMOTT; Pense = STEPHEN]]
:'''Cipher of STEPHEN in the Garter''': The circulatory Garter cipher required certain procedures to be enacted, before the De-cipher could be achieved to depict its hidden name &amp;etc. This procedure was re-discovered in the mid 17th century, in a quote attributed to Clarendon; ''“To open the cipher of other men’s thoughts,”'' i.e. PENSE defined as thinks or thoughts: THinKING representing TH in KING (KNIGHT); then when added to PENSE = King Stephen: This procedure incorporating phrases associated to ‘Think:’ (Eg: Think -on it: -about it: -it over): The next procedure referred to by Fox-Davis: “Given Pause” i.e. “Paws -for- thought.” To incorporate the “Holding between the paws,”  i.e. PENSE between the lions paws: ([[Lion rampant]]: [[Supporter]]):
:(Re: Think -on- '''IT''') = PENSE -on- HONI SO '''IT''' = H-PENSE-T:  (Re: Think about it) = '''HO:PE''' NSE = Charles II Eikon Cipher: &quot;In Thy Word is my '''Hope'''&quot;; 
:Finally (think it over): = H-ESNEP-T: Place the &quot;little finger&quot; of the '''''Right Hand''''' as a pivot on the [ N ] of the H-ESNEP-T;

The castle was built for to defend the [[Tyne Bridge]], to secure a free pass for English armies returning from Scotland into Northumberland. Rufus, however, was the first to employ arms against it, against a rebellion headed by Mowbray Earl of Northumberland.''

:In 1095ad: Mowbray, having “''Raised the Standard''” of rebellion against [[William Rufus]], the son and successor of William the Conqueror, the King marched against the new castle with a great army, and took it after a short siege together with several of Mowbray’s partisans. Undeterred, Mowbray converted Tynemouth monastery into Tynemouth Castle: Thither, William marched with his army against Mowbray in Tynemouth Castle, and after a siege of two months took the Castle by storm. William captured his brother and made him prisoner, but Mowbray escaped and took refuge in [[Bamborough Castle]], which William also besieged, but finding it impregnable against Mowbray, erected a fully garrisoned castle blockade it, whilst William returned south. The besieged Mowbray twice escaped to his castle of Newcastle, eventually taking sanctuary in the Tynemouth church of [[St. Oswin]], where he was captured and made prisoner.

==DIEU ET MON DROIT==
REF: Translations: DIEU ET MON DROIT: (Meanings): (1): '''God and my right''': (2): '''God and my right hand''': [7][8][9][10][11] (3): '''God and my lawful right''': [12] (4): '''God and my right shall me defend''': [13]The meaning of Dieu et mon droit is God and my right. However, according to “Kearsley’s Complete Peerage” (1799): Dieu et mon Droit meaning “God and my right hand” was the motto of King George III. Kearsley’s Peerage; printed June 1799, appeared during publication of the 1st Edition (1796-1808): of the German “Brockhaus Encyclopedia;” emphasizing the raising of the ‘Right Hand’ during installations and coronations of German Kings. Later interpretations quote Dieu et mon droit, stands for &quot;God and my lawful right&quot; and not &quot;God and my right hand.&quot;:Heraldic Usage: '''DIEU ET -&amp;- MON DROIT''': Most depictions of the Royal Arms separate the DIEU ET from the MON DROIT: The '''DIEU ET''' is always depicted beneath the rear/bottom feet (paws: hooves: claws) of the dexter (right) Royal supporter i.e. The Lion or Boar. The MON DROIT is always depicted beneath the rear feet of the sinister Royal supporter i.e. The Greyhound, Dragon or Unicorn. The '''DIEU ET''' (on its own) is also listed among terminologies of '''giving an oath'''. [14] The '''MON DROIT''' (on its own) is further quoted in terminology meaning: &quot; '''My right hand''' &quot;:[15] The '''DROIT''' (on its own) is quoted as meaning in French; '''law; a legal title, claim or due'''.[16]:Royal Banners: DIEU ET MON –&amp;- DROYT: (SEE: Royal Standard of England): (Banners: [17]): All Royal Standards separate the DIEU ET MON from the DROYT. As can be seen in the Banners of [[Edward III]]: [[Richard II]]: [[Edward IV]]: [[Henry V]] ( 2 ): [[Henry VII]] ( 2 ): NB: Under [[Cromwell]], (Commonwealth) his motto separates PAX QUAERITUR from BELLO: NB: The [[Earl of Mar]] ([[Scotland]]) motto separates JE '''PENSE''' from PLUS: The &quot;'''ET MON DROIT'''&quot; contains the '''D:E:R:M:O:T:T''' cypher, as exemplified in: [[Talk:Dieu et mon droit]] and [[User talk:Stephen2nd/Sandbox (c)]]

'''The Royal Standard of England''', in favour during [[Tudor]] times, was a narrow, tapering swallow-tailed [[flag]], of considerable length, used mainly for [[pageant]]s. [[English]] Standards had the [[cross of St. George]] at their head; then the heraldic [[device]], [[badge]] or [[crest]], with its [[motto]]. These did not bear the [[coat of arms]]. 

Arms are displayed on banners. [[Royal Banners]] are often confused with [[Royal Standards]]. It is the Royal Banner which flies above the place where the [[sovereign]] is in residence. The Royal Standard of England has the motto: [[Dieu et mon droit]], which is divided into two bands: Dieu et mon and Droyt.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell's Heraldry: Frederic Warne &amp; Co Ltd. 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ABOUT ME:
My name is Angelia Ferguson, I am 32 Years old.  I live in Bluefield, Virginia with my husband of nine years and our two beautiful children.  Alyssa is almost 5 and Mason is almost 3.  They have the same birthday July 24 just 2 years apart!!  Can you believe that!!

I graduated from a very small high school and went to college so confused about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.  I received a Bachelor's Degree in Business in 1999.  Through college I worked at a local bank, and then moved on to a medical equipment supply company where I worked for the next six years.  During that time I had our daughter, and was not happy being away from her.  The next phase of my life began...I opened up a daycare in my home.  This has been my job for the last few years.  It is very challenging at times, but it was a good decision for me.  This has brought me to where I am today, pursuing a liscensure in PreK-6.

I love spending time with my family, going to the beach, and LOVE chocolate!!


EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY:
I believe a great teacher is someone who can relate to each student, everyone comes from different backgrounds and circumstances.  Being able to understand where each student has been I think would be very beneficial in how they may learn and interact with other classmates.  Every child will learn in a different way...hands on activities are great.  A good teacher needs to have a positive learning environment and a lot of patience.  Being able to motivate your students I think is also very important.  A successful teacher can handle diversity and problems as they arise and keep the classroom engaged with fun but educational activities.  Teachers are role models to our children, they see them everyday and help shape their minds.  Good teachers are excited to come to work each day not for a paycheck, but for the love of their students.
 
The classroom environment should be exciting and BOLD.  Decorated with bright colors, pictures, and learning aids.  There should be a lot of student-teacher interaction, as well as group assisgnments.  This allows students to work with their peers and to really interact with classmates.  I think technology integration like power point, projectors, and the use of computers can be an empowering tool for students which can improve learning and achievement.  Parental involvement is so important for the success of the child.  Parents need to be informed about what is going on in the classroom and receive regular feedback about the progress of their child.</text>

&lt;big&gt;Original author: Guy Cohen, Tel-Aviv University&lt;/big&gt;

[[Media:biosoft.pdf|PDF version.]]
[[Media:biosoft_diagrams.pdf|All diagrams.]]

==Introduction and Preliminaries==
We will make several assumptions throughout the course:
  
#The physics in question are generally in the classical regime, &lt;math&gt;\hbar\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;. 
#Materials are &quot;soft&quot;: quantitatively, this implies that all relevant energy scales are of the order of &lt;math&gt;k_{B}T&lt;/math&gt;. 
#Condensed matter physics deals with systems composed of &lt;math&gt;O\left(10^{23}\right)&lt;/math&gt; particles, and statistical mechanics applies. We are always interested in a reduced description, in terms of continuum mechanics and elasticity, hydrodynamics, macroscopic electrodynamics and so on. 

We begin with an example from Chaikin &amp; Lubensky, the story of an
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. This molecule is bound together
by a chemical bond which is around &lt;math&gt;20k_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; at room temperature
and not easily broken under normal circumstances. What happens when
we put &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{23}&lt;/math&gt; water molecules is a container? First of all,
with such large numbers we can safely discuss phases of matter: namely&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\underset{(\mbox{amorphous/crystal ice)}}{\mbox{solid}}\leftrightarrow\underset{\mbox{(water)}}{\mbox{fluid}}\leftrightarrow\underset{\mbox{(steam)}}{\mbox{gas}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Gas is typical to low density, high temperature and low pressure.
It is generally prone to changes in shape and volume, homogeneous,
isotropic, weakly interacting and insulating. This is the least ordered
form of matter relevant to our scenario, and relatively easy to treat
since order parameters are small.
The liquid phase is typical of intermediate temperatures. It flows
but is not very compressible. It is homogeneous, isotropic, dense
and strongly interacting. Its response to external forces depends
on the rate of its deformation. Liquids are hard to treat theoretically,
as their intermediate properties make simple approximations less effective.
The solid is a dense ordered phase with low entropy and strong interactions.
It is anisotropic and does not flow, it strongly resists compression
and its response to forces depends on the amount of deformation they
cause (elastic).
Transitions between these phases occur at specific values of thermodynamic
parameters (see diagram (1)). First order changes (volume/density &quot;jumps&quot; at the transition, and no jump in pressure/temperature)
occur on the lines; at the critical liquid/gas point, second order
phase transitions occur; at the triple point, all three phases (solid/liquid/gas)
coexist.
The systems we are interested in are characterized by several kinds
of interactions between their constituent molecules: for example,
Coulombic interactions of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{q^{2}}{r^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; when charged
particles are present, fixed dipole interaction of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{p}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{2}}{r^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
when permanent dipoles exist, and almost always induced dipole/van
der Waals interaction of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta\mathbf{p}_{1}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{p}_{2}}{r^{6}}&lt;/math&gt;.
At close range we also have the &quot;hard core&quot; or steric repulsion,
sometimes modeled by a &lt;math&gt;\sim\frac{1}{r^{12}}&lt;/math&gt; potential. Simulations
often use the so-called &lt;math&gt;12-6&lt;/math&gt; Lennard-Jones potential &lt;math&gt;U=4\varepsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6}\right]&lt;/math&gt;(as
pictured in (2)), which with appropriate parameters correctly describes
both condensation and crystallization in some cases.
{{Sidenote|When only the repulsive potential exists (for instance, for billiard
balls), crystallization still takes place but no condensation/evaporation
phase transition between the liquid and gas phases exists.}}
Starting from a classical Hamiltonian such as &lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\mathbf{p}_{i}^{2}}{2m}+V_{VdW}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
we can predict all three phases of matter and the transitions between
them.
In biological systems, this simple picture does not suffice: the basic
consideration behind this is that of effects which occur at different
scales between the nanometric scale, through the mesoscopic and up
to the macroscopic scale. Biological systems are mesoscopic in nature,
and their properties cannot be described correctly when a coarse-graining
is performed without accurately accounting for mesoscopic properties.
A few examples follow:
====Liquid crystals====
The most basic assumption we need in order to model liquid crystals
is that isotropy at the molecular level is broken: molecules are represented
by rods rather than spheres. Such a description was suggested by Onsager
and others, and leads to three phases as shown in (3).

====Polymers====
When molecules are interconnected at mesoscopic ranges, new phases
and properties are encountered.
====Soap/beer foam====
This kind of substance is approximately 95%
agent, with the remainder water - yet it behaves like a weak solid
as long as its deformations are small. This is because a tight formation
of ordered cells separated by thin liquid films is formed, and in
order for the material to change shape the cells must be rearranged.
This need for restructuring is the cause of such systems' solid-like
resistance to change.

====Structured fluids====
Polymers or macromolecules in liquid state, liquid crystals, emulsions
and colloidal solutions and gels display complex visco-elastic behavior
as a result of mesoscopic super-structures within them.
====Soft 2D membranes====
Interfaces between fluids have interesting properties: they act as
a 2D liquid within the interface, yet respond elastically to any bending
of the surface. Surfactant molecules will spontaneously form membranes
within the same fluid, which also have these properties at appropriate
temperatures. Surfactants in solution also form lamellar structures
- multilayered structures in which the basic units are the membranes
rather than single molecules.

==Polymers==
&lt;big&gt;Books:&lt;/big&gt; Doi, de Gennes, Rubinstein, Doi &amp; Edwards.
===Introduction===
====Brief history====
Natural polymers like rubber have been known since the dawn of history,
but not understood. The first artificial polymer was made &lt;math&gt;\sim1905&lt;/math&gt;.
Stadinger was the first to understand that polymers are formed by
molecular chains and is considered to be the father of synthetic polymers.
Most polymers were made by petrochemical industry. Nylon was born
in 1940. Various uses and unique properties (light, strong, thermally
insulating; available in many different forms from strings and sheets
to bulk; cheap, easy to process, shape and mass-produce...) have made
them very attractive commercially. Later on, some leading scientists
were Kuhn and Flory in chemistry (30's to 70's) and Stockmayer in
physical chemistry (50's and 60's). The famous modern theory of polymers
was first formulated by P.G. de Gennes and Sam Edwards.


====What is a polymer?====

Material composed of chains, having a repeating basic unit (monomer).
Connections between monomers are made by chemical (covalent) bonds,
and are strong at room temperature.&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[A\right]_{N}\equiv\overset{N\mbox{ times}}{\overbrace{A-A-A-...-A}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the polymerization index.
{{Sidenote|More generally, this kind of structure is called a ''homopolymer'' .
''Heteropolymers''  - which have several repeating constituent units
- also exist. These can have a random structure (&lt;math&gt;A-B-B-A-B-A...&lt;/math&gt;)
or a block structure (&lt;math&gt;\left[A\right]_{n}\left[B\right]_{m}\left[C\right]_{l}&lt;/math&gt;),
in which case they are called ''block copolymers'' . These can self-assemble
into complex ordered structures and are often very useful.
}}
{{Sidenote|For an example, look up ester monomers and polyester, or polyethylene.}}
Polymerization is also the name of the process by which polymers
are synthesized, which involves a chain reaction where a reactive
site exists at the end of the chain. Some chemical reactions increase
the chain length by one unit, while simultaneously moving the reactive
site to the new end:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[A\right]_{N}+\left[A\right]_{1}\rightarrow\left[A\right]_{N+1}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
There also exist condensation processes, by which chains unite:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[A\right]_{N}+\left[A\right]_{M}\rightarrow\left[A\right]_{N+M},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N,\, M\ge1&lt;/math&gt;. A briefer notation, dropping the name of the
monomer, is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left(N\right)+\left(M\right)\rightarrow\left(N+M\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Consider the example of hydrocarbon polymers, where we have a monomer
which is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}&lt;/math&gt;(Check this...). As a larger number
of such units is joined together to become polyethylene molecules,
the material composed of these molecules changes drastically in nature:

====Types of polymer structures====

Polymers can exist in different topologies, which affect the macroscopic
properties of the material they form (see (4)):
  
*Linear chains (this is the simplest case, which we will be discussing). 
*Rings (chains connected at the ends). 
*Stars (several chain arms connected at a central point). 
*Tree (connected stars). 
*Comb (one main chain with side chains branching out). 
*Dendrimer (ordered branching structure). 

====Polymer phases of matter====

Depending on the environment and larger-scale structure, polymers
can exist in many states:
  
*Gas of isolated chains (not very relevant).

===Ideal Polymer Chains in Solution===


====Some basic models of polymer chains====

The simplest model of an ideal polymer chain is the ''freely jointed chain'' (FJC), where each monomer performs a completely independent
random rotation. Here, at equilibrium the end-to-end length of the chain is &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\simeq N^{\frac{1}{2}}\ell=L^{\frac{1}{2}}\ell^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L=N\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the contour length.

A slightly more realistic model is the ''freely rotating chain'' 
(FRC), where monomers are locked at some chemically meaningful ''bond angle'' &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; and rotate freely around it via the ''torsional angle'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Here,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; \simeq &amp; L\ell_{eff}\sim N^{\frac{1}{2}},

\ell_{eff} &amp; = &amp; \ell\frac{1+\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that for &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \cos\vartheta\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt; we find
that &lt;math&gt;\ell_{eff}=\ell&lt;/math&gt; and this is identical to the FJC. For very
small &lt;math&gt;\vartheta\sim\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, we can expand the cosine an obtain
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ell_{eff}\underset{{\scriptstyle \vartheta\rightarrow0}}{\longrightarrow}\frac{2\ell}{\varepsilon}\left(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)\gg\ell.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is the rigid rod limit (to be discussed later in detail).

A second possible improvement is the ''hindered rotation''  (HR)
model. Here the angles &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i}&lt;/math&gt; have a minimum-energy value,
and are taken from an uncorrelated Boltzmann distribution with some
potential &lt;math&gt;V\left(\varphi_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; \simeq &amp; L\ell_{eff}\sim N,

\ell_{eff} &amp; = &amp; \ell\left(\frac{1+\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}\right)\left(\frac{1+\left\langle \cos\varphi\right\rangle }{1-\left\langle \cos\varphi\right\rangle }\right).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
{{Sidenote|See Flory's book for details.}}
Another option is called the ''rotational isomeric state''  model. Here, a finite
number of angles are possible for each monomer junction and the state
of the full chain is given in terms of these. Correlations are also
taken into account and the solution is numeric, but aside from a complicated
&lt;math&gt;\ell_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; this is still an ideal chain with &lt;math&gt;R_{0}^{2}\simeq L\ell_{eff}\sim N&lt;/math&gt;.

====Calculating the end-to-end radius====

For the polymer chain of (5), obviously we will always have &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{N}\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.
The variance, however, is generally not zero: using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{N}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{N}^{2}\right\rangle =\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}\mathbf{r}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{j}=\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}\ell^{2}\left\langle \cos\vartheta_{ij}\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;big&gt;FJC&lt;/big&gt;

In the freely jointed chain (FJC) model, there are neither correlations
between different sites nor restrictions on the rotational angles.
We therefore have &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \cos\vartheta_{ij}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\ell^{2}}\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{j}\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,
and&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{N}^{2}\right\rangle =\sum_{ij}\ell^{2}\delta_{ij}=N\ell^{2}=L\ell.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{Sidenote|The mathematics are similar to that of a random walk or diffusion process, where in 1D &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle }\sim t^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

Therefore, &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\equiv\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{N}^{2}\right\rangle }=N^{\frac{1}{2}}\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;big&gt;FRC&lt;/big&gt;

In the freely rotating chain model, the bond angles are held constant
at angles &lt;math&gt;\vartheta_{i}&lt;/math&gt; while the torsion angles &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
are taken from a uniform distribution between &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.
This introduces some correlation between the angles: since (for one
definition of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i}&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{i+1}=\cos\vartheta_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}+\sin\vartheta_{i}(\sin\varphi_{i}\mathbf{\hat{y}}\times\mathbf{r}_{i}+\cos\varphi_{i}\mathbf{\hat{x}}\times\mathbf{r}_{i})&lt;/math&gt;,
and since the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are independent and any averaging over a sine of cosine of one or more of them will result in a zero, only the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i}&lt;/math&gt; independent terms survive and by recursion this correlation has the simple form&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{j}\right\rangle =\ell^{2}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{\left|i-j\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The end-to-end radius is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{ij=1}^{N}\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{j}\right\rangle \\

&amp; = &amp; \sum_{i=1}^{N}\overset{{\scriptstyle =\ell^{2}}}{\overbrace{\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}^{2}\right\rangle }}+\ell^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\overset{{\scriptstyle k=i-j}}{\overbrace{\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{i-j}}}+\ell^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\overset{{\scriptstyle k=j-i}}{\overbrace{\sum_{j=i+1}^{N}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{j-i}}}\\

&amp; = &amp; N\ell^{2}+\ell^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{k}+\sum_{k=1}^{N-i}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{k}\right].\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we can approximate the two sums in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; by the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\cos^{k}\vartheta=\frac{\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}&lt;/math&gt;, giving&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{0}^{2}\simeq N\ell^{2}+2\ell^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}=N\ell^{2}\frac{1+\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


To extract the Kuhn length &lt;math&gt;\ell_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; from this expression, we rewrite in in the following way:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{0}^{2}=N\left(\ell\sqrt{\frac{1+\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}}\right)^{2}\equiv N\ell\ell_{eff}=L\ell_{eff},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ell_{eff}=\ell\frac{1+\cos\vartheta}{1-\cos\vartheta}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To go back from this to the FRC limit, we would consider a chain with a random distribution of &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; angles such that &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \cos\vartheta\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Gyration radius====

Consider once again the polymer chain of (5). Define:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{g}^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}^{\prime}-\mathbf{R}_{CM}^{\prime}\right)^{2}\equiv\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{R}_{i}^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The unprimed coordinate system is refocused on the center of mass,
such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}\mathbf{R}_{i}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Now, it is easier to work with
the following expression:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)^{2} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left(-2\mathbf{R}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{j}+2\mathbf{R}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{2N}{2N^{2}}\sum_{i}\mathbf{R}_{i}^{2}-\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{{\scriptstyle =0}}{\overbrace{\left(\sum_{i}\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)}}\cdot\overset{{\scriptstyle =0}}{\overbrace{\left(\sum_{j}\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)}}

 &amp; = &amp; R_{g}^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We will calculate &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt; for a long FJC. For &lt;math&gt;N\gg1&lt;/math&gt; we can replace the sums with integrals, obtaining&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcr}
\left\langle R_{g}^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\overset{\scriptstyle {\left|i-j\right|\ell^{2}}}{\overbrace{\left\langle \left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)^{2}\right\rangle }}\\

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2N^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}u\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}v\,\ell^{2}\left|u-v\right|\\

&amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{2N^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}u\int_{0}^{u}\mathrm{d}v\,\ell^{2}\left(u-v\right)\\

&amp; = &amp; \frac{\ell^{2}}{N^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}u\left[u^{2}-\frac{1}{2}u^{2}\right]\\

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{6}N\ell^{2}.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives the gyration radius for an FJC:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{g}^{2}=\frac{1}{6}N\ell^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Polymers and Gaussian distributions====

An ideal chain is a Gaussian chain, in the sense that the end-to-end
radius is taken from a Gaussian distribution. We will see two proofs
of this.


&lt;big&gt;Random walk proof&lt;/big&gt;

One way to show this (see Rubinstein, de Gennes) is to begin with
a random walk. For one dimension, if we begin at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and at each
time step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; move left or right with moves &lt;math&gt;x_{i}=\pm\ell&lt;/math&gt; and the final displacement &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i}x_{i},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; then &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x=\ell\left(N_{+}-N_{-}\right)\equiv\ell N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We define &lt;math&gt;Z_{N}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; as the number of configurations of
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; steps with a final displacement of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;P_{N}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the associated normalized probability.&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Z_{N}\left(x\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{N!}{\left(N_{+}\right)!\left(N_{-}\right)!}\underset{{\scriptstyle N\rightarrow\infty}}{\longrightarrow}\frac{C}{\sqrt{N}}e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle }},

\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; N\ell^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In fact, for &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; the central limit theorem tells
us that &lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; will have a Gaussian distribution for any
distribution of the &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be extended to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions
with a displacement &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{x}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Z_{N}^{d} &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{C}{\sqrt{N}}\right)^{d}\exp\left\{ -\frac{dR^{2}}{2\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle }\right\} ,

\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; d\left\langle \mathbf{x}_{i}^{2}\right\rangle =N\ell^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To find the normalization constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; we must integrate over alldimensions:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
1=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; \left(\int\mathrm{d}xZ_{N}\left(x\right)\right)^{d}\\

&amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{C}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{2\pi\left\langle x^{2}\right\rangle }\right)^{d},\\

&amp; \Downarrow\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}^{d}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)=\left(\frac{d}{2\pi N\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{d}{2}}\exp\left\{ -\frac{dR^{2}}{2N\ell^{2}}\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Some notes: 
  
*An ideal chain can now be redefined as one such that &lt;math&gt;P_{N}^{d}\left(R\right)&lt;/math&gt; is Gaussian in any dimension &lt;math&gt;d\ge1&lt;/math&gt;.  
*This is also true for a long chain with local interactions only, such that &lt;math&gt;R_{0}^{2}=N\ell\ell_{eff}=L\ell_{eff}\sim N&lt;/math&gt;. 
*The probability of being in a spherical shell with radius '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R'''}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4\pi R^{2}P_{N}\left(R\right)&lt;/math&gt;. 
*The chance of returning to the origin &lt;math&gt;P_{N}\left(R=0\right)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{2\pi\ell^{2}N}\right)^{\frac{d}{2}}\sim\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)^{\frac{d}{2}}\equiv N^{-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{d}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is typical of an ideal chain. 
*For any dimension &lt;math&gt;d\ge1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_{0}=\sqrt{\left\langle R^{2}\right\rangle }\sim N^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;big&gt;Formal proof&lt;/big&gt;

Another way to show this follows, which is also extensible to other
distributions of the &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \mathbf{r}_{i}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;.
{{Sidenote|This proof can be found in Doi and Edwards.}}

In general, we can write&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{1}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{2}...\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{N}\Psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{1},...,\mathbf{r}_{N}\right)\delta\left(\mathbf{R}-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{r}_{i}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the absence of correlations, we can factorize &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{1},...,\mathbf{r}_{N}\right)=\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{1}\right)...\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{N}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For example, for a freely jointed chain &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=\alpha\delta\left(\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}\right|-\ell\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
The normalization constant is found from &lt;math&gt;\int\psi\left(r_{i}\right)4\pi r_{i}^{2}\mathrm{d}r_{i}=4\pi\alpha\ell^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;,
giving&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi\ell^{2}}\delta\left(\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}\right|-\ell\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can replace the delta functions with &lt;math&gt;\delta\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;,
leaving us with&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{1}...\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{N}\prod_{i}\left[e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{i}}\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)\right]

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}}\left[\int d\mathbf{r}e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right]^{N}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In spherical coordinates,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right) &amp; = &amp; \int r^{2}\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\vartheta\mathrm{d}\varphi\sin\vartheta e^{-ikr\cos\vartheta}\frac{1}{4\pi\ell^{2}}\delta\left(r-\ell\right)

 &amp; \overset{{\scriptscriptstyle \alpha=\cos\vartheta}}{=} &amp; \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}\mathrm{d}\alpha e^{-ik\ell\alpha}

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{\sin k\ell}{k\ell},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{3}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\left(\frac{\sin k\ell}{k\ell}\right)^{N}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We are left with the task of evaluating the integral. This can be
done analytically with the Laplace method for large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, since the
largest contribution is around &lt;math&gt;k\ell=0&lt;/math&gt;: we can approximate &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\sin k\ell}{k\ell}\right)^{N}&lt;/math&gt;
by &lt;math&gt;\left(1-\frac{\left(k\ell\right)^{2}}{6}+...\right)^{N}\simeq e^{-\frac{\left(k\ell\right)^{2}N}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The integral is then &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
P_{n}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{3}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}}e^{-\frac{k^{2}\ell^{2}N}{6}}\\

&amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{3}\int\mathrm{d}k_{1}\mathrm{d}k_{2}\mathrm{d}k_{3}\exp\left[\sum_{\alpha}\left(ik_{\alpha}R_{\alpha}-\frac{Nk_{\alpha}^{2}\ell^{2}}{6}\right)\right]\\

&amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{3}\prod_{\alpha}\int\mathrm{d}k_{\alpha}\exp\left(ik_{\alpha}R_{\alpha}-\frac{Nk_{\alpha}^{2}\ell^{2}}{6}\right)\\

&amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{3}{2\pi N\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left\{ -\frac{3R^{2}}{2N\ell^{2}}\right\} .\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is, of course, the same Gaussian form we have obtained from the
random walk (we have done the special case of &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt;, but once again
this process can be repeated for a general dimension &lt;math&gt;d\ge1&lt;/math&gt;).

===Rigid and Semi-Rigid Polymer Chains in Solution===


====Worm-like chain====

In considering the &lt;math&gt;\vartheta\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; limit of the freely rotating
chain, we have seen that &lt;math&gt;\ell_{eff}\sim\frac{\ell}{\vartheta^{2}}\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
This is of course unphysical, and this limit is actually important
for many interesting cases of stiff chains (for instance, DNA). If
we take the &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; limit along with &lt;math&gt;\vartheta\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;
and start over, we can make the following change of variables:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{j}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \ell^{2}\left\langle \cos\vartheta_{ij}\right\rangle 

 &amp; = &amp; \ell^{2}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{\left|i-j\right|}

 &amp; = &amp; \ell^{2}\exp\left[-\frac{\left|i-j\right|\ell}{\ell_{p}}\right],\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which defines the ''persistence length''  &lt;math&gt;\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;. For the FRC
model,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ell_{p}=-\frac{\ell}{\ln\cos\vartheta}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is a useful concept in general, however: it defines the typical
length scale over which correlations between chain angles dies out,
and is therefore an expression of the chain's rigidity.

At small &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; we can expand the logarithm to get&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\ln\cos\vartheta &amp; \simeq &amp; \ln\left(1-\frac{\vartheta^{2}}{2}\right)\approx-\frac{\vartheta^{2}}{2}

&amp; \Downarrow\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\ell_{p}\simeq\frac{2\ell}{\vartheta^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Taking the continuum limit carefully then requires us to consider
&lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R_{max}=N\ell\cos\frac{\vartheta}{2}\simeq N\ell&lt;/math&gt;
is constant. Now, we can calculate the end-to-end length &lt;math&gt;R_{0}^{2}=\left\langle R_{N}^{2}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
at the continuum limit using out the new form for the correlations:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; = &amp; \ell\sum_{ij}\left(\cos\vartheta\right)^{\left|i-j\right|}=\ell^{2}\sum_{ij}\exp\left\{ -\frac{\ell\left|i-j\right|}{\ell_{p}}\right\} 

&amp; \rightarrow &amp; \ell^{2}\int_{0}^{R_{m}}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\ell}\int_{0}^{R_{m}}\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\ell}\exp\left\{ -\frac{\left|u-v\right|}{\ell_{p}}\right\} .\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To simplify the calculation, we can define the dimensionless variable
&lt;math&gt;u^{\prime}=u/\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v^{\prime}=v/\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{m}^{\prime}=R_{m}/\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;.
With these replacements,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcr}
\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{\ell_{p}^{2}} &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}u^{\prime}\int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}v^{\prime}e^{-\left|u^{\prime}-v^{\prime}\right|}\\

 &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}u^{\prime}\int_{0}^{u^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}v^{\prime}e^{-u^{\prime}}e^{v^{\prime}}+\int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}u^{\prime}\int_{u^{\prime}}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}v^{\prime}e^{u^{\prime}}e^{-v^{\prime}}\\

 &amp; = &amp; \int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}u^{\prime}e^{-u^{\prime}}\left(e^{u^{\prime}}-1\right)+\int_{0}^{R_{m}^{\prime}}\mathrm{d}u^{\prime}e^{u^{\prime}}\left(e^{-u^{\prime}}-e^{-R_{m}^{\prime}}\right)\\

 &amp; = &amp; R_{m}^{\prime}+\left(e^{-R_{m}^{\prime}}-1\right)+R_{m}^{\prime}-e^{-R_{m}^{\prime}}\left(e^{R_{m}^{\prime}}-1\right)\\

 &amp; = &amp; 2R_{m}^{\prime}-2\left(1-e^{-R_{m}^{\prime}}\right).\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The final result (known as the Kratchky-Porod worm-like-chain or WLC)
is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{0}^{2}=\left\langle R_{N}^{2}\right\rangle =2\ell_{p}R_{max}-2\ell_{p}^{2}\left(1-e^{-\frac{R_{max}}{\ell_{p}}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Importantly, is does not depend on &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; but only on
the physically transparent persistence length and contour length.

We will consider the two limits where one parameter is much larger
than the other. First, for &lt;math&gt;\ell_{p}\gg R_{max}&lt;/math&gt; we encounter the
''rigid rod''  limit: we can expand the previous expression into&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; = &amp; 2\ell_{p}R_{max}-2\ell_{p}^{2}\left(1-1+\frac{R_{max}}{\ell_{p}}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{R_{max}}{\ell_{p}}\right)^{2}+...\right)

 &amp; = &amp; R_{max}^{2}+\vartheta\left(\frac{R_{max}^{3}}{\ell_{p}^{3}}\right),

 &amp; \Downarrow

R_{0} &amp; \sim &amp; N.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; The fact that &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\sim N&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\sim N^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a result of the long-range correlations we have introduced, and is an indication that at this regime the material is in an essentially different phase. Somewhere between the ideal chain and the rigid rod, a crossover regime must exist.
{{Sidenote|While an ideal chain has &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_{0}\sim N^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and a rigid rod has &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_{0}\sim N&lt;/math&gt;, in general polymer chains can have a scaling law &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_{0}\sim N^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The power &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nu&lt;/math&gt; need not be an integer.}}
For &lt;math&gt;\ell_{p}\ll R_{max}&lt;/math&gt; we can neglect the exponent, obtaining&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
R_{0}^{2} &amp; \simeq &amp; 2\ell_{p}R_{max},

\ell_{p} &amp; \simeq &amp; \frac{2\ell}{\vartheta^{2}},

R_{max} &amp; \simeq &amp; N\ell.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This therefore returns us to the ideal chain limit, with a Kuhn length
&lt;math&gt;\ell_{eff}=2\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;. The crossover phenomenon we discussed occurs
on the chain itself here as we observe correlation between its pieces
at differing length scales: at small scales (&lt;math&gt;\sim\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;) it behaves
like a rigid rod, while at long scales we have an uncorrelated random
walk. An interesting example is a DNA chain, which can be described
by a worm-like chain with &lt;math&gt;\ell_{p}\approx500\AA&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{max}\simeq10\mu m\gg\ell_{p}&lt;/math&gt;:
it will therefore typically cover a radius of &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\sim7000\AA&lt;/math&gt;.

===Free Energy of the Ideal Chain and Entropic Springs===
We have calculated distributions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; for Gaussian chains
with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; components, &lt;math&gt;Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Let's consider
the entropy of such chains:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; k_{B}\ln Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)

P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)}{\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)}=\left(\frac{3}{2\pi N\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{3R^{2}}{2N\ell^{2}}\right).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The logarithm of &lt;math&gt;Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that
of &lt;math&gt;P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, aside from a factor which does
not depend on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; \overset{{\scriptstyle =S_{N}\left(0\right)}}{\overbrace{k_{B}\ln\left(\int Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\right)+\frac{3}{2}k_{B}\ln\left(\frac{3}{2\pi N\ell^{2}}\right)}}-\frac{3}{2}k_{B}\frac{R^{2}}{N\ell^{2}}

 &amp; = &amp; S_{N}\left(0\right)-\frac{3}{2}k_{B}\frac{R^{2}}{N\ell^{2}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The free energy is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
F_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right) &amp; = &amp; U_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)-TS_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T\frac{R^{2}}{N\ell^{2}}\,\,+\underset{{\scriptscriptstyle _{U_{N}\left(0\right)-TS_{N}\left(0\right)}}}{\underbrace{F_{N}\left(0\right)}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;U_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)=U_{N}\left(0\right)&lt;/math&gt; for an ideal
chain.

What does &lt;math&gt;F_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt; mean? It represents the
energy needed to stretch the polymer, and this energy is &lt;math&gt;\sim R^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
like a harmonic spring (&lt;math&gt;U\sim\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{3k_{B}T}{N\ell^{2}}\sim\frac{T}{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that the polymer becomes ''less''  elastic (more rigid) as
the temperature increases, unlike most solids. This is a physical
result and can be verified experimentally: for instance, the spring
constant of rubber (which is made of networks of polymer chains) increases
linearly with temperature.
Consider an experiment where instead of holding the chain at constant
length, we apply a perturbatively weak force &lt;math&gt;\pm\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; to its
ends and measure its average length. We can perform a Legendre transform
between distance and force: from equality of forces along the direction
in which they are applied,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
f_{x} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial F_{N}}{\partial R_{x}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial R_{x}}\left(\frac{3k_{B}T}{2N\ell^{2}}R^{2}\right)=\overset{{\scriptstyle \equiv k}}{\overbrace{\frac{3k_{B}T}{N\ell^{2}}}}R_{x},\\

&amp; \Downarrow\\

\mathbf{f} &amp; = &amp; k\mathbf{R}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To be in this linear response (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\sim\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;) region,
we must demand that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\sim\left|\mathbf{R}_{0}\right|\ll R_{max}=N\ell&lt;/math&gt;,
and to stress this we can write&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{f}=\left(\frac{3k_{B}T}{\ell}\right)\frac{\mathbf{R}}{R_{max}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Numerically, with a nanometric &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and at room temperature the
forces should be in the picoNewton range to meet this requirement.
A more rigorous treatment which works at arbitrary forces can be carried
out by considering an FJC with oppositely charged (&lt;math&gt;\pm q&lt;/math&gt;) ends
in an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}\parallel\mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;. The chain's
sites are at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\equiv\mathbf{R}_{N}-\mathbf{R}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
The potential is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
U_{elec} &amp; = &amp; +q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{0}-q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{N}=f\mathbf{R}\\

&amp; \Downarrow\\

\mathbf{f} &amp; = &amp; q\mathbf{E}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the potential as &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U_{elec}=-q\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{R}=-q\mathbf{E}\cdot\left(\sum_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=-f\ell\sum_{i}\cos\vartheta_{i},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\cos\vartheta_{i}=\mathbf{\hat{z}\cdot}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The
partition function is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{f}\right) &amp; = &amp; \int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{1}...\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{N}\Psi\left(\left\{ \mathbf{r}_{i}\right\} \right)e^{-\beta U_{elec}\left(\left\{ \mathbf{r}_{i}\right\} \right)}

&amp; = &amp; \mbox{Tr}_{\Psi_{i}}e^{-\beta U\left(\left\{ \psi_{i}\right\} \right)}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; is separable into product of functions &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi\ell^{2}}\delta\left(\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}\right|-\ell\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
Now, &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\exp\left\{ -\frac{U_{elec}}{k_{B}T}\right\} =\exp\left\{ \frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\sum_{i}\cos\vartheta_{i}\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In spherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{i}=\left(r_{i},\vartheta_{i},\varphi_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
we can solve the integral:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{f}\right) &amp; = &amp; \left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}r\frac{r^{2}}{4\pi\ell^{2}}\delta\left(r-\ell\right)\right]^{N}\times\left[\int_{0}^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\varphi\right]^{N}\times\prod_{i}\int_{0}^{\pi}\mathrm{d}\vartheta_{i}\sin\vartheta_{i}e^{\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\cos\vartheta_{i}}\\

&amp; \underset{{\scriptscriptstyle x=\cos\vartheta}}{=} &amp; \left(\frac{1}{4\pi}\right)^{N}\left(2\pi\right)^{N}\left[\int_{-1}^{1}\mathrm{d}xe^{\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}x}\right]^{N}\\

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2^{N}}\left[\frac{2k_{B}T}{f\ell}\sinh\left(\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\right)\right]^{N}\\

&amp; = &amp; \left[\frac{k_{B}T}{f\ell}\sinh\left(\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\right)\right]^{N}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The Gibbs free energy (Gibbs because the external force is fixed)
is then &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G_{N}\left(\mathbf{f}\right)=-k_{B}T\ln Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{f}\right)=-k_{B}TN\ln\left[\sinh\left(\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\right)\right]+k_{B}TN\ln\left(\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}\right),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the average extension&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle R\right\rangle _{f} &amp; = &amp; -\frac{\partial G_{N}\left(f\right)}{\partial f}

&amp; = &amp; -k_{B}TN\coth\left(\overset{{\scriptstyle \equiv\alpha}}{\overbrace{\frac{f\ell}{k_{B}T}}}\right)\frac{\ell}{k_{B}T}+k_{B}TN\frac{1}{f}

&amp; = &amp; N\ell\left[\coth\alpha-\frac{1}{\alpha}\right]\equiv N\ell\mathcal{L}\left(\alpha\right)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The ''Langevin function''  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(\alpha\right)=\coth\alpha-\frac{1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
is also typical of spin magnetization in external magnetic fields
and of dipoles in electric fields at finite temperatures.

===Polymers and Fractal Curves===
====Introduction to fractals====
&lt;big&gt;Book:&lt;/big&gt; B. Mandelbrot.

A fractal is an object with ''fractal''  ''dimensionality'' ,
called also the ''Hausdorff dimension'' . This implies a new definition
of dimensionality, which we will discuss.
Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. It is considered three-dimensional
because it has &lt;math&gt;V=\frac{4\pi}{3}R^{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M=\rho V\sim R^{D}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;D=3&lt;/math&gt;. A plane has by the same reasoning &lt;math&gt;M\sim R^{D}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;D=2&lt;/math&gt;,
and is therefore a &lt;math&gt;2D&lt;/math&gt; object. Fractals are mathematical objects
such that by the same sort of calculation they will have &lt;math&gt;M\sim R^{D_{f}}&lt;/math&gt;,
for a &lt;math&gt;D_{f}&lt;/math&gt; which is not necessarily an integer number (this definition
is due to Hausdorff). One example is the Koch curve (see (7)): in
each of its iterations, we decrease the length of a segment by a factor
of 3 and decrease its mass by a factor of 4. We will therefore have &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
M_{2} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{4}M_{1}=A\left(r_{2}\right)^{D_{f}}=A\left(\frac{1}{3}r_{1}\right)^{D_{f}},\\

M_{1} &amp; = &amp; A\left(r_{1}\right)^{D_{f}}.\\

 &amp; \Downarrow\\

\frac{1}{4} &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{D_{f}}\Rightarrow D_{f}=\frac{\ln4}{\ln3}\simeq1.26\mbox{ and }1&lt;D_{f}&lt;2.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that a fractal's &quot;real&quot; length is infinite, and its approximations
will depend on the resolution. The structure exhibits ''self-similarity:'' 
namely, on different length scales it will look the same. This can
be seen in the Koch snowflake: at any magnification, a part of the
curve looks similar to the whole curve. There's a very nice animation
of this in Wikipedia.
The total length of the curve depends on the the ruler used to measure
it: the actual length at iteration &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L_{0}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
Another definition for the fractal dimension is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
D_{f}=\frac{\ln\frac{L_{0}}{\ell_{0}}}{\ln\frac{\ell_{1}}{\ell_{0}}}=\frac{\ln4}{\ln3}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Linking fractals to polymers====

{{Sidenote|The Flory exponent is defined from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R\sim N^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \nu=\frac{1}{D_{f}}&lt;/math&gt;.}}
Consider the ideal Gaussian chain again. It has &lt;math&gt;R_{0}^{2}=N\ell^{2}\sim N&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the mass, we have an object with a fractal
dimension of 2 no matter what the dimensionality of the actual space
is. We can say that a polymer in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-space fills only &lt;math&gt;D_{f}\le d&lt;/math&gt;
dimensions of the space it occupies, where &lt;math&gt;D_{f}&lt;/math&gt; is 2 for an ideal
polymer Gaussian and &lt;math&gt;2\le D_{f}\le d&lt;/math&gt; in general. Flory
has shown that in some cases a non-ideal polymer can also have &lt;math&gt;D_{f}&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;,
in particular when a self-avoiding walk (SAW) is accounted for. The
SAW as opposed to the Gaussian walk (GW) is the defining property
of a physical rather than ideal polymer, and gives a fractal dimension
of &lt;math&gt;D_{f}\approx1.66&lt;/math&gt;. A collapsed polymer has &lt;math&gt;D_{f}=3&lt;/math&gt; and fills
space completely. Note that two polymers with fractal dimensions &lt;math&gt;D_{f}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;D_{f}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; do not &quot;feel&quot; each other statistically if &lt;math&gt;D_{f}+D_{f}^{*}&lt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Polymers, Path Integrals and Green's Functions===

&lt;big&gt;Books:&lt;/big&gt; Doi &amp; Edwards, F. Wiegel, or Feynman &amp; Hibbs.

====Local Gaussian chain model and the continuum limit====

This model is also known as LGC. We start from an FJC in 3D where
&lt;math&gt;\Psi=\prod_{i}\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi\ell^{2}}\delta\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}-\ell\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
By the central limit theorem &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\sum_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
will always be taken from a Gaussian distribution when the number
of monomers is large (whatever the form of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, as long as it
is symmetrical around zero such that &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)=\left(\frac{3}{2\pi N\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{3R^{2}}{2N\ell^{2}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the LGC approximation we exchange the rigid rods for Gaussian
springs with '''&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}''' _{i}\right\rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}_{i}^{2}\right\rangle =\ell^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, by
setting &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=\left(\frac{3}{2\pi\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{3R^{2}}{2\ell^{2}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can then obtain for the full probability distribution&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\Psi\left(\left\{ \mathbf{r}_{i}\right\} \right) &amp; = &amp; \prod_{i}\psi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)

 &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{3}{2\pi\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3N}{2}}\exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{3\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{i-1}\right)^{2}}{2\ell^{2}}\right),\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{i}=\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; describes
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; harmonic springs with &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{3k_{B}T}{\ell^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; connected
in series:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
U_{0}\left(\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{i}\right\} \right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}k_{B}T\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{i-1}\right)^{2},

\Psi &amp; \sim &amp; e^{-\frac{U_{0}}{k_{B}T}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
An exact property of the Gaussian distributions we have been using
is that a sub chain of &lt;math&gt;m-n&lt;/math&gt; monomers (such as the sub chain starting
at index &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and ending at &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) will also have a a Gaussian distribution
of the end-to-end length:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
P\left(\mathbf{R}_{m}-\mathbf{R}_{n},m-n\right) &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{3}{2\pi\left|n-m\right|\ell^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\exp\left(-\frac{3R^{2}}{2\left|n-m\right|\ell^{2}}\right),

\left\langle \left(\mathbf{R}_{m}-\mathbf{R}_{n}\right)^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \ell^{2}\left|n-m\right|.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At the continuum limit, we will get ''Wiener distributions'' : the
correct way to calculate the limit is to take &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\ell\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;N\ell=L&lt;/math&gt; remaining constant. The length
along the chain up to site &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is then described by &lt;math&gt;n\ell\rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;0\le s\le L&lt;/math&gt;. At this limit we can also substitute derivatives &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial s}=\frac{1}{\ell}\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial n}&lt;/math&gt;
for the finite differences &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{i-1}}{\ell}&lt;/math&gt;,
such that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{\ell^{2}}\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{i-1}\right)^{2} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \int_{0}^{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\ell}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial s}\right)^{2}=\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}n\frac{1}{\ell^{2}}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}

\Psi\left(\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{i}\right\} \right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mbox{const.}\times\exp\left\{ -\frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}n\right\} .\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


If we add an external spatial potential &lt;math&gt;U\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
(which is single-body), its contribution to the free energy will amount
in a factor of&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\sum_{i=1}^{N}U\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)\right\} \rightarrow\exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\int_{0}^{N}U\left(\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\right)\mathrm{d}n\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
to the Boltzmann factor.

====Functional path integrals and the continuum distribution function====
&lt;big&gt;Books:&lt;/big&gt; F. Wiegel, Doi &amp; Edwards.

Consider what happens when we hold the ends of a chain defined by
&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{i}\right\} &lt;/math&gt; in place, such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{0}=\mathbf{R}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{N}=\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;. We can calculate the probability
of this configuration from &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R}_{0},\mathbf{R}_{N}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N-1}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{i}\Psi\left(\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{i}\right\} \right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At the continuum limit the definition of the chain configurations
translates into a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the product
of integrals can be taken as a path integral according to &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i=1}^{N-1}\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{i}\rightarrow\int\mathcal{D}\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
The probability for each configuration with our constraint is a functional
of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The partition function is:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)=\int_{\mathbf{R}_{0}=\mathbf{R}^{\prime}}^{\mathbf{R}_{N}=\mathbf{R}}\mathcal{D}\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\exp\left\{ -\frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}n-\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\int_{0}^{N}U\left(\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\right)\mathrm{d}n\right\} ,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we can normalize it to obtain a probability distribution function,
given in terms of this path integral:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{N}\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)=\frac{Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)}{\int Z_{N}\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}^{\prime}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We now introduce the Green's function &lt;math&gt;G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right),&lt;/math&gt;which
as we will soon see describes the evolution from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;
to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; steps. We define it as:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G\left(\mathbf{R}_{N}=\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}_{0}=\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)\equiv\frac{\int_{\mathbf{R}_{0}=\mathbf{R}^{\prime}}^{\mathbf{R}_{N}=\mathbf{R}}\mathcal{D}\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\exp\left\{ -\frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}n-\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\int_{0}^{N}U\left(\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\right)\mathrm{d}n\right\} }{\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R^{\prime}}\int_{\mathbf{R}_{0}=\mathbf{R}^{\prime}}^{\mathbf{R}_{N}=\mathbf{R}}\mathcal{D}\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\exp\left\{ -\frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}n\right\} }.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that while the nominator is proportional to the probability &lt;math&gt;P_{N}&lt;/math&gt;,
the denominator does ''not''  include include the external potential.

&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has several important properties:
  
#It is equal to the exact probability &lt;math&gt;P_{N}&lt;/math&gt; for Gaussian chains in the absence of external potential. 
#If we consider that the chain might be divided into one sub chain between step &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and a second sub chain from step &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to step &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime}G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime};N-i\right)G\left(\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};i\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can use this property to compute expectations values of observables. If we have some function of a specific monomer &lt;math&gt;A\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, for instance:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle A\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)\right\rangle =\frac{\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{N}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{0}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{i}G\left(\mathbf{R}_{N},\mathbf{R}_{i};N-i\right)A\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}\right)G\left(\mathbf{R}_{i},\mathbf{R}_{0};i\right)}{\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{N}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}_{0}G\left(\mathbf{R}_{N},\mathbf{R}_{0};N\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 
#The Green's function is the solution of the differential equation (see proof in Doi &amp; Edwards and in homework):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial G}{\partial N}-\frac{\ell^{2}}{6}\frac{\partial^{2}G}{\partial\mathbf{R}^{2}}+\frac{U\left(\mathbf{R}\right)}{k_{B}T}G=\delta\left(\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)\delta\left(N\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 
#The Green's function is defined as 0 for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and is equal to &lt;math&gt;\delta\left(\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; in order to satisfy the boundary conditions.

====Relationship to quantum mechanics====

This equation for &lt;math&gt;N&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\neq\mathbf{R}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is
very similar in form to the Schrödinger equation. To see this, we
can rewrite it as:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial N}-\overset{{\scriptstyle \equiv\mathcal{L}}}{\overbrace{\frac{\ell^{2}}{6}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\mathbf{R}^{2}}+\frac{U\left(\mathbf{R}\right)}{k_{B}T}}}\right]G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial N}-\mathcal{L}\right]G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If we make the replacement &lt;math&gt;N\rightarrow\frac{it}{\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\ell^{2}}{6}\rightarrow\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; this is identical
to &lt;math&gt;-i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}G=\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}\triangledown^{2}}{2m}+V\left(\mathbf{R}\right)\right]G=\mathcal{H}G&lt;/math&gt;.
Like the quantum Hamiltonian the Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;
has eigenfunctions such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\varphi_{k}=E_{k}\varphi_{k}&lt;/math&gt;,
which according to Sturm-Liouville theory span the solution space
(&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}\varphi_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right)\varphi_{k}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\delta\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\right)&lt;/math&gt;)
and can be orthonormalized (&lt;math&gt;\int\varphi_{k}^{*}\varphi_{m}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}=\delta_{km}&lt;/math&gt;).

The solution of the non-homogeneous problem is therefore&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=\sum_{k}\varphi_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{R}\right)\varphi_{k}\left(\mathbf{R}^{\prime}\right)e^{-NE_{k}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the homogeneous equation
&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathcal{L}-E_{n}\right)\varphi_{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;big&gt;Example&lt;/big&gt;
A polymer chain in a box of dimensions &lt;math&gt;L_{x}\times L_{y}\times L_{z}&lt;/math&gt;:
The potential &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; within the box and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the edges.
The boundary conditions are &lt;math&gt;G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; are on the boundary. The
function is also separable in Cartesian coordinates:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G\left(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R}^{\prime};N\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{3}g_{i}\left(R_{i},R_{i}^{\prime};N\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Let's solve for &lt;math&gt;g_{1}\equiv g_{x}&lt;/math&gt; (the other &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; functions are
similar):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial N}-\frac{\ell^{2}}{6}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial R_{1}^{2}}\right)u\left(R_{1},N\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If we separate variables again with the ansatz &lt;math&gt;u\left(R_{1},N\right)=\varphi\left(R_{1}\right)e^{-EN}&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
-E\varphi-\frac{\ell^{2}}{6}\varphi^{\prime\prime} &amp; = &amp; 0,\\

&amp; \Downarrow\\

\varphi\left(R_{1}\right) &amp; = &amp; A\sin k_{1}R_{1}+B\cos k_{1}R_{1}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
With the boundary condition&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\varphi\left(0\right)=0 &amp; \Rightarrow B=0,\\
\varphi\left(L_{x}\right)=0 &amp; \Rightarrow k_{1}=\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives an expression for the energy and eigenfunctions:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
E_{n} &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{\ell^{2}\pi^{2}}{6L_{x}}\right)n^{2}=E_{1}n^{2},

\varphi_{n}\left(R_{1}\right) &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{L_{x}}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}R_{1}\right),

u_{n}\left(R_{1}\right) &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\frac{2}{L_{x}}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}R_{1}\right)e^{-E_{n}N}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The Green's function can finally be written as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g_{1}\left(R_{1},R_{1}^{\prime};N\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{L_{x}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}R_{1}\right)\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}R_{1}^{\prime}\right)e^{-NE_{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since with the Cartesian symmetry of the box the partition function &lt;math&gt;Z=\prod_{i=1}^{3}Z_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is also separable and using &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int_{0}^{L_{x}}\sin\frac{n\pi}{L_{x}}x\mathrm{d}x=\begin{cases}
\frac{2L_{x}}{n\pi} &amp; n=2,\,4,\,6,\,...\,\mbox{(even),} \\

0 &amp; n\in1,\,3,\,5,\,...\,\mbox{(odd)}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we can calculate&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Z_{x} &amp; = &amp; \int\mathrm{d}x\int dx^{\prime}g_{1}\left(x,x^{\prime};N\right)

&amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{L_{x}}\sum_{n=1,\,3,\,5...}\left(\frac{2L_{x}}{n\pi}\right)^{2}\exp\left(-N\frac{\ell^{2}\pi^{2}n^{2}}{6L_{x}^{2}}\right)

&amp; = &amp; \frac{8L_{x}}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n=1,\,3,\,5...}\frac{1}{n^{2}}e^{-n^{2}E_{1}N}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can now go on to calculate &lt;math&gt;F=-k_{B}T\ln Z_{x}Z_{y}Z_{z}&lt;/math&gt;, and
we can for instance calculate the pressure on the box edges in the
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{x}=-\frac{1}{L_{y}L_{z}}\frac{\partial F}{\partial L_{x}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Two limiting cases can be done analytically: first, if the box is much larger than the polymer, &lt;math&gt;L_{i}\gg\sqrt{N}\ell&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcr}
\frac{1}{n^{2}}\exp\left\{ -\frac{\pi^{2}\ell^{2}N}{L_{x}^{2}}n^{2}\right\}  &amp; \approx &amp; \frac{1}{n^{2}},\\

\sum_{n=1,\,3,\,5...}\frac{1}{n^{2}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\pi^{2}}{8},\\

 &amp; \Downarrow &amp;\\

P_{x} &amp; = &amp; -\frac{1}{L_{y}L_{z}}\frac{\partial}{\partial L_{x}}\left(-k_{B}T\ln Z_{x}Z_{y}Z_{z}\right)\\

 &amp; = &amp; -\frac{k_{B}T}{L_{y}L_{z}}\frac{1}{Z_{x}}\frac{\partial Z_{x}}{\partial L_{x}}\\

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{Z_{x}Z_{y}Z_{z}}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is equivalent to a dilute gas of polymers (done here for a single
chain). At the opposite limit, &lt;math&gt;L_{i}\ll\sqrt{N}\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the polymer
should be &quot;squeezed&quot;. The Gaussian approximation will be no
good if we squeeze too hard, but at least for some intermediate regime
we can neglect all but the first term in the series:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcr}
Z_{x} &amp; = &amp; \frac{8L_{x}}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n=1,\,3,\,5...}\frac{1}{n^{2}}e^{-\frac{\pi^{2}\ell^{2}n^{2}}{6L_{x}^{2}}N}\\

&amp; \approx &amp; \frac{8L_{x}}{\pi^{2}}e^{-\frac{\pi^{2}\ell^{2}}{6L_{x}^{2}}N},\\

P_{x} &amp; = &amp; -\frac{k_{B}T}{L_{y}L_{z}}\frac{\partial\ln Z_{x}}{\partial L_{x}}\\

&amp; \approx &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{V}\left\{ \frac{1}{L_{x}}+\frac{\pi^{2}\ell^{2}N}{3L_{x}^{3}}\right\}\\ 

&amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{V}\left\{ 1+\frac{\pi^{2}\ell^{2}N}{3L_{x}^{2}}\right\} .\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
There is a large extra pressure caused by the &quot;squeezing&quot; of
the chain and the corresponding loss of its entropy.

The same formalism can be used to treat polymers near a wall or in
a well near a wall, for instance (see the homework for details). In
the well case, like in the similar quantum problem, we will have bound
states for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; (where the critical temperature is defined by
a critical value of &lt;math&gt;\beta_{c}V_{0}=\frac{V_{0}}{k_{B}T_{c}}&lt;/math&gt;, and
describes the condition for the potential well to be &quot;deep&quot;
enough to contain a bound state).

====Dominant ground state====

Note that since &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\varphi_{n}\left(x\right)\varphi_{n}^{*}\left(x^{\prime}\right)e^{-NE_{n}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is positive and the &lt;math&gt;E_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are real and ordered (assuming
no degeneracy, &lt;math&gt;E_{0}&lt;E_{1}&lt;E_{2}&lt;...&lt;/math&gt;), at large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; we can neglect
all but the leading terms (smallest energies) and&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
G\approx\varphi_{0}\left(x\right)\varphi_{0}^{*}\left(x^{\prime}\right)e^{-NE_{0}}+\varphi_{1}\left(x\right)\varphi_{1}^{*}\left(x^{\prime}\right)e^{-NE_{1}}+....&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is possible because the exponent is decreasing rather than oscillating,
as it is in the quantum mechanics case. Taking only the first term
in this series is called the ''dominant ground state approximation'' .


===Polymers in Good Solutions and Self-Avoiding Walks===


====Virial expansion====

So far, in treating Gaussian chains, we have neglected any long-ranged
interactions. However, polymers in solution cannot self-intersect,
and this introduces interactions &lt;math&gt;V\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
into the picture which are local in real-space, but are long ranged
in terms of the contour spacing - that is, they are not limited to
&lt;math&gt;i\approx j&lt;/math&gt;. The importance of this effect depends on dimensionality:
it is easy to imagine that intersections in 2D are more effective
in restricting a polymer's shape than intersections in 3D.

The interaction potential &lt;math&gt;V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; can in general
have both attractive and repulsive parts, and depends on the detailed
properties of the solvent. If we consider it to be due to a long ranged
attractive Van der-Waals interaction and a short ranged repulsive
hard-core interaction, it might be modeled by a &lt;math&gt;6-12&lt;/math&gt; Lennard-Jones
potential. To treat interaction perturbatively within statistical
mechanics, we can use a virial expansion (this is a statistical-mechanical
expansion in powers of the density, useful for systematic perturbative
corrections to non-interacting calculations when one wants to include
many-body interactions). The second virial coefficient is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
v_{2}=\int\mathrm{d}^{3}r\left[1-e^{-\frac{V\left(r\right)}{k_{B}T}}\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To make the calculation easy, consider a potential even simpler than
the 6-12 Lennard-Jones:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\begin{cases}
\infty &amp; r&lt;\sigma,\\

-\varepsilon &amp; \sigma&lt;r&lt;2\sigma,\\

0 &amp; r&gt;2\sigma.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
v_{2} &amp; = &amp; \overset{{\scriptstyle =\frac{4\pi}{3}\sigma^{3}\equiv V_{0}}}{\overbrace{\int_{r&lt;\sigma}\mathrm{d}^{3}r\left[1-e^{-\frac{V\left(r\right)}{k_{B}T}}\right]}}+\overset{{\scriptstyle =\frac{4\pi}{3}\left[\left(2\sigma\right)^{3}-\sigma^{3}\right]\left(1-e^{\beta\varepsilon}\right)}}{\overbrace{\int_{\sigma&lt;r&lt;2\sigma}\mathrm{d}^{3}r\left[1-e^{-\frac{V\left(r\right)}{k_{B}T}}\right]}}

&amp; = &amp; 8V_{0}-7V_{0}e^{\beta\varepsilon}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This can be positive (signifying net repulsion between the particles)
at &lt;math&gt;k_{B}T&gt;\frac{\varepsilon}{\ln\frac{8}{7}}&lt;/math&gt; or negative (signifying
attraction) for &lt;math&gt;k_{B}T&lt;\frac{\varepsilon}{\ln\frac{8}{7}}&lt;/math&gt;. While
the details of this calculation depend on our choice and parametrization
of the potential, in general we will have some special temperature
known as the &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; temperature (in our case &lt;math&gt;k_{B}\vartheta=\frac{\varepsilon}{\ln\frac{8}{7}}&lt;/math&gt;)
where &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
v_{2}\left(\vartheta\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This allows us to define a good solvent: such a solvent must have
&lt;math&gt;T&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; at our working temperature. This assures us (within
the second Virial approximation, at least) that the interactions are
repulsive and (as can be shown separately) the chain is ''swollen'' .
A bad solvent for which &lt;math&gt;T&lt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; will have attractive interactions,
resulting in ''collapse'' . A solvent for which &lt;math&gt;T=\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; is
called a &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; solvent, and returns us to a Gaussian chain
unless the next Virial coefficient is taken.

====Lattice model====
A common numerical treatment for this kind of system is to draw the
polymer on a grid and make Monte-Carlo runs, where steps must be self-avoiding
and their probability is taken from a thermal distribution while maintaining
detailed balance. This gives in 3D &lt;math&gt;R_{N}\simeq\ell N^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;\nu\approx0.588&lt;/math&gt;.
====Renormalization group====
A connection between SAWs and critical phenomena was made by de Gennes
in the 1970's. Some of the similarities are summarized in the table
below. Using renormalization group methods, de Gennes showed by analogy
to a certain spin model that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\nu\left(\varepsilon\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{16}\varepsilon+\frac{15}{512}\varepsilon^{2}+\vartheta\left(\varepsilon^{3}\right),

\varepsilon &amp; \equiv &amp; 4-d.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives in 3D a result very close to the SAW: &lt;math&gt;\nu_{RG}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{16}+\frac{15}{512}+\vartheta\left(\varepsilon^{3}\right)=0.5625+\vartheta\left(\varepsilon^{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Flory model====
This is a very crude model which gives surprisingly good results.
We write the free energy as &lt;math&gt;F_{tot}\left(R\right)=F_{int}+F_{ent}&lt;/math&gt;.
For the entropic part we take the expression for an ideal chain: &lt;math&gt;S_{N}\left(R\right)=-\frac{d}{2}k_{B}\frac{R^{2}}{N\ell^{2}}+S_{N}\left(0\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;F_{ent}=-TS_{N}&lt;/math&gt;. For the interaction, we use the second virial
coefficient:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{F_{int}\left(R\right)}{k_{B}T} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\nu_{2}\int\left[c\left(r\right)\right]^{2}\mathrm{d}^{3}r.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;c\left(r\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a local density such that its average value
is &lt;math&gt;\left\langle c\right\rangle =\frac{N}{V}\sim\frac{N}{R^{d}}&lt;/math&gt;.
If we neglect local fluctuations in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\int\left[c\left(r\right)\right]^{2}\mathrm{d}^{3}r &amp; = &amp; V\left\langle c^{2}\left(r\right)\right\rangle \approx V\left\langle c\left(r\right)\right\rangle ^{2}=R^{2}\left(\frac{N}{R^{d}}\right)^{2},

\frac{F_{int}}{k_{B}T} &amp; \approx &amp; \frac{1}{2}v_{2}N^{2}R^{-d}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The total free energy is then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{F_{tot}}{k_{B}T}\approx\frac{d}{2}\frac{R^{2}}{N\ell^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}v^{2}N^{2}R^{-d}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The free parameter here is &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, but we do not know how it relates
to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. For constant &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the minimum is at &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{F}=\left(\frac{v_{2}}{2}\ell^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{d+2}}N^{\frac{3}{d+2}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which gives the Flory exponent&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\nu_{F}=\frac{3}{d+2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This exponent is exact for 1, 2 and 4 dimensions, and gives a very
good approximation (0.6) for 3 dimensions, but it misses completely
for more than 4 dimensions. For a numerical example consider a polymer
of &lt;math&gt;\sim10^{5}&lt;/math&gt; monomers each of which is about &lt;math&gt;5\AA&lt;/math&gt; in length.
From the expressions above,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R=\begin{cases}
1600\AA &amp; \mbox{GW,}\\

5000\AA &amp; \mbox{Flory,}\\

4400\AA &amp; \mbox{SAW.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This difference is large enough to be experimentally detectable by
the scattering techniques to be explained next.

The reason the Flory method provides such good results turns out to
be a matter of lucky cancellation between two mistakes, both of which
are by orders of magnitude: the entropy is overestimated and the correlations
are underestimated. This is discussed in detail in all the books.

====Field Theory of SAW====
&lt;big&gt;Books:&lt;/big&gt; Doi &amp; Edwards, Wiegel

The seminal article of S.F. Edwards in 1965 was the first application
of field-theoretic methods to the physics of polymers. To insert interactions
into the Wiener distribution, we take sum over the two-body interactions
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}V\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
to the continuum limit &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}n\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}mV\left(\mathbf{R}\left(m\right)-\mathbf{R}\left(n\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

This formalism is rather complicated and not much can be done by hand.
One possible simplification is to consider an excluded-volume (or
self-exclusion) interaction of Dirac delta function form, which prevents
two monomers from occupying the same point in space:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
V\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)=k_{B}Tv_{2}\delta\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The advantage of this is that a simple form is obtained in which only
the second virial coefficient &lt;math&gt;v_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is taken into account. The
expression for the distribution is then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi\left(\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{n}\right\} \right)\sim\exp\left\{ -\frac{3}{2\ell^{2}}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}n\left(\frac{\partial R\left(n\right)}{\partial n}\right)^{2}-\frac{v_{2}}{2}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{dn}\int_{0}^{N}\mathrm{d}m\delta\left(\mathbf{R}_{m}-\mathbf{R}_{n}\right)\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
With expressions of this sort, one can apply standard field-theory/many-body
methods to evaluate the Green's function and calculate observables.
This is more advanced and we will not be going into it.

===Scattering and Polymer Solutions===
====The form factor====
Materials can be probed by scattering experiments, and for dilute
polymer solutions this is one way to learn about the polymers within
them. Laser scattering requires relatively little equipment and can
be done in any lab, while x-ray scattering (SAXS) requires a synchrotron
and neutron scattering (SANS) requires a nuclear reactor. We will
discuss structural properties on the scale of chains rather than individual
monomers, which means relatively small wavenumbers. It will also soon
be clear that small angles are of interest.
{{Sidenote|Modeling the monomers as points is reasonable when considering probing on the scale of the complete
chain.}}
If we assume that the individual monomers act as point scatterers (see (8)) and consider a process which scatters the incoming wave
at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}_{f}&lt;/math&gt;, we can define a scattering
angle &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; and a scattering wave vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{k}_{f}-\mathbf{k}_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
(which becomes smaller in magnitude as the angle &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; becomes
smaller). We then measure scattered waves at some outgoing angle for
some incoming angle as illustrated in (9), where in fact many chain
scatterers are involved we should have an ensemble average over the
chain configurations (which should be incoherent since the chains
are far apart compared with the typical decoherence length scale).
All this is discussed in more detail below.
{{Sidenote|For this kind of experiment to work with lasers or x-rays, there must
be a ''contrast'' : the polymer and solvent must have different
indices of refraction. X-Ray experiments rely on different electronic
densities. In neutron scattering experiments, contrast is achieved
artificially by labeling the polymers or solvent - that is, replacing
hydrogen with deuterium.}}

Within a chain scattering is mostly coherent such that that the scattered
wavefunction is &lt;math&gt;\Psi=\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The intensity or power should be proportional to &lt;math&gt;I=\left|\Psi\right|^{2}=\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}a_{i}a_{j}^{*}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;).
If we specialize to homogeneous chains where &lt;math&gt;a_{i}=a&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
I=\left|a\right|^{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This expression is suitable for a single static chain in a specific
configuration &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \mathbf{R}_{i}\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. For an ensemble
of chains in solution, we average over all chain configurations incoherently,
defining the ''structure factor''  &lt;math&gt;S\left(k\right)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle I\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \left\langle \Psi^{2}\right\rangle ,

S\left(k\right) &amp; \equiv &amp; \frac{\left\langle \left|\Psi\left(k\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle }{\left\langle \left|\Psi\left(0\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle }.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The normalization is with respect to the unscattered wave at &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left|\Psi\left(0\right)\right|^{2}=a^{2}N^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in an
isotropic system like the system of chain molecules in a solvent,
the structure factor must depend only on the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting the expression for &lt;math&gt;\Psi^{2}&lt;/math&gt; into the above equation gives
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
S\left(k\right)=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\left\langle \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)}\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We now switch to spherical coordinates with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; parallel
to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; with the added notation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{ij}=\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since in these coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{ij}=kR_{ij}\cos\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;,
we can write &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{ij}}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\varphi\int_{0}^{\pi}\mathrm{d}\vartheta\sin\vartheta e^{ikR_{ij}\cos\vartheta}

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}\mathrm{d}xe^{ikR_{ij}x}

&amp; = &amp; \frac{\sin\left(kR_{ij}\right)}{kR_{ij}},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
S\left(k\right)=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left\langle \frac{\sin\left(kR_{ij}\right)}{kR_{ij}}\right\rangle _{\mathrm{configurations}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====The gyration radius and small angle scattering====

For small &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (which at least in the elastic case implies small &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;),
we can expand the above expression for &lt;math&gt;S\left(k\right)&lt;/math&gt; in powers
of &lt;math&gt;kR_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S\left(k\right) &amp; \simeq &amp; \frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left\langle 1-\left(\frac{kR_{ij}}{3!}\right)^{2}\right\rangle 

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{N^{2}}N^{2}-\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{N^{2}}\left|\mathbf{k}\right|^{2}\sum_{ij}\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{ij}^{2}\right\rangle 

&amp; = &amp; 1-\frac{1}{3}k^{2}R_{g}^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The last equality is due to the fact &lt;math&gt;R_{g}^{2}=\frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left\langle \mathbf{R}_{ij}^{2}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
If the scattering is elastic, &lt;math&gt;\left|\mathbf{k}_{i}\right|=\left|\mathbf{k}_{f}\right|=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
k=\left|\mathbf{k}_{i}-\mathbf{k}_{f}\right|=\sqrt{\mathbf{k}_{i}^{2}+\mathbf{k}_{f}^{2}-2\mathbf{k}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{k}_{f}}=\left|\mathbf{k}_{i}\right|\sqrt{1+1-2\cos\vartheta}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\cdot2\sin\frac{\vartheta}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
With this expression for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the angle &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;,
the structure factor is then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S\left(k\right) &amp; \simeq &amp; 1-\frac{1}{3}k^{2}R_{g}^{2}.

 &amp; = &amp; 1-\frac{16\pi^{2}}{3}\frac{\sin^{2}\frac{\vartheta}{2}}{\lambda^{2}}R_{g}^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
From an experimental point of view, we can plot &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as a function
of &lt;math&gt;k^{2}\sim\sin^{2}\frac{\vartheta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and determine the polymer's
gyration radius &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt; from the slope.

The approximation we have made is good when &lt;math&gt;kR_{g}\sim\frac{\sin\frac{\vartheta}{2}}{\lambda}R_{g}\ll1&lt;/math&gt;,
and this determines the range of angles that should be taken into
account: we must have &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\vartheta}{2}\sim\frac{\vartheta}{2}\lesssim\frac{\lambda}{R_{g}}&lt;/math&gt;.
For laser scattering usually &lt;math&gt;\lambda\sim500\mathrm{nm}&lt;/math&gt; (about enough
to measure &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt;) while for neutron scattering &lt;math&gt;\lambda\sim0.3\mathrm{nm}&lt;/math&gt;
(meaning we must take only very small angles into account to measure
&lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt;, but also allowing for more detailed information about correlations
within the chain to be collected).
====Debye scattering function====
Around 1947, Debye gave an exact result (the ''Debye function'' )
for Gaussian chains:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\left(\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}\right)}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; e^{-\frac{\ell^{2}k^{2}}{6}\left|i-j\right|},

S_{D}\left(k\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{\left(k^{2}R_{g}^{2}\right)^{2}}\left(k^{2}R_{g}^{2}-1+e^{-\overset{=x}{\overbrace{k^{2}R_{g}^{2}}}}\right),\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
S_{D}\left(x\right)=\frac{2}{x^{2}}\left(x-1+e^{-x}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
At the limit where &lt;math&gt;x\ll1&lt;/math&gt; we can expand &lt;math&gt;S\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; around
&lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; limit we have encountered earlier.
For &lt;math&gt;x\gg1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S\left(x\right)=\frac{2}{x^{2}}\left(x-1+e^{-x}\right)\simeq\frac{2}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Sidenote|Another way to observe GW behavior is to use a &lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;-solvent.}}
This also works very well for non-Gaussian chains in non-dilute solutions,
where a small percentage of the chains is replaced by isotopic variants.
This gives an effectively dilute solution of isotopic chains, which
can be distinguished from the rest, and these chains are effectively
Gaussian for reasons which we will mention later. An example from Rubinstein is neutron scattering from PMMA as done
by R. Kirste et al (1975), which fits very nicely to the Debye function
for &lt;math&gt;R_{g}\approx130\AA&lt;/math&gt;. In general, however, a SAW in a dilute
solution modifies the tail of the Debye function, since &lt;math&gt;\rho\left(k\right)\sim k^{-D_{f}}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;D_{f}=\frac{5}{3}&lt;/math&gt; for a SAW.

====The structure factor and monomer correlations====

Consider the full distribution function of the distances &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_{ij}=\mathbf{R}_{i}-\mathbf{R}_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.
This is related to the correlation function for monomer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g_{i}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left\langle \delta\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}_{ij}\right)\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This function is evaluated by fixing a certain monomer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and counting
which other monomers are at a distance &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; from it, averaging
over all chain configurations. If we now average over all monomers
&lt;math&gt;1\le i\le N&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\left\langle g_{i}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right\rangle =\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left\langle \delta\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}_{ij}\right)\right\rangle .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Fourier transforming it,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\, g\left(\mathbf{r}\right)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{ij}\left\langle e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{R}_{ij}}\right\rangle =S\left(k\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The fact that the structure function is the Fourier transform of the
scatterer density correlation function is, of course, not unique to
the case of polymers.
At large &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown (homework) that if &lt;math&gt;S\left(k\right)\sim k^{-D_{f}}&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;g\left(r\right)\sim\frac{1}{r^{d-D_{f}}}&lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore
determine the fractal dimension of the chain from the large &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; tail
of the structure factor (see table).

===Polymer Solutions===


====Dilute and semi-dilute solutions====

Up to this point, we have considered only independent chains in dilute
solutions. We have also discussed the quality of solvents and the
&lt;math&gt;\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; temperature. Now, we consider multiple chains in a good
solvent (good because we do not want them in a collapsed state).
The concentrations of monomers &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the number of monomers
(for all chains) per unit volume. A solution is dilute if the typical
distance between chains is more that &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt; and semi-dilute if it
is more that &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt;. Between these limits, the concentration passes through a crossover value &lt;math&gt;c^{*}&lt;/math&gt; where the inter-chain distance is equal to the typical chain size &lt;math&gt;R_{g}&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Sidenote|A ''concentrated''  solution is defined by &lt;math&gt;c&gt;c^{**}&lt;/math&gt;. If the solvent is removed completely, one obtains a ''melt'' , composed of polymerchains in a liquid state (a viscoelastic material). We will not be
discussing these cases further - see Rubinstein for details.}}
We can calculate &lt;math&gt;c^{*}&lt;/math&gt; by calculating the concentration of monomers within a single chain and equating it to the average monomer concentration:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
c^{*}\sim\frac{N}{R_{g}^{d}}=\frac{N^{1-d\nu}}{\ell^{d}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For instance, in a 3D SAW &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;c^{*}=N^{-0.8}\ell^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;. We can also work in terms of volume fraction
&lt;math&gt;\phi=\ell^{3}c&lt;/math&gt;. This turns out to be very small (for &lt;math&gt;N=10^{6}&lt;/math&gt;
it is about 0.001 and for &lt;math&gt;N=10^3&lt;/math&gt; it is about 0.4%).

====Free energy of mixing====
If we have a mixture of two components - &lt;math&gt;N_{A}&lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;N_{B}&lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; on a lattice model with cell length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;N_{A}+N_{B}=N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of cells - we can define
the relative volumes &lt;math&gt;\phi\equiv\phi_{A}=\frac{N_{A}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{B}=1-\phi&lt;/math&gt;. The free energy of mixing (in the simple isotropic
case) is then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F_{\mathrm{mix}}=U_{\mathrm{mix}}-TS_{\mathrm{mix}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


From a combinatorical argument and with the help of the Stirling series,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
S_{\mathrm{mix}}=k_{B}\ln\frac{\left(N_{A}+N_{B}\right)!}{N_{A}!N_{B}!}\simeq-N_{A}\ln\overset{{\scriptstyle =\phi}}{\overbrace{\frac{N_{A}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}}}-N_{B}\overset{{\scriptstyle =1-\phi}}{\overbrace{\frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The average entropy of mixing per cell is therefore&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{S_{\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{B}\left(N_{A}+N_{B}\right)}=-\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{B}}=\phi\ln\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


We now consider interactions &lt;math&gt;U_{AA}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_{BB}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{AB}&lt;/math&gt; between
nearest neighbors of the two species. The specific form of the interaction
depends on the coordination number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, or the number of nearest
neighbors per grid point: for instance, on a square 2D grid &lt;math&gt;z=4&lt;/math&gt;.
The mixing interaction energy can be written as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U\mathrm{_{mix}=N_{AB}U_{AB}+N_{AA}U_{AA}+N_{BB}U_{BB}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;N_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; count the number of boundaries of the different
types within the system. In the ''mean field approximation'' , we
can evaluate them by neglecting local variations in density:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
N_{AB} &amp; = &amp; N_{A}z\frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}=z\left(N_{A}+N_{B}\right)\phi\left(1-\phi\right),

N_{BB} &amp; = &amp; \frac{z}{2}\left(N_{A}+N_{B}\right)\left(1-\phi\right)^{2},

N_{AA} &amp; = &amp; \frac{z}{2}\left(N_{A}+N_{B}\right)\phi^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The interaction energy per-particle due to mixing is then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
u_{\mathrm{mix}}=\frac{U_{\mathrm{mix}}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}=z\phi\left(1-\phi\right)U_{AB}+\frac{z}{2}\left(1-\phi\right)^{2}U_{BB}+\frac{z}{2}\phi^{2}U_{AA},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we will subtract from it the enthalpy of the &quot;pure&quot; system,
where the components are unmixed:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{U_{0}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}=\left(1-\phi\right)\frac{z}{2}U_{BB}+\phi\frac{z}{2}U_{AA}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The difference between these two quantities it the change in enthalpy
per unit cell due to mixing:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\Delta u_{\mathrm{mix}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{U_{\mathrm{mix}}-U_{0}}{N_{A}+N_{B}}=\overset{{\scriptstyle \equiv k_{B}T\chi}}{\overbrace{z\left(U_{AB}-\frac{1}{2}U_{AA}-\frac{1}{2}U_{BB}\right)}}\phi\left(1-\phi\right)=k_{B}T\chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right),\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\chi=\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\left[U_{AB}-\frac{U_{AA}-U_{BB}}{2}\right]z.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


The sign of the ''Flory parameter''  &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; determines whether
the minimum of the energy will be at the center or edges of the parabola
in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\Delta f_{\mathrm{mix}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\Delta F_{\mathrm{mix}}}{N_{A}+N_{b}}=\Delta u_{\mathrm{mix}}-T\sigma_{\mathrm{mix}},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta f_{\mathrm{mix}}=k_{B}T\chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right)+k_{B}T\phi\ln\phi+k_{B}T\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is the MFT approximation for the free energy of mixing.
{{Sidenote|If the two components have different volumes, then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\phi_{A} &amp; = &amp; \frac{v_{A}N_{A}}{v_{A}N_{A}+v_{B}N_{B}},\\

\phi_{B} &amp; = &amp; 1-\phi_{A}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Otherwise, the treatment is very similar (see homework).}}


====The Flory-Huggins model for polymer solutions====
This is based on work mostly done by Huggins around 1942. The basic
idea is to consider a lattice like the one shown in (11), with chains
(inhabiting &lt;math&gt;N=5&lt;/math&gt; blocks in the example) in a solvent (which can
also be a set of chains, but in the example the number of blocks per
solvent unit is &lt;math&gt;S=1&lt;/math&gt;).
The enthalpy of mixing &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathrm{mix}}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately independent
of the change from the molecule-solvent system to this polymer-solvent
system, at least within the MFT approximation. We can therefore set
&lt;math&gt;\phi=\frac{N_{P}}{N_{P}+N_{S}}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;N_{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of monomers
and &lt;math&gt;N_{S}&lt;/math&gt; the number of solvent units; &lt;math&gt;\frac{N_{p}}{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the
number of chains) and use the previous expressions for &lt;math&gt;\Delta u_{\mathrm{mix}}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;. The fact we have chains rather than individual monomers
is of crucial importance when we calculate the entropy, though: chains
have more constraints and therefore a lower entropy than isolated
monomers. We will make an approximation (correct to first order in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for
&lt;math&gt;N\gg1&lt;/math&gt;) based on the assumption that the chains are solid objects
and can only be transformed, rather than also rotated and conformed
around their center of mass.
{{Sidenote|This is treated in detail in the books by Flory and by Doi &amp; Edwards.}}
This gives, making the Stirling approximation
as before,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
S_{\mathrm{mix}} &amp; \simeq &amp; k_{B}\frac{\left(N_{P}+N_{S}\right)!}{N_{S}!\left(\frac{N_{P}}{N}\right)!},\\

-\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{B}} &amp; \simeq &amp; \frac{\phi}{N}\ln\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right)+\alpha\phi,\\

\alpha &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{N}\ln\left(\frac{N_{S}+N_{P}}{N}\right)-\ln\left(N_{S}+N_{P}\right)+1-\frac{1}{N}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If we neglect the term linear in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which we will later show is of no importance, these two expressions lead to the Flory-Huggins free energy of mixing:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f\left(\phi,T\right)=\frac{\Delta f_{\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{B}T}=\chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right)+\frac{\phi}{N}\ln\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Compared to our previous expression, we see that the only difference is in the division of the second term by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Sidenote|This formula is for &lt;math&gt;S=1&lt;/math&gt;, but it is easy to show (homework) that
for a ''blend''  of two polymers with &lt;math&gt;N_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we
will still have &lt;math&gt;\phi=\phi_{A}=1-\phi_{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{lcl}
\scriptstyle f\left(\phi,T\right)&amp;\scriptstyle = \scriptstyle &amp;\frac{\Delta f_{\mathrm{mix}}}{k_{B}T}\\
&amp;\scriptstyle =&amp;\scriptstyle \chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right)\\
&amp;&amp;\scriptstyle+\frac{\phi}{N_{1}}\ln\phi+\frac{\left(1-\phi\right)}{N_{2}}\ln\left(1-\phi\right).\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, if the molecular volumes are different we can define &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \phi_{A}=\frac{N_{A}V_{A}}{N_{A}V_{A}+N_{B}V_{B}}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \phi_{B}=\frac{N_{B}V_{B}}{N_{A}V_{A}+N_{B}V_{B}}&lt;/math&gt;, then continue
to use the same expression.}}

====Polymer/solvent phase transfers====

A system composed of a polymer immersed in a solvent can be in a uniform
phase (corresponding to a good solvent) or separated into two distinct
phases (a bad solvent). Qualitatively, this depends on &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;: the
entropic contribution to the free energy from &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathrm{mix}}&lt;/math&gt;
will always prefer mixing, but the preference of &lt;math&gt;\Delta u_{\mathrm{mix}}&lt;/math&gt;
depends on the the sign of &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;. Phase transfers can only possibly
exist if &lt;math&gt;\chi&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, because otherwise the total change in energy due
to mixing is always negative.
When discussing Helmholtz free energy, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the degree of freedom
- however, in the physical case of interest it constant and we must
perform a Legendre transformation, or in other words introduce a Lagrange
multiplier to impose the constraint that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. We therefore
define&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g=f-\mu\phi,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and after &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is minimized &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; will be determined so as to maintain
our constraint (it turns out that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between
the chemical potentials of the polymer and solvent). When &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has
multiple minima (&lt;math&gt;\frac{dg}{d\phi}=\frac{df}{d\phi}-\mu=0&lt;/math&gt; for more
than one &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), a phase transfer can exist.

If &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has only one minimum at &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then we must have &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}\left(\phi\right)=\mu&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has two minima, a first order phase transfer will exist when
the free energy &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; at these two minima is the same. This amount
to a ''common tangent construction''  condition for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (see 12):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
f\left(\phi_{1}\right)-\mu\phi_{1}=f\left(\phi_{2}\right)-\mu\phi_{2},\\

f^{\prime}\left(\phi_{1}\right)=f^{\prime}\left(\phi_{2}\right)=\mu.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This requires &lt;math&gt;f\left(\phi_{1}\right)-f\left(\phi_{2}\right)=\mu\left(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
The two formulations (in terms of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;) are of course identical.
The common tangent actually describes the free energy &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a mixed
phase system (having a volume &lt;math&gt;v_{1}&lt;/math&gt; at concentration &lt;math&gt;\phi_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
and a volume &lt;math&gt;v_{2}&lt;/math&gt; at concentration &lt;math&gt;\phi_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\frac{v_{1}\phi_{1}}{v_{1}\phi_{1}+v_{2}\phi_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;).
When &lt;math&gt;\phi_{1}&lt;\phi&lt;\phi_{2}&lt;/math&gt; this line is always lower than the
concave profile of the uniform system with concentration &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
and therefore the mixed-phase system must be the stable state.

Note that any additional term to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; which is linear in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; will
only produce a shift in &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and not qualitatively change the phase
diagram. This is because &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
f &amp; \rightarrow &amp; f+\alpha\phi\\

&amp; \Downarrow\\

g &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \left(f+\alpha\phi\right)-\mu\phi=f-\left(\mu-\alpha\right)\phi.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Returning to the Flory-Huggins mixing energy, for &lt;math&gt;\chi&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can
see that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has two minima and the system can therefore be in two
phases. For &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; only one minimum exist, and therefore only one
phase. Generalizing beyond the Flory-Huggins model, at any temperature
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;\chi\left(T\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and often a dependence
&lt;math&gt;\chi\left(T\right)=A-\frac{B}{T}&lt;/math&gt; works well experimentally (we
have found a dependence &lt;math&gt;\sim\frac{1}{T}&lt;/math&gt; assuming that the interactions
are independent of temperature). For every &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, we can
find &lt;math&gt;\phi_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{2}&lt;/math&gt; from the procedure above where two
phases exist. This produces a phase diagram similar to (13), where
the &lt;math&gt;\phi\left(T\right)&lt;/math&gt; curve is known as the ''binodal''  or
''demixing curve'' .
The phase diagram (13) includes a few more details: one is the critical point &lt;math&gt;\left(T_{c},\phi_{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left(\chi_{c},\phi_{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, beyond which two solution can no longer exist. Another is the ''spinodal curve'', existing within the demixing curve at &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}=0&lt;/math&gt;, marks the point of transition between metastability and instability (within the spinodal curve, phase spearation occurs spontaneously, while between the spinodal and binodal curves it requires some initial nucleation). The spinodal curve is usually quite close to the binodal curve, and since it can be found analytically provides a useful estimate:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
f\left(\phi\right) &amp; = &amp; \chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right)+\frac{\phi}{N}\ln\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right),\\

 &amp; \Downarrow\\

f^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi\right) &amp; = &amp; -2\chi+\frac{1}{N}\frac{1}{\phi}+\frac{1}{1-\phi},\\

 &amp; \Downarrow &amp; {\scriptstyle f^{\prime\prime}\left(\phi\right)=0}\\

2\chi_{s} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{1-\phi}+\frac{1}{N}\frac{1}{\phi}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The endpoint of the spinodal curve is also the endpoint of the binodal
curve; also, this endpoint is the same for the &lt;math&gt;\chi\left(\phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;T\left(\phi\right)&lt;/math&gt; curves. We can find it from&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
0 &amp; = &amp; \left.\frac{\partial\chi_{s}}{\partial\phi}\right|_{c}=\frac{1}{2}\left[-\frac{1}{N}\frac{1}{\phi_{c}^{2}}+\frac{1}{\left(1-\phi_{c}\right)^{2}}\right],\\

&amp; \Downarrow\\

\phi_{c} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{N}}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Inserting this into the equation for &lt;math&gt;\chi_{s}&lt;/math&gt; gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\chi_{c}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


There is a great deal to expand on here. Chapter 4 in Rubinstein is
a good place to start.

==Surfaces, Interfaces and Membranes==

===Introduction and Motivation===
We will differentiate between several types of surfaces:
  
*An outer ''surface''  (or boundary) between a liquid phase and a solid boundary or surface. This surface needs not be in thermal equilibrium and exists under external constraints. 
*An ''interface''  between two phases in equilibrium with each other, like the A/B liquid mixture that was studied earlier. 
*''Membranes''  have a molecular thickness and are in equilibrium with surrounding water. 
We will talk now separately about flat interfaces first, and then
extend the discussion to curved and fluctuating interfaces.

===Flat Surfaces===
====Ginzburg-Landau formalism====
The simplest kind of non-homogeneous system one can imagine may be
described by the variation in some order parameter or concentration
as a function of a single spatial direction, &lt;math&gt;\phi\left(z\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if we have a gas at &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and a liquid
at &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, there will be some crossover regime between
them. This kind of physics can be treated with a Ginzburg-Landau formalism,
which can be derived from the continuum limit of a lattice gas/Ising
model.

If every cell &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (with size &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;) is parametrized by a discrete
spin variable $S_{i}$ such that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
S_{i}=1 &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; \mbox{cell }i\mbox{ contains molecule }A, \\

S_{i}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; \mbox{cell }i\mbox{ contains molecule }B,\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we may write the Hamiltonian as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{H}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}J_{ij}S_{i}\left(1-S_{j}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The &lt;math&gt;\left\{ J_{ij}\right\} &lt;/math&gt; are the interaction constants between
cells. Note that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
J_{ij}S_{i}\left(1-S_{j}\right)+J_{ji}S_{j}\left(1-S_{i}\right)=\begin{cases}
0 &amp; S_{i}=S_{j},

J_{ij} &amp; \left({\scriptstyle S_{i}=1}\wedge{\scriptstyle S_{j}=0}\right)\vee\left({\scriptstyle S_{i}=0}\wedge{\scriptstyle S_{j}=1}\right).\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The partition function is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
Z=\mbox{Tr}_{\left\{ S_{i}\right\} }e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;F=-k_{B}T\ln Z&lt;/math&gt;.
We can formulate now a mean-field theory (by neglecting correlations
such as: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle S_{i}S_{j}\right\rangle \approx\left\langle S_{i}\right\rangle \left\langle S_{j}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;)
for this model in cases of spatial inhomogeneities (presence of walls
and interfaces). The full development is left as an exercise: the
result assumes a local thermal equilibrium &lt;math&gt;\phi_{i}=\left\langle S_{i}\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
and gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
F_{0} &amp; = &amp; \left\langle F_{0}\right\rangle 

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\left\langle S_{i}\right\rangle \left(1-\left\langle S_{j}\right\rangle \right)+k_{B}T\sum_{i}\left[\phi_{i}\ln\phi_{i}+\left(1-\phi_{i}\right)\ln\left(1-\phi_{i}\right)\right].\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Separating this $F_{0}$ into internal energy and entropy,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\phi_{i}\left(1-\phi_{j}\right),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-TS=k_{B}T\sum_{i}\left[\phi_{i}\ln\phi_{i}+\left(1-\phi_{i}\right)\ln\left(1-\phi_{i}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the continuum limit &lt;math&gt;\phi_{i}\rightarrow\phi\left(z\right)&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}\rightarrow\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\ell^{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and
neglecting long-term interactions, we can perform a Taylor expansion:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{i}-\phi_{j}=\phi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)-\phi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}+\boldsymbol{\ell}\right)\simeq-\boldsymbol{\ell}\cdot\left.\triangledown\phi\right|_{\mathbf{r}_{i}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
J_{ij}\phi_{i}\left(1-\phi_{j}\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}J_{ij}\left[\left(\phi_{i}-\phi_{j}\right)^{2}-\phi_{i}^{2}-\phi_{j}^{2}+2\phi_{i}\right]

\sum_{i\neq j}J_{ij}\phi_{i}\left(1-\phi_{j}\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \frac{1}{4}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\ell^{3}}zJ\left(-\phi^{2}-\phi^{2}+2\phi\right)+\frac{1}{4}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\ell^{3}}\sum_{ij}J_{ij}\left(\boldsymbol{\ell}_{j}\cdot\triangledown\phi\right)^{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
$z$ is the coordination number.&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\ell^{3}}\left[zJ\phi\left(1-\phi\right)\right]+\frac{1}{4}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\ell^{3}}J\ell^{2}\left(\triangledown\phi\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Adding the continuum limit entropy,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
F &amp; = &amp; \int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\left[f_{0}\left(\phi\right)+\frac{1}{2}B\left(\triangledown\phi\right)^{2}\right],

f_{0} &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{\ell^{3}}\left[\chi\phi\left(1-\phi\right)+\phi\ln\phi+\left(1-\phi\right)\ln\left(1-\phi\right)\right],

B &amp; \equiv &amp; \frac{J}{2\ell},

\frac{1}{2}zJ &amp; \equiv &amp; k_{B}T\chi.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can find the profile &lt;math&gt;\phi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; at equilibrium
by minimizing the free energy functional &lt;math&gt;F\left[\phi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
with respect to &lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; and taking external constraints
into account. Normally, &lt;math&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the minimum of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous
other than surfaces and interfaces. If &lt;math&gt;\phi\left(-\infty\right)=\phi\left(+\infty\right)=\phi_{A}&lt;/math&gt;,
the minimal solution &lt;math&gt;\phi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant
and we will have a single homogeneous phase. On the other hand, if&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\phi\left(-\infty\right)=\phi_{A},

\phi\left(+\infty\right)=\phi_{B},\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we are in the two-phase region in (&lt;math&gt;\chi,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\phi)&lt;/math&gt; then a 1D
profile must exist that solves the Euler-Lagrange equation, and becomes
approximately homogeneous far from the center of the interface.


====1D profile at an interface====

Quite independently of the previous treatment and the microscopic
model, the free energy can be written as a functional of an order
parameter and its gradients:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\left\{ f_{0}\left(\phi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right)+\frac{B}{2}\left[\triangledown\phi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right]^{2}\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\left(\triangledown\phi\right)^{2}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the system
avoids strong local fluctuations and smooth states have smaller energies.
A uniform state is therefore preferred, and if the system is not allowed
to become fully uniform then regions of different phases form in equilibrium
with each other. This is shown in (16), and can also be described
by a tangent construction of the type illustrated in (12). 
In the two phase example above, due to the symmetry of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(\phi\longleftrightarrow1-\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the critical point is clearly
at &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c}=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We will make a Taylor expansion of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;
around $\phi_{c}$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi=\phi_{c}+\psi=\frac{1}{2}+\psi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Due to the same symmetry in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, an expansion of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;
should contain only even powers. Performing this expansion gives the
result&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
f_{0} &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{\ell^{3}}\left[2\psi^{2}+\frac{4\psi^{4}}{3}-\ln2+\chi\left(\frac{1}{4}-\psi^{2}\right)\right]+B\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{\ell^{3}}\left[\left(2-\chi\right)\psi^{2}+\frac{4}{3}\psi^{4}\right]+\mbox{const.}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In general the &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt; will be replaced by some positive numerical
factor &lt;math&gt;\frac{\gamma}{4}&lt;/math&gt;. To obtain the correct critical behavior
(note that &lt;math&gt;\chi_{c}=\chi\left(T_{c}\right)=2&lt;/math&gt;) we assume a linear
dependence of the form &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\alpha}{2}\left(T_{c}-T\right)=2-\chi&lt;/math&gt;,
and minimize&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
F &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{\ell^{3}}\int\left[-\frac{\alpha}{2}\left(T-T_{c}\right)\psi^{2}+\frac{\gamma}{4}\psi^{4}\right]\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}+\frac{B}{2}\int\left(\triangledown\psi\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The above expansion of the inhomogeneous free energy is called the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model or expansion. By applying a variational
principle on this free energy, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)} &amp; = &amp; 0,

 &amp; \Downarrow

\frac{\partial F}{\partial\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)}-\triangledown\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\left(\triangledown\psi\right)} &amp; = &amp; 0.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
06/09/2009
Here &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\triangledown\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\left(\triangledown\psi\right)} &amp; = &amp; \sum_{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial r_{i}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial\triangledown_{i}\psi},

\triangledown_{i}\psi &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial r_{i}}\psi.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In particular, &lt;math&gt;\frac{B}{2}\triangledown\cdot\frac{\partial}{\partial\left(\triangledown\psi\right)}\left(\triangledown\psi\right)^{2}=B\triangledown\cdot\triangledown\psi=B\triangledown^{2}\psi&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta f_{0}}{\delta\psi}=-\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)\psi+\gamma\psi^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.
The EL equation is therefore&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)\psi+\gamma\psi^{3}-B\triangledown^{2}\psi=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is the well-known Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation.
For &lt;math&gt;T&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt; the only homogeneous (bulk) solution (arrived at by
neglecting the Laplacian term) is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)\psi+\gamma\psi^{3}=0\Rightarrow\psi=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the other case when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, the system has two homogeneous
solutions&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi=\pm\sqrt{\frac{\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)}{\gamma}}\equiv\pm\psi_{b}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If we do not neglect the derivative but assume a 1D profile with &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(\pm\infty\right)=\pm\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;
and $\psi^{\prime}\left(\pm\infty\right)=0$, we must solve the equation&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B\psi^{\prime\prime}\left(z\right)+\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)\psi\left(z\right)-\gamma\psi^{3}\left(z\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The exact solution of the GL model is &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi\left(z\right)=\psi_{b}\tanh\left(\frac{z}{\xi}\right),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\xi^{-2}=\frac{\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)}{\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We have introduced the correlation length &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, which is typical
of the width of the meniscus (the layer in which the phases are mixed).
As a matter of fact, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is also the correlation length by the
definition &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \psi\left(a\right)\psi\left(r+a\right)\right\rangle \sim\exp(-r/\xi)&lt;/math&gt;.
The dependence &lt;math&gt;\xi\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the
mean field result with an exponent &lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In general,
&lt;math&gt;\xi\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{-\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. We also have for the order
parameter dependence &lt;math&gt;\psi\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; where
we have obtained in MFT &lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.


====Surface energy and surface tension====

''Surface energy''  is the excess of energy in the system with respect
to the bulk. ''Surface tension''  &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the surface
energy per unit area. Therefore, in our case of two phases separated
by a meniscus, $\sigma$ can be calculated using&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma\cdot\mbox{Area}=\Delta F=F\left[\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right]-\left[\frac{1}{2}Vf_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)+\frac{1}{2}Vf_{0}\left(-\psi_{b}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, we have subtracted the bulk energy of the separate surfaces
from the energy of the full system including the interface. Note that
in equilibrium, by definition &lt;math&gt;f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)=f_{0}\left(-\psi_{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
With the 1D dependence we are treating, then, &lt;math&gt;\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\psi\left(z\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sigma &amp; = &amp; \overset{{\scriptstyle =1}}{\overbrace{\frac{1}{\mbox{Area}}\int\mathrm{d}x\int\mathrm{d}y}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}z\left[\frac{B}{2}[\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)]^{2}+f_{0}\left(\psi\left(z\right)\right)-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)\right]

 &amp; = &amp; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}z\left[\frac{B}{2}[\psi'\left(z\right)]^{2}+f_{0}\left(\psi\right)-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)\right].\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is not an extensive quantity like &lt;math&gt;F\left[\psi\right]&lt;/math&gt;, a single
number in the size of the system: it is rather a geometry independent
parameter with units of energy per unit area.

The first term above is reminiscent of kinetic energy and the second
of potential energy. An analogy to the classical mechanics of a point
particle exists, as detailed in the following table.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering{}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline 
&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (time)\tabularnewline
\hline
\hline 
&lt;math&gt;\psi\left(t\right)&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;x\left(t\right)&lt;/math&gt; (distance)\tabularnewline
\hline 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{B}{2}\left(\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m}\dot{x}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; (kinetic energy)\tabularnewline
\hline 
&lt;math&gt;f_{0}\left(\psi\right)&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;-V\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; (potential energy)\tabularnewline
\hline 
&lt;math&gt;f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;-E&lt;/math&gt; (total energy)\tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
With this analogy in mind, we can derive an expression similar to
energy conservation in mechanics. From applying the variational principle
to $f_{0}$ we obtain&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\psi}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi^{\prime}}\left[\frac{B}{2}\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}\right]=B\psi^{\prime\prime}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Multiplying this by $\psi^{\prime}$ gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\psi^{\prime}\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\psi}=B\psi^{\prime}\psi^{\prime\prime}=\frac{B}{2}\frac{d}{dz}\left[\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Integrating over $z$ from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\overset{{\scriptstyle =\int_{-\infty}^{z}\frac{df_{0}}{dz}\mathrm{d}z}}{\overbrace{\int_{-\infty}^{z}\frac{df_{0}}{d\psi}\frac{d\psi}{dz}\mathrm{d}z}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{B}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{z}\frac{d}{dz}\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}z=\left.\frac{B}{2}\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}\right|_{-\infty}^{z}

 &amp; \Downarrow

f_{0}\left(\psi\right)-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{B}{2}\left\{ \left[\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)\right]^{2}-\overset{=0}{\overbrace{\left(\psi^{\prime}\left(-\infty\right)\right)^{2}}}\right\} 

 &amp; \Downarrow\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f_{0}\left(\psi\right)-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)=\frac{1}{2}B\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The last term disappears due to to the boundary condition at &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow-\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\psi\rightarrow\psi_{b}=\mathrm{const.}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\psi^{\prime}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The analogy between this equation and the law of conservation of mechanical
energy can be stressed by writing it as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{{\scriptstyle kin.\, En.}}{\overbrace{\frac{1}{2}B\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}}}\overset{{\scriptstyle Pot.\, En.}}{\overbrace{-f_{0}\left(\psi\right)}}=\overset{{\scriptstyle Tot.\, En.}}{\overbrace{-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Returning to the surface tension, we can use this conservation law
to rewrite it in the simpler form &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sigma &amp; = &amp; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{B}{2}\left(\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)\right)^{2}+\overset{{\scriptstyle =\frac{B}{2}\left(\psi^{\prime}\right)^{2}}}{\overbrace{f_{0}\left(\psi\right)-f_{0}\left(\psi_{b}\right)}}\right]\mathrm{d}z=B\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}z.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
An estimate may be obtained from&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma\simeq B\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\psi^{\prime}\left(z\right)\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}z\simeq B\left(\frac{\psi_{b}}{\xi}\right)^{2}\xi,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma\simeq B\psi_{b}^{2}\xi^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The exact expression for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; may be obtained from the exact
GL form that we have derived for &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. In any case, the temperature
dependence of $\sigma$ is of the form &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma\approx B\overset{{\scriptstyle \xi^{-1}}}{\overbrace{\sqrt{\frac{T_{c}-T}{2B}}}}\overset{{\scriptstyle \psi_{b}^{2}}}{\overbrace{\frac{\alpha\left(T_{c}-T\right)}{\gamma}}}\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If we insert the general exponential dependencies of &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_{b}&lt;/math&gt;
into the equation, we will see that the exponent for surface energy
as function of &lt;math&gt;(T_{c}-T)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2\beta+\nu&lt;/math&gt;.
This discussion can be extended to systems which do not have symmetry
between &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1-\phi&lt;/math&gt;, such as a liquid/gas system with two
densities &lt;math&gt;n_{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_{g}&lt;/math&gt;. Without proof, we will state that
within the GL formalism it can be shown that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
f_{0}\left(n\right)-\frac{1}{2}\left[f_{0}\left(n_{g}\right)+f_{0}\left(n_{\ell}\right)\right]=c\left(n-n_{g}\right)^{2}\left(n-n_{\ell}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The surface energy will be&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta F=\int\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\left[\frac{1}{2}B\left(\triangledown n\right)^{2}+f_{0}\left(n\right)-\frac{1}{2}f_{0}\left(n_{g}\right)-\frac{1}{2}f_{0}\left(n_{\ell}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For a profile in the $z$ direction,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma=\frac{\Delta F}{\mbox{Area}}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}z\left[\frac{B}{2}\left(n^{\prime}\right)^{2}+c[n\left(z\right)-n_{g}]^{2}[n\left(z\right)-n_{\ell}]^{2}\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
After variation, one obtains for the two coexisting phases with $n_{\ell}&gt;n&gt;n_{g}$&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\ln\frac{n_{\ell}-n}{n-n_{g}} &amp; = &amp; -\frac{z}{\xi},

\xi &amp; = &amp; \left(n_{\ell}-n_{g}\right)\sqrt{\frac{2c}{B}},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;n_{\ell}-n_{g}\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi\sim\left(T_{c}-T\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
The density profile interpolates smoothly between the two phases:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
n\left(z\right)=\frac{n_{\ell}}{1+e^{-\frac{z}{\xi}}}+\frac{n_{g}}{1+e^{+\frac{z}{\xi}}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


A few generalizations:
  
*Surfactants or surface active materials: this includes soap, detergent, biological membranes composed of biological amphiphiles called phospholipids and more. What they have in common is that they are formed of molecules with charged or polarized {}&quot;heads&quot; connected to long hydrocarbon {}&quot;tails&quot;. These molecules are called ''amphiphyllic'' , since the tails are ''hydrophobic''  and the heads ''hydrophillic'' . This causes them to accumulate on interfaces between water and air, and reduce surface tension (by a factor $\sim2-3$):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\sigma\left(\mbox{with soap}\right)=\sigma_{\mathrm{air/water}}-\Delta\sigma(\phi_{s}),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi_{s}&lt;/math&gt;is the surface concentration of the soap molecules. 
*Emulsions: drops of oil in water (or water in oil), stabilized by some sort of emulsifier (which is also a surfactant). Some common examples are milk and mayonnaise.
{{Sidenote|There is a French biochemist by the name of Herve This who specializes in molecular gastronomy, who has some very interesting popular lectures which are worth looking up. He authored several books (one is called &quot;molecular gastronomy&quot;), and appeared on several TV shows. In his presentations he explains how food preparations depends crucially on physical chemical processes on the molecular level. This includes preparation of mousse, whipped cream, sauces, thickeners and emulsifiers.}}
*Detergency of soap: while soap reduces surface tension between oil and water, it does not create a phase where oil and water are mixed on a molecular level. Rather, micrometric oil droplets are formed in the aqueous solution. The process of cleaning is the process where oily dirt is solubilized in the aqueous solution and is washed away from the object we clean.

===Curved Surfaces===
====Review of differential geometry====
\begin{description}

[{Books:}] The book by Safran has a short introduction which will
be followed here. The one by Visconti is more thorough and oriented
towards other physics problems such as relativity . There also exists
a multi-authored book on the subject edited by David Nelson, and a
mathematical book on the theory of manifolds by Spivak.
\end{description}
In order to discuss surfaces and curves which exhibit local curvature,
we will need to introduce a few mathematical concepts. A brief introduction
follows.
\paragraph{Curves}
A ''parametric curve''  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\left(u\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a set of
vectors along some contour in space, expressed as a function of the
parameter &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, which may vary, for example, from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to the length
&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the curve. The differential length element &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}s&lt;/math&gt;
along the curve can be expressed by&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{d}s &amp; = &amp; \left|\mathbf{R}\left(u+\mathrm{d}u\right)-\mathbf{R}\left(u\right)\right|\simeq\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial u}\right|\mathrm{d}u,

&amp; \Downarrow

\mathrm{d}s &amp; = &amp; \left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial u}\right|\mathrm{d}u,

\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}u} &amp; = &amp; \left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial u}\right|.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
A tangent vector $\hat{\mathbf{t}}$ can be found from&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{t}}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}s}=\frac{\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}u}}{\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}u}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that from the magnitude of this expression, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{t}}&lt;/math&gt;
is always a unit vector. It is tangent to the curve because it is
proportional to &lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{R}\left(u+\mathrm{d}u\right)-\mathbf{R}\left(u\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

With these definitions, we can define ''curvature''  as one extra
derivative:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{t}}}{\mathrm{d}s}=\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathbf{R}}{\mathrm{d}s^{2}}\equiv\kappa\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{c}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is a unique vector perpendicular
to &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{t}}&lt;/math&gt; (this is easy to show by taking &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\hat{\mathbf{t}}^{2}=2\hat{\mathbf{t}}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{t}}}{\mathrm{d}s}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{ds}}\left(1\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;),
and we can also write&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{\kappa}=\left|\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{t}}}{\mathrm{d}s}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is also useful to define the local ''radius of curvature''  &lt;math&gt;R=\kappa^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Some intuition can be gained from an analogy with the kinetics of
point particles moving without a friction on a curve in space, if
&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The tangent and curvature vectors
can then be related to the velocity and acceleration, respectively.


\paragraph{Surfaces}

Similarly to curves, ''a parametric surface &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r'' =\mathbf{R}\left(u,v\right)&lt;/math&gt;}
in space can be defined as a function of two parameters. There are
three scalar functions contained in this explicit definition:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
x=f\left(u,v\right),

y=g\left(u,v\right),

z=h\left(u,v\right).\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that it is also possible to represent surfaces implicitly as&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F\left(x,y,z\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where other than its zeros &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary.

Any explicit definition requires some particular choice of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and
$v$. For instance, one choice (called the Monge representation) is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
x=f\left(u,v\right)=u,

y=g\left(u,v\right)=v,

z=h\left(u,v\right)=h\left(x,y\right).\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In vector notation,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r}=\left(x,y,h\left(x,y\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This works only if there is a single &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; value for each choice of
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and is very convenient for surfaces which are almost
flat. Another common choice useful for nearly spherical surfaces is
the spherical representation, where &lt;math&gt;u=\vartheta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.
In spherical coordinates, this is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{r}=\left(r,\vartheta,\varphi\right)=\left(R\left(\vartheta,\varphi\right),\vartheta,\varphi\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


We can define two tangent vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{u}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{v}&lt;/math&gt;
at every point on the surface, such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{u}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{v}=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The unit vector normal to the surface is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{u}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{v}}{\left|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{u}\times\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{v}\right|}&lt;/math&gt;.
It is easy to find the unit vector from the implicit representation,
and one can usually find an implicit representation: for instance,
starting from Monge &lt;math&gt;F=z-h\left(x,y\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. On the surface, &lt;math&gt;F=0&lt;/math&gt;
implies&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{d}F &amp; = &amp; F\left(\mathbf{r}\right)+F\left(\mathbf{r}+\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\right)

&amp; = &amp; -\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\triangledown F=0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The vector &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; can be any vector tangent to the
surface, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\triangledown F&lt;/math&gt; must be proportional to
the normal vector:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\frac{\triangledown F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



\paragraph{Metric of a curved surface}

A surface has been defined as an ensemble of points &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \mathbf{r}\left(u,v\right)\right\} &lt;/math&gt;
embedded in 3-dimensional space. In order to measure length along
such a surface, we must integrate along a differential length element
within it:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial u}\mathrm{d}u+\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\mathrm{d}v\equiv\mathbf{r}_{u}\mathrm{d}u+\mathbf{r}_{v}\mathrm{d}v,

\mathrm{d}s &amp; = &amp; \left|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\right|,

\mathrm{d}s^{2} &amp; = &amp; \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}=\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\mathrm{d}u+\mathbf{r}_{v}\mathrm{d}v\right)\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\mathrm{d}u+\mathbf{r}_{v}\mathrm{d}v\right)

 &amp; = &amp; \overset{E}{\overbrace{\mathbf{r}_{u}^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{d}u\right)^{2}+2\overset{F}{\overbrace{\mathbf{r}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}}}\mathrm{d}u\mathrm{d}v+\overset{G}{\overbrace{\mathbf{r}_{v}^{2}}}\left(\mathrm{d}v\right)^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The metric is defined as &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g\equiv EG-F^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is positive definite since&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
g=EG-F^{2}=\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{u}\right)\left(\mathbf{r}_{v}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)-\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)^{2}=\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\times\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)^{2}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The surface element can be expressed in terms of the metric:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\left|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{u}\times\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}_{v}\right|=\left|\mathbf{r}_{u}\times\mathbf{r}_{v}\right|\mathrm{d}u\mathrm{d}v=\sqrt{g}\mathrm{d}u\mathrm{d}v.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We illustrate this in the Monge representation as an example. Here,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{r}_{u} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{r}_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x,y,h\left(x,y\right)\right)

 &amp; = &amp; \left(1,0,h_{x}\right),

\mathbf{r}_{v} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{r}_{y}=\left(0,1,h_{y}\right).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The surface element is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\sqrt{g}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with the metric&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
g &amp; = &amp; \left(\mathbf{r}_{u}\times\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)^{2}=\left|\begin{matrix}{ccc}
\mathbf{\hat{x}} &amp; \mathbf{\hat{y}} &amp; \mathbf{\hat{z}}

1 &amp; 0 &amp; h_{x}

0 &amp; 1 &amp; h_{y}\end{matrix}\right|,\\
\sqrt{g} &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The length element is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{d}s^{2} &amp; = &amp; r_{x}^{2}\mathrm{d}x^{2}+2\mathbf{r}_{x}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{y}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y+r_{y}^{2}\mathrm{d}y^{2},

\mathrm{d}s &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\left(1+h_{x}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\left(1+h_{y}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}y^{2}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and therefore we have in the Monge representation&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}s=\sqrt{\left(1+h_{x}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\left(1+h_{y}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}y^{2}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the implicit representation, one can begin the same process by
writing the surface element in terms of the volume element:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\delta^{\left(3\right)}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{s}\left(x,y,z\right)\right)\mathrm{d}^{3}r,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
using the 3D Dirac delta function &lt;math&gt;\delta^{\left(3\right)}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
A general property of the Dirac delta is that &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\delta\left(f\left(x\right)-a\right)=\frac{\delta\left(x-f^{-1}\left(a\right)\right)}{\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{x=f^{-1}\left(a\right)}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse function such that &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right)=a\Rightarrow f^{-1}\left(a\right)=x&lt;/math&gt;.
In terms of the function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that the surface is defined by
$F=0$, we can use this property to write&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\delta^{\left(3\right)}\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_{s}\left(F\right)\right)=\delta\left(F\right)\left|\triangledown F\right|,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\delta\left(F\right)\left|\triangledown F\right|\mathrm{d}^{3}r.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Returning to the implicit version of the Monge representation,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\triangledown F &amp; = &amp; \left(-h_{x},-h_{y},1\right),

\left|\triangledown F\right| &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}A=\delta\left(z-h\left(x,y\right)\right)\mathrm{d}z\sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



\paragraph{Curvature of surfaces}

So far we have discussed first order differential expressions and
the area element. This has to do with properties like surface energy
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}f=\sigma\mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;. Curvature is a second order property,
useful in discussing deformations and fluctuations.
Consider a curve &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\left(s\right)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;s&lt;L&lt;/math&gt; on a surface
parametrized by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. On the curve, &lt;math&gt;u=u\left(s\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;v=v\left(s\right)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector normal
to the surface, the local curvature (of the curve) is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathbf{r}\left(s\right)}{\mathrm{d}s^{2}}\cdot\hat{n}=\mathbf{r}^{\prime\prime}\left(s\right)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first derivative is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}s}=\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial u}\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}s}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v}\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}s}=\mathbf{r}_{u}u^{\prime}+\mathbf{r}_{v}v^{\prime},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the second derivative&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}s^{2}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\left(\mathbf{r}_{u}u^{\prime}+\mathbf{r}_{v}v^{\prime}\right)

&amp; = &amp; \mathbf{r}_{uu}\left(u^{\prime}\right)^{2}+\mathbf{r}_{vv}\left(v^{\prime}\right)^{2}+2\mathbf{r}_{uv}u^{\prime}v^{\prime}+\mathbf{r}_{u}u^{\prime\prime}+\mathbf{r}_{v}v^{\prime\prime}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{u}&lt;/math&gt; and
$\mathbf{r}_{v}$, we are left with&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=L\left(u^{\prime}\right)^{2}+N\left(v^{\prime}\right)^{2}+2Mu^{\prime}v^{\prime},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
L &amp; = &amp; \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{uu},

N &amp; = &amp; \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{vv},

M &amp; = &amp; \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{uv}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}
\begin{shaded}
(some missing formulas...)\end{shaded}
\end{minipage}&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
L &amp; = &amp; -\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{u},

N &amp; = &amp; -\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{v}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v},

M &amp; = &amp; -\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{v}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{u}=-\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We finally obtain&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=\frac{\left(\mathbf{\hat{n}}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{u}\right)\mathrm{d}u^{2}+\left(\mathbf{\hat{n}}_{v}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{u}+\mathbf{\hat{n}}_{u}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)\mathrm{d}u\mathrm{d}v+\left(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{v}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{v}\right)\mathrm{d}v^{2}}{\left(\mathrm{d}s\right)^{2}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{u}\mathrm{d}u+\mathbf{r}_{v}\mathrm{d}v&lt;/math&gt;
and $\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{u}\mathrm{d}u+\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{v}\mathrm{d}v$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=-\frac{\mathrm{d\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}=-\frac{\mathrm{d\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}s^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
(missing diagram...)


\paragraph{Curvature tensor}

Since $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}=0$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{n}}+\mathrm{d}\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\hat{\mathbf{n}}\left(\mathbf{r}+\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\right)=\mathbf{\hat{n}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)}+\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\triangledown\mathbf{\hat{n}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\hat{n}}=\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\triangledown\hat{\mathbf{n}}\equiv\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\overleftrightarrow{Q}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The quantity &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\overleftrightarrow{Q} &amp; = &amp; \triangledown\hat{\mathbf{n}},

Q_{ij} &amp; = &amp; \left(\triangledown\hat{\mathbf{n}}\right)_{ij}=\frac{\partial}{\partial r_{i}}\left(\mathbf{\hat{n}}\right)_{j},\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
is a second rank tensor or dyadic.

Now, we can write &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; with
\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}
\begin{shaded}
(some missing formulas...)\end{shaded}
\end{minipage}&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=-\frac{\mathrm{d\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}=-\frac{\mathrm{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\overleftrightarrow{Q}\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}=-\frac{\mathrm{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}\cdot\overleftrightarrow{Q}\cdot}\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}s^{2}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\left(s\right)\cdot\overleftrightarrow{Q}\cdot\mathbf{r}^{\prime}\left(s\right)=\sum_{ij}r_{i}^{\prime}Q_{ij}r_{j}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'(s)={\normalcolor \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}s}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be used for the case of an implicitly defined surface where
$\hat{\mathbf{n}}=\frac{\triangledown F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Q_{ij} &amp; = &amp; \left[\triangledown\left(\frac{\triangledown F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}\right)\right]_{ij}

&amp; = &amp; \partial_{i}\left(\frac{\partial_{j}F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}\right)=\frac{\partial_{i}\partial_{j}F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}-\left(\partial_{j}F\right)\cdot\frac{\partial_{i}F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Using $\partial_{i}\left|\triangledown F\right|=\partial_{i}\sqrt{\left(\partial_{x}F\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y}F\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{z}F\right)^{2}}$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
Q_{ij}=-\frac{1}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}\left[\frac{\partial_{i}\left|\triangledown F\right|\partial_{j}F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|}-\partial_{i}\partial_{j}F\right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

\paragraph{The curvature tensor and its invariants}

The dyadic matrix &lt;math&gt;Q=\overleftrightarrow{Q}&lt;/math&gt; has eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt;,
a trace &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}Q=\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and a determinant &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Det}Q=\left|Q\right|=\prod_{i}\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt;
which are invariant under similarity transformations &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Q}=UQU^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The sum of the principal minors &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}M_{ii}&lt;/math&gt; is also invariant:
to see this, consider the characteristic polynomial&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
P\left(\lambda\right) &amp; = &amp; \mathrm{Det}\left(Q-\lambda I\right)

&amp; = &amp; \mathrm{Det}\left(U^{-1}U\right)\mathrm{Det}\left(Q-\lambda I\right)

&amp;  &amp; \mathrm{Det}\left(U^{-1}\right)\mathrm{Det}\left(Q-\lambda I\right)\mathrm{Det}\left(U\right)

&amp; = &amp; \mathrm{Det}\left(U^{-1}QU-\lambda U^{-1}IU\right)

&amp; = &amp; \mathrm{Det}\left(\tilde{Q}-\lambda I\right).\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the unit matrix. Expanding &lt;math&gt;P\left(\lambda\right)&lt;/math&gt; in
powers of $\lambda$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P\left(\lambda\right)=\left|Q\right|-\lambda\sum_{i}M_{ii}+\lambda^{2}\sum_{i}Q_{ii}-\lambda^{3}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can identify clearly the coefficients of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;as
the 3 invariants. One eigenvalue is always equal to zero (as an exercise
do it in the implicit representation). If we choose &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{3}=0&lt;/math&gt;,
we are reduced to two nontrivial invariants: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}Q=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}M_{ii}=\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}&lt;/math&gt;(as &lt;math&gt;{\normalcolor \mathrm{Det}}(Q)=0)&lt;/math&gt;.
These invariants are called the ''mean curvature''  &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and the
''Gaussian curvature''  $K$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
H\equiv\frac{1}{2}\left(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
K\equiv\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


For example, in the implicit representation we can write&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{\hat{n}} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\triangledown F}{\left|\triangledown F\right|},

N &amp; \equiv &amp; \left|\triangledown F\right|,

\mathrm{Tr}Q &amp; = &amp; -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\left[\frac{N_{i}F_{i}}{N}-F_{ii}\right],\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
N_{i}=\frac{\partial}{\partial r_{i}}N,

F_{ij}=\frac{\partial}{\partial r_{i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial r_{j}}F.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that since, for instance, &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
N_{i}=\partial_{i}\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}+F_{z}^{2}}=\frac{\partial_{i}\left(F_{j}F_{j}\right)}{2\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}+F_{z}^{2}}}=\frac{1}{N}F_{j}F_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with a few more steps we can show (another exercise) that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
H=-\frac{1}{2N^{3}}\left[2F_{x}F_{y}F_{xy}-F_{xx}\left(F_{y}^{2}+F_{z}^{2}\right)+\mathrm{2\, cyclic\, permuations}\right],&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
K=-\frac{1}{2N^{3}}\left[F_{xx}F_{yy}F_{z}^{2}-F_{xy}^{2}F_{z}^{2}+2F_{xz}F_{x}\left(F_{y}F_{yz}-F_{z}F_{yy}\right)+\mathrm{2\, cyclic\, permuations}\right],&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


where by cyclic permutations we mean permuting the axes: &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow y\rightarrow z\rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;.
In the case of the Monge representation where &lt;math&gt;F=z-h\left(x,y\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; have a simpler form:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
N &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}},

h_{i} &amp; = &amp; \partial_{i}h,

F_{x} &amp; = &amp; -h_{x},

F_{y} &amp; = &amp; -h_{y},

F_{z} &amp; = &amp; 1.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
One can then show that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
H=\frac{1}{2\left(\sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}}\right)^{3}}\left[\left(1+h_{y}^{2}\right)h_{xx}+\left(1+h_{x}^{2}\right)h_{yy}-2h_{x}h_{y}h_{z}\right],&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
K=\frac{h_{xx}h_{yy}-h_{xy}^{2}}{\left(1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}\right)^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
====Small disturbances of planar surfaces====
To treat nearly flat surfaces, one can use the Monge representation
to expand a Taylor series around a completely flat surface in derivatives
of $h\left(x,y\right)$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
N &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{1+h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}}\simeq1+\frac{1}{2}\left(h_{x}^{2}+h_{y}^{2}\right),\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or equivalently&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
N=\left|\triangledown F\right|\simeq1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\triangledown_{||}h\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
From similar arguments, one can show that&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
H &amp; \simeq &amp; \frac{1}{2}\left(h_{xx}+h_{yy}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\triangledown_{\parallel}^{2}h,

K &amp; \simeq &amp; h_{xx}h_{yy}-\left(h_{xy}\right)^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the general parametric representation,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=\frac{L\left(du\right)^{2}+2Mdudv+N\left(dv\right)^{2}}{E\left(du\right)^{2}+2Fdudv+G\left(dv\right)^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;L=\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{uu}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;M=\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{uv}&lt;/math&gt;and
&lt;math&gt;N=\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{vv}&lt;/math&gt;.
Picking a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}=l\mathbf{r}_{u}+m\mathbf{r}_{v}&lt;/math&gt;
in the plane, the curvature in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
is given by&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa=Ll^{2}+2Mlm+Nm^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The parameters $l$ and $m$ must obey&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
a=\hat{|\mathbf{a}}|=1\Rightarrow\hat{\mathbf{a}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{a}}=El^{2}+2Fml+Gm^{2}=1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In investigating &lt;math&gt;\kappa\left(l,m\right)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the direction
of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, we can find its extrema with the constraint
$a=1$ by adding a Lagrange multiplier:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\tilde{\kappa} &amp; = &amp; \kappa\left(l,m\right)-\lambda(El_{2}+2Flm+Nm^{2}),

 &amp; \Downarrow

\frac{\partial\tilde{\kappa}}{\partial l}=\frac{\partial\tilde{\kappa}}{\partial m} &amp; = &amp; 0.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The solution takes the form of a quadratic equation&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\kappa^{2}\left(EG-F^{2}\right)-\kappa\left(EN+GL-2FM\right)+\left(LN-M^{2}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which has 2 roots: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{b}.&lt;/math&gt; This extremum
finding process defines the ''principal directions'' , which (we
will state without proof) are always perpendicular to each other.
The two invariants are then&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
H &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa_{a}+\kappa_{b}\right)=-\frac{EN+GL-2FM}{2\left(EG-F^{2}\right)},

K &amp; = &amp; \kappa_{a}\kappa_{b}=\frac{LN-M^{2}}{EG-F^{2}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Consider a few cases in terms of the radii of curvature &lt;math&gt;r_{a}=\frac{1}{\kappa_{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;r_{b}=\frac{1}{\kappa_{b}}&lt;/math&gt;:
  
#If at some point both radii are positive, then &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{a}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{b}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are all positive. The surface is convex around the point, as in (17a). 
#If both are negative, then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The surface is concave around the point, as in (17b). 
#If the two have opposing signs, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is negative and one is at a saddle point of the surface, as in (17c). 
#The special surface having &lt;math&gt;H=(\kappa_{a}+\kappa_{b})/2=0&lt;/math&gt; at ''any''  point is called a ''minimal surface''  (or ''Schwartz surface,''  after the 19th century mathematician who studied them in detail). These surfaces have a saddle at every point, as one curvature is always positive and the second negative: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{a}=-\kappa_{b}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, their Gaussian curvature is always negative: &lt;math&gt;K&lt;0.&lt;/math&gt; 
We will use the principal directions to describe a local paraboloid
expansion of a nearly flat surface. In general,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
z=z_{0}+\frac{1}{2}L\left(u-u_{0}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}N\left(v-v_{0}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In the Monge representation,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
z=z_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\kappa_{a}\left(x-x_{0}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\kappa_{b}\left(y-y_{0}\right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
====Free energy of soft surfaces====
\begin{description}

[{Book:}] Landau &amp; Lifshitz' book on ''Elasticity '' has a chapter
on elasticity of hard (solid) shells. There is also a book by Boal
on ''elasticity and mechanics of fluid membranes'' . Safran's book
shows how the parameters we describe can be derived from a microscopic
model where the lipid (surfactant) molecules are modeled as beads
connected with various springs.
\end{description}
Consider a liquid surface or fluid membrane: as such a surface curves,
its free energy varies. Phenomenologically,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta F=\sigma\int\mathrm{d}A+2k\int\left(H-C_{0}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}A+\bar{k}\int K\mathrm{d}A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
All the integrals are taken over the surface. The fact that the above
expression models a fluid membrane is related to the fact that we
do not account for any lateral shear forces. Molecules composing the
fluid membrane are free to flow inside the membrane but they resist
elastic deformations such as bending. The first term describes the
contribution of surface tension, which is proportional to the total
surface area. The geometric values &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are the mean and
Gaussian curvatures we have already encountered. The coefficients
&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{k}&lt;/math&gt; (with units of energy) depend, like &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,
on the material properties in question. The spontaneous curvature
&lt;math&gt;C_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is also a material property: it defines a certain preferred
angle (perhaps due to the shape of surfactant molecules), and its
sign depends on the preferred direction of curvature. See (18) for
an illustration. Unless there is an active process that causes an
asymmetry in the lipid composition of the two leaflets, the bilayer
will have the same lipid composition on the inside and outside, and
therefore has in total &lt;math&gt;C_{0}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Usually for fluid membranes, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\bar{k}&lt;/math&gt; range from &lt;math&gt;\sim1k_{B}T&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sim40k_{B}T&lt;/math&gt;.

One example is a sphere of radius $R$, where:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
H &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\left(R_{1}^{-1}+R_{2}^{-1}\right)=R^{-1},

K &amp; = &amp; R^{-2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left.\Delta F\right|_{\mathrm{sphere}} &amp; = &amp; \sigma\int\mathrm{d}A+2k\int\left(H-C_{0}\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}A+\bar{k}\int K\mathrm{d}A

&amp; = &amp; 4\pi R^{2}\sigma+2k\left(\frac{1}{R}-C_{0}\right)^{2}\cdot4\pi R^{2}+4\pi\bar{k}

&amp; = &amp; 4\pi R^{2}\sigma+8\pi k\left(1-C_{0}R\right)^{2}+4\pi\bar{k}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The interesting fact that the surface integral over the Gaussian curvature
&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; gives a constant value of &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; - independent on the radius
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the sphere - has a deep meaning. It is related to the famous
Gauss-Bonnet theorem which will be stated here without further details:
according to this theorem, the integral over the Gaussian curvature
is a topological invariant of the surface whose value is equal to
&lt;math&gt;4\pi\left(1-g\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the ''genus''  of the surface.
A sphere or any closed object with no {}&quot;holes&quot; has &lt;math&gt;g=0&lt;/math&gt; and
an integrated Gaussian curvature of &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, while a torus (or {}&quot;donut&quot;)
with one hole has &lt;math&gt;g=1&lt;/math&gt; and hence a zero integrated Gaussian curvature.
{{Sidenote|More information about the Gauss-Bonnet theorem may be found in books
on differential geometry}}

A second example is an infinite cylinder with radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{a}=\frac{1}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
and $\kappa_{b}=0$. The free energy per unit length is&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{\Delta F}{L} &amp; = &amp; 2\pi R\sigma+2k\left(\frac{1}{2R}-C_{0}\right)\cdot2\pi R+\bar{k}\overset{{\scriptstyle =0}}{\overbrace{\int\frac{1}{R}\cdot0\cdot\mathrm{d}A}}

 &amp; = &amp; 2\pi R\sigma+\frac{4\pi k}{R}\left(\frac{1}{2}-C_{0}R\right)^{2}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
An even simpler example is the infinite plane, where &lt;math&gt;\kappa_{a}=\kappa_{b}=0\Rightarrow K=H=0&lt;/math&gt;.
This yields&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Delta F}{\mathrm{Area}}=\sigma+2kC_{0}^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Thermal fluctuations of a plane====
\begin{description}

[{Book:}] Safran's book.
\end{description}
To second order in derivatives of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the Monge representation
for $\bar{k}=0$,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta F=\frac{\sigma}{2}\int\left(\triangledown h\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y+\frac{2k}{4}\left(\triangledown^{2}h\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The minimum of energy is obtained for a flat surface. Going to a Fourier
transformed form, we have&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
h_{\mathbf{q}} &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^{2}\int\mathrm{d}^{2}r\, h\left(\mathbf{r}\right)e^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}},

h\left(\mathbf{r}\right) &amp; = &amp; \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^{2}\int\mathrm{d}^{2}q\, h_{\mathbf{q}}e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}},

\left(\triangledown^{2}h\right)^{2} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; q^{4}h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}},

\left(\triangledown h\right)^{2} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; q^{2}h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives for the free energy in terms of the normal surface modes
$\left\{ h_{q}\right\} $:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta F=\frac{\sigma}{2}\int\left(q_{x}^{2}+q_{y}^{2}\right)h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}\mathrm{d}^{2}q+\frac{k}{2}\int\left(q_{x}^{2}+q_{y}^{2}\right)^{2}h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}\mathrm{d}^{2}q.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
With &lt;math&gt;h\left(\mathbf{r}\right)&lt;/math&gt; real, we know that &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathbf{q}}=h_{-\mathbf{q}}^{*}&lt;/math&gt;,
or &lt;math&gt;h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}=\left|h_{\mathbf{q}}\right|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
From the classical equipartition theorem we can estimate the equilibrium
energy for the average of this quantity:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{k_{B}T}{2} &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\sigma q^{2}\left\langle h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}\right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}kq^{4}\left\langle h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{-\mathbf{q}}\right\rangle 

 &amp; \Downarrow

\left\langle \left|h_{\mathbf{q}}\right|^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{\sigma q^{2}+kq^{4}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is now useful to define the new length scale &lt;math&gt;\xi\equiv\sqrt{\frac{k}{\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;,
and examine the limits of &lt;math&gt;k\xi\gg1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\xi\ll1&lt;/math&gt;.
In the &lt;math&gt;k\xi\ll1&lt;/math&gt; limit, one obtains a surface dominated by surface
tension. Consider the real space thermal correlation function&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle h\left(\mathbf{r}\right)h\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{2}}\int\int e^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}e^{-i\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\overset{{\scriptstyle =2\pi\delta\left(\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\right)}}{\overbrace{\left\langle h_{\mathbf{q}}h_{\mathbf{q^{\prime}}}\right\rangle }}\mathrm{d}^{2}q\mathrm{d}^{2}q^{\prime}

&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi}\int\mathrm{d}^{2}q\,\frac{k_{B}T}{\sigma q^{2}}.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since this integral diverges at both large and small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, to obtain
a physically meaningful result we must introduce cutoffs to the range
of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{q}&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;q_{\mathrm{min}}=\frac{2\pi}{L}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is
the linear dimension of the system, and &lt;math&gt;q_{\mathrm{max}}=\frac{2\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a\sim3\AA&lt;/math&gt; is the typical molecular size. This gives an example
of a famous result from the 1930's, known as Landau-Peierls instability
for 2-dimensional systems and the lack of an ordered phase at $T&gt;0$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle h^{2}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right\rangle =\frac{k_{B}T}{2\pi\sigma}\ln\frac{L}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since the logarithmic divergence is very weak, it turns out that the
thermal fluctuations are two or three Angstroms in size for a water
surface of macroscopic (a few millimeters or centimeters) dimension.
These thermal fluctuations are not easy to measure because the signal
should come only from the water molecules at the water surface. In
the 1980s they were measured for the first time for water surfaces
at room temperature using a powerful synchrotron X-ray source. The
technique employs scattering at very low angles (called grazing incidence)
from the water surface and obtains the intensity of the scattered
X-ray as function of &lt;math&gt;q.&lt;/math&gt; This quantity is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\langle|h_{q}|^{2}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
In the opposite limit where &lt;math&gt;k\xi\gg1&lt;/math&gt;, the membrane is dominated
by its elastic energy, and $\sigma\ll kq^{2}$ can be neglected: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \left|h_{\mathbf{q}}\right|^{2}\right\rangle =\frac{k_{B}T}{\sigma q^{2}+kq^{4}}\simeq\frac{k_{B}T}{kq^{4}}\sim q^{-4}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The divergence at small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is much larger here than in the first
case, and&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle h^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{2\pi k}\int_{q_{\mathrm{min}}}^{q_{\mathrm{max}}}\frac{1}{q^{3}}\mathrm{d}q

 &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{4\pi k}\left[-\overset{\approx0}{\overbrace{\left(\frac{1}{q_{\mathrm{max}}}\right)^{2}}}+\left(\frac{1}{q_{\mathrm{min}}}\right)^{2}\right],\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\left\langle h^{2}\right\rangle  &amp; = &amp; \frac{k_{B}T}{2\left(2\pi\right)^{2}}\frac{L^{2}}{k}

 &amp; \Downarrow

\sqrt{\left\langle h^{2}\right\rangle } &amp; \sim &amp; L.\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In such membranes, which are dominated by elasticity, the fluctuations
increase linearly with membrane size. For a membrane around &lt;math&gt;1\mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt;
in length, a typical amplitude is in the &lt;math&gt;\mu\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; range.
Another interesting observation is that &lt;math&gt;\left\langle h^{2}\right\rangle \sim T/k&lt;/math&gt;.
For small &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (flexible membranes), as well as for higher temperatures,
the fluctuations become larger. This is valid as long as the condition
of the elastic-dominated case, &lt;math&gt;\sigma\ll kq^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, remains satisfied.
Also, recall that the source of the large membrane fluctuations comes
from the small &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; or large wavelengths, and not from small wiggles
associated with the motion of individual molecules.
====Rayleigh instability====
Due to surface tension, a cylinder of liquid created in air (or surrounded
by another immiscible liquid) is unstable and will break into spherical
droplets. Let's consider the following model: a cylinder of length
&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and smaller radius &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\ll L&lt;/math&gt;, which contains inside it an
''incompressible''  liquid with a total volume of &lt;math&gt;V=\pi LR_{0}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
For simplicity, we will consider perturbations which preserve the
body-of-revolution symmetry around the main axis and the cylinder
length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that only the local radius &lt;math&gt;\rho\left(z\right)&lt;/math&gt;
along the cylinder's axis may vary. Expanding &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; in normal modes
then gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\rho\left(z\right)=R+\sum_{q\neq0}\rho_{q}e^{iqz}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The mode amplitudes are &lt;math&gt;\rho_{q}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L}}\int\rho\left(z\right)e^{-iqz}\mathrm{d}z&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \rho\left(z\right)\right\rangle =\frac{1}{L}\int_{0}^{L}\rho\left(z\right)\mathrm{d}z=R,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. This dependence can be found from
the constant volume constraint&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
V &amp; = &amp; \pi R_{0}^{2}L=\int_{0}^{L}\pi\rho^{2}\left(z\right)\mathrm{d}z \\

 &amp; = &amp; \pi R^{2}L+\frac{\pi}{L}\sum_{q}\sum_{q^{\prime}}\overset{{\scriptstyle =L\delta_{qq^{\prime}}}}{\overbrace{\left(\int e^{i(q+q^{\prime})z}\mathrm{d}z\right)}}\rho_{q}\rho_{-q} \\

 &amp; \Downarrow &amp; \\

R^{2}L &amp; = &amp; R_{0}^{2}L-\sum_{q\ne0}\rho_{q}\rho_{-q}.\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is exact, but for small perturbations we can expand the root
and obtain&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R\simeq R_{0}\left(1-\frac{1}{2L}\sum_{q\ne0}\left|\rho_{q}\right|^{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The surface energy of the distorted cylinder will be&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F_{s}=\sigma\cdot\mathrm{Area}=\sigma\cdot\int_{0}^{L}2\pi\rho\left(z\right)\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial z}\right)^{2}}\mathrm{d}z.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
(We have used expression for the surface area of a body-of-revolution
with axial symmetry). Expanding all quantities up to second order
in &lt;math&gt;\rho_{q}&lt;/math&gt; gives&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
F_{s} &amp; \simeq &amp; \overset{{\scriptstyle =0}}{\overbrace{2\pi\sigma\int_{0}^{L}\left(\rho\left(z\right)-R\right)\mathrm{d}z}}+2\pi\sigma\int_{0}^{L}\mathrm{d}zR\left(1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial r}\right)^{2}\right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; 2\pi\sigma L\left(R_{0}-\frac{R_{0}}{2L}\sum_{q}\frac{\left|\rho_{q}\right|^{2}}{R_{0}^{2}}\right)+\frac{\pi\sigma R_{0}}{L}\int_{0}^{L}\sum_{q}\sum_{q^{\prime}}\left(-q\cdot q^{\prime}\right)e^{i\left(q+q^{\prime}\right)z}\mathrm{d}z \\

 &amp; = &amp; 2\pi\sigma LR_{0}-2\pi\sigma R_{0}\sum_{q}\frac{\left|\rho_{q}\right|^{2}}{2R_{0}^{2}}+2\pi\sigma R_{0}\sum_{q}\frac{q^{2}\left|\rho_{q}\right|^{2}}{2R_{0}^{2}}.
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Finally,&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta F=F_{s}-F_{s}^{0}=2\pi\sigma R_{0}\sum_{q}\frac{\left|\rho_{q}\right|^{2}}{2R_{0}^{2}}\left(q^{2}R_{0}^{2}-1\right).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The conclusion is that modes having &lt;math&gt;q^{2}R_{0}^{2}\le1&lt;/math&gt; will reduce
the original cylinder free energy &lt;math&gt;F_{s}^{0}.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, this is the
onset of an instability called the Rayleigh instability of a liquid
cylinder. A liquid cylinder will spontaneously start to develop undulations
of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda\sim q^{-1}\ge R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. These undulations will
grow and eventually break up the cylinder into spherical droplets
of size &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if we go back to the planar surface by
taking the limit &lt;math&gt;R_{0}\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;, no such instability will
occur since the planar geometry has the lowest surface area with respect
to any other fluctuating surface.

====What is this document all about? ====
This paper is submitted as a final project in the course {\small {}&quot;Physical
Models in Biological Systems and Soft Matter&quot;. }Writing this document
I aimed at achieving two goals. The first was getting to know a little
better a subject that I found interesting and was not covered during
the course. As an interesting by product I have also profoundly improved
my knowledge on diffusion, a subject I was already superficially acquainted
with. The second goal was to provide an accessible exposition to the
subject of polymer dynamics aimed mainly for advanced undergraduate
students who are curious about the subject and would like an easy
start. This is also the reason this document is titled: {}&quot;A Guided
Tour to the Essence of Polymer Dynamics&quot; and for the fact it is
written in the form of questions and answers.



The saying goes: {}&quot;There are two ways by which one can really
master a subject: research and teaching&quot;. I felt that the effort
I have put into making this document readable for advanced undergraduate
students taught me more than I would have learned by passive reading.
I have tried hard to make this document as self contained and self
explanatory as possible and therefore hope that it will be of some
help to you the curious student. So, if you wonder {}&quot;What do you
mean by polymer dynamics?&quot; and {}&quot;How can this subject be of any
interest to me?&quot; please read on. 
\newpage{}
\section{O.K, sum it up in a few lines so I can decide if I want to go on
reading!}
=====What's a polymer?=====
A polymer is a large molecule (macro-molecule) composed of repeating
structural units (monomers) typically connected by covalent chemical
bonds. Due to the extraordinary range of properties accessible in
polymeric materials, they have come to play an essential and ubiquitous
role in everyday life - from plastics and elastomers on the one hand
to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are essential
for life on the other.

\end{figure}



=====What's polymer dynamics?=====

As every other molecule a polymer is also affected by the thermal
motion of surrounding molecules. It is this thermal agitation that
causes a flexible polymer to move about in the solution while constantly
changing its shape. This motion is referred to as polymer dynamics.

=====What can I find in the rest of this document?=====

If you ever wondered how can one understand the motion of a polymer
and what are the physical properties emanating from the dynamics of
these materials you should read on. We will start with the building
blocks, the dynamics of a single particle in solution. We will then
gradually build on, presenting two models for polymer dynamics. Experimental
observations will also be discussed as we confront our models with
reality.

\section{I knew there must be some preliminaries, can you keep it short and
to the point? }


\subsection{Why do you bore me with this? why can't I skip directly to section
4?}

If you are familiar with concepts such as Diffusion, Einstein relation
and Brownian motion you would find this section easier to read. If
you are also familiar with the mathematics behind these concepts,
Smoluchowski and Langevin equations, you can skip directly to section
4. In order to understand polymer dynamics we have to start from something
more basic. A polymer can be thought of as long chain of particles
(the monomers), the particles are connected to one another and hence
interact. It would be wise to first try and understand the dynamics
of a single particle and only then take into account these interactions.
The dynamics of a single particle lies in the heart of the section. 


\subsection{Can't say I know much about any of the stuff you mentioned above
but first thing is first, what is diffusion?}

Molecular diffusion, often called simply diffusion, is a net transport
of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower
concentration by random molecular motion. The result of diffusion
is a gradual mixing of material. In a phase with uniform temperature,
absent external net forces acting on the particles, the diffusion
process will eventually result in complete mixing or a state of equilibrium.
Basically, it is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration
to a lower area.

\end{figure}



=====How can we mathematically treat diffusion?=====

As mentioned above diffusion is basically the movement of molecules
from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration.
For simplicity we will consider one-dimensional diffusion. Let &lt;math&gt;c(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;
be the concentration at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. A Phenomenological
description of diffusion is given by Fick's law: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
j(x,t)=-D\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In words: if the concentration is not uniform, there will be a flux
of matter which is proportional to the gradient in concentration.
The proportionality constant is called the diffusion constant and
it is denoted by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; its units are &lt;math&gt;\frac{length^{2}}{time}&lt;/math&gt;. The
minus sign is there to take care of the fact that the flow is from
the higher concentration region to the lower concentration region. 
====Where is this flux coming from? ====
Its microscopic origin is the random thermal motion of the particles.
The average velocity of each particle is zero, and there is an equal
probability for each particle to have a velocity directioned right
or left. However, if the concentration is not uniform the number of
particles which happen to flow from the higher concentration region
to the lower concentration region is higher than the number of particles
flowing in the other direction simply because there are more particles
there.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\string&quot;23-07-2009 22-19-57\string&quot;.eps}
\par\end{centering}
\centering{}\caption{Microscopic explanation for Fick's law. Suppose that the particle
concentration &lt;math&gt;c(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not uniform. If the particles move randomly
as shown by the arrows, there is a net flux of particles flowing from
the higher concentration region to the lower concentration region.
Here the diffusion constant of the particle, which determines the
average length of the arrows, is assumed to be constant. }

\end{figure}



======How do we go on?======

We now write an equation for the conservation of matter, the change
in the number of particles located at the interval &lt;math&gt;[x,x+\triangle x]&lt;/math&gt;
from time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to time &lt;math&gt;t+\triangle t&lt;/math&gt; is given by the number of
particles coming/going from the left minus the number of particles
coming/going from the right: {\tiny &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
N(t+\triangle t)-N(t)\simeq\left[c(x+\frac{\triangle x}{2},t+\triangle t)-c(x+\frac{\triangle x}{2},t)\right]\triangle x\simeq\left[j(x,t+\frac{\triangle t}{2})-j(x+\triangle x,t+\frac{\triangle t}{2})\right]\triangle t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}or: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\left[c(x+\frac{\triangle x}{2},t+\triangle t)-c(x+\frac{\triangle x}{2},t)\right]}{\triangle t}=\frac{\left[j(x,t+\frac{\triangle t}{2})-j(x+\triangle x,t+\frac{\triangle t}{2})\right]}{\triangle x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
taking the limits &lt;math&gt;\triangle t,\triangle x\longrightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; and assuming
continuity and differentiability of the concentration and the flux
we obtain: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial j(x,t)}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Substituting the expression for the flux gives the well known diffusion
equation:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial^{2}c(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
\subsubsection{What happens if the particles are under the influence of some kind
of a potential &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt;?}

If this happens Fick's law must be modified since the potential &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt;
exerts a force: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
F=-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
on the particle and gives an non zero average velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. If the
force is weak there is a linear relation between force and velocity
given by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
v=\frac{F}{\zeta}=-\frac{1}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
the constant &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is called the friction constant and its inverse
&lt;math&gt;1/\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is called the mobility.


\subsubsection{How come the velocity doesn't grow indefinitely? there is a constant
force!}

Correct, but it is not the only force acting on the particle. There
are also friction and random forces exerted by other particles and
hence like a feather falling under its own weight the particle reaches
a finite average velocity. 


======O.K, and what do we do now?======

We will obtain the Smoluchowski equation that takes the potential
into account, but first we will obtain an important relation between
the diffusion constant the temperature and the friction constant.
The average velocity of the particle gives an additional flux &lt;math&gt;cv&lt;/math&gt;
so that the total flux is: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
j(x,t)=-D\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial x}-\frac{c}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
An important relation is obtained from this equation. As you may recall
from statistical mechanics, in equilibrium the concentration is given
by the Boltzmann distribution:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
c_{eq}(x,t)\propto exp(-U(x)/k_{B}T)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
for which the flux must vanish and hence:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-D\frac{\partial c_{eq}(x,t)}{\partial x}-\frac{c_{eq}}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Substituting for $c_{eq}(x,t)$ we get:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{Dc_{eq}}{k_{B}T}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}-\frac{c_{eq}}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}=c_{eq}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\left[\frac{D}{k_{B}T}-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since this is true for every $x$ it follows that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
D=\frac{k_{B}T}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
this relation is called the Einstein relation. The Einstein relation
states that the diffusion constant which characterizes the thermal
motion is related to the friction constant which specifies the response
to external force. The Einstein relation is a special case of a general
theorem called the fluctuation dissipation theorem, which states the
spontaneous thermal fluctuations are related to the characteristics
of the system response to an external field.
====And the Smoluchowski equation is obtained by plugging in the {====&quot;new&quot;
flux into the continuity equation right?}
Exactly right! using the Einstein relation we rewrite the flux as:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
j(x,t)=-\frac{1}{\zeta}\left[k_{B}T\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial x}+c\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Substituting this into the continuity equation we get the Smoluchowski
equation:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial j(x,t)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{1}{\zeta}\left[k_{B}T\frac{\partial c(x,t)}{\partial x}+c\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which serves as a phenomenological description of diffusion under
the influence of an external potential. Although we have derived the
above equation for the concentration &lt;math&gt;c(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; the same equation will
also hold for the probability distribution function &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; that
a particular particle is found at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. This
is true since the distinction between &lt;math&gt;c(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is,
for non-interacting particles, only the fact that &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is
normalized. The evolution equation for the probability &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;
is hence written as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\frac{1}{\zeta}\left[k_{B}T\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x}+\Psi(x,t)\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which will also be termed the Smoluchowski equation.

===What's Brownian motion?===
Brownian motion (named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown) is
the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (i.e.
a liquid or gas) or the mathematical model used to describe such random
movements. Brownian motion is traditionally regarded as discovered
by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. It is believed that Brown was
studying pollen particles floating in water under the microscope.
He then observed small particles within the vacuoles of the pollen
grains executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with
particles of dust, he was able to rule out that the motion was due
to pollen particles being 'alive', although the origin of the motion
was yet to be explained.

Les Atomes,Perrin, 1914, p. 115.}
\end{figure}
=====And the mathematical treatment?=====
\subsubsection{Before we start I have to say that it seems awfully similar to diffusion,
what's new?}
You are right! these are opposite sides of the same coin. However,
the approach we take here is microscopic rather than macroscopic.
Instead of starting from a macroscopic quantity, the concentration,
we will start from the equation of motion for a single particle in
solution, Newton's second law: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=-\zeta\frac{dx}{dt}-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+g'(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here the first term on the right hand side is the friction force which
is assumed to take a standard form of being opposite in direction
and proportional to the velocity. The second term is the force exerted
as a consequence of the external potential and the third term is a
random force that represents the sum of the forces due to collisions
with surrounding particles. Let us now rewrite this equation in the
form: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{m}{\zeta}\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+\frac{dx}{dt}=-\frac{1}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+\frac{g'(t)}{\zeta}\equiv-\frac{1}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+g(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have defined &lt;math&gt;g(t)\equiv\frac{g'(t)}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;. Our next
step is an approximation, treating very small and light weight particles
we will drop the inertial term &lt;math&gt;\frac{m}{\zeta}\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
assuming it is negligible and obtain: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx}{dt}=-\frac{1}{\zeta}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+g(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we will refer to this equation as the Langevin equation. This equation
describes the motion of a single Brownian particle, solving it one
can (in principle) obtain a trajectory of such a particle.
======I don't understand why you throw away the inertial term, please explain!======
This can be further explained by the following example. Consider a
particle immersed in some solvent moving under the influence of a
constant external force &lt;math&gt;F=-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us
denote the velocity: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
v=\frac{dx}{dt'}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
the equation of motion for $v$ is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{m}{\zeta}\frac{dv}{dt'}+v=\frac{F}{\zeta}+g(t')&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For simplicity let us factor out the random force by taking an ensemble
average (to avoid the subtleties of taking the time average) of both
sides of the equation and obtaining an equation for the average velocity:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d&lt;v&gt;}{dt'}+\frac{\zeta}{m}&lt;v&gt;=\frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{t'\zeta}{m}}&lt;/math&gt; and integrating
from zero to $t$ we are able to solve for $&lt;v&gt;$: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;v&gt;=e^{\frac{-t\zeta}{m}}\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{F}{m}e^{\frac{t'\zeta}{m}}dt'=\frac{F}{\zeta}\left[1-e^{\frac{-t\zeta}{m}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Where we have assumed that the particle was at rest at time zero.
We see that the velocity approaches an asymptotic value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{F}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;
exponentially fast and that the characteristic relaxation time is
&lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{m}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;. Dropping the inertial term in the first place
we would have simply gotten: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;v&gt;=\frac{F}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e an immediate response to the force. It is now clear that if the
relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{m}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt; is small, dropping the inertial
term is a good approximation! In the case of small particles (atoms,molecules,colloidal
particles, etc...) immersed in a liquid, the relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;
is indeed very small supporting the validity of our approximation.
\subsubsection{If these are opposite sides of the same coin how does the Langevin
equation relate to the Smoluchowski equation?}
As mentioned earlier, since we don't know the exact time dependence
of &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; we will treat it as a random force. The freedom in choosing
the distribution of &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is very large, here however we will limit
ourselves to a model which will be equivalent to the Smoluchowski
equation.
\subsubsection{The Langevin equation gives us trajectories, the Smoluchowski equation
gives us a probability distribution for the position, how can they
be equivalent?}
Excellent question! Examining many trajectories one can generate the
probability distribution for the position. For example starting the
particles from a given origin and following its trajectory up to some
time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; one can record the position &lt;math&gt;x(t).&lt;/math&gt; Repeating the processes
many many times will yield many many different &lt;math&gt;x(t).&lt;/math&gt; Creating a
histogram one can generate an empirical probability distribution for
the position at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. One can show () that if the probability
distribution of &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be Gaussian and is characterized
by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g(t)&gt;=0

&lt;g(t)g(t')&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}\delta(t-t')\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
then the distribution of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; determined by the Langevin equation
satisfies the Smoluchowski equation. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is
a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance &lt;math&gt;\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;
and if &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(t')&lt;/math&gt; are independent for &lt;math&gt;t\neq t'&lt;/math&gt; then the
above statement holds.
\subsubsection{I still don't understand, can you demonstrate on a simple special
case?}
Yes! Consider the Brownian motion of a free particle (no external
potential) for which the Langevin equation reads:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx}{dt}=g(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
If the particle is at &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, its position at time
$t$ is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=x_{0}+\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}g(t')dt'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
From the above we deduce that &lt;math&gt;x(t)-x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination
independent Gaussian random variables. We now recall that the sum
independent Gaussian random variables is a Gaussian random variable
itself and hence the probability distribution of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; may be written
as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi B}}exp\left[-\frac{\left(x-A\right)^{2}}{2B}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
A=&lt;x(t)&gt;

B=&lt;(x(t)-A)^{2}&gt;\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The mean is calculated from: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A=&lt;x(t)&gt;=x_{0}+\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}&lt;g(t')&gt;dt'=x_{0}+\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}0\cdot dt'=x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For the variance we have: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=&lt;\left(\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}g(t')dt'\right)\left(\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}g(t&quot;)dt&quot;\right)&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}&lt;g(t')g(t&quot;)&gt;dt'dt&quot;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
hence: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}\delta(t-t')dt'dt&quot;=\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}t=2Dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and thus:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}exp\left[-\frac{\left(x-x_{0}\right)^{2}}{4Dt}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which is exactly (check by direct differentiation) the solution for
the Smoluchowski equation: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial^{2}\Psi(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, both equations result in the same probability distribution
for &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. An important conclusion is that the mean square displacement
of a Brownian particle from the origin is given by &lt;math&gt;2Dt&lt;/math&gt; and is hence
linear in time.


=====O.K, I think we covered everything! anything else?=====

We are almost done but in order to complete our analysis we need to
analyze one more problem, the Brownian motion of a harmonic oscillator.


\subsubsection{Why do we have to do this? how come we always have to talk about
the harmonic oscillator?}

The harmonic oscillator is a simple system that serves as a prototype
for problems we will solve later one. Treating it here will ease things
for us later.


======I understand, please go on.======

Consider a Brownian particle moving under the following potential:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The equation of motion for this particle is given by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t')}{dt'}=-\frac{k}{\zeta}x(t')+g(t')&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In order to get a formal solution for &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; we multiply both sides
by $e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}$and do some algebra:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dx(t')}{dt'}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}+\frac{k}{\zeta}x(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}=\frac{d}{dt'}\left[x(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}\right]=g(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We now integrate from $-\infty$ to $t$ and get: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[x(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}\right]_{t'=-\infty}^{t'=t}=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}g(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}dt'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Assuming the following boundary condition: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t'=-\infty)\cdot e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}\cdot\infty}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We conclude that:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}g(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'-t\right)}dt'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
It is also possible to solve under the initial condition &lt;math&gt;x(t=0)=x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;,
in that case:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[x(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}\right]_{t'=0}^{t'=t}=\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}g(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t'}dt'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we have &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
x(t)=x_{0}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}t}+\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}g(t')e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'-t\right)}dt'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



\subsubsection{O.K, but &lt;math&gt;g(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable and hence &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is also one
that doesn't tell me much... Can we calculate some moments? Start
with the case of the particle that has been with us since &lt;math&gt;t=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.}

First we note that for the mean position we have: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A(t)=&lt;x(t)&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}&lt;g(t')&gt;e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'-t\right)}dt'=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the mean position is hence zero. We now aim at finding an expression
for the mean square displacement from the origin &lt;math&gt;&lt;(x(t)-x(0))^{2}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;,
the variance of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be calculated as a by product. We start
with the time correlation function of $x(t)$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}dt_{1}\overset{0}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}dt_{2}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t_{1}+t_{2}-t\right)}&lt;g(t_{1})g(t_{2})&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Recalling that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;g(t)g(t')&gt;=2D\delta(t-t')=\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}\delta(t-t')&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we get:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;=\overset{0}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}dt_{1}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t_{1}-t\right)}\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}=\left[e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t_{1}-t\right)}\frac{k_{B}T}{k}\right]_{t_{1}=-\infty}^{t_{1}=0}=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here we assumed that &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and used the fact that &lt;math&gt;&lt;g(t_{1}&gt;0)g(t_{2})&gt;\equiv0&lt;/math&gt;
since $t_{2}&lt;0$. Similarly if $t&lt;0$ we get:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}dt_{1}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t_{1}-t\right)}\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}=\left[e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t_{1}-t\right)}\frac{k_{B}T}{k}\right]_{t_{1}=-\infty}^{t_{1}=t}=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We may hence conclude that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}\left|t\right|}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Letting $t=0$ we get &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;x(0)x(0)&gt;=&lt;x^{2}&gt;=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which coincides with the known result obtained from statistical mechanics
with the use of the Boltzmann distribution &lt;math&gt;\psi_{eq}\propto exp(-kx^{2}/2k_{B}T)&lt;/math&gt;.
We will now show that this is also the variance: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=&lt;(x(t)-A(t))^{2}&gt;=&lt;x(t)x(t)&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}&lt;g(t')g(t&quot;)&gt;e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'+t&quot;-2t\right)}dt'dt&quot;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and hence: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t'-2t\right)}dt'=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 The mean square displacement &lt;math&gt;&lt;(x(t)-x(0))^{2}&gt;&lt;/math&gt; can now be easily
calculated:{\scriptsize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;(x(t)-x(0))^{2}&gt;=&lt;x(t)^{2}&gt;+&lt;x(0)^{2}&gt;-2&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;=2\left[&lt;x(t)^{2}&gt;-&lt;x(t)x(0)&gt;\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}and hence:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;(x(t)-x(0))^{2}&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T}{k}\left[1-e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}\left|t\right|}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, unlike the case of free diffusion, for long times the mean square
displacement is bounded by &lt;math&gt;\frac{2k_{B}T}{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The bound is approached
exponentially fast with a characteristic relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau=\frac{\zeta}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.
Considering the opposite limit &lt;math&gt;\left|t\right|\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt; (very
short times) we have (to first order):&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;(x(t)-x(0))^{2}&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T}{k}\left[1-1+\frac{k}{\zeta}\left|t\right|\right]=2D\left|t\right|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Indeed in this limit the particle has yet to {}&quot;feel&quot; the harmonic
potential and we expect regular diffusion.


\subsubsection{I think that since &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear sum of Gaussian random variables
and hence Gaussian itself, we can also write an expression for the
it probability distribution. Am I right?}
Yes you are! We already found the mean and variance and hence the
probability distribution for $x(t)$ is:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi B}}exp\left[-\frac{\left(x-A\right)^{2}}{2B}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{2\pi k_{B}T}{k}}}exp\left[-\frac{kx^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which is exactly the Boltzmann distribution. We could have guessed
that this will be so since we have given the particle an infinite
amount of time to equilibrate with the potential well.
====Let's proceed to the case of the particle that started at &lt;math&gt;x_{0====&lt;/math&gt;! }

First we note that for the mean position we have: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
A(t)=&lt;x(t)&gt;=x_{0}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}t}+\overset{t}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}&lt;g(t')&gt;e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'-t\right)}dt'=x_{0}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
the mean position depends on time and exponentially decays towards
zero. For the variance we have: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=&lt;(x(t)-A(t))^{2}&gt;=\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}&lt;g(t')g(t&quot;)&gt;e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(t'+t&quot;-2t\right)}dt'dt&quot;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and hence: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
B=\overset{t}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}e^{\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(2t'-2t\right)}dt'=\frac{k_{B}T}{k}\left[1-e^{-\frac{2k}{\zeta}t}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here again the variance exponentially decays towards the equilibrium
variance. The probability distribution is Gaussian again and we have:
{\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi B}}exp\left[-\frac{\left(x-A\right)^{2}}{2B}\right]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{2\pi k_{B}T}{k}\left[1-e^{-\frac{2k}{\zeta}t}\right]}}exp\left[-\frac{k(x-x_{0}e^{-\frac{k}{\zeta}t})^{2}}{2k_{B}T\left[1-e^{-\frac{2k}{\zeta}t}\right]}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}which for short times &lt;math&gt;t\ll\tau=\frac{\zeta}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as
free diffusion:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}}exp\left[-\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{4Dt}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and for long times gives the Boltzmann distribution: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{2\pi k_{B}T}{k}}}exp\left[-\frac{kx^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====The Bead-Spring (Rouse) Model for Polymer Dynamics====
=====Give me the simplest model for polymer dynamics!=====
A polymer is a chain of monomers linked to one another by covalent
bonds. It is natural to represent a polymer by a set of beads connected
to one another by springs. The dynamics of the polymer is modeled
by the Brownian motion of these beads. Such a model was first proposed
by Rouse in the fifties of the the twentieth century and has been
the basis of the dynamics of polymers in dilute solutions. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{\string&quot;26-07-2009 16-17-49\string&quot;.eps}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{A pictorial description of the Rouse model.}
\end{figure}
======But now the the beads are connected! how do we take that into account?======
Let &lt;math&gt;\{\vec{R}_{1},..,\vec{R}_{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; be the positions of the beads,
if we assume the beads experience a drag force proportional to their
velocity as they move through the solvent, then for each bead we can
write the following Langevin equation:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{1}{\zeta_{n}}\frac{\partial U}{\partial\vec{R}_{n}}+\vec{g}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the friction coefficient of the &lt;math&gt;n-th&lt;/math&gt; bead
and from now on we will assume that the beads are all alike and hence
&lt;math&gt;\zeta=\zeta_{n}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The random force &lt;math&gt;\vec{g}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
is Gaussian with the following characteristics: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha n}(t)&gt;=0 &amp; \forall n,\forall\alpha=x,y,z

&lt;g_{\alpha n}(t)g_{\beta m}(t')&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T}{\zeta}\delta_{nm}\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t') &amp; \forall n,m\,,\forall\alpha,\beta=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
i.e the random forces acting on different beads and/or in perpendicular
directions and/or in different times are independent. 


======And the potential &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;? Harmonic as always?======
Indeed, having harmonic springs connecting the beads, we will take
it as:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
U=\frac{k}{2}\overset{N}{\underset{n=2}{\sum}}\left(\vec{R}_{n}(t)-\vec{R}_{n-1}(t)\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In this model the Langevin equation becomes a linear equation for
$\vec{R}_{n}(t)$, for the internal beads we have:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(\vec{R}_{n+1}(t)+\vec{R}_{n-1}(t)-2\vec{R}_{n}(t)\right)+\vec{g}_{n}(t) &amp; \,\,\, n=2,...,N-1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and for the beads at each end we have:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(\vec{R}_{2}(t)-\vec{R}_{1}(t)\right)+\vec{g}_{1}(t) &amp; \,\,\, n=1

\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(\vec{R}_{N-1}(t)-\vec{R}_{N}(t)\right)+\vec{g}_{N}(t) &amp; \,\,\, n=N\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In order to unify the treatment we define two additional hypothetical
beads $\vec{R}_{0}$ and $\vec{R}_{N+1}$ as:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\vec{R}_{0}\equiv\vec{R}_{1}

\vec{R}_{N+1}\equiv\vec{R}_{N}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
under this definition the Langevin equation for beads &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,...,N&lt;/math&gt;
is given by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=\frac{k}{\zeta}\left(\vec{R}_{n+1}(t)+\vec{R}_{n-1}(t)-2\vec{R}_{n}(t)\right)+\vec{g}_{n}(t) &amp; \,\,\, n=1,...,N\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



======How do we proceed?======

In order to proceed it is convenient to assume that the beads are
continuously distributed along the polymer chain. We first recall
that in the continuum limit: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{R}_{n+1}(t)+\vec{R}_{n-1}(t)-2\vec{R}_{n}(t)\,\,\longrightarrow\,\,\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Letting &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous variable, and writing &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
as $\vec{R}(n,t)$ the Langevin equation takes the form: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}=\frac{k}{\zeta}\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n^{2}}+\vec{g}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The definitions we made regarding the additional hypothetical beads
&lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{N+1}&lt;/math&gt; now turn into the following boundary
conditions:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n}|_{n=0}=0

\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n}|_{n=N}=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



\subsubsection{I don't know how to solve this one, can we bring it to a form of
something we have solved before? }

Yes we can, as a first step we define normal coordinates by the following
transformation: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\vec{X}_{p}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{R}(n,t)dn &amp; \,\,\, p=0,1,2,...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
whose inverse is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{R}(n,t)=\vec{X}_{0}(t)+2\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=1}{\sum}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



\subsubsection{Defining new coordinates (call them as you will) is one thing but
the inverse must be defined such that it takes you back to the original
coordinates! Is this truly the correct inverse? }

We verify this by direct substitution: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{X}_{p}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\left[\vec{X}_{0}(t)+2\overset{\infty}{\underset{p'=1}{\sum}}cos\left(\frac{p'\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{X}_{p'}(t)\right]dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first term gives: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{X}_{0}(t)\delta_{p,0}=\begin{cases}
\frac{\vec{X}_{0}(t)}{p\pi}sin\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)|_{n=0}^{n=N}=0 &amp; \,\,\, p=1,2,3,..

\vec{X}_{0}(t) &amp; \,\,\, p=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Using the trigonometric identity:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
cos(A)cos(B)=\frac{1}{2}\left[cos(A-B)+cos(A+B)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
the second term is written as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{N}\overset{\infty}{\underset{p'=1}{\sum}}\vec{X}_{p'}(t)\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\left[cos\left(\frac{(p+p')\pi n}{N}\right)+cos\left(\frac{(p-p')\pi n}{N}\right)\right]dn &amp; \,\,\, p=1,2,3,..

\overset{\infty}{\underset{p'=1}{\sum}}\frac{2\vec{X}_{p'}(t)}{p'\pi}sin\left(\frac{p'\pi n}{N}\right)|_{n=0}^{n=N}=0 &amp; \,\,\, p=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which gives: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{X}_{p}(t)(1-\delta_{p,0})=\begin{cases}
\overset{\infty}{\underset{p'=1}{\sum}}\vec{X}_{p'}(t)\delta_{p,p'}=\vec{X}_{p} &amp; \,\,\, p=1,2,3,..

0 &amp; \,\,\, p=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We conclude that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{X}_{p}(t)=\vec{X}_{0}(t)\delta_{p,0}+\vec{X}_{p}(t)(1-\delta_{p,0})=\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which proves that the inverse transformation is defined correctly.


======How does this new set of coordinates help us? ======

We will now show that the equations of motion for the normal coordinates
&lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt; are the equations of motion for an infinite set
of uncoupled Brownian harmonic oscillators. Since we have already
treated the problem of a Brownian harmonic oscillator, this will ease
our lives considerably. We start by applying &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)dn&lt;/math&gt;
to both side of the Langevin equation for $\vec{R}(n,t)$: {\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}dn=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{k}{\zeta}\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n^{2}}dn+\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{g}(n,t)dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}The left hand side term is identified as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}dn=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{R}(n,t)dn\right]=\frac{d\vec{X}_{p}(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first term on the right hand side gives: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)}{N}\frac{k}{\zeta}\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n}|_{n=0}^{n=N}+\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{p\pi}{N^{2}}sin\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{k}{\zeta}\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n}dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
by integration by parts. Invoking the boundary condition for &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial n}&lt;/math&gt;
the first term drops, another round of integration by parts gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{p\pi}{N^{2}}sin\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{k}{\zeta}\vec{R}(n,t)|_{n=0}^{n=N}-\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{\left(p\pi\right)^{2}}{N^{3}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{k}{\zeta}\vec{R}(n,t)dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here the sine kills the first term and the second term is identified
as:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{p^{2}\pi^{2}k\vec{X}_{p}(t)}{N^{2}\zeta}=-\frac{k_{p}}{\zeta_{p}}\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have defined: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
k_{p}=\frac{2p^{2}\pi^{2}k}{N} &amp; \,\,\, p=0,1,2,3...

\zeta_{0}=N\zeta &amp; \,\,\, p=0

\zeta_{p}=2N\zeta &amp; \,\,\, p=1,2,3...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We are left with the second term on the right hand side of the original
equation which we deal with by defining the random forces:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\vec{g}_{p}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{g}(n,t)dn &amp; \,\,\, p=0,1,2,3...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Which are characterized by zero mean:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)&gt;=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)&gt;dn=0 &amp; \forall p\,,\forall\alpha=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
And by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta_{pp'}\delta(t-t')}{\zeta_{p}} &amp; \forall p,p'\,,\forall\alpha,\beta=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
since: {\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{p'\pi n'}{N}\right)&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)g_{\beta}(n',t')&gt;dndn'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}and use of the trigonometric identity: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
cos(A)cos(B)=\frac{1}{2}\left[cos(A-B)+cos(A+B)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
gives: {\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=\frac{k_{B}T\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t')}{\zeta N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\left[cos\left(\frac{(p+p')\pi n}{N}\right)+cos\left(\frac{(p-p')\pi n}{N}\right)\right]dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}which yields the result after preforming the integration. This means
that the random forces with different values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and/or acting
in perpendicular directions and/or acting in different times are independent.
The equations of motion for the normal coordinates &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
are given by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\vec{X}_{p}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{k_{p}}{\zeta_{p}}\vec{X}_{p}(t)+\vec{g}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and since the random forces are independent of each other, the motions
of the &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}&lt;/math&gt;'s are also independent of each other. These
are the equations of motion for an infinite set of uncoupled Brownian
harmonic oscillators, each with a force constant &lt;math&gt;k_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and friction
constant &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{p}&lt;/math&gt; of its own. We have gone from one partial differential
equation (which we don't know how to solve directly) for &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt;
to an infinite set of uncoupled ordinary differential equations (from
a type we are already familiar with) for the normal coordinates &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.


=====Great, we can now do some analysis! =====


======What can we say about the motion of the center of mass? ======

Using the results of section 3 we will now calculate two time correlation
function that will help us in the near future. We first note that
since &lt;math&gt;k_{0}=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is actually preforming free diffusion
and hence:{\tiny &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;(X_{0}(t)-X_{0}(0))_{\alpha}(X_{0}(t)-X_{0}(0))_{\beta}&gt;=&lt;(X_{0}(t)-&lt;X_{0}(t)&gt;)_{\alpha}(X_{0}(t)-&lt;X_{0}(t)&gt;)_{\beta}&gt;=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\frac{2k_{B}T}{N\zeta}t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}On the other hand, the time correlation function for &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
($p&gt;0)$ is the one for a Brownian harmonic oscillator and hence:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;X_{p\alpha}(t)X_{p'\beta}(0)&gt;=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta_{pp'}\frac{k_{B}T}{k_{p}}e^{-t/\tau_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the relaxation time $\tau_{p}$ is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{p}=\frac{\zeta_{p}}{k_{p}}=\frac{N^{2}\zeta}{p^{2}\pi^{2}k}=\frac{\tau_{1}}{p^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
A conclusion from the previous result is that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\left(X_{p\alpha}(t)-X_{p'\beta}(0)\right)^{2}&gt;=\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta_{pp'}\frac{2k_{B}T}{k_{p}}\left[1-e^{-t/\tau_{p}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


We are now ready to calculate some real features of the Brownian motion
of a polymer. We start with the motion of the center of mass, the
position of the center of mass: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{R}_{cm}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\vec{R}(n,t)dn\equiv\vec{X}_{0}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
is the same as the normal coordinate &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{0}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The mean square
displacement of the center of mass is hence given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;(\vec{R}_{cm}(t)-\vec{R}_{cm}(0))^{2}&gt;=3&lt;(X_{0}(t)-X_{0}(0))_{\alpha}^{2}&gt;=\frac{6k_{B}T}{N\zeta}t\equiv6D_{G}t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the diffusion constant $D_{G}$ is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
D_{G}=\frac{k_{B}T}{N\zeta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we note that it is inversely proportional to the number of monomers.
====What can we say about rotational motion?====
To characterize rotational motion of the polymer molecule as a whole,
let us consider the time correlation function &lt;math&gt;&lt;\vec{P}(t)\cdot\vec{P}(0)&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
of the end to end vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;. Using normal coordinates, &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
can be written as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{P}(t)\equiv\vec{R}(N,t)-\vec{R}(0,t)=2\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=1}{\sum}}\left[cos\left(p\pi\right)-1\right]\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which results in:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{P}(t)\equiv-4\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers}{\sum}}\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We therefore conclude that:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\vec{P}(t)\cdot\vec{P}(0)&gt;=16\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers}{\sum}}&lt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)\cdot\vec{X}_{p}(0)&gt;=16\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers}{\sum}}\frac{3k_{B}T}{k_{p}}e^{-t/\tau_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This time correlation function is a summation over many terms with
different relaxation times. We will now see that for large enough
times this infinite sum is well approximated by the first term. We
rewrite the correlation function as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\vec{P}(t)\cdot\vec{P}(0)&gt;=\frac{24Nk_{B}T}{\pi^{2}k}e^{-t/\tau_{1}}\left[1+\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers&gt;1}{\sum}}\frac{1}{p^{2}}e^{-t\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{p}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
but since: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{p}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]\geq\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{3}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we have:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
e^{-t\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{p}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]}\leq e^{-t\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{3}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We also know that: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers&gt;1}{\sum}}\frac{1}{p^{2}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{8}-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and hence the second term in the parentheses is bounded by an exponentially
decaying function and moreover it is never larger than $1/4$: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{}{\underset{p:odd\,\, integers&gt;1}{\sum}}\frac{1}{p^{2}}e^{-t\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{p}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]}\leq\left[\frac{\pi^{2}}{8}-1\right]e^{-t\left[\frac{1}{\tau_{3}}-\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}\right]}&lt;\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We conclude that the second term may be neglected for large times
and the correlation function is approximated to be: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\vec{P}(t)\cdot\vec{P}(0)&gt;\cong\frac{24Nk_{B}T}{\pi^{2}k}e^{-t/\tau_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which decays exponentially with a single relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The relaxation time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is called the rotational relaxation
time, it is also denoted $\tau_{r}$ and is given by:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{r}=\frac{N^{2}\zeta}{\pi^{2}k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
====What can we say about the motion of one specific bead?====
We now turn to study the internal motion of a polymer chain focusing
on the mean square displacement of the $n-th$ monomer: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)\equiv&lt;\left[\vec{R}(n,t)-\vec{R}(n,0)\right]^{2}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Direct substitution for &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}(n,0)&lt;/math&gt; gives:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)=&lt;\left[\vec{X}_{0}(t)-\vec{X}_{0}(0)+2\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=1}{\sum}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\left(\vec{X}_{p}(t)-\vec{X}_{p}(0)\right)\right]^{2}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
utilizing the correlation functions we have obtained above all the
cross terms vanish and we are left with: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)=6D_{G}t\,+\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=1}{\sum}}\frac{24k_{B}T}{k_{p}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)^{2}\left[1-e^{-tp^{2}/\tau_{r}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Let us examine this expression in two limits, for &lt;math&gt;t\gg\tau_{r}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)\simeq6D_{G}t\,+\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=1}{\sum}}\frac{12k_{B}T}{p^{2}\pi^{2}k}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The second term is a constant that doesn't depend on time (it is easily
seen that the infinite sum converges) and hence &lt;math&gt;\phi(n,t)&lt;/math&gt; is linear
in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in this limit. For large enough times the displacement of
the &lt;math&gt;n-th&lt;/math&gt; monomer is determined by the diffusion constant of the
center of mass as the monomer drifts away with the polymer as a whole.
On the other hand, for &lt;math&gt;t\ll\tau_{r}&lt;/math&gt;, the motion of the segments
reflects the internal motion due to the many modes of vibration. In
this limit we may approximate by replacing summation with integration
and &lt;math&gt;cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt; by its average value &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)=\frac{6k_{B}T}{N\zeta}t\,+\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=0}{\int}}\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{p^{2}\pi^{2}k}\left[1-e^{-tp^{2}/\tau_{r}}\right]dp=\frac{6k_{B}T}{N\zeta}t+I&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Doing the integral by parts we get: {\tiny &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
I=\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=0}{\int}}\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{\pi^{2}k}\left[e^{-tp^{2}/\tau_{r}}-1\right]d\frac{1}{p}=\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{p\pi^{2}k}\left[e^{-tp^{2}/\tau_{r}}-1\right]|_{0}^{\infty}+\overset{\infty}{\underset{p=0}{\int}}\frac{12tNk_{B}T}{\tau_{r}\pi^{2}k}e^{-tp^{2}/\tau_{r}}dp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}The first term vanishes (basic calculus) and the second term is transformed
into a Gaussian integral which gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
I=\frac{6tNk_{B}T}{\tau_{r}\pi^{2}k}\sqrt{\frac{\pi\tau_{r}}{t}}=\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{\sqrt{\tau_{r}}\pi^{3/2}k}\sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We can now write the $\phi(n,t)$ as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)=\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{\pi^{2}k}\left[\frac{t}{\tau_{r}}+\sqrt{\frac{\pi t}{\tau_{r}}}\right]\underset{t\ll\tau_{r}}{\simeq}\frac{6Nk_{B}T}{\pi^{3/2}k}\sqrt{\frac{t}{\tau_{r}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and observe that in this limit the mean square displacement of the
&lt;math&gt;n-th&lt;/math&gt; monomer increases like &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e in a sub-diffusive
manner. 
=====How does the Rouse model stand in comparison to experimental results? =====
Unfortunately not as good as one might have hoped. The Rouse model
may seem to be a very natural way to describe the Brownian motion
of a polymer chain, but unfortunately the conclusions drawn from it
do not agree with the experimental results. As we saw above, for the
Rouse model: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\tau_{r}=\frac{N^{2}\zeta}{p^{2}\pi^{2}k}\propto N^{2}\propto M^{2}

D_{G}=\frac{6kT}{N\zeta}\propto\frac{1}{N}\propto\frac{1}{M}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight of the polymer. Experimentally
however, the following dependencies were measured: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\tau_{r}\propto M^{3\nu}

D_{G}\propto M^{-\nu}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, the exponent &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is that which is used to express the dependence
of the radius of gyration &lt;math&gt;R_{G}&lt;/math&gt; on molecular weight ():
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
R_{G}\propto M^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The value of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the nature of the interaction
between the solvent and the polymer, in a good solvent &lt;math&gt;\nu\simeq\frac{3}{5}&lt;/math&gt;
and in the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; state &lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ().

The reason for the discrepancy between experiments and the Rouse model
is that in the latter we have assumed the average velocity of a particular
bead is determined only by the external force acting on it, and is
independent of the motion of the other beads. However, in reality
the motion of one bead is influenced by the motion of the surrounding
beads through the medium of the solvent. For example, if one bead
moves the solvent surrounding it will also move, and as a result other
beads will be dragged along. This type of interaction transmitted
by the motion of the solvent is called hydrodynamic interaction. We
will discuss a model taking this interaction into account in the next
section.

\caption{The hydrodynamic interaction. If bead &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; moves under the action
of the force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, a flow is created in the surrounding
fluid, which causes the other beads to move.}

\newpage{}
====The Zimm Model for Polymer Dynamics====
\subsection{So we need a model that will take into account hydrodynamics interactions,
but how do we do that?}
In the Rouse model we have assumed the average velocity of a particular
bead is determined only by the external force acting on it, and is
independent of the motion of the other beads. This assumption led
to the following Langevin equation:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\vec{v}_{n}(t)=\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{1}{\zeta_{n}}\frac{\partial U}{\partial\vec{R}_{n}}+\vec{g}_{n}(t)=\frac{\vec{F}_{n}}{\zeta_{n}}+\vec{g}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In order to take into account hydrodynamic interaction we can generalize
this assumption. Denoting the forces acting on the beads by &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{n}(n=1,2,..)&lt;/math&gt;
, we assume that there is a linear relationship between these forces
and the average velocity &lt;math&gt;&lt;\vec{v}_{n}(t)&gt;&lt;/math&gt; and so the following
holds: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\vec{v}_{n}(t)&gt;=\overset{}{\underset{m}{\sum}}H_{nm}\cdot\vec{F}_{m}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt; matrix, the &lt;math&gt;nm&lt;/math&gt; component of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.
It is now our task to calculate &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; and write the appropriate
Langevin equation. This can be done using hydrodynamics and some approximations (),
the result of the calculation gives: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
H_{nm}=\begin{cases}
I/\zeta &amp; \,\,\, n=m

\frac{[\hat{r}_{nm}\hat{r}_{nm}+I]}{8\pi\eta\left\Vert \vec{r}_{nm}\right\Vert } &amp; \,\,\, n\neq m\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity of the liquid, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;3\times3&lt;/math&gt;
identity matrix, &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{nm}\equiv\vec{R}_{n}-\vec{R}_{m}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;.
The appropriate Langevin equation is given by (taking the same potential
$U$ as in the Rouse model): &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\vec{R}_{n}(t)}{dt}=k\overset{}{\underset{m}{\sum}}H_{nm}\cdot(\vec{R}_{m+1}(t)+\vec{R}_{m-1}(t)-2\vec{R}_{m}(t))+\vec{g}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and the random force &lt;math&gt;\vec{g}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is Gaussian with the following
characteristics: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha n}(t)&gt;=0 &amp; \forall n,\forall\alpha=x,y,z

&lt;g_{\alpha n}(t)g_{\beta m}(t')&gt;=2k_{B}T\left(H_{nm}\right)_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t') &amp; \forall n,m\,,\forall\alpha,\beta=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
\subsubsection{The Langevin equation we got seems complicated, it is not even linear
in &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt;! I guess there is an approximation coming my
way, am I right? }

Since &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt; the Langevin equation
we got is not linear in &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_{n}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and hence tremendously hard
to solve. Zimm's idea was to replace &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; (the factor that is
causing the non-linearity) by its equilibrium average value &lt;math&gt;&lt;H_{nm}&gt;_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;,
this is called the preaveraging approximation. In general the equilibrium
value of &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the interactions between the solvent
and the polymer and hence will have a different value in a good/medium/bad
solvents. Here we will concentrate on a special state of a polymer
in solution, this state was also mentioned earlier and is called the
&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; state (). For a polymer in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;
conditions, the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by a Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and a variance of &lt;math&gt;|n-m|b^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Here
&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between two adjacent monomers and it follows
that the probability density function for $\vec{r}_{nm}$ is: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P(\vec{r}_{nm})=\left(\frac{3}{2\pi|n-m|b^{2}}\right)^{3/2}exp\left(-\frac{3\left\Vert \vec{r}_{nm}\right\Vert ^{2}}{2|n-m|b^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;H_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; is a function only of &lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_{nm}&lt;/math&gt; we can calculate
$&lt;H_{nm}&gt;_{eq}$ (for $n\neq m$) as follows:{\scriptsize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;H_{nm}&gt;_{eq}=\int d^{3}\vec{r}P(\vec{r})H_{nm}=\int d\vec{r}\left(\frac{3}{2\pi|n-m|b^{2}}\right)^{3/2}exp\left(-\frac{3r^{2}}{2|n-m|b^{2}}\right)\frac{[\hat{r}\hat{r}+I]}{8\pi\eta r}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}Noting that in spherical coordinates: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\hat{r}\hat{r}=\left[\begin{matrix}{ccc}
sin^{2}\theta cos^{2}\phi &amp; sin^{2}\theta cos\phi sin\phi &amp; cos\theta sin\theta cos\phi

sin^{2}\theta cos\phi sin\phi &amp; sin^{2}\theta sin^{2}\phi &amp; cos\theta sin\theta sin\phi

cos\theta sin\theta cos\phi &amp; cos\theta sin\theta sin\phi &amp; cos^{2}\theta\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We have:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\pi}{\underset{0}{\int}}sin\theta d\theta\overset{2\pi}{\underset{0}{\int}}d\phi\hat{r}\hat{r}=\left[\begin{matrix}{ccc}
\frac{4\pi}{3} &amp; 0 &amp; 0

0 &amp; \frac{4\pi}{3} &amp; 0

0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{4\pi}{3}\end{array}\right]=\frac{4\pi}{3}I&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and hence:{\scriptsize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;H_{nm}&gt;_{eq}=\int d^{3}\vec{r}P(\vec{r})H_{nm}=\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}4\pi r^{2}dr\left(\frac{3}{2\pi|n-m|b^{2}}\right)^{3/2}exp\left(-\frac{3r^{2}}{2|n-m|b^{2}}\right)\frac{\frac{4}{3}I}{8\pi\eta r}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}The integral is calculated in a straight forward way, defining &lt;math&gt;t=r^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
we have:{\scriptsize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{I}{3\eta}\left(\frac{3}{2\pi|n-m|b^{2}}\right)^{3/2}exp\left(-\frac{3t}{2|n-m|b^{2}}\right)dt=\frac{I}{3\eta}\left(\frac{3}{2\pi|n-m|b^{2}}\right)^{3/2}\frac{2|n-m|b^{2}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}and hence: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;H_{nm}&gt;_{eq}=h(n-m)I&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have defined:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h(n-m)\equiv\frac{1}{\eta b}\left(\frac{1}{6\pi^{3}|n-m|}\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Substituting this result into our Langevin equation and re-writing
it in the continuum limit we get:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}=k\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dmh(n-m)\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{R}(m,t)}{\partial^{2}m}+\vec{g}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the random force &lt;math&gt;\vec{g}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt; is Gaussian with the following
characteristics:{\small &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)&gt;=0 &amp; \forall n,\forall\alpha=x,y,z

&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)g_{\beta}(m,t')&gt;=2k_{B}Th(n-m)\delta(t-t') &amp; \forall n,m\,,\forall\alpha,\beta=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}Note that &lt;math&gt;h(n-m)&lt;/math&gt; depend only on &lt;math&gt;|n-m|&lt;/math&gt; and we have indeed linearized
our equation as promised.
======Seems familiar, shall we try normal coordinates again?======
Yes, we will one again use the normal coordinates defined for the
Rouse model. We start by applying &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)dn&lt;/math&gt;
to both side of the Langevin equation for $\vec{R}(n,t)$:{\tiny &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}dn=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\left[k\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dmh(n-m)\frac{\partial^{2}\vec{R}(m,t)}{\partial^{2}m}\right]dn+\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{g}(n,t)dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}The left hand side term is identified as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{\partial\vec{R}(n,t)}{\partial t}dn=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{R}(n,t)dn\right]=\frac{d\vec{X}_{p}(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first term on the right hand side gives: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\left[k\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dmh(n-m)\frac{\partial^{2}\left[\vec{X}_{0}(t)+2\overset{\infty}{\underset{q=1}{\sum}}cos\left(\frac{q\pi m}{N}\right)\vec{X}_{q}(t)\right]}{\partial^{2}m}\right]dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which yields: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\left[-2k\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dmh(n-m)\overset{\infty}{\underset{q=1}{\sum}}\left(\frac{q\pi}{N}\right)^{^{2}}cos\left(\frac{q\pi m}{N}\right)\vec{X}_{q}(t)\right]dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and with some additional algebra we get: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\overset{\infty}{\underset{q=1}{\sum}}\frac{2kq^{2}\pi^{2}}{N}\vec{X}_{q}(t)\left[\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{q\pi m}{N}\right)h(n-m)dmdn\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Defining: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
k_{q}=\frac{2q^{2}\pi^{2}k}{N} &amp; \,\,\, q=0,1,2,3...

h_{pq}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{q\pi m}{N}\right)h(n-m)dmdn &amp; \,\,\, p,q=0,1,2,3...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
this term can be written as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\overset{\infty}{\underset{q=1}{\sum}}h_{pq}k_{q}\vec{X}_{q}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



======But this doesn't decouple the equations! another approximation?======

Indeed, we will approximate by neglecting all the off diagonal terms.
The reasoning goes as follows, we first note that setting &lt;math&gt;m-n=l&lt;/math&gt;
and noting that $h(n-m)=h(m-n)$ we can write $h_{pq}$ as: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{pq}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dn\overset{N-n}{\underset{-n}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{q\pi(n+l)}{N}\right)h(l)dl&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
we now use a trigonometric identity:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
cos(A+B)=cos(A)cos(B)-sin(A)sin(B)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
to get:{\tiny &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{pq}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}dn\left[cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{q\pi n}{N}\right)\overset{N-n}{\underset{-n}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{q\pi l}{N}\right)h(l)dl\,-cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)sin\left(\frac{q\pi n}{N}\right)\overset{N-n}{\underset{-n}{\int}}sin\left(\frac{q\pi l}{N}\right)h(l)dl\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}For large &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, the two inner integrals rapidly approach the following
integrals:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\overset{\infty}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{q\pi l}{N}\right)h(l)dl=\frac{\sqrt{N}}{\sqrt{3\pi^{3}q}\eta b}

\overset{\infty}{\underset{-\infty}{\int}}sin\left(\frac{q\pi l}{N}\right)h(l)dl=0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
With this substitution $h_{pq}$ becomes:\underbar{ }&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{pq}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{q\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{\sqrt{N}}{\sqrt{3\pi^{3}q}\eta b}dn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and after using the trigonometric identity: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
cos(A)cos(B)=\frac{1}{2}\left[cos(A-B)+cos(A+B)\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
{\small &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
h_{pq}=\frac{1}{2N^{3/2}\sqrt{3\pi^{3}q}\eta b}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{\pi n(p-q)}{N}\right)+cos\left(\frac{\pi n(p+q)}{N}\right)dn=\frac{\delta_{pq}}{\sqrt{12N\pi^{3}p}\eta b} &amp; p&gt;0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}If &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is small our approximation is still fair but for the case
&lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; it is invalid and this case deserves special attention. The
careful reader may have noticed that the sum:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
-\overset{\infty}{\underset{q=1}{\sum}}h_{pq}k_{q}\vec{X}_{q}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
starts from &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt; and it may seem that a discussion regarding &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt;
is pointless. We will nevertheless require this case (&lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt;) later
on and so we calculate directly{\small : }&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{p0}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)dn\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{1}{\eta b}\left(\frac{1}{6\pi^{3}|n-m|}\right)^{1/2}dm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The inner integral gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{n}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{1}{\eta b}\left(\frac{1}{6\pi^{3}(n-m)}\right)^{1/2}dm+\overset{N}{\underset{n}{\int}}\frac{1}{\eta b}\left(\frac{1}{6\pi^{3}(m-n)}\right)^{1/2}dm&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
which results in:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{-2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{n-m}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}|_{0}^{n}+\frac{2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{m-n}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}|_{n}^{N}=\frac{2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{n}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}+\frac{2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{N-n}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Substituting this into the expression for $h_{p0}$ gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{p0}=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\frac{2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{n}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}dn+\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(p\pi-\frac{p\pi t}{N}\right)\frac{2}{\eta b}\left(\frac{t}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have changed variables to &lt;math&gt;t=N-n&lt;/math&gt;. It is now easy to see
that for odd $p$: $h_{p0}=0$, while for even $p$ we get: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{p0}=\frac{4}{\eta bN^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{6\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\sqrt{n}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)dn\,\,\,\, for\,\, even\,\, p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For $p=0$ this gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
h_{00}=\frac{8}{3\eta b}\left(\frac{1}{6N\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
while for even &lt;math&gt;p&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the integral may be re-expressed in terms of
the Fresnel integral &lt;math&gt;S(x)=\overset{x}{\underset{0}{\int}}sin^{2}(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;
to give: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\sqrt{n}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)=\frac{-\sqrt{2}N^{3/2}}{2\pi p^{3/2}}S(\sqrt{2p})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and we see that:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\left|\frac{-\sqrt{2}N^{3/2}}{2\pi p^{3/2}}S(\sqrt{2p})\right|\leq\frac{N^{3/2}}{\pi p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
concluding that for $p&gt;0$:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\left|h_{p0}\right|\leq\frac{4}{\eta b\pi p}\left(\frac{1}{6N\pi^{3}}\right)^{1/2} &amp; even\,\, p&gt;0

h_{p0}=0 &amp; odd\,\, p&gt;0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
We see that for large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h_{p0}&lt;/math&gt; is small and also decays with
&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. We will hence neglect &lt;math&gt;h_{p0}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and keep only the
diagonal term &lt;math&gt;h_{00}&lt;/math&gt;. 


======O.K, what about the random forces?======

We are left with the second term on the right hand side of the original
equation which we deal with by defining the random forces:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\vec{g}_{p}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)\vec{g}(n,t)dn &amp; \,\,\, p=0,1,2,3...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Which are characterized by zero mean:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)&gt;=\frac{1}{N}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)&gt;dn=0 &amp; \forall p\,,\forall\alpha=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
And by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=2k_{B}T\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t')h_{pp'} &amp; \forall p,p'\,,\forall\alpha,\beta=x,y,z\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
since: {\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=\frac{1}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{p'\pi n'}{N}\right)&lt;g_{\alpha}(n,t)g_{\beta}(n',t')&gt;dndn'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}gives: {\footnotesize &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;g_{\alpha p}(t)g_{\beta p'}(t')&gt;=\frac{2k_{B}T\delta_{\alpha\beta}\delta(t-t')}{N^{2}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}\overset{N}{\underset{0}{\int}}cos\left(\frac{p\pi n}{N}\right)cos\left(\frac{p'\pi n'}{N}\right)h(n-n')dndn'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
}which yields the result by definition of &lt;math&gt;h_{pp'}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that
the random forces with different values of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (remember &lt;math&gt;h_{pp'}\propto\delta_{pp'}&lt;/math&gt;)
and/or acting in perpendicular directions and/or acting in different
times are independent.


======That was a bit long, could you please sum up the main result?======

The main result is that we have found the equations of motion for
the normal coordinates &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and that they are given by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\vec{X}_{p}(t)}{dt}=-\frac{k_{p}}{\zeta_{p}}\vec{X}_{p}(t)+\vec{g}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
with &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
k_{p}=\frac{2p^{2}\pi^{2}k}{N} &amp; \,\,\, p=0,1,2,3...

\zeta_{0}=1/h_{00}=\frac{3\eta b}{8}\left(6N\pi^{3}\right)^{1/2} &amp; \,\,\, p=0

\zeta_{p}=1/h_{pp}=\sqrt{12N\pi^{3}p}\eta b &amp; \,\,\, p=1,2,3...\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and since the random forces are independent of each other, the motions
of the &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}&lt;/math&gt;'s are also independent of each other. These
are the equations of motion for an infinite set of uncoupled Brownian
harmonic oscillators, each with a force constant &lt;math&gt;k_{p}&lt;/math&gt; and friction
coefficient &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{p}&lt;/math&gt; of its own. We have once again gone from
one partial differential equation (which we don't know how to solve
directly) for &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}(n,t)&lt;/math&gt; to an infinite set of uncoupled ordinary
differential equations (from a type we are already familiar with)
for the normal coordinates &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}_{p}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.


\subsubsection{Great! This is very similar to what we got for the Rouse model, are
we going to repeat the same type of analysis? }

Since the equation for the normal modes is the same as that for the
Rouse model, we can immediately write the expressions for the diffusion
constant of the center of mass and the rotational relaxation time
using the results of the previous section:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
D_{G}=\frac{k_{B}T}{\zeta_{0}}=\frac{8k_{B}T}{3\eta b\left(6N\pi^{3}\right)^{1/2}}

\tau_{r}=\frac{\zeta_{1}}{k_{1}}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi}}\frac{\eta b}{k}N^{3/2}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



=====How does the Zimm model stand in comparison to experimental results? =====

As can been seen &lt;math&gt;D_{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{r}&lt;/math&gt; depend on the molecular
weight $M$ as follows (recall that $M\propto N$): &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
D_{G}\propto\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}

\tau_{r}\propto M^{3/2}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The dependence of these quantities on the molecular weight agrees
with experiments performed on solutions in the &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; state. Furthermore,
the relaxation times of the normal modes are: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{p}=\frac{\zeta_{p}}{k_{p}}=\frac{\tau_{r}}{p^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and hence for short times (&lt;math&gt;t\ll\tau_{r}&lt;/math&gt;) the average mean square
displacement of the $n-th$ monomer is given by: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)\approx\frac{2Nb^{2}}{\pi^{2}}\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{1-exp(-tp^{3/2}/\tau_{r})}{p^{2}}dp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
integration by parts gives:&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)\approx\frac{2Nb^{2}}{\pi^{2}}\left[\frac{-1+exp(-tp^{3/2}/\tau_{r})}{p}\right]|_{0}^{\infty}+\frac{3Ntb^{2}}{\tau_{r}\pi^{2}}\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{exp(-tp^{3/2}/\tau_{r})}{\sqrt{p}}dp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The first term drops (elementary calculus), the second term is treated
by a change of variable $x=tp^{3/2}/\tau_{r}$ :&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\phi(n,t)\approx\frac{3Ntb^{2}}{\tau_{r}\pi^{2}}\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}\frac{2\tau_{r}exp(-x)}{3t\left[\frac{\tau_{r}x}{t}\right]^{2/3}}dx=\frac{2Nb^{2}\Gamma(1/3)}{\pi^{2}}\left[\frac{t}{\tau_{r}}\right]^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where we have identified the gamma function &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(x)=\overset{\infty}{\underset{0}{\int}}t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt&lt;/math&gt;.
The relation &lt;math&gt;\phi(n,t)\propto t^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; has been confirmed by analysis
of the Brownian motion of DNA molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many student organizations face a common set of organizational problems. This section describes the organizational problems that student organizations face including  problems with membership, planning for events, leadership, and communication. 

{{TOC|limit=3}}
==Problems With Membership==
Problems with membership can be a huge issue especially with new emerging clubs. Depending on the mission statement, a large group of members may be necessary in order to fulfill the clubs goals. In other groups too many members can lead to not receiving as much participation as wanted. In regards to membership clubs face issues ranging from new member recruitment to members fighting. If not dealt with effectively, these problems can lead to the disbandment or eventual dissolution of a club.

One problem with membership that the Scottish Country Dance Club has is that there are only 2 male members, this means that girls are having to wear &quot;man-bands&quot; and dance the males role. 

KUGS requires that people volunteer for a certain period of time before they receive pay, which sometimes deters people from becoming involved.

Western's Rugby Club lacks the potential of recruiting new members to the organization that are willing to stay fully committed. As the seniors on the team graduate, it gets a little harder for the team members to find new members that can show the same dedication towards the sport which would be their downfall.

===Problems With Missions and Goals===
In my time interviewing the Submarine club, there seemed to be a stalemate with the progress of the Club. They have had great achievements in their past endeavors and now face a question of where to go next. There is a newer smaller sub that is in progress but the annual races are a ways away and the submarine team seems to be drifting with the current. Speaking with the leader of the club she sounded confident they would create more exciting subs that would compare to the highly funded competition. For now the Sub team sits patiently, with their large Viking sub in storage to one day rejoin the competition and make &amp; break goals the members have.

===Problems Recruiting New Membership===

	The Hui’ O Hawaii club met with difficulties recruiting new members due to a lack of public awareness of the club. This is partially due to their absence at the Fall Info Fair this past year. However they were represent at the Spring Club Fair, and got some publicity but since then there have been no big recruiting drives. The root cause of HOH's recruitment difficulties is simply its less-than-proactive attitude towards going out and trying to find new members. HOH seems to rely heavily on sheer luck and the initiative of potential members who seek them out rather than making an effort to develop an effective recruitment strategy. Another way of getting new members is by word of mouth; current members will discuss the club with friends who will show up to a meeting and if interested join. While these recruitment tactics do have the advantage of drawing only those dedicated enough to seek out the club, they also mean that the clubs using them will be somewhat lacking in numbers.  WWU Cycling club was having similar problems with recruitment and discovered that one of the best ways to find new members was to leave flyers for their club on people's bikes. A good way to increase recruitment for other clubs may be to pin point where they choose to advertise so that those who would be interested in the group, based on hobbies and activities, will be the ones who will see the flyer.


Western Men Against Violence has always had issues advertising itself, but the most recent years have been particularly difficult. Changes in university policy have caused them to be unable to advertise easily and effectively inside the dorms, and therefore they have lost an important part of their recruiting capabilities. 

Campus Christian Fellowship has struggled with increasing in members mainly since they only advertise by word of mouth and select events on campus each year. Though the events that CCF holds on campus usually draw attention and the number of members does still increase, there is a desire within the group to see more members attend each week.

Western's Rugby Club does not necessarily have problems with recruiting new members, but instead has a difficult time keeping members.  The team mentioned they always receive a high turnout, but as the year goes on, loses the majority of the men.

Dead Parrot's society has had lots of problems with advertising their shows and club in general. It is based on word of mouth and that isn't an effective strategy if you are trying to open the experience up to a wider variety of people.

The Student- Homeless Outreach Team has come a long way since their first established quarter in the spring of 2008. Still they face many obstacles that are impairing their clubs effectiveness. Their main fallback is not having enough people to fulfill the tasks needed.  They face the difficulty of having the time to recruit; this takes money, time, and a lot of effort to advertise. As stated by a fellow group member, “I think their needs could be covered generally by recruitment.” With only four members they spend the entire quarter preparing for the event “Be Our Guest.”  In several other clubs, such as the Making Western Diverse club and the A’Capella group they all carry the general theme of wanting to advertise for the club more in order to receive an increased number of members. These groups also provided evidence from their interviews that the clubs do not have the funding to recruit or the time. As new clubs are being established, since each of these clubs mentioned above are fairly new, they all face the struggle of how to advertise effectively. With extra help and a little bit of time these clubs would be beneficial to the entire community rather than the small, secluded portion currently involved. 

Campus Christian Fellowship has struggled with gaining new members and leaders. At the beginning of the year the club advertises through a fair but during the year they rely on word of mouth. Although this does bring in some new members, it is not as effective and does not increase the membership as much as the leadership in the club would like. This problem with lack of new members/leadership is also an issue because there are not enough core leaders to lead the small groups that are a part of CCF. This is frustrating to the leadership of CCF because they would like to keep the core groups small and have as many people as possible join core groups. 

Voices for Planned Parenthood (VOX) also experiences problems recruiting members. While membership has gone up this year due to active recruiting attempts, the club's members are mainly women (currently there is only one male member). The club feels like there is a lack of men is an issue. This is mainly because Planned Parenthood and sexual health, the members feel, is for both men and women since it is about safe sex. The club feels that sometimes men seem uncomfortable talking about such things when they are tabling or, as in a certain instance, they say testing is more of a woman’s concern and believe that having more males at events and tabling will help curb these reactions from men.

Campus Christian Fellowship struggles with maintaining strong awareness for the organization. It is always a concern and they are always trying to find even better ways to improve outreach; so, students old and new know that Campus Christian Fellowship is an organization with open arms. 

Although Students Against Civilization does very well in retaining members, gaining new membership is a recurring issue. This club predominantly communicates by word of mouth, and is an organization whose views are held by very few. Students Against Civilization has always encouraged anyone and everyone to attend meetings, but has always struggled with getting its message and motives out to the general public.

In the Planned Parenthood group on campus, they face many problems with recruiting. They have plenty of girls within the Planned Parenthood group, but they lack male membership. The group thinks that if they get more male involvement then the goals they are trying to accomplish on campus will be more affective. They want to increase STI testing and the men on campus feel they don't need to listen to Planned Parenthood because it is a women group. That creates a huge problem for the people involved in the group since their goal is to promote safe sex and, most of the times, it starts with the men.  

It has been recognized the WWU club Students for Disability Awareness (SDA) has a problem with having enough members. Because of this struggle, communication is difficult, as there are not very many people to get a hold of.

The Photography Club has a hard time getting more members to join because there is not a high awareness or understanding of the club. Not a lot of people know about it and those who do know about it may think that they are not skilled enough to join even though it is open to all skill levels.

The Jewish Chabad has found difficulty in getting the word out that their group exists. The Jewish Chabad discussed that there isn’t a single extremely effective way of letting people know about the group. 

====Problems with New Member Auditions/Rehearsal====

'''A'capella Club'''
Although the A'capella club has no issue with the recruitment of members due to their invite-only procedure, the club only has one person solely in charge of the auditioning process. Because the recruitment and auditioning processes have not been well documented, the club will have problems finding an effecting method after the person in charge of the current procedure graduates from Western.

====Problems With Inexperienced New Members====
KUGS radio goes through a re-hiring process every year, having to invest time and effort into training new staff and volunteers in order to keep things running smoothly since there are so many aspects to maintaining a radio station, especially with their need for specific knowledge about technological aspects.

The Student Homeless Outreach Team’s members biggest problem is their lack of members. The current members know that it may be difficult to integrate new members into their system at this point in the year, but that eventually it is going to be essential in keeping the mission of the club alive.

Students for Renewable Energy, a club at Western Washington University that has made the Western campus powered by 100% sustainable energy sources, is also facing the issue of inexperience in their club. For the first time in quite awhile, all of the current leadership is graduating. Which means that meaning that they need to add underclassmen to the club who are passionate about the issues.  But the current vice president of Students for Renewable Energy added that in the 2006-2007 school year, there were only 4 returnees which forced the club to re-evaluate what they wanted from the club and what goals they wanted to achieve. It took the entire year to restructure the club because there were lots of clashing personalities.  Although it will be a challenge to integrate new students into the club, it is necessary to keep the club alive.  And with new people come new ideas which could benefit Students for Renewable Energy and help them to affect the Western Washington University community in a positive way.

===Problems With Variable Membership: Decreases or increase in number of members===
Western Washington University’s LEAD group it is often in such high demand that the amount of volunteers seeking to get involved far outnumbers the maximum capacity allowed by the groups resources. This problem requires the group to expand, a feat especially troubling given the university’s current financial constraints.

Western's Rugby Club's greatest issue is getting newly recruited players to commit.  Although a good number of newcomers will initially appear in the fall, the team roster always dwindles as the year wears on. The first few months are the hardest for the team in terms of keeping recruits interested in continuing participation.

In regards to the first paragraph above, there needs to be an introductory overview of what the university’s current financial constraints consists of. There needs to be specific numbers involving the amount of funds needed to run LEAD's group, and state how university’s current financial constraints relates to the amount of funding needed for LEAD.

I feel this first paragraph needs to changed because &quot;the university’s current financial constraints&quot; is too general and vague. There needs to be specific numbers mentioned to show the relationship to the groups current funding. This needs to be placed as an introduction, so the reader will understand what is at play, and not be left wondering what financial constraints there are. to deal with.

The Tango Club needs more publicity done throughout the year. There was a decrease in membership over the past year that is connected to the lack of publicity because first quarter they had forty plus members with posters out on campus whereas now with no publicity being done, the number drops to fifteen members.

A pending issue Slum Doctor Club faces is a decrease in key members, such as the club's current co-founder and president due to graduation. The club's solid members are upperclassmen, and without recruitment of new, younger members very soon, the club may not make it through the next few years.

The Ritmo Salsa club has a much higher membership in the start of the year, which gradually dwindles towards the end.  There are a lot of freshman looking to try out new clubs, so the number of people showing up to meetings is very high in the fall.  But as the year goes on, the number returning members gets much lower.

===Problems Scheduling Membership Meetings and Activities===

Associated Students is a huge group of people that their goal for the club is to get people involved with the school and get people to go to the events, films, and concerts that they put on for the students and community around Bellingham. But its hard with so many members in one club to get together on a weekly basis and get them all together on time and get everyone organized for the events. Its something that may be hard to fix but they are hoping one day to fix their problem of participation.

The only main area of weakness that LEAD seems to have is the need to be able to accommodate more people into work parties. LEAD only has three main members involved within the group sometimes resulting in a volunteer overload where community volunteers have to be turned away from various service and or community projects.

The Students for Disabilities Awareness club has had issues in scheduling group meetings of significant size simply due to the fact that the club has only been around for two years.

A problem that many groups are facing, for example the group SMASH, is funding or fund raising. This group has been struggling to get the funds to continue to support their group, this is from lack of public or private awareness and funding.

===Problems with meeting attendance===
In the Cycling Club, the Vice President pointed out that although they communicate rather easily on the cycling website through the discussion board. There is a lack of members attending meetings that are schedule if the meeting wasn't significant to the biker, or because during the season it gets fairly busy for bikers to attend frequent meetings. In the Harry Potter Club, the President said that they don't take attendance at the meetings because they don't want to make members feel like they have to come, or feel bad for missing a meeting. This potentially causes the effect is that if a member does not like the activity that is planned for the night, they just wont go, causing there to be lower attendance.

Although the experienced members of the Scottish Country Dance Club are helpful and love spreading their knowledge of country dancing, it is still hard to have an affective practice time when all the members are not at the same level of skill. Because the members of the SCDC are busy, attendance from week to week varies; this causes a great variety in ability between the members.
 
One of Sexploration's main problems is getting new members to attend their meetings. Although Sexploration uses quite colorful posters to advertise meetings very few people attend. This certainly is not due to disinterest in sex but could be due to the taboo nature of the topics discussed or a lack of publicity.

The Club STAND has a problem with meeting attendance because the members just get burnt out on everything that they have to do to keep the club going.  So members just decide not to show up which causes the attendance of the meeting to be very minimal.

With the Dead Parrots society if members aren't attending the closed rehearsals it makes it hard for them to put the show together because it's more of a structured setting.

The photography club had a big issue with members attending the meetings. When people don't show up to the meetings then they don't have pictures to show or talk about, which is the whole purpose of the club.

One of the biggest issues with the Scottish Country Dance Club is the meeting attendance. The leader said meetings can range from 8 to 20 members making it difficult to rehearse for upcoming performances. Also, when small clubs such as the Scottish Country Dance Club are not able to fill their meetings consistently with all the students who have signed up, problems arise that can range from miscommunications concerning practice times, missed opportunities for exposure to the club subject in local events such as Folklife or other area internationally themed events, as well as putting the continuation of the club into another quarter in jeopardy.

===Problems with ineffective resolution of member conflicts===
In any gathering of people there is the potential for conflict--whether the club is Western Men Against Violence, or the Western Rugby club. In most cases these conflicts can be dissipated through peaceful means such as talking or mediation. However, on occasion, such conflicts are not resolved and lead to harm. This harm can be in the form of trash talking, name calling, or rumor-mongering, and in perhaps in some extreme cases--physical attacks. While such conflict is often personal in nature, and thus hard to avoid, poor leadership of meetings or lack of supervision of events can exacerbate conflicts. Thus it is important for groups to learn how to deal with conflict in order to be a more effective and efficient club.

One club ran into problems with disagreements over leadership last year. The resolution of this conflict was when the group split apart. The agitated party left the club all together rather than trying to rebuild and reconnect with other members.

==Problems With Leadership==

===Problems Recruiting Leadership===

Sexplortions main problem is that there are so few leadership positions. With only two leaders to get everything done, not only is the future uncertain when the leaders graduate, but there are not enough people to help recruit new members as well as advertise for upcoming events.

===Problems Passing On Leadership Skills and Experiences===
Many clubs have one person to lead the club. For example, the sexploration club has one person that does most of the work. the leader of the club is a senior and will be graduating this spring so that makes clear that they are going to need another leader to do all of this work.  

Even when a club as more than one club leader, such as with the Ritmo Salsa club, if most of the leaders are members of the same grade then upon graduating the collective leadership knowledge of that group of leaders will be lost. The club will then be forced to elect a whole group of new, untrained leaders who will have to learn from scratch how to govern the club.  


'''Women in the Woods'''
The current leaders of Women in the Woods do not know the founders of the club well which makes it hard to carry on a legacy for future club members. The e-mail list of contacts is also inconsistent. Since there are so few regular members, it has been difficult to find leaders that are willing to step up and plan the trips which can often be very intimidating. If they are unable to find effective leaders this year, it could be even more difficult next year, especially without a founder of the club to help.

Besides carrying on the legacy and finding more people to join the club there is another problem that women in the woods face, which deals with promoting. This problem comes from the fact that there isn't very many members, without being able to find more members, activities can not be promoted causing people to not know about women in the woods.

'''WWU Body Building Club'''
One problem that the WWU Body Building Club is going to be faced with is when the creator and leader graduates; she wants to make sure that the club continues and falls into the right hands because this is an important club.
Another Problem the club has is funding. The club cannot hold events, go to competitions, or advertise without the proper funding.

'''A'capella Club'''
Although the A'capella Club at Western has a great leader right now, there is concern that after he is gone the club will dwindle because his driving motivation might leave with him.

'''Hui O' Hawaii'''
Leadership in the Hui O' Hawaii group is loosely fixed, members share responsibility in all aspects of leadership, there is a hope that by handling leadership in this way will teach everyone the necessary skills and processes need for leadership so that one of the members can take over at the start of the new year, while receiving help from other members. Leaders are not groomed in advance, but instead step forward once the previous leader has stepped down. While this forms a sense of camaraderie, it may also mean that the leader cannot be as effective as they otherwise might.

'''World Injustice Awareness Club'''
The problem that the WIAC faced was a lack of members because the past leader stepped down and did not give the current leader the contact information of the other members in the group; the past leader also stepped down late, and thus the current leaders were not able to set up a booth at the info fair.

===Problems Related to Ineffective Leadership===
The South Asian Student Association(SASA)  faced a number of difficulties regarding ineffective leadership during the 2008 and 2009 school year. After a controversial election of the officers the club felt a strong division and split. With the older members leaving the group there was no transfer of knowledge of leadership skills. This led to a continual drop in membership after ineffective leadership. It culminated into the president and vice president dropping out and the steering rep running the meeting to only one or two attendees on average.

==Problems with communication==

===Changing contact information===

One problem Students for Renewable Energy had with regards to communication was that they were undergoing a change in leadership. This meant that all of the contact information on their website was outdated, making it impossible to contact continuing members and get updates about where to meet and/or if a meeting was moved or cancelled.

One problem that a few of the Dead Parrots Society members seemed to face was that the contact information provided seemed unreliable. Whether it was outdated organization, or it was lost in WWU's mess of an e-mail system, it's hard to say, but a few members said they did have to go through a few extra steps to really get in contact with the group.

===Ineffective types of communication===
One of the problems that ASP faces is a problem with effectively communicating when and where events are happening, due to many complications with publicity.

The Creators of Visual Art and Literature Society do not face the common problem of communicating from member to member, but in expressing what it is the club hopes to achieve.

One problem the Harry Potter club has is keeping their member's attention span the entire meeting. This is probably due to the fact that there is a lot of Harry Potter material on the internet, making it very easy to distract the club on some tangent that can end up not relating to Harry Potter at all.

A problem that the WWU body Building Club faces is with communication.  Most communication is done through Facebook, which seems to work for them, but a more effective way of communication might be holding formal meetings.

===Poor past relationship with the University.===

The WWU Cycling club has had some problems in the past with communication and cooperation with the University. In a past race there was some damage to Western property that was handled poorly by the group leadership. The current leadership is working on building a relationship with the administration, as well as working with other groups to get their message out

==Problems Related to Operations and Planning==

===Problems with Technological Advancement===
The SMASH club has encountered a rather unique problem with the advancement of its technology.  The club was started with the GameCube version of the game, &quot;Melee.&quot;  However, as the new version, &quot;Brawl,&quot; came ot for Nintendo Wii, the group encountered a conflict of interest.  They are still struggling to advance to the new version of the game because most of the members prefer to play the older version.

===Problems With Funding===
Funds are an important asset for many clubs on campus. Besides the AS start up contribution of $50 the clubs are responsible for coming up with the money to fund events and pay for supplies. To do so the club has three options, pay out of their own pocket, take out loans with the AS, or fundraise. Fundraising is a great tool for coming up with extra money; however often clubs are inhibited by their lack of members or opportunities to put on a successful fundraiser leading to a shortage of funds. 

My club was Students for Disability Awareness and they had problems with funding that lead to a decrease in amount of events that this club was able to host. Money and funding are a key component to this clubs success. 

The funding problem due to the photography club is since they are a fairly new club they do not have pre-existing funds left from previous members. Because there is no pre-existing money they have to fund-raise for field trips and a dark room that they have no current access to.

The Croquet club has trouble with funding because they struggle with finding funding and even starting a fundraiser. The funding in many clubs has decreased in the last few years. The leader of the club uses his own money to purchase equipment and prizes for the winners of their tournaments. 

'''WWU Bodybuilding Club'''
Like many other WWU campus organizations, one of the major problems that the bodybuilding club is faced with is a means of obtaining funds. Currently, their only mode of funding is money earned through selling jello (jelly) shots. There are many activities that the bodybuilding club would like to organize and be involved with but they just don't have the funds to support these efforts. Fundraising tactics need to change in order to allow this club to grow to its full potential. 

'''Student Homeless Outreach Team'''
One of the bigger struggles for the Student Homeless Outreach Team is fundraising. The reason why fundraising is so hard is because of the group’s membership. The group has the ability to recruit dozens of students for its quarterly event “Be Our Guest” but the core club only consists of four members. Although they have been successful with their event many other club necessities have been postponed because there are not enough members to fulfill certain duties, such as fundraising. Since “Be Our Guest” is based on the donation of meals to hungry members of the community the club doesn’t get any revenue off of the event and they rely on loans or grants from the Associated Students. In my interview with the group leader, she felt that if the club was able to recruit more members for the club then they would be able to spread out other duties such as publicity and event planning, there would be more time for fundraising. With more funds the club would be able to give money back into the community or sponsor events with other clubs to spread the awareness of hunger in other countries.

'''The Dead Parrot Society'''
Many clubs, the Dead Parrot Society for example, only acquire funds through events that they host, so publicity for events is a critical issue for many clubs; without publicity they lose funding. Hui O' Hawaii is another club that had some problems with fundraising and according to the President, the problem stemmed from always getting off track during group meetings. They sometimes tended to run off topic, so fundraising ideas weren't always acknowledged.

The Dead Parrots Society's funding problems stem from publicity issues, but could be solved by using more accessible venues when hosting events, which would result in increased attendance.

'''Croquet Club'''
One weakness that the Croquet Club suffers from is funding. While the club does get the 50 dollars from the school, this serves as a difficult process. Most of the money used for prizes, snacks, and trophies unfortunately come out of founder Devin Spencer’s own pocket. He also owns all of the equipment, which is altogether mismatched, worn out, broken, or outdated. Fund raising is simply a donation jar that Devin puts out every meeting. With adequate funding, this already enormously popular, up and coming club could afford better equipment, prizes, and snacks that do not have to come out of Devin’s own pocket. Croquet Club could also grow a great deal with more funding, surpassing many clubs in popularity and attendance.

'''Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF)'''
CCF generally gets its funding through it members and its alumni. Every service there is an offering bucket passed around for those who would wish to donate or attribute money. The summer meetings for CCF are generally the hardest time for funding because most students go home for the summer and aren't in Bellingham to give money. This is a problem especially for the staff at CCF. That is why most of the staff do fundraising over the summer to make up for the money not be attributed by the students, parents or alumni.

CCF has also had the issue of legal action against it in the past which has hindered its ability to meet. The idea of a religious club on campus has proven to be problematic in the eyes of some, and the club has had to fight several legal battles to be able to keep its right to meet. For the most part, CCF has won these legal battles and the only loss the club has sustained is that the Core groups are no longer allowed to reserve dorm lounges for its weekly meetings.

==Problematic Relationships With Other Clubs==

===Problems Interacting With Or Communicating With Another Club===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I take notes by computer (using a tablet with Lyx for the text and equations and Xournal for diagrams) in all my classes. This results in nice PDF files rendered with LaTeX, and other students often ask me for them. The idea of open-sourcing the notes has often come up in conversation, but I have always been skeptical about the technical feasibility. I came across a script called latex2wiki, and decided to try sharing my notes and see what happens. Getting it to look right has taken a bit of work. Also, I have kept my (ugly, hand-drawn) diagrams in PDF form, but it would be better to make nicer ones and put them in the main text.

So, if this is useful to anyone, please let me know! I crank out one or two or three of these a year and already have a bunch lying around, but I will only take the time to convert and upload them if it turns out to be helpful and if other students participate in the writing process.

Guy

: I certainly hope this book would be helpful to others and encourage you to continue to add content to Wikibooks.

Thanks! The correct category should be soft condensed matter physics or physical chemistry, though - not chemical engineering. [[User:Guycohen|Guy Cohen]] ([[User talk:Guycohen|talk]])


Just added second chapter. Needs many corrections... [[User:Guycohen|Guy Cohen]] ([[User talk:Guycohen|talk]])</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The War of 1812 ==

=== Precursors to the War ===
By the time James Madison took office as president in 1809, the U.S. was still a young nation.  Though the war for independence was fought and won, culminating in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, problems revolving around U.S. sovereignty continued to be a source of contention between the United States and Great Britain. By 1812, the U.S military Academy at West Point, founded in 1802, had produced only eighty-nine regular officers. Senior army officers were aged Revolutionary War Veterans or political appointees. Nor did the United States succeed at mustering sufficient forces. The governments efforts to lure recruits, with sign up- bonuses and promises of three months pay and rights to purchase 160 acres of western land upon discharge, met with mixed success.  This was especially true on the American frontier (remember, the British had agreed to recognize all of the land from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, except for Spanish Florida) and on the high seas, where American sailors were pressed into service in the British Royal Navy, as the British were waging war against Napoleonic France.  The reason for doing this was so the British could find and recover seamen who had defected from the British Navy to join (a relatively easier) life on the High Seas with the Americans. The British would raid American ships (such as the Chesapeake) claiming to look for British deserters. When American refused to allow the British to seize ships this resulted in 18 Americans wounded.  This upset a lot of Americans who pressed Jefferson by anonymous letter for the war with Britain. Further, the British had recruited Indians, such as Tecumseh, to aggravate American settlers and even continued to maintain forts on American soil. The British encouraged Native American tribes to harass American settlers. The British took interest in the Ohio Valley and Kentucky region due to the fur trade with the western world. 

The British further enraged the Americans with their refusal to recognize U.S. neutrality in Britain's war with France.  The British did not want the United States to engage in trade with France, even though Americans believed that they had the right to trade with whomever they wished.

In addition, many Americans wanted to push the British Empire off of the North American continent altogether. President Madison and his advisers believed a conquest of Canada would be quick and easy, believing that the British would hand the Americans the land because of their war with Napoleon.  Former President Thomas Jefferson himself even stated that &quot;the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.

=== Politics of the War ===
As was stated above, former President Jefferson and current President Madison, both Democratic-Republicans, supported the war to end British aggravation on both the frontier and the high seas, with the hope of taking over Canada from the British.  However, New England Federalists opposed the war, which was driven by Southern and Western desires for more land.  The war was highly unpopular in New England because the New England economy relied heavily on trade, especially with Great Britain.

A Declaration of War was passed by Congress by an extremely small margin in the summer of 1812.  Across the Atlantic, meanwhile, Prime Minister Spencer Perceval had been shot and killed, putting Lord Liverpool, who wanted to improve relations with the United States, in charge of the government.  He repealed the orders of impressment, but by then, it was already too late.  The war had begun.

===War of 1812===

The war of 1812 did not begin badly for the Federalists, who benefited from anti-war sentiment. They joined renegade Democratic  Republicans in supporting New York City mayor Dewitt Clinton for president in the election of 1812. Clinton lost to President Madison by 128 to 89 votes--a respectable showing against a wartime president and the federalists gained some congressional seats and carried many local elections. But the south and the west areas that favored the war remained solidly Democratic Republican. Both sides were rather unprepared to wage a war.  The British did not have many troops in British North America at the time (some 5,000 or so), and meanwhile the British war against Napoleon continued in continental Europe as the British blockaded most of the European coastline. 

The American military was still unorganized and undisciplined compared to the British military. Militias in New England and New York often refused to fight outside their own states. Desperate for soldiers, New York offered them to free the slaves who enlisted, and compensation to their owners, and the U.S Army made the same offer to slaves in the Old Northwest and in Canada. In Philadelphia black leaders formed a black brigade to defend the city, but in the deep south fear of arming slaves kept them out of the military in New Orleans, where a free black militia dated back to Spanish control of Louisiana. The British on the other hand recruited slave by promising freedom, and exchange for service.   The regular army consisted of around 12,000 men, but the state militias were often unwilling to fight outside state lines (and often retreated when they did).  This, combined with some difficult losses early on and the war's high level of unpopularity in New England made the war effort much more difficult than President Madison originally imagined.

====The Atlantic Theater====
The British navy was by far the preeminent naval force in the world.  They dominated the high seas.  By contrast, the U.S. Navy was not even 20 years old yet and had a mere 22 vessels.  The British plan was to protect its shipping in Canada while blockading major American ports.

However, there were a series of American naval victories on the Atlantic at this early stage of the war.  On August 19, the USS ''Constitution'' engaged HMS ''Guerriere''. The battle was held off the coast of Nova Scotia became the first naval encounter. The HMS Guerriere was led by Captain Dacres who states who was really confident that the British navy could take the U. S Constitution, &quot;There is a Yankee frigate in 45 minutes she surely ours take her in 15 minutes and I promise you 4 months pay.&quot; After being 25 ft in distance USS Constitution opened fire with cannon and grape shots.  In the midst of the battle, a cannonball fired from ''Guerriere'' hit the ''Constitution's'' in the side, causing one American seaman to exclaim &quot;Huzzah! Her sides are made of iron!&quot;  The ''Guerriere,'' which had been instrumental in enforcing the British blockade, lost decisively.  Her crew was brought on board as prisoners.  When it was realized that ''Guerriere'' could not be salvaged, it was set fire and blown up.  When Captain Hull of the USS ''Constitution'' reached Boston with the news, joy broke out.  In October of the same year, ''Constitution'' sailed under Captain William Bainbridge and won another victory off the coast of Brazil against HMS ''Java,'' which was also rendered unsalvageable while the ''Constitution'' remained unharmed.  The USS ''Constitution'' won the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; in some of the first victories against Great Britain on the high seas. The victory led from General Hull sparked new hope to the Americans and also redeemed them from the lost at the battle at Fort Dearborn, Ohio leaving General Hull wounded and force to surrender August 15, 1812.

Captain Stephen Decatur, who gained fame during the Barbary War, was also responsible for early naval victories.  On October 25, 1812, Captain Decatur, commanding the USS ''United States,'' captured the HMS ''Macedonian.''  And in January 1813, Captain David Porter sailed the USS ''Essex'' into the Pacific to aggravate British shipping in retaliation for harassment of British whaling ships on the American whaling industry.  ''Essex'' inflicted some $3 million in damages to the British whaling industry before finally being captured off the coast of Chile on March 28, 1814.

Back in on the Atlantic Coast, meanwhile, Sir John Coape Sherbrooke embarked on what was known as the Penobscot Expedition in September 1814 with 500 British sailors off the coast of Maine (then part of Massachusetts), a main hub for smuggling between the British and Americans.  During this period, lasting 26 days, Sir Sherbrooke raided and looted several cities and destroyed 17 American vessels, won the Battle of Hampden and occupied Castine for the remainder of the war.

====The Great Lakes/Canadian/Western Theater====
The Western theater of the war was mostly fought in the Michigan, Ohio, and the Canadian border area. Geography dictated the military operations that would take place in west. Primarily around Lake Erie, Niagara River, Lake Ontario, Saint Lawrence River, and Lake Champlain.

====Chesapeake Campaign====
The Chesapeake Bay Region was a center of trade, commerce and government during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It became a target of British Military strategy during the War of 1812.The British brought war into the Chesapeake area in 1813 and 1814.&lt;ref&gt;http://starspangled200.org/History/Pages/ChesapeakeCampaign.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 1813 Joshua Barney convinced the Navy Department to build twenty barges to protect the Chesapeake Bay. These barges were successful at harassing the Royal Navy, but in the end proved useless in the British campaign that led to &quot;Burning of Washington&quot;. The White House and other structures were left ablaze all night and the President and his Cabinet fled D.C.  This attack was a diversion by the British and the major battle would take place in 1814 in Baltimore. . This battle is where Francis Scott Key who was detained on a British ship watching the bombardment of Fort McHenry, aboard the British ship Key wrote the verses to The Star Spangled Banner the next morning, this song would become the National Anthem in 1931. Despite some victories on the Atlantic by the USS Constitution, USS Wasp, and USS United States of the U.S. Navy could not match the powerful British Royal Navy. The British blockaded nearly every American port on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The British had America so blockaded that that U.S. trade declined to nearly 90% in 1811. This major loss of funds threatened to bankrupt the federal government and cut off New England from British Embargo.

====The Southern Theater====
Connected to the War of 1812 was the Creek War in the South.  The Creeks were supported by the British, and in March 1814, General Andrew Jackson and General John Coffee led a force comprised of about 2,000 Tennessee militiamen, Choctaw, Cherokee, and U.S. regulars in a war against the Creek Indians.  Out of 1,000 Creeks, led by Chief Menawa, 800 were killed at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.  Only 49 of Jackson's forces were killed.  Jackson pursued the remaining Creeks until they surrendered.

At the end of the year 1814, General Jackson was on the move again, this time to New Orleans, Louisiana, to defend against invading British forces.  In one of the greatest battles of the war, Jackson decisively routed the British forces.  The British army took a hit of 1,784 killed; the Americans lost merely 210.  The British forces left New Orleans, and the battle propelled General Jackson to hero status, despite the fact that the war was over.  Word had not yet reached the combatant forces that a peace had been signed.

=== Hartford Convention ===
New England merchants and shippers had already been upset about the trade policies of the Jefferson administration (Embargo Act of 1807) and the Madison administration (Non-Intercourse Act of 1809), and had wholly opposed going to war with Great Britain in the first place due to the potential damage to New England industry.  Thus, the Federalist Party, which had been weakened at the end of the Adams administration, found resurgence in popularity among the citizens of New England states.

With trade illegalized and a British blockade, New England states, particularly Massachusetts and Connecticut, felt the brunt of President Madison's war-time policies.  This includes what many New Englanders may have perceived as an attack on their states' sovereignty, as Madison maintained executive control over the military defense of New England rather than allowing governors to take control.

On October 10, 1814, the Massachusetts legislature voted for delegates from all five New England states to meet on December 15 in Hartford, Connecticut, to discuss constitutional amendments pertaining to the interests of New England states.

Twenty-six delegates gathered in Hartford.  The meetings were held in secret and no records were kept.  The Hartford Convention concluded with a report stating that states had a duty and responsibility to assert their sovereignty over encroaching and unconstitutional federal policy.  In addition, a set of proposed Constitutional amendments was established, including:

# Prohibition of trade embargos lasting longer than 60 days;
# 2/3rds majority in Congress for declaration of offensive war, admission of new states, and interdiction of foreign commerce;
# Rescinding 3/5ths representation of slaves (perceived as an advantage to the South);
# One-term limit for the President of the United States; and
# A requirement that each succeeding president be from a different state than his predecessor.

While some delegates may have desired secession from the Union, no such proposal was adopted by the Convention.

Three commissioners from Massachusetts were sent to Washington, DC, to negotiate these terms in February 1815, but news that the war had ended and of General Jackson's victory at New Orleans preceded them.  The act was perceived by many as disloyal, and the commissioners returned to Massachusetts.  The Hartford Convention added to the ultimate decline of the Federalist Party.

== Second Barbary War ==
Following the First Barbary War, the United States focused on the situation developing with Great Britain, giving the pirate states of the Barbary Coast opportunity to not follow the terms of the treaty ending that war.  The U.S., not having the military resources to devote to the region, was forced to pay ransoms for the crew.  The British expulsion of all U.S. vessels from the Mediterranean during the War of 1812 further emboldened the pirate states, and Umar ben Muhammad, the Dey of Algiers, expelled U.S. Consular Tobias Lear, declaring war on the United States for failing to pay tribute.  Again, the situation went unaddressed due to the lack of U.S. military resources in the area.

After the end of the War of 1812, however, the U.S. was able to focus on American interests in North Africa.  On March 3, 1815, Congress authorized use of naval force against Algiers, and a force of ten ships was deployed under the commands of Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge.  Decatur's squadron was the first to depart to the Mediterranean on May 20.

Commodore Decatur quickly led the squadron to decisive victories over the Algiers, capturing two Algerian-flagged ships en route to Algiers.  By the end of the month of June, Decatur reached Algiers and demanded compensation or threatened the Dey's destruction.  The Dey capitulated, and a treaty was signed in which the Algerian ships were returned in exchange for American captors (of which there were approximately ten), several Algerian captors were returned in exchange for several European captors, $10,000 was paid for seized shipping, and guarantees were made to end the tribute payments and grant the United States full shipping rights.

== James Monroe Presidency and The Era of Good Feelings ==
Opposition to the War of 1812 and the Hartford Convention terminally damaged the Federalists as a viable political party, even portraying the party as traitorous.  The last serious Federalist candidate Rufus King ran for the presidency in 1816, losing to James Madison's Secretary of State James Monroe.  The party disbanded in 1825.

Indeed following the war, a new wave of nationalism spread across the United States.  Previously, citizens of the United States tended to view themselves as citizens of their individual states (i.e. New Yorkers or Georgians) before they viewed themselves as ''Americans.''

The wave of national pride and the lull in partisanship in the wake of defeating the British Empire led to what journalist for Boston's ''Columbian Sentinal'' Benjamin Russell perceived to be an '''Era of Good Feelings''' as the newly elected President Monroe came through on a good will tour in 1817.

=== American System ===
Riding on the wave of newfound national pride, politicians such as Henry Clay of Kentucky, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, and John Q. Adams of Massachusetts, following in Alexander Hamilton's footsteps, pushed an agenda to strengthen and unify the nation.  The system, which came to be known as the '''American System,''' called for high tariffs to protect American industry and high land prices to generate additional federal revenue.  The plan also called for strengthening the nation's infrastructure, such as roads and canals, which would be financed by tariffs and land revenue.  The improvements would make trade easier and faster.  Finally, the plan called for maintaining the Second Bank of the United States (chartered in 1816 for 20 years) to stabilize the currency and the banking system, as well as the issuance of sovereign credit. Congress also passed a protective tariff to aid industries that had flourished during the war of 1812 but were now threatened by the resumption of over seas trade. The Tariff of 1816 levied taxes on imported woolens and cottons, as well as on iron,leather,hats, papers,and sugar. 

Although portions of the system were adopted (for example, 20-25% taxes on foreign goods, which encouraged consumption of relatively cheaper American goods), others met with roadblocks.  Namely, this was true of the infrastructure proposals.  The Constitutionality was called into question on whether or not the federal government had such power.  Despite this, two major infrastructure achievements were made in the form of the Cumberland Road and the Erie Canal.  The Cumberland Road stretched between Baltimore and the Ohio River, facilitating ease of travel and providing a gateway to the West for settlement.  The Erie Canal extended from the Hudson River at Albany, New York, to Buffalo, New York, at Lake Erie, thus vastly improving the speed and efficiency of water travel in the northeast.

Opposition to the American System mostly came from the West and the South.  Clay argued, however, that the West should support the plan because urban workers in the northeast would be consumers of Western food, and the South should support it because of the market for the manufacture of cotton in northeastern factories.  The South, however, strongly opposed tariffs and had a strong market for cotton, anyway.

In short, the American System met with mixed results over the 1810s and 1820s due to various obstacles, but in the end, American industry benefited, and growth ensued.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
The Industrial Revolution was from the 18th to 19th century which made major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology. The industrial revolution began in England and slowly made its way over to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msu.edu/user/brownlow/indrev.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panic of 1819 ===
Following the War of 1812, in addition to the relative absence of partisanship, the United States experienced a period of economic growth.  However, around the same time the partisanship returned to Washington, the U.S. economy began to experience its first major financial crisis.  Unlike the downturns of the 1780s and 1790s, this downturn originated primarily in the United States, and caused foreclosures, bank failures, unemployment, and reductions in agricultural and manufacturing output.

===Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819===
Due to the act of purchasing the Louisiana territory in 1803, the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1819 (purchasing Florida territory), and the incorporation of the northern territories of Mexico into the United States in 1847 (Mexican Cession), the number of Catholics in the United States nearly doubled.

=== Monroe Doctrine and Foreign Affairs ===

On December 2, 1823, President Monroe introduced the most famous aspect of his foreign policy in his State of the Union Address to Congress.  '''The Monroe Doctrine,''' as it came to be called, stated that any further attempts by European powers to interfere in the affairs of the nations of the Western hemisphere (namely Latin America) would be seen as an act of aggression against the United States, requiring a U.S. response.  The Monroe Doctrine came about as a result of U.S. and British fears the Spain would attempt to restore its power over former colonies in Latin America.  President Monroe essentially sent notice that America, both North and South, was no longer open to colonization by European powers.

The fact that the U.S. was still a young nation with very little naval power meant that the warning went largely ignored by the major powers.  Despite this, the British approved of the policy and largely enforced it as part of the Pax Britannica, whereby the British Navy secured the neutrality of the high seas.  It was mainly through this support, rather than the Monroe Doctrine exclusively, which secured and maintained the sovereignty of Latin American nations.

Even so, the Monroe Doctrine was met with praise by Latin American leaders, despite the fact that they knew that the United States realistically could not enforce it without the backing of the British.  In 1826, Latin American revolutionary hero Simón Bolívar called for the first Pan-American conference in Panama, and an era of Pan-American relations commenced.

=== Seminole War ===
Chief Neamathla of the Mikasuki at Fowltown engaged in a land dispute with the commander at Fort Scott, General Edmund Pendleton Gaines.  The land had been ceded by the Creek at the Treaty of Fort Jackson, however the Mikasuki did not consider themselves Creek and so wished to exert sovereignty over the area, believing the Creek did not have right to cede Mikasuki land.  In November 1817, a force of 250 men was sent by General Gaines to capture Neamathla, but was driven back.  A second attempt in the same month turned out successful, and the Mikasuki people were driven from Fowltown.

A week after the attack on Fowltown, a military boat transporting supplies, sick soldiers, and the families of soldiers (whether or not children were on board is not clear) to Fort Scott was attacked on the Apalachicola River.  Most of the passengers on board were killed, with one woman captured and six survivors making it to Fort Scott.

General Gaines had been ordered not to invade Spanish Florida (save for small incursions).  However, after word of the Scott massacre reached Washington, DC, Gaines was ordered to invade Florida in pursuit of Seminoles, but not to attack Spanish installations.  However, Gaines had been ordered to eastern Florida to deal with piracy issues there, so Secretary of War John C. Calhoun ordered General Andrew Jackson, hero of the War of 1812, to lead the invasion.

General Jackson gathered his forces at Fort Scott in March 1818.  The force consisted of 800 regulars, 1,000 Tennessee volunteers, 1,000 Georgia militia, and 1,400 friendly Creek warriors.  Jackson's force entered Florida on March 13, following the Apalachicola River and constructing Fort Gadsden.  The Indian town of Tallahassee was burned on March 31 and the town of Miccosukee was taken the next day.  The American and Creek forces left 300 Indian homes devastated in their wake, reaching the Spanish fort of St. Marks on April 6, capturing it.

The American force left St. Marks and continued to attack Indian villages, capturing Alexander George Arbuthnot, a Scottish trader who worked out of the Bahamas and supplied the Indians, and Robert Ambrister, a former Royal Marine and self-appointed British agent, as well as the Indian leaders Josiah Francis and Homathlemico.  All four were eventually executed. Jackson's forces also attacked villages occupied by runaway slaves along the Suwannee River.

Having declared victory, Jackson sent the Georgia militia and Creek warriors home, sending the remaining army back to St. Marks, where he left a garrison before returning to Fort Gadsden.  On May 7, he marched a force of 1,000 to Pensacola where he believed the Indians were gathering and being supplied by the Spanish, against the protests of the governor of West Florida, who insisted that the Indians there were mostly women and children.  When Jackson reached Pensacola on May 23, the governor and the Spanish garrison retreated to Fort Barrancas.  After a day of exchanging cannon fire, the Spanish surrendered, and Colonel William King was named military governor of West Florida.  General Jackson went home to Tennessee -- and prepared for his presidential run in 1824.

== The 1824 Election and Presidency of John Q. Adams ==
With the dissolution of the Federalist Party, there were no organized political parties for the 1824 presidential election, and four Democratic-Republicans vied for the office.  The Tennessee legislature and a convention of Pennsylvania Democratic-Republicans had nominated General-turned-Senator Andrew Jackson for president in 1822 and 1824, respectively.  The Congressional Democratic-Republican caucus (the traditional way to nominate a president) selected Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford for president and Albert Gallatin for vice president.  Secretary of State John Q. Adams, son of the former President Adams, and House Speaker Henry Clay also joined the contest.  It is widely believed that Crawford would have won had he not suffered a debilitating stroke during the course of the election.

When the electoral votes were cast and counted, it turned out that no candidate had a majority of votes.  Jackson had won the most votes, but Constitutionally, a plurality was not good enough, and the vote for the top three candidates went to the House of Representatives.  Clay, with the least amount of votes, was ineligible, but still wielded a lot of power as speaker of the house.  And since Clay had a personal dislike of Jackson and supported many of Adams' policies, which were similar to his American System, Clay threw his support to Adams, and Adams won the presidency, much to the chagrin of Jackson, who had won the most electoral and popular votes.  After Adams appointed Clay as secretary of state, Jackson's supporters protested that a '''corrupt bargain''' had been struck.

The 1824 helped in the resurgence of political parties in America.  Jackson's followers, members of the Democratic Party, were known as Jacksonians; Adams, Clay, and their supporters established the National Republican Party.  Partisan politics was back in style in Washington, DC.

During Adams' term as president, he undertook an ambitious domestic agenda, implementing many aspects of the American System, such as extending the Cumberland Road and several canal projects like the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, the Portland to Louisville Canal, the connection of the Great Lakes to the Ohio River system, and the enlargement and rebuilding of the Dismal Swamp Canal in North Carolina.  He worked diligently to upgrade and modernize infrastructure and internal improvements, such as roads, canals, a national university, and an astronomical observatory.  These internal improvements would be funded by tariffs, an issue which divided the Adams administration.  While Secretary Clay most certainly supported tariffs, Vice President John C. Calhoun opposed.  This turned out to be a source of contention within the administration.

Unfortunately for President Adams, his agenda met with many roadblocks.  First of all, Adams' ideas were not very popular, even from within his own party.  But a major reason Adams had a tough time enacting his agenda was because the Jacksonians were still quite upset about the 1824 elections.  In 1827, the Jacksonians won control of Congress, making it even more difficult.  In addition, Adams did not believe in removing administration officials from office, except for incompetence, including those who may be political opponents.  As a result, many administration officials were, in fact, supporters of Andrew Jackson.  Adams' generous policy towards Indians further served to not endear him to some, such as when the federal government sought to assert authority on behalf of the Cherokee, causing Georgia to take up arms.  The final nail in the coffin of the Adams administration would turn out to be when President Adams signed the Tariff of 1828 into law, which intended to protect northern industry, while the South saw it as an economic blow.  The &quot;Tariff of Abominations,&quot; as it was called, was highly unpopular in the South, and virtually crippled the administration in its final year.

The campaign was brutal, bitter, and personal, with even Jackson's wife attacked, accused of bigamy.  In the end, Adams lost handily:  178-83 in the electoral college.  Adams, like his father, chose not to attend his successor's inauguration ceremony.  In 1830, he would go on to be the first former president elected to Congress after serving as president.

== The People's President -- The Era of Andrew Jackson ==

=== Election and Inauguration ===

The three week journey from Nashville, Tennessee, to Washington, DC, was filled with jubilation, as crowds swarmed to catch a glimpse of the new president-elect Andrew Jackson.  The inauguration ceremonies of former presidents were all indoor affairs, invite only.  On March 29, 1829, however, there was a sense that this new president was a man of the people.  The ceremony was held on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol, where 21,000 people eventually gathered to view the swearing-in.

The new president left through the west front of the capital and proceeded to the executive mansion for the reception on a white horse.  By the time he arrived, the White House had already been invaded by supporters, as the festivities had been opened to the public.  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story noted, &quot;I never saw such a mixture.  The reign of King Mob seemed triumphant.&quot;

The new president was forced to sneak out of the White House before heading to Alexandria, Virginia.  The crowd remained, however, until the liquor was moved to the front lawn.  The White House was left a mess, including thousands of dollars in broken china.

=== Petticoat Affair and the Kitchen Cabinet ===
The Petticoat Affair is also known as the Eaton Affair. Happening in the U.S. between 1830-1831. It was a U.S. scandal involving President Andrew Jackson's cabinet and their wives. Even though this was a private matter, it still troubled several men in their political careers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkingstreet.com/Petticoat_affair&lt;/ref&gt; The Petticoat affair involved Peggy Eaton who was accused of having an affair with a man by the name of John Eaton during the time she was married to purser John Timberlake. Daughter of William O Neal, Peggy remained close to politics her father owned the Washington D.C Boarding House for politicians where Peggy worked. Peggy frequented the boarding house which later gave spectators more discrepancies in Peggy's character as she looses popularity. Peggy husband died while on sea and many believed it was a suicide after being revealed to of his wife Peggy's affair with John Eaton who was a good friend of couple.  Although Timberlake's death was said to be a result of pneumonia. Peggy married John Eaton less than a year after her husbands death. Many surrounding women felt like the marriage of Peggy and John Eaton was not the correct thing to do.  The alleged affair controversy ultimately assisted many men in Andrew Jackson's cabinet to resign from their position, including John Eaton himself.  People begin to judge Jackson on the his position on the marriage. Andrew Jackson recommended that John Eaton and Peggy should get married, Jackson views resulted on from his personal experience he had with his first wife.A group of women emerged claimed to be Anti-Peggy who was led by Floride Calhoun. The women who emerged proclaimed rights and guidelines that women have to follow after death of husband including that they mourn and wear black for a year following their death.

=== Nullification Crisis ===

One of the early crises faced by the Jackson administration was the issue of nullification. In 1828, Congress decided to raise an already high tariff on imports from Europe. It was meant to help the industrialized North compete with Europe, but the agricultural South detested it, as it traded heavily with Europe. The South called it the &quot;Tariff of Abominations.&quot;  

The concept of nullification, that states had the right to nullify any federal law which it deemed went against its interests, had first appeared in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions in 1798. In response to the tariff, South Carolina declared it null and void. Vice President John C. Calhoun agreed with this notion of states’ rights and encouraged South Carolina to take a stand on the tariff issue.

Up until that point, no one was sure where Jackson stood on the issue of states' rights. Then, in April, 1830, he announced that he opposed states rights in this instance. While President Jackson sympathized with the South's position on the tariff, he believed in a strong union with central power. As a result, a deep rivalry developed between Jackson and Calhoun. The rivalry can be epitomized in an incident at the Jefferson Day dinner, April 13, 1830, in which South Carolina Senator Robert Hayne made a toast to &quot;The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.&quot; President Jackson added (and clearly directed towards the vice president), &quot;Our federal Union: It must be preserved!&quot; To this, Vice President Calhoun responded: &quot;The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!&quot;
In 1831, the first ever Democratic National Convention was held, and former Secretary of State Martin Van Buren (who was still playing a vital role in the President's &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;) was selected to replace Calhoun as the nominee for vice president in the 1832 election. The vice president resigned in December 1832 to run for the South Carolina U.S. Senate seat.

The South would not compromise on this lower tax, and South Carolina passed the Nullification Act which proclaimed that the state would no longer pay the &quot;illegal&quot; tariffs. South Carolina threatened to secede from the Union if the federal government tried to interfere. 

President Jackson continued to oppose nullification, stating that &quot;The Constitution... forms a government not a league... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation.&quot; In 1832 he asked Congress to pass a &quot;force bill,&quot; authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff law. The bill was held up in Congress until the great compromiser Henry Clay and the protectionists agreed to a Compromise Tariff bill. The Compromise Tariff contained a lower but still fairly high tariff. Both bills passed on March 1, 1833, and the president signed both. 

In the face of the threat of military force, South Carolina quickly agreed to the lower compromise tariff and abolished the Nullification Act. The crisis was averted for another day.

=== Indian Policies ===

The lives of the Indians became even more troubled once a man who had been a friend, Andrew Jackson, became President of the United States. In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, this act removed any claims of the indigenous people to the land.  This affected five tribes of the east—Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole. 
The act would subsequently resettle them into a designated Indian Territory, which would be where Oklahoma is today. In spite of legal protests from tribal leaders, Jackson wanted them gone, even if he had to use military force in order to do it.
Jackson decided that the Indians were a threat to national security. He also had a personal financial stake in some of the territory in question. With each treaty signed by the Native Americans, a white investor could purchase the ceded lands for themselves.
In spite of this, the Cherokee, continued to pursue justice legally and actually was victorious in 1832 when the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the individual states had no jurisdiction within tribal lands. Jackson, argued that Indian removal was in the national interest, and ignored the ruling. The aftermath becomes known as the  Trail of Tears. The Trail of Tears begins on October 8, 1832 and lasts for years. Indians are forced off of their land and migrate to the west.

=== Second Bank of the United States ===
The Second Bank of the United States began about 5 years after the First Bank of the United States fell. The Second Bank of the United States began in the same place as the first, Carpenters' Hall, Philadelphia. It had many branches through out the nation. Many of the same men from the First Bank ran the Second bank, when they refused to renew the charter of the First Bank. The main reason the Second Bank rose was because of the war of 1812. The U.S. suffered a horrible inflation and had trouble financing military operations.  Like the first, bank many speculators believed the bank was corrupt. Second Bank ending up suffering from similar issues as the first bank and was ultimately disposed.

=== Gag Rule ===
The Gag Rule of 1836 is a rule that limits or forbids the raising, consideration or discussion of a particular topic by members of a legislative or decision-making body. The term originated in the mid-1830s, about 1836, when the U.S. House of Representatives barred discussion or referral to committee of antislavery petitions.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The gag rule was supported by people involved in proslavery. The gag rule helped limit the progression of antislavery petitions. After antislavery petitions begin to emerge the democrats create initial gag orders to prevent the petitions.John Quincy Adams opposed the gag rule and said that limited and diregarded basic civil rights for free citizens. John Quincy Adams was member of the whig party with numerous pushed to eliminated the gag rule.

=== Panic of 1837 ===
The Panic of 1837 was a financial crisis in the United States because of frequent actions of buying and selling housing properties.This all happened in New York City, on May 10, 1837, when every bank began to accept payment in Specie(Gold and Silver). This also happened due to when President Andrew Jacksons came up with the Specie Circular and when he refused to renew the charter of the Second Bank[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837 .&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837&lt;/ref&gt;]

== Reform and American Society ==

=== The Second Great Awakening ===
The Second Great Awakening was a religious movement during the early 19th century in the United States. Which showed Arminian Theology, by which every person could be saved through revivals[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening .&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening&lt;/ref&gt;]The Awakening grew largely in opposition to deism related to the French Revolution. The Second Awakening grew after a revival in Uttica New York which was hosted by Charles Grandison Finney. Finney believed spoke to congregations in America stating that people were &quot; moral free agents.&quot; Charles spoke about Calvinist beliefs and that everyone had a defined destiny. Awakenings were described as spiritual and religious revivals where people will congregate and confess to their sins. By 1831 church membership had grew by 100,000 solely as a result to awakenings that were carried out by preachers like Charles Finney and Theodore Weld.

=== Temperance ===
Throughout the late 1700s and 1800s, alcoholism became an increasing problem, and as a result, temperance groups began forming in several states to reduce the consumption of alcohol.  Although the temperance movement began with the intent of limiting use, some temperance leaders such as Connecticut minister Lyman Beecher began urging fellow citizens to abstain from drinking in 1825.  In 1826, the American Temperance Society formed in a resurgence of religion and morality.  By the late 1830s, the American Temperance Society had membership of 1,500,000, and many Protestant churches began to preach temperance.

=== Public Education ===
In the New England states, public education was common, even though it was class-based with the working class receiving minimum benefits. Schools taught religious values and also taught Calvinist philosophies of discipline, including corporal punishment and public humiliation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England .&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England&lt;/ref&gt;]In 1833 Oberlin college had in attendance 29 men and 15 women. Oberlin college came to be known the first college that allowed women attend.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Within five years, thirty-two boarding schools enrolled Indian students. They substituted English for American Indian languages and taught Agriculture alongside the Christian Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Horace Mann was considered “The Father of American Education.” He wanted to develop a school that would help to get rid of the differences between boys and girls when it came to education. He also felt that this could help keep the crime rate down. He was the first Secretary for the Board of Education in Massachusetts in 1837-1848. He also helped to established the first school for the education of teachers in America in 1839.

=== Asylum Movement ===
The Asylum Movement was a social conscience that was increased in the early 19th century the helped raise the awareness of mental illness and its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anxiety-depression-treatment.com/articles/asylum-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;] The first asylum in America was in 1817 near Frankfort, PA. Later in 1817 another asylum emerged in Hartford, Connecticut. The asylums grew popularity and influenced other states to create asylums similar, like Massachusetts, Massachusetts State Lunatic Hospital in 1833. Prior to 1840 only wealthy people were permitted to the asylums. Many people that were mentally ill who did not have finances, were permitted to jails and almshouses.

=== Abolitionism ===
Abolitionism is the movement for which the purpose is to abolish slavery.  While many believed in the injustices that those in the south believed, there were also those who opposed the heinous acts they did to African Americans.  There were many people involved in helping slaves to escape to freedom. The movement was expanding.  As it got bigger and bigger the hostilities between the north and the south grew as well.  The Underground Railroad stemmed from the hearts and minds of these abolitionist freedom fighters.  Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were two popular African Americans who were a part of the abolitionist movement.

Hello everyone - Thanks for checking out my page!  My name is Regan Owens, and I am 23 years old.  I am originally from Mathews County, VA, but I currently reside in Virginia Beach.  Mathews is a very small town on the bay with no stop lights and TONS of old people.  As boring as it sounds, I am very thankful that I grew up in such a wonderful place.  My entire family still lives in Mathews, so I spend a lot of my time there.  For now, I wait tables to pay the bills.  I love food, so the fact that I have the opportunity to try new things at work is great for me.  I spend nearly all of my free time in the summer doing something water-related.  I love to go to the beach, swim, tan, fish and I hope to learn how to surf in the near future.  I also love to spend time with my family and friends, read, cook, eat, play with my dog, shop and travel.


After graduating high school, I attended Longwood University.  My goal at Longwood was to obtain a degree in elementary education.  After one semester, I was incredibly homesick, and I decided to move home.  Back in Mathews, I attended a local community college for two years.  Two years ago, I moved to Norfolk and started taking classes at ODU.  I am currently finishing up my bachelor’s degree in tourism and recreation management.  My original career goal was to become an event planner.  As I have gotten closer to obtaining my degree, however, I have realized that teaching is still what I really want to do.  Because teaching is still my passion, I have started taking the preliminary classes for a Master’s degree in education pre-k through 6.

'''My Educational Philosophy:'''


I like to think of my current education philosophy as a rough draft version.  Because this is my first class in the education field, my knowledge on the topic is limited.  I do know, however, that I believe every child has the ability to learn.  Some children may be better at learning than others, but I strongly believe that with enough support, encouragement and positive reinforcement, every child can learn.  Nothing breaks my heart more than a child being excluded.  I think that a great teacher is one who has the compassion and patience to take the most troubled child - show them how important they are, and give them the desire and motivation to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How Sauron Returns
___________________
The return of Sauron started with the death of Gollum. As Gollum was falling, He heard 
Sauron's voice promising to give him the One Ring in exchange for Gollum's life essence
which would bring Sauron back. Gollum agreed, but Sauron double-crossed Gollum and kept
the ring for himself and got Gollum's life essence. It was now time for Sauron to rule 
Middle Earth once again. It took 5-6 days for Sauron to regain all of his Orc warriors, 
but he soon re-gathered his army and now aimed his sights towards Gondor.


How each country was effeted by Sauron's return
_______________________________________________

Gondor
______

When King Aragorn heard of Sauron's return he fled Minas Tirith and headed towards the 
mountains where he would exile himself. The Orc army advances on Minas Tirith and Gondor
 makes a last minute decision for new king of Gondor. Gandalf is chosen to be King of 
Gondor and under Gandalf's leadership Minas Tirith survives the Orc attack and drive 
them back across the river Anduin. Gondor is safe for now, but for how long?


Rohan
_____

The news of Sauron's return spreads to Rohan and civil war breaks out and the citizens 
and warriors of Rohan must choose sides. The first is lead by Eomer, King of Rohan. The 
other by former prince of Gondor, Faramir. Faramir and his supporters are soon corrupted 
by the ring and drive Eomer and his followers out of Rohan with aid from the Wildmen of
Dunland. Eomer and his followers head North and build a settlement at Weathertop where 
they plan to retake Rohan from Faramir and his army. Faramir is then declared King of 
Rohan.


Rivendell
_________

The elves of Rivendell now send aid to Gondor and Weathertop. Elrond heads to Mirkwood 
where he seeks aid from the elven queen, Galadriel. Three days after Elrond's arrival 
in Mirkwood, the elven settlement is attacked and both Elrond and Galadriel are killed 
by the revived Uruk-Hai leader,Lurtz. Legolas escapes Mirkwood with some Elven citizens 
and warriors, but he is unable to reach Rivendell because of Orc search parties, so he 
is forced to take the survivors and settle in the now abandoned city of Erebor where he 
decides the Elves will rally any other Elven survivors and the Elves will make their 
finally stand there. The elves of Rivendell flee from the city and a messenger is sent 
from Erebor telling them the survivors from the attack on Mirkwood are rallying for a 
final stand there. The Rivendell elves led by Arwen head for Erebor.


Isengard
________

Treebeard and the Ents had already started fortifing the outer defenses of Isengard, but 
when they heard about Sauron's return they doubled their efforts. They soon started to 
send some of their Ent warriors to Weathertop, Erebor, Gondor, and other places arming 
for their upcoming battles with Sauron's forces. The Ents decide it is'nt safe for 
Treebeard to stay in Isengard, so Treebeard decides to take some of his Ent Warriors 
and head to the Shire where they hope they can evacuate the Hobbits before the war 
against Sauron reaches the Shire. While Treebeard heads to the Shire, the Ents of 
Isengard call for more Ents to coming and aid them in their defense of Isengard. More 
Ents arrive along with some Dwarven warriors led by Gimli. Sauron then sends Bill Ferny
with over 10,000 Orc soldiers to go and retake Isengard from the Ents. The Ents and the
Dwarves drive them back the Mines of Moria where Sauron decides he will bring back the 
Balrog to help exterminate the Ents once and for all.


The Shire
_________

The hobbits had not found out about the return of Sauron, so everything was back to the 
way it was before Frodo left the Shire to destroy the One Ring. Merry, Sam, and Pippin 
are now leaders in the Hobbit community and Frodo is mayor or Hobbiton. Treebeard 
finally reaches the Shire where he tells the Hobbits of Sauron's return. Frodo calls on 
the warriors of Dunedain for aid. The Dunedain arrive and the evacuation of the Shire 
begins. Frodo decides that the Hobbits will be evacuated to Weathertop where they will 
stay until they can find a new place for the Hobbits to settle where Sauron won't find 
them. Sauron then sends the resurrected Witch King of Angmar and his Nazgul to go find 
and kill Frodo so that the forces of Good won't have any way to defeat Sauron. The 
Nazgul reach the Shire to find Frodo gone, so Sauron commands them to kill anyone left 
in the Shire. Treebeard, the Ents, the Dunedain, and some Hobbit warriors defeat the 8 
Nazgul, but the Witch King escapes. The Hobbits reach Weathertop. Treebeard, the Ents, 
the Dunedain, and the remaining Hobbits instead of going to Weathertop, head to 
Osgiliath where they hope they can help Gondor hold off the advancing Orc armies and 
keep them from reaching the other places arming themselves for the war that is falling 
upon Middle-Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== '''Tonks and Lupin?''' ===

Lupin seems to not like Tonks in the way she loves him...is she pregnant already with Teddy or was Lupin basically forced into the marriage? Please clear this up for me! ~*CF12*~

:First off: Teddy was actually born in late March or early April (timeline: Draco was home from Hogwarts when Harry was captured by the Snatchers, so it must have been Easter break; Lupin's appearing at The Burrow was not very long after that). So Tonks would have &quot;caught&quot; nine months previous, in June or July. Not having a precise date for Teddy's birth, we equally don't have a precise date for conception. But based on this, we know that Tonks may or may not have been pregnant, likely did not know if she was, but was certainly trying to be, when we see her at the wedding.

:Lupin was somewhat railroaded into the marriage, though he was not forced. He simply still feels that it is irresponsible to bring a child, especially the child of a werewolf, into the world when it is such an insecure future he or she would be facing. One gathers that he does not know if his son will be lycanthrope; likely no werewolf has ever married a human before, and so nobody knows if the child will inherit his father's infection. It is his uncertainty about the child's future that is eating at him. He may or may bit know that Tonks is pregnant; her scent will have changed, and if he had transformed since she caught, he will know it.

:One thing is certain, though: reluctant as Lupin is, he will not have gotten Tonks pregnant until they were married. Lupin is emotionally the most mature of the Marauders, and will behave himself. But it is that same sense of maturity and responsibility that makes him unsure of whether he has done the right thing by giving in to Tonks' importuning and produced a child.

----


&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Briefly summarize the feedback you received on a recent writing assignment. Based on what you have heard in class and read in the two articles in this chapter, decide if this feedback was effective or ineffective. Justify your decision. Describe the feedback you would have liked to have received on the assignment.&lt;/span&gt;

''Add your response below under the appropriate heading (&quot;Effective Feedback Examples&quot; or &quot;Ineffective Feedback Examples&quot;). Extra credit will be awarded to multimedia responses. Don't forget to sign your response with four tildes.''



== Ineffective Feedback Examples ==

A few years ago, while I was studying to earn a masters degree, I took a course on Christian ethics.  We had several essay assignments.  I spent many hours working on each eassy.  I recall spending about a full week on one them--researching, etc., which was to be a 6 page paper. For each of the essays, I received back, the feedback included no more than a short phrase, or at most, a sentce.  One paper received the phrase:  &quot;Good start, but work on tightening the logic of your exposition;&quot;  and another paper received the phrase, &quot;This is pretty good.&quot;    Disappointed at one of my grades, I asked the TA if I could see an example of a paper by someone who earned an A.  I was given such a paper, and the only piece of feedback on this paper(besides the grade) was the phrase &quot;This is just wonderful.&quot;  It would have been helpful to my own learning if the evaluator had provided a rubric for grading and gave more insights on the mistakes and/or weaknesses of the paper, as well as how I could have improved the paper.

Last semester at ODU I took an English class where we did peer editing.  The problem was the class was for media writing which none of us knew how to do so we edited each others papers not knowing what we were doing.  The instructor also insisted that we not repeat words which I can understand but I wrote an article on recycling and she said I used the word recycling too much.  How many different ways can you say recycling and still keep the same meaning?  It was a thousand word article.  I was not the only one with this issue.  One paper I edited used the word recruit too many times but his paper was about his experience in boot camp.  He was a recruit not yet a soldier.  Basically none of us knew what to expect and were given awful grades on assignments where the blind was grading the blind.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:44, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

I took an English class at TCC where all the papers were checked by the students before the instructor graded it.  It made it easier for her I'm sure, and it forced us to read each others work.  Sometimes the students gave a quick review and graded easily, but in the long run when the other classmates were easy on you, it worked against you because the teacher was going to review your work anyway!  One drawback too was I bet not a lot of the students looked at what the instructor sent back, and she did a lot of hard work digitally highlighting and marking the work.

In one of my philosophy classes, I received feedback that i'm not sure if it was effective or inneffective. The paper came back merely saying &quot;B&quot;. On one hand, he did not tell me what I did good, or what I need to do to improve. On the other hand, I knew that it was what I thought of my paper that mattered.

Throughout my college and high school careers, I have had a wide range of feedback towards my papers.  The most ineffective, however, had to be a paper I wrote my freshman year of college in a Music Literature class.  This paper was supposed to be a response to a concert which we were assigned to attend.  The professor supplied us with a sample essay and a rubric for which to make notes on during the concert.  I followed the rubric as closely as I could, and expected to receive a high grade.  I was amazed to find that my professor did not respond well to my paper at all.  When I confronted her about it, she simply stated that I did not supply enough opinions, information and support to qualify for a high grade.  I was furious, because though I did exactly what she asked of me, I still did not receive a grade which was up to my standards.

I feel like I have always struggled with writing papers.  In high school as well as college I never received what I would call a good grade on a paper....above a C.  The most frustrating thing was I never really understood what all the read marks meant and never remember getting any specific feedback.  I believe that a students success and progress really depends on proper feedback.  Effective feedback that you can understand and keep in mind for the next assignment.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 04:43, 30 May 2009 (UTC)   


Assignments I have received in the past three years have been very frustrating.  I believe in some cases professors give back such little feedback because they do not want students to possibly question them as to why they were counted off for certain things.  I had one professor that if there was any question asked why this was marked wrong or why a grade does not add up she would immediately become defensive.  It was unbelievable and quite frustrating.  I understand where both articles we read disscuss the importance of objective and positive reinforcing comments on every assignment.  It does not take a lot of time to sit down and write a few sentences to a student on their assignment.  I was not one of the students that wanted clerification on &quot;good job!&quot; but I did want clerification when something was marked wrong.  If there was not a comment or some reasoning behind deducting points I would always meet with the professor and discuss it.  I also believe red pens have got to go.  Marking everything with red pens, I believe, is such a psychological downer.  I know there are many theories behind this.  I have even read pieces on getting rid of X's on wrong answers.  I know there are many thoughts out there but as an educator we need to look at what is best for the students and what will bring them the most help.

I recently graduated this Spring 2009 semester and one of my last courses provided me with some ineffective feedback on one of my papers. I had written a paper on Child Abuse and Neglect and the only comment that was provided on the reference page was good job. Considering that throughout the papers some red marks were made regarding grammatical and mechanical errors, the only written feedback I received was at the end of the paper with &quot;good job&quot;. I felt that although I received a good grade on the paper, it was a ten page research paper and I felt that simply writing good luck was not sufficient enough of feedback. I believe that if my professor had gone through and told me what parts of my paper were a good job and what parts were not, that I would be able to know and replicate the good parts in future papers. However, now I am not sure if the whole paper was good, or if overall my paper was good despite certain areas that need improvement. I have had this happen multiple times with teachers in the past and believe that in order for students to have a goal to ascribe to and understand their current level of work, professors need to provide students with more detailed feedback including indication of what their current level of work is, and what they need to do to reach that desired level of work that the professor is looking for.

I have taken the majority of my college classes on-line.  Most of them have been strictly web driven with the exception of a couple of video streaming classes.  While I treat these classes just as I would treat a traditional seated class, some of my professors have been less than forthcoming with useful feedback on writing assignments.  One of my courses required that I write four essays which were due at various points in the semester.  I always try to complete my assignments in a timely manner.  What I always noticed was that as soon as an essay was submitted (often early), it was graded and returned almost immediately, often with a 100 or 10/10.  The feedback that was given (on Bb) was very generic and usually consisted of two words ...good job.  I consider myself a good writer but I am far from perfect.  When the marked copy was returned to me, it was covered with marks and sometimes teacher comments.  I guess I don't understand how one can go from good job to a bloody paper and still get 10/10.  What could I have done to make my essay better?  For that fact, did it even matter?

I recently took a course that required many ambiguous writing assignments.  They weren't labeled as either formal research papers or simple informal, opinion papers.  They were ambiguous!  I have spent my days writing neverending term papers and also stories and poetry for creative writing courses.  I felt as if I had a solid understanding of the writing process, but feedback to these assignments made me believe otherwise.  I was left questioning my abilities.  Even worse, my inabilities were made an example of in class.  How embarrassing.  I had given these assignments a valuable college effort and apparently, I did not make the cut.  I chuckle because I journal a lot and have never truly doubted my capabilities. I was told I have a stream of concsiousness problem? (I think that's what it was called?)  I think that's what it's called when an instructor doesn't exactly agree with my style, or provide solutions, especially since I received an &quot;A&quot; in the class.

I have received positive feedback, as well as negative feedback in my college courses...funny how the negative feedback seems to be remembered more. The first instance was in a History class. We were discussing ancient history. I wrote a paper with some reference to religion during the time period. The grade I received was a big F at the top and a note beside it that simply said &quot;There is no God&quot;. I am assuming the professor was an atheist, although I did not get a chance to speak with him about his reasoning. The second instance was during my conventional in-class time in a English 102 course. The class spent a few weeks discussing and writing poetry. Note: I have spent many years writing poetry, have won awards, and have been published...not that I think I am one of the great poets like Frost or Yeats, etc...however, it was a nice feeling to have people relate too and understand my writing. I wrote a poem for my assignment that came from the heart (or so I thought); however, my professor returned my paper stating that it was &quot;literary drivel...you will never make it as a writer...this is college, not kindergarten...&quot; basically, she was telling me that I should not give up my day job. I went to her office to speak with her about the poem and how I could correct my mistakes. She informed me that I should give up now because she did not have time for this nonsense...needless to say, I left in tears and dropped her class. In both of these instances, the professor's were negative to the point of being mean (especially, the last one). Instead, it would have been better if they could have '''stated''' '''exactly''' '''why''' they did not like or agree with my papers. If a paper has a lot of marks on it, but does not have any side notes...the student is not going to understand why the marks are there, i.e. is the word spelled wrong; wrong choice; not descriptive, etc. No one likes to receive a bad grade, but having a bad grade without any feedback is even worse.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 05:25, 28 May 2009 (UTC)


This past semester a big portion of my grade in an art history class was a research paper. I spent about half the semester working on the paper and felt that I had done a good job. When I got the paper back there were no corrections written anywhere on the paper. The last page simply said 95 A+ good job. Now as overjoyed as I was to receive an A+, I know I did not have a perfect paper and wish I had been given at least a small amount of feedback regarding areas I could have improved on!

I recently wrote a paper for a Special Education class on the effects of labeling. Labeling is the system that educators use to define what special needs students may have. This was an 8-10 page paper, and when I received it back I received an &quot;A&quot;. However, my teacher commented that I should have &quot;elaborated&quot; more, and this was the only comment I received. I was both surprised and confused by this comment, as I did not know where in this long paper I could have elaborated. If my teacher had told me that I should have elaborated and provided further examples on page 7, paragraph 4, I would have been able to go back to the specific section of the paper. I could then review the section and consider suggestions for improvement. But because of this broad statement, I was unsure of where to make improvements. In the future, I hope to receive more specific feedback. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 21:50, 29 May 2009 (UTC)


Rubrics are something that are a fairly new concept for me.  I don't remember actually hearing the term rubric till just this past year.  Going through my educational career I always wondered how papers were graded.  Teachers/Professors always seemed to tell us what they were looking for, but it seemed to be a totally subjective evaluation on their part.  I have never been a strong writer in any subject.  When I did write in my degree programs, feedback was always very vague.  To the point where I was wondering if the professors actually read the paper.  I was always tempted to put in some obvious (as opposed to my unintended) mistakes to see if they were caught.  Grammar was something that was usually caught, but thought formation and flow of a paper was something that was rarely critiqued.  I am pleased to be teaching in a school division that relies heavily on the rubrics for their courses.  My department goes as far as to require the student to include the rubric on their paper/project when it is turned in.  I try hard to make sure I provide quality feedback to my students so they do not feel the same way. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 14:31, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


I will never forget my last semester of college. I done an internship in a pharmacy that summer and that fall I had to write six different papers of varying lengths to finish the class. I had some hard classes that semester but I turned major hours getting these papers done. After I finished them and turned them into the professor I felt like they were not up to par. I had citied all my work and have several sources for each paper, but I still didn't feel good about them. Some weeks later I received my papers from my professor via mail. When I started going through them, all I noticed was a red check mark at the top corner of each page. At the very end of the last paper was a short response from the professor.....&quot;Good work. Have a nice summer. Dr.R.&quot; I felt like he didn't even read them which hurt because I put so much work in them and I knew that they weren't that great. Why did I even waste my time? Oh yea, I forgot to tell you it was the dead of winter when I received them (nice summer huh?)[[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:42, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


Writing for me is quite difficult.  It may take the average person 10-15 minutes to write a response, yet I continually go back to change and manipulate the material.  I was the person in high school that had five drafts before the final result.  Needless to say I'm required to put a lot of time into my writing to get the grades I strive for.  I believe I'm this way because I've had little effective feedback from paper's in the past, even the one's I did horribly on.  More recently I wrote a paper that I thought was written quite well...the professor thought otherwise.  He marked it with the red pen, told me I needed to change some things, and improve my organization.  I'm aware that professor's at this level expect you to know how to write.  However, would it be that hard if they saw a continual pattern in my writing to offer tips or suggestions?  Granted, I know it's my responsibility to keep up to par, but I can only teach myself so much. How many times is he gonna write the same comments with that red pen before he decides to offer whatever knowledge he might have to make my life easier. I wish he would've addressed the problem and offered some useful tips that he's experienced in organizing a paper. If every professor gave me a gem from their educational treasure box I think I'd be in a lot better shape.[[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 18:05, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


I have always thought that writing was one of my strong suits, so I usually have done well on writing assignments.  I have, however, had assignments in my long and drawn out college career, that I have received great grades on but no feedback was given on how to improve.  This lead me to believe that I could attain an A on a paper but there was no feedback on what I could do to keep it there!  I know this could be construed as whining and I hope that no one looks at me like that, but feedback is a way for all of us to improve ourselves.  I am not an English major, I enjoy writing and have done well so far, but I am sure that there is room for improvement for everyone.  Even if a person gets a good grade, please let them know what they did right and be sure to point out the faults.  Feedback is important for both good and bad graded assignments!

I will not soon forget my personal experience with the quintessential example of ineffective feedback. I took an honors course in college entitled The 1960's: Film and Society. The entire point of the semester long class was to pick a movie, director or sequence of movies from the 60's and analyze that movie considering the state of the world and thus the social reflections of the film(s). The only grade in the class was the final paper which was to be the culmination of an entire three months of research. With little tidbits here and there from the professor, there were only minimal guidelines and feedback offered. At the end of the semester with 25 pages in hand, which seemed to be a tremendous amount to me at the time being a sophomore math major, I turned in my paper and prayed. Although I have never have any problem writing papers, with such little amount of direction offered, I had no idea if I had even written on an appropriate topic. Two weeks later, final grades were posted and sure enough I got an A+, but I have no idea how or why. To this day, I have never seen the graded copy of my paper on Dr. Strangelove. I emailed and even attempted to make appointments with the professor, but all to no avail. Feedback is bad enough when it is ineffective, but it is worse still when there is no feedback at all.

I recently made an attempt to write my exit exam. I knew when I walked out of the room I did not pass. Although I have not gone in to receive any feedback I know what some of the comments will be. I struggle with ideas on what to write about. Not that I do not have anything to say, I just find it difficult to express what I am thinking, also I am still learning to type so my brain moves much faster than my fingers, by the time I get two words typed I forgot what I wanted to express.  With all the writing it looks like I will be doing for this class maybe that will change.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 03:11, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

== Effective Feedback Examples ==
I learned a lot about writing in my English 111 and English 112 classes when attending SVCC and I want to thank those teachers.  I had to do an action research project on any subject that I wanted.  What a headache!  There were different components to do the action research project but I did not know exactly where to put the information.  When I got the paper back,  the instructor gave me some very good feedback as to my writing and what should go into the action research project and what should be taken out.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 02:42, 31 May 2009 (UTC)


I recently finished taking an undergrad World History class that I needed to complete in order to get my teaching license. In that class, all of the tests that we took were identifications, short answers and essays. On each of the test, we were required to compare and contrast 2 things (countries, events, etc.) for the essay portion. My professor gave great feedback on all portions of the test, but especially the essay portion. He did not just put &quot;needs more details&quot; or &quot;needs more dates&quot; or anything vague like that. He offered useful feedback that made me think. He gave some examples but didn't spell everything out for me either. He would make comments like, &quot;how about this person or place?&quot;, &quot;how would this event have worked into the essay?&quot; I was able to realize what he was looking for in general and learned what to include as each test passed. The teacher's comments were specific enough that I could see what I needed for that essay in particular, yet it was a hint that I needed to include more from then on. I really found those comments motivating and positive and really helpful. When I saw the teacher's positive thoughts from the beginning, I was pleased to know that I had given some good information. In addition to this, through his suggestions, I learned how to improve in the future! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 18:07, 29 May 2009 (UTC)


I recently completed a poetry class.  To me, poetry is like art and music.  Each of us has different tastes and “beauty is in the eye of the beholder”.  Although I enjoy reading some poetry, analyzing poems is an entirely subjective matter and if five people read the same poem, there would be five different interpretations.  In my poetry class, I was tasked with reading and answering questions about poems such as: “What evidence in this poem is there for the necessity of a symbolic interpretation?  What is your symbolic interpretation?”  I must say that my professor gave appropriate and constructive feedback.  She would explain exactly what I had missed in my interpretations and cite lines in the poem to make her point.  I always understood exactly her point of view, even if I didn’t agree with it.  When she liked my interpretations, she told me so and cited exactly why.  She made something as subjective as poetry interpretation concrete and objective and helped me understand some of the how and why poets write as they do.  I now have a deeper appreciation for how much work truly goes into a writing a poem.  Her good feedback made all the difference in how well I performed in the class.

Being a music student, I am not required to complete many writing assignments. Last semester, though, I was required to write a 10-12 page term paper for my Vocal Pedagogy class (a class on teaching voice). For the paper we wrote about two topics: the first half of the paper was about the anatomy and processes of the voice and singing, while the second half was about a choice topic. My choice topic was &quot;Exploring the Middle Voice in Full Lyric Sopranos.&quot; When we received our papers, I was very pleased with the feedback that my professor gave me. All of the feedback followed the correct format; as in, it was specific and constructive, yet positive. Since the topics I wrote my paper on are essential to what I will be teaching in the future, the feedback that was provided for me helped me understand what I already know and what I need to review.

As an undergraduate student I majored in psychology, which translates to having to write a great deal of papers.  I would write 10-30 page papers regularly.  I enjoy writing papers, but more than that I enjoy getting positive feedback on my papers.  I have always felt I put a lot of time and effort into each paper so yes the grade is important, but I also want to know the professor enjoyed reading my work.  I had one undergraduate course that we were required to write a 10-12 page paper. I chose to write mine on ethnicity and counseling.  When I received my paper back I was very surprised the professor broke down every paragraph and gave me feedback.  I received and A on the paper which made me happy, but I was so much happier knowing she really did take the time to read the paper and inform me of good or great information and sources.  I have written many papers at ODU, but never had one professor make me feel like all the time and effort I put into the research and writing of the paper paid off.[[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 19:21, 27 May 2009 (UTC)


A few semesters ago I had to write a 10 page research paper on a Japanese god. As I knew very little about Japan, or their gods, it was a paper I felt rather flustered on. When it was finally time to turn in the paper I felt that I understood the topic I had spent hours researching. However, when I received the graded paper it was marked up with red ink all over and I was given a C-. After reading through the corrections I could not make heads or tail of any of them! I set up an appointment with my professor and she went through each paragraph of the 10 pages with me, specifically pointing out what needed correcting and what I had misinterpreted in the Japanese culture. The meeting lasted almost an hour and when I left I had a better understanding of the culture and what I needed to do to improve my paper. The professor even gave me some of her personal books to use as references! When I turned in the rewrite of the paper my C- turned into a 100 A+, and the only reason I could figure is because I listened to all of my professors helpful feedback, suggestions and tips (and of course returned all of her books! :-D ) [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 00:18, 29 May 2009 (UTC)


I graduated in December 2008 with a BS in Psychology from ODU. During my last semester, I decided to sign up for a Supervised Research class. For for this class, we wrote an entire APA style research article under the supervision of one of the faculty members. While this was certainly not an easy task to write such a long paper, the fact that I had such a wonderful professor to work with made the experience much better. During that semester, I wrote countless drafts and finally wound up with a paper that I was very proud of. My professor took a lot of time out of her busy schedule once or twice a week to meet with me, read my draft, and give me feedback. While I felt overwhelmed sometimes, her positive constructive feedback left me wanting to try harder and make changes to better my final paper. She corrected any grammar issues, as well as content and formatting issues. In the end, I had a much better appreciation for Psychology researchers and also was very proud of my A+ that I had worked so hard for. I may have been able to write a mediocre paper by myself in a lot less time, but was so thankful that I had wonderful feedback throughout the entire semester and was able to produce a paper that I was proud of.[[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 14:43, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


As I attended school for my BA in Business at the University of Puerto Rico I took an English writing class as an elective with the goal of improving my writing skills. I knew I would be moving to the states and possibly continuing my education so I took the challenge. As the class progressed and I found myself drowning in a sea of writing assignments on different topics, I found the feedback received by my professor to be very much helpful. I noticed that my choice of words and sentence structure had improved because the teacher had “murdered” my earlier papers. My professor never held back on feedback. She gave me tips on how to research topics as well as the use of correct quoting and references making a paper more reliable. She always pushed me to believe that I could get it done with the hopes of arriving to her level of expectation. I wrote a paper about how I thought that having uniforms in public schools would improve students in every way. I was so proud of myself, I finally got across the point that I wanted in the correct way. Using more explicit wording and having improved my researching skills, I finally got an A. Even thought that still came with some feedback about how I could still improve the paper I was happy to receive it because it would let me know in what areas I still needed a positive push. I still keep this paper not only because it was very important to me because of the topic, but because I worked as hard as I could on the assignment. This experience helped me accomplish a personal goal as well as improve my writing skills. [[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 16:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


Although it has taken several years to gain my coinfidence, I consider myself a fairly good writer. Therefore, I greatly appreciate teachers who give me informative and constructive feedback on my writing assignments. One of these teachers is a history teacher, who I have had here at Old Dominion University for my Bachelor’s as well as at Thomas Nelson Community College for my Associate’s. Here grading style is that you almost never receive a perfect grade, but come very close to it. I have met many students who are discouraged by this, but I find this type of feedback very encouraging because it pushes me to do better writing than in my other classes. She also gives very good feedback on the content and technicality of your paper. For example, last semester I had her for Women’s History and submitted a draft to her. She gave comments on mechanical errors, since one of my weaknesses as a writer is run-off sentences. However, she also commented on the content of my paper, which I believe is one of my strengths. She offers, at least in my opinion, a balance of your strengths and weakness in writing while pertaining to the paper’s topic. She has a great sense of balance of assessing the content of your paper, with the technical and mechanical aspects as well. As a writer, I feel that while it is important to have a grammatically sound paper, it is perhaps even more important to have a paper that is strong in content. However, it is good to have a teacher like her for student such as me, because I know that she will be grading accordingly on all aspects of my paper, including grammar and content.

Coming from a Spanish language dominated island, it was hard for me at first to write good papers in English. It took me several bad grades and countless sleepless nights to raise my GPA not only to keep my scholarship, but keep playing baseball and finally have decent grades in my English class. It was not until last semester where I received positive feedback from my professor. She made it clear that our research paper that contained not only traditional argument styles but also Rogerian argument influences would count for more than 50 percent of our final grade. Since she took the time to know my classmates and my struggles throughout the semester, she held a 20 minute conference with each student, where she see the writing from the students point of view, and  review our rough drafts with us. In this time, she not only pointed out my more than common grammar errors but she helped me shorten my words to form complete and precise sentences. Like the articles we have read bout feedback, my professor took the time to ask &quot;what we meant&quot; or &quot;why do you think that idea is beneficial?&quot;.These questions helped me develop my point as well as provide further detail to help the reader understand the point that I wanted to make. She pointed out my strengths, quality of my work,  what she liked (cognitive and motivational factors) and help me expand these ideals throughout my research paper. In these feedback conferences I learned a lot like highlighting my goal and how to make my writing better and precise. Although I'm still not a perfect writer, I feel that I learned much from my professor.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 21:47, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


Last semester my English teacher wouldn't really be very constructive with her comments. She taught her class like we were all Graduate English majors or something. When in reality it was English 110. When she did leave comments they were all basically x's and question marks. I personally don't think that is a very constructive. I think that a teacher should at least tell you a couple things that I would be able to use to improve my paper. It would be different if there was a question mark missing, but no it was along the lines of &quot;what does this mean?&quot;. Also in the band classroom if a director just tells me that a certain thing was wrong and doesn't either explain another way to finger a certain note or play a certain rhythm then how is it going to get any better.

Before I read this article I didn't think it was that important to use rubrics. Rubrics seemed helpful when doing my work in college but could elementary students know how to use them? According to this article they can and have. I was not giving students enough credit for being able to manage their work.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:31, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Article 1 had a number of helpful insights about various issues concerning teachers.  Section 1.6 deals with the question of whether or not the best teachers are highly qualified.  All too often, people look at being &quot;highly qualified&quot; as nothing more than a set of academic degrees and credentials.  The author of this section points out that such degrees are in fact important for being highly qualified.  At the same time, the author makes the point that such credentials are not enough and contrary to common perception, being highly qualified goes beyond this.  The author lists a number of features for what it means to be highly qualified.  To be highly qualified, a teacher needs to be very passionate about his/her work, know the content of what they're teaching, avoid a boring classroom environment, know how to build repoire with students, challenge students, and demonstrate the fruit of their success with strong test scores.  In this section of the chapter, the author was effective at showing how being &quot;highly qualified&quot; presupposes these traits, going beyond the common notion of what the phrase means.

From this article  I got that rubrics are vital in a teacher's overall grading process in order to achieve some level of equality in their grading.  The problem occurs when deciding what the points on the rubric should or should not be.  I think that it is a very valid point that assignments should be graded on their strengths and weaknesses rather than a strict rubric.  All students are different and have different styles of writing.  Though different, one might not be better than the other.  This type of grading allows for greater grading equality and subjectiveness.  [[User:Abeck017|Abeck017]] ([[User talk:Abeck017|talk]]) 02:45, 31 May 2009 (UTC)


This article really made me think about the different uses for a rubric and its importance in teaching the student and the teacher. I had never really thought about having a student's work as a tool to inform the teacher about places for improvement; however, it makes sense that by reading the work, not only can the student see the mistakes, but the teacher can learn ways to improve as well. Rubrics are used because they are subjective in nature, but this can also be a challenge. They do not offer a great deal of useful feedback when only a single number is given without comments. I really liked Figure 2 in the article. It incorporated aspects of the standard rubric with teaching points as well. If educators (and those grading the student's work) were to use more 'rubrics' like the one in this article, I think the success rate and writing quality would greatly increase!

This article was very interesting.  I do believe that many teachers and educators battle the thought of a rubric.  It is important for educators to have an objective approach to graded any and all work.  I would agree the second option the author presented was a better rubric to use.  I have always found in my experience that I did not agree with many of the ruberics I have come across.  I believe that a simple ruberic can be one of the best in certain situations.  I think it is great for anyone grading a childs piece of writing to focus on the strengths and weakness.  I would agree this approach ha a clearer ouline in the rubric compaire to the first where many were giving scores ranging from 2-4.  To conclude I do agree with a use of a ruberic because it gives students that ability to gain more points and also receive positive feedback on assignments.

I found this article to be effective in describing an alternative to traditional assessment and feedback to student writing.  Most educators have provided feedback with a traditional strict scoring rubric.  Scoring with a traditional rubric often leaves little wiggle room and leaves teachers struggling to find the appropriate score for a specific trait.  Utilizing a rubric which identifies an individual student's strengths and weaknesses, based on what they wrote, provides feedback that the student can understand.  Identification of strengths builds condfidence in the writer while identification of weaknesses allows for productive disucssions that can lead to better writers.  I have participated in fifth grade writing workshops where the teachers stressed the grading rubric used by DOE to grade the writing test.  To most students this rubric is little more that a list of numbers.  I believe that the addition of the rubric identifying student strengths and weaknesses would allow students to become more confident in their writing, which would lead to higher scores.  Overall, I believe that this is an excellent article that is well written.  I intend on sharing it with my co-workers.

I enjoyed reading this article because it discussed the difference between using a strict grading rubric, and using a rubric while also identifying strengths and weaknesses in the students writing. I think  the latter is the better grading system, as students can see their grade(s) but also determine the positive and negative aspects of their writing to help with their future assignments. If all teachers begin to use similar grading strategies, I belive they will see a vast improvement in the grades and test scores of their students. This article was very well written and I like how the author gave a description and example of each rubric used. Each main point was followed by many descriptive examples.

I found this article to be very informative because it gives two types of rubric ideas for educators.  As detailed as the figure one grading rubric was, the second figure gave students ideas and stategies they could use for future writing assignments.  I believe students could possibly perform better if they know what they did wrong or what could be a stronger point in a paper. Students could also find ways they can make their writing stronger using bulleting and receiving the strengths as well as weaker points of their paper.  I was pleased the rubrics were posted within the article as it helped the reader understand the difference between the two rubrics more clearly.  I would have preferred to have the second figure as a rubric when I was in grade school.  I also would have found it helpful to have been given tips to write better, or my strengths and weaknesses of a paper, not just a letter grade and a &quot;greatjob.&quot;  Overall, this was in interesting article.[[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 19:04, 27 May 2009 (UTC)


While reading this article I came to realize again one of the benefits of being a Physical Education Teacher.  In physical education our rubrics are very cut and dry.  When I am assessing the skill of skipping in 1st graders, it is very easy for me to assess if they can perform the skill.  This article gave me a better understanding of the use of rubrics in writing assessments.  When a student is given a single score whether it is &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, or &quot;4&quot;, I believe they still need written or verbal feedback that they can use when they are either editing their work or for their next writing assignment.  [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 22:27, 28 May 2009 (UTC)


I found this article to be very interesting. I agree, the second rubric seemed to be more helpful for the student to grow and learn from their writing assignments. I also think that using the two rubrics together would work nicely, as one was quite specific in what was/was not missing and the other was more informative to the student on how to improve and what to work on. Since I am going to teach art, the second rubric would become more beneficial in an art classroom. Rules in art are not strictly black and white, as a lot of writing rules are. Art is subjective, therefore a strict rubric would not be helpful in grading artwork. The second rubric in the article gave more lead-way and gave teachers a chance to explain to students what they can do to improve their work, as well as strategies and goals to use to improve.

I enjoyed reading this article because it was clear, concise and depicted two types of rubrics. I liked the second rubric because it seems to be more detailed than the first rubric.  Using rubrics is a good way for assessment and scoring. Assessing a student's ability is not something you can briefly skim over or watch. Having some sort of rubric to place each point is a great way that a teacher can separate their standards for the assignment. Although rubrics are a great way to separate the points in a paper, master a skill, etc., I think written feedback needs to be a part of the process. In order for students to understand what does and does not meet standards, rubrics can be used as a starting point for scoring, but really need to be followed up with feedback so that the student is not left wondering about specifics.

This article really made me think about some of the past papers that I have written and how my work was graded based on a ruberic. Some may have been effective and some were probably like the one in this article and would not have very good inter-rater reliability. The first ruberic in the article look like a standard ruberic where a teacher will pick a score based on certain traits. However with this ruberic, the Content and Organization as well as the Style and Fluency were all grouped together and fell under a one certain number. If I am understanding this ruberic correctly, a student can only get one score, for both Content and Style, which should be graded separately. The second ruberic that was proposed seem to be very effective. It was very clear on what requirements were met, and which ones were not and even gives a place for the teacher to write what instructional strategies that this particular writer could benefit from. I think that this ruberic will help the student and the teacher by giving them both the understanding of what the student understands, and what the student needs to improve on as well as what the next steps will be in order to improve.

After carefully reading this article I realized how important it is for all teachers to pay detailed attention to each student writing assignments. It teaches that all students are not at the same level of writing skills expected. I found the first rubric style to be too strict not benefiting the student in any way. In the first style rubric there was way that it would notify the student of what areas where in need of work in the future to obtain a better score. I think that the second rubric style allows teachers to help students identify their strength and weaknesses better in their own work. This style of rubric should be followed by direct feedback from the teacher to allow students to better understand what their work is lacking in and what the teacher is expecting. Students writing can also inform the teacher about his or her way of teaching as well. If the teacher finds that many students are lacking in a specific area of writing then the teacher should go over that topic.  There may have been a chance that the class did not understand the topic as well as the teacher thought.  Reviewing the area that was not understood can help raise the witting skills and better their scores in the future using the second rubric scoring style along with direct feedback from the teacher.

I found this article to be very informative to future educators. It was clear that the second rubric was more beneficial to the student than the first. While reading rubric one I felt that I couldn't make a choice between giving the student a 2 or a 3. It would've been hard for me to decide and it wouldn't have given the student any idea on how to make her paper better or what made it enjoyable to read. The second rubric seemed to fit just right. It was balanced and incorpated ideas/strategies for the student to use on future writing assignments. I believe that we need to constantly think of ways to make rubrics better. We know they are beneficial to the education profession and we need to keep working on them to make them as helpful as possible to both educators and students.

I sighed a deep breath following the analysis of this article.  I thought it was brilliant that they used the original rubric as a foundation to improve upon.  The new model not only assesses the writer but offers advice as to the next step to improve on the student's weaknesses. Criticism proves more constructive when it's supported by solutions versus mere statement of problems.  Since I was homeschooled, my mother was not exposed to these rubrics to asses my writing levels.  Like the fourth grader in the example, I have a difficult time with organization in writing, yet I tend to have the facts and be able to convey them.  I've always received feedback from this fault, but seldom have solutions been offered. &quot;You need to work on your organization&quot; has been the story of my life.  I've managed to teach myself several techniques to aid my growth in this area.  I just feel that had I been exposed to this rubric model as a young child I could've addressed the problem earlier.  Instead, it has manifested itself into a monster that scares me out of writing.  Anyhow, I'm excited to observe the continual evolvement of these rubrics.  With each step we're getting closer to more accurately assess and ultimately assist the student in his or her learning experience.[[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 17:47, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


After taking ECI 432, or Instructional Strategies for Teaching Language Arts for Prek-6, I found this particular article interesting and informative, since it dealt with assessing student writing. The opening quote, “If you read carefully, a poem will teach you how to read it”, is something teacher should keep in mind when they are assessing something as subjective as writing. Although I feel many teacher have made progress as far as grading writing assignments, they still do many common mistakes, such as focusing more on correcting student mistakes than using strategies where students can fix their errors themselves. Another issue that caught my attention the author, Mark Overmeyer, commented that many of the teachers in his district spend a large amount of time on scoring and cross-scoring. I am very pleased that teachers have raised their expectations for student writing and performance level. However, it does disturb me that so much time is dedicated to just the scoring of writing samples and teachers struggling with certain scores. I believe that it takes several hours to make an authentic assessment of student writing. At the same time, I also see educators becoming exhausted after just grading a few writing assignments and then unintentionally giving a lower or higher score on the rest of the class’s papers. This problem can most likely be solved by keeping the main goal of writing assessment in mind; look at student writing as a way to develop strategies so that students can write better. Once teachers and students start to know what their strengths and weaknesses are, they can use a variety of skills to become better writers.

This article is a great way for teachers to realize that there is always room for improvement.  That is the thing that I love the best about learning about education, realizing that there have been advancements in grading and teaching that will help teachers to keep within the guidelines but also be able to evaluate writing as an individual work.  It helps the teachers and the students when there are guidelines so that there is a framework to assign a grade, but the adjustment in the rubric gave the ability of the teacher to grade the work to reflect the writer's strengths and weaknesses instead of just assigning a number.
[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 19:28, 30 May 2009 (UTC) 


There were numerous issues touched on in this article. One of the most essential is that there is always room to improve and so everything especially a teacher's grading should be reviewed often by peers. Although this article had very practical advice for the use of rubrics to grant students appropriate feedback, and avenues to advance from that feedback, I could not help but ponder my own thoughts on rubrics themselves. As a math teacher, I do not usually use rubrics except on projects, however even still I find them limiting. As the author mentioned when giving a student a single score, it is hard to give a student appropriate credit due to the vague or broad nature of a rubric. Rubric are utilized to make grading objective, but in order to do so, they must be broad and usually vague to encompass all possibilities. In my opinion, not matter how well written a rubric is, it is still lacking. Even in rubric that are broken down into categories, there is always something missing. In my experience, to have a thorough category rubric there are almost limitless possibilities for categories, when you are force to bind yourself to only a few of the most essential categories, then you are so binding the prospective from which you will grade. Overall, rubrics are very useful, and practical for providing feedback, however there will always be a few papers/ projects that really stretch the bounds of a rubric.

I think that there is a lot that teachers can learn from the writing of there students. First off, it shows the students strengths and weaknesses as a writer. It can also show what material needs to be covered more with in the classroom. There are several other things that both the student and the teacher can learn from analyzing a students paper.[[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 02:42, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

The feedback described in this article seems appropriate and something that shoud just be an obvious way to deliver feedback.  Looking back at my own experience with teachers tells me that is not true. I did have dfficulty understanding why we would not make corrections on the everything. Wouldn't this be demonstrating te correct way? However, I can see why we would not want to confuse the student with minor corrections at a young age.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 02:41, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I liked the different examples in this article.  The author brought up a good point when she mentioned the importance of giving positive feedback where it's due.  It would be impossible to be an effective teacher without providing enough feedback for students in the proper manner.  There is certainly a fine line between being direct and informative, and saying something that may rub a student the wrong way.  I think it's important to keep sensitity in mind.  I remember the worst thing I ever found written on one of my papers in school was &quot;SEE ME AFTER CLASS&quot;.  That is never a good thing to find written on your paper.  There is no reason to scare students, positive &amp; effective feedback goes a long way!

This article brought up some good points. If the point of school is to get a grade and get out, then a rubric is perfectly acceptable. If the goal is to learn something, then the teacher needs to give feedback that tells the student what they did good, and what they need to do to improve. The teacher can't just grade writing so that all a student needs to do is re-write it. When my violin teacher would give me feedback, instead of saying, &quot;your intonation was wrong here&quot; or &quot; play this phrase with more of an arc&quot; he would ask &quot;how was your intonation&quot; or &quot;how were your phrases&quot;. I would hate him, but it was good for me. [[User:Rebecca.hechler|Rebecca.hechler]] ([[User talk:Rebecca.hechler|talk]]) 04:17, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
 
I think this was a very helpful article on feedback.  This is a very important part of a teachers job.  The author clearly states how this can be a real problem.  She states the main topic and has supporting ideas on how to give effective feedback that students can understand.  The article addresses the when, how much, and mode of feedback which are all important.  The nature of communication matters a great deal. The author also give some great examples to show the difference of good verses bad feedback.  One thing that stood out in my mind was that &quot;good feedback contains information that the student can use.&quot;  The goal of all teachers is to help all students grow in a positive manner.  As teachers we will need to master the nature of feedback.[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 05:15, 30 May 2009 (UTC)   


The article on constructive feedback was a great explanation of how teachers can aide students in their own individual learning journeys.  Today, classrooms are extremely diverse, but learning targets are unfortunately not.  Baseline standards are in place so that students can pass rigorous high stakes tests for their particular grade level.  Although my opinions of these highs stakes tests are not of admiration or fondness, they are still a sad, bureaucratic reality.  Nonetheless, if students must focus on specific learning targets, teachers must be able to effectively evaluate and assess individual work and progress.  Proper feedback is critical.  Therefore, teachers must remain current with research in this particular area.  Opportunely, the assigned assessment article explains various modes of feedback delivery and even makes content suggestions.  Moreover, it provides specific examples of effective and ineffective feedback, while also laying a solid foundation of the overall topic. The article also implies that students will need some differentiated learning, as they will all have different skill sets.  Accounting for diversity in classrooms is a significant part of feedback research.  Teachers have to understand each student in order to chart individual growth, goal set, and exceed state standards.  Genuine feedback is essential to this goal setting process, which in turn, increases the self-efficacy of students.  What teacher wouldn’t want to increase self-efficacy?  We should all want students to believe they have the skills necessary to accomplish everything they work hard for.

I agree with the message about feedback indicated in this article. I feel that Brookhart has mentioned the critical components of effective feedback for students including thinking about feedback from the student's perspective. I think that Brookhart effectively demonstrated that the impact of feedback on the student should be taken into consideration when preparing and giving feedback to a student. If the feedback is given in a tone that the student perceives as threatening, then the student will not be benefiting from that feedback as a result. I feel that Brookhart listed all of the possible positive and negative outcomes to feedback both for the teacher and the student. The teacher needs to evaluate the learning targets when assessing the student's performance as Brookhart mentioned. By looking to see whether the student achieved the learning targets or not, the teacher will be able to provide a more effective feedback for the student allowing them to understand that they grasped the assignment, but also noticing that there are other aspects of their work that may need improvement. By letting the student know that they understood and completed the basics of the assignment correctly, they will be more motivated and self efficient in correcting their work. I believe that Brookhart's article outlines effective tips and models for future and present teachers to follow when preparing and giving feedback to students. It was also well written, and adhered to critical points to outline the main idea in the article. I believe that many readers who read and have read this article will listen and apply her points to their own teaching methods and classrooms.

I think this is a very effective article on feedback.  The author clearly demonstrates her knowledge and experience when discussing what constitutes good feedback.  She provides meaningful examples of appropriate and positive feedback for a writing assignment and turns what might have been just a rewrite into a learning experience the student can use for future self assessments.  The author also reminds those who assess how important timliness is when providing feedback and how comments must be specific to the assignment.  I was so impressed by the author's article that I will be looking into purchasing her book for my own personal library.  She reminds her readers that not only what you say, but how you say it to a student can make such an impact!  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 14:32, 27 May 2009 (UTC)


This article on feedback was very effective and informative. I agree with the author that effective feedback communicates a clear, concise and positive message to the student. The way teachers deliver the feedback is critical to the student. I think that a very effective strategy is beginning your feedback by asking the student specific questions about their work. This allows them to search through their work to find their own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers should then ask their students what the best solution is. Developing their own solutions to change and improve their work will allow for better student understanding and comprehension. Brookhart also identified key points for delivering feedback, such as being positive and specific, and try for description, not judgement. This article was very well- written, and the formatting was excellent. It captured my attention from beginning to end and I enjoyed reading about the authors thoughts and ideas on this critical subject.

The author of the article comes across as being very well educated and an expert on her topic. I really like the table she provides that gives samples of feedback and tells what the student will gain from reading it.

I am new to thinking about all of these different topics and ideas, however the different ways of using feedback seemed quite useful/helpful. It is true that students work better depending on the feedback they receive. I have a personal example to back up that statement. I loved art from a young age and drawing was my favorite pass-time. When I was in elementary school art class my art teacher told me that I was no good at art and wouldn't amount to anything. Harsh words to a little kid! I went home crying and my grandmother did the best thing (besides going to school to chew out that teacher!) ... she took me to Louis Jones a renowned artist and ask him if he would look at my drawings. She told him what my art teacher told me and he said that I was very good at drawing and to never let anyone tell me that I couldn't do something because I could do anything I set my mind to. The difference between that negative and positive feedback was great. As soon as the positive feedback came it pushed the negative feedback away!

This article was well written and interesting. Brookhart uses her experience to explain the differences between different types of feedback, as well as giving some ways to use feedback that have been successful for her. It was interesting when Brookhart suggests asking the student questions to see if they can see where their mistakes were. It never crossed my mind that this would be a perfect option, but now it makes sense. In my household, when my children have done something that is not appropriate behavior, my husband and I always ask them first what they did, why they got into trouble, and why was it not appropriate. We do this so that we can make sure that they understand why they are in trouble. Without giving feedback, students could keep doing the same mistakes over and over again without realizing their mistakes. Asking the student where their mistakes are and why they are considered mistakes, lets the student express to their teacher what was on their mind when they completed the task and why they think it is considered a mistake.

I think that this was a really good article about feedback. Students not only need feedback, they need the right kind of feedback. I think it is true that sometimes teachers get caught up on correcting spelling and grammar problems and do not focus in on what the paper was really about and if the student wrote it effectively. I can remember when I was in elementary school, one of my teachers would write &quot;good job&quot;, give a sticker and maybe correct a few grammar problems.  However, my other teacher would write do this in addition to writing comments about my writing style or maybe just that they thought that something I wrote about was interesting. Sometimes she would also give me a few sentences at the end of my paper to read for myself. It would always be positive constructive feedback that made me want to try harder. Sometimes teachers get frustrated because a child &quot;just isn't getting it&quot; but they may need to take a look at themselves and evaluate whether they are giving the child what he/she needs to be a better writer and improve performance.

I really enjoyed this article because I honestly never even thought about how my students would or wouldn't feel about my feedback. Looking back now I do remember some of my teachers being brutal, especially those college professors!!! However when I was in high school most of my teachers always gave positive feedback. I agreed with the phrase in the article about how different students take feedback in different ways. You could give the same feedback to two different students and they could respond total opposite of each other. I believe that while being positive we don't need to forget the real reason of feedback (to help the student grow intellectually). The paragraph about &quot;loving dogs more than cats&quot; was a good example of papers that I use to get back in elementary school. I still remember being confused and trying to decifer the teachers hand writing or the symbols used. It helped with the students grammar, but the teacher should have told her that she did an excellent job by staying on topic. I think it would've have given the student a more positive attitude about writing on her next topic while allowing her to know that she needs some work in the grammar department.

I think that this article was very informative.  I often feel that there is a big difference between just giving corrections and actually guiding the students to correct their own work.  I think that it is important to know your students on a personal level so that you can better gauge how that student would respond to the feedback for their assignment.  I appreciated in the article when the example was given about the writing corrections.  I often find that the editing of assignments almost needs another key to find out what the students did wrong, which can be very frustrating for a student(even in college).  In the article it made the distinction between giving general statements that provide no real ways for students to gauge the worth of their work and specific statements about their work so that can either have ways to correct the work or realize that you really took notice in their specific work and appreciated how hard they worked.  I think that if all teachers remembered that technique would help students feel respected and important instead of just another grade int he grade book.

Personally, this was the more enjoyable and interesting article of the chapter, because it discussed the differences between a teacher’s perspective and student’s perspective on assessment, suggestions of giving good feedback, and the comparisons of effective and ineffective feedback. Many teachers have very good intentions of giving positive feedback; however, students tend to interpret them as negative comments and make the writing experience more frustrating. I also found it very beneficial that Susan M. Brookhart mentioned that teachers tend to forget that their assessments are going back into student hands. Therefore, it is very important that teachers place themselves in students’ shoes, or even remember their own writing experiences when they are doing assessment. As the article indicated, composing feedback is a skill that will take time to master and educators will have to consider what they say, how to say it, and when they should say it. In spite of this, the skill is worth the benefits, because students eventually learn that their strengths and weaknesses in writing, and different types of methods they can use to fix them on their own.

I think that effective feedback is beneficial. I thought this article to be beneficial also. I plan on reflecting back on it as a learning tool for myself.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 03:26, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

The author brought some great examples of feedback to the table. I agree that positive feedback where is due is crucial for a students learning. Feedback on improvement also helps the student better themselves and develop their writing. This article helped me to understand the different types of feedback, and it's definitely an article I would look back on during my teaching years.

&quot;Qielli poshte&quot; Leon Qafzezi

Novela fantastiko-humoristike&quot;Qielli poshte&quot;e autorit Leon Qafzezi,sjell nje mesazh bashkekohor per kohen dhe dhe ditet e trazuara 
qe jetojme,nje mesazh antikaos...
Atmosfera e noveles tejet  stigmatizuese nen groteskun e sj fantastik,ku Toka ndali rrotullimin dhe njerez e sende fluturuan ne hava,eshte ne vetvete nje metafore e ashper qe te kujton dikur Mark Twen me &quot;Fluturimin e Kapitenit Stromfilld ne Parajse&quot;remineshenca
meditative qe vijne natyrshem nepermjet se qeshures...
Paradoksaliteti i permbajtjes spektakolare dhe te kendshme,ku e mrekullueshmja perzihet me banalen,eshte aq bindes ne zhvillimin e tij kompozicional sa lexuesi e jeton situaten me nje intensitet gati stresant,por njekohesisht pa asnje ndjenje paniku,megjithese apokalipsi
perjetohet ne lartesite e stratosferes,ku dhe jeta nis e leviz tashme normalisht,megjithese ne hava,pa iu shmangur procedurave te saj sociale dhe antisociale...Ku sic shprehet autori:&quot;Koha kishte dale dore..&quot; 
E shkruar ne veten e pare,vetem me dy personazhe krejt pa biografi,autorin dhe njeriun me bizhama,ajo te kujton diku dhe &quot;Ne pritje te Godose&quot;te S.Becket,mbasi eshte i njejti absurd qe leviz brenda nje rrethi vicioz,brenda dhe jashte kohes dhe hapesires...
&quot;Qielli poshte&quot;i Leon Qafzezit,eshte nje tjeter liber eksploziv,ku individualiteti krijues ka krijuar tashme fizionomine e tij ne gjinine e noveles artistike dhe nje stili aspak te rrahur ne letersine tone,e themi kete mbasi figuracioni dhe abstraksioni eshte ne gjurmet e shkrimtareve me te rendesishem bashkohore
Ne novelat e tij si &quot;Pashaporte per Ferr&quot;apo &quot;Tregu i Enderrave&quot;po ashtu dhe tek &quot;Qielli poshte&quot;kemi nje kolorit te vecante,nje psikologji dhe filozofi ,larg konvencionalizmit ne sensin me profesional te termit.Ai del pertej nje pragmatizmi profesionist,drejt aksidentales,suprizes qe ka hyre tashme ne jeten tone te perditshme,eshte kjo klime krijuese qe i jep nje lirshmeri vizionit te tij
eksistencialist-surrealist;novela eshte nje realitet brenda fantazise,por edhe nje fantazi brenda realitetit...I urojme suksese&quot;
Kristofor Bulo(Parathenia)

&quot;Novela&quot;Tregu i Enderrave&quot;e autorit Leon Qafzezi te intrigon qe ne titull per ate shtjellim te metejshem plot fantazi dhe humor te investimit te enderres dhe dhenies se saj me fajde ne firmat piramidale...Eshte perseri po ai zhgenjim i moderuar bashkekohor qe i merr edhe shpresen e fundit nje populli nen idene e nje fitimi thuajse magjik...
I shkruajtur ne stilin e dy novelave te meparshme te tij ,ku realiteti dhe fantazia shkrihen ne nje,ndjehet po ajo elokuence e ndertimit kompozicional,nje surrealizem teper pikant...Pikant eshte vete gjetja qe eshte njekohesisht edhe vete sterhollimi i noveles,paradoksaliteti i nje jete kolektive qe vuan nga nje insoni kronike dhe qe befas nis e investon enderrat per nje te ardhme me te mire dhe qe ,se fundi,gjejne ashtu si dhe me parate vetem nje mashtrim tejet bashkekohor...
Per te qeshur dhe per te qare,nje novele tragji-komike,qe do te mbetet si nje deshmi e antimoralit te kohes qe kalojme ne kete fund shekulli.
Ritmi i perkryer i vepres flet per krijimin e nje individualiteti ne fushen e noveles,krijimin e nje atmosfere ku nuk kemi asnje resonance pesimiste,pavaresisht nga eho  e preokupacionit te kohes..
Nje polemike violente shperndahet hapesires si ai pluhuri i rruges,pa asnje lloj pergjegjesie individuale,per keto inisiativa te rrezikshme..
Denoncimi nga ana e popullit te ketyre manovrave ekonomike,ketij kataklizmi te xhepit te nje populli,me gjuhen e Mark Antonit,eshte nje nga gjetjet me te bukura te berjes se transparences..Diagnostikimi i kesaj epidemie sociale,ku korrupsioni ka nje natyre virale,braktis shpesh te verteten..
Kthesa qe ben protagonisti i vepres Sofokli Pata,eshte bindes dhe ka nje moral ne vetvete,ne te vertete ajo perben figuren e intelektualit te vertete,qe di te ruaje vlerat autentike te nje populli dhe te nje vendi.
I urojme suksese autorit&quot;

&quot;Historia e Kinematografise Boterore&quot;e autorit Leon Qafzezi,eshte nje liber me vlera njohese ne fushen e historise dhe zhvillimit te kinematografise boterore dhe si e tille ajo perben ne vetevete dobine e te botuarit ne kete kohe krize per filmin.
Autori ndonese me shkurtime dhe gjuhe lakonike,ku profesionalizmi jo vetem ne renditjen kronologjike te ngjarjeve,por shpesh edhe per kinematografi te vecanta hedh drite jo vetem ne evenimenet te saj,vale apo rryma,por edhe ne periudha te thella krize,po ashtu edhe per shkolla te fuqishme filmi dhe gjithashtu personalitetet ne kete fushe te cilet me veprat e tyre filmike hapen rruge te reja apo eksperimentuan me sukses.
Mendoj se libri i Leon Qafzezit&quot;Historisa e Kinematografise Boterore&quot;(libri i tete ne kete fushe i autorit)eshte i nevojshem per cdo studiues te filmit,profesionist apo dashamires i tij&quot;

&quot;&quot;Ne kohet qe kalojme jane te tpakte ata artiste apo edhe me gjere njerez te fushes se artit qe merren me botime ne fushen e kinematografise.Ne si fakultet e ndjejme kete mungese edhe me shume pasi pikerisht dy vite me pare kemi arritur te hapim specialitetin e Regjise se Filmit dhe TV.
ne kete specialitet kurrikula e &quot;Historise se Kinematografise Boterore&quot;eshte e nje rendesie te vecante per formimin e studentit
Duke marre parasysh:
-deficitet e medha qe jane krijuar pas viteve 90 ne edukimin e brezit te ri te artisteve ne fushen e kinematografise
-kerkesat gjithnje ne rritje te te rinjve dhe pasionit te tyre per kinemane ne ndjejme nevojen e botimeve ne kete fushe dhe pikerisht vleressojme angazhimin e Z.Leon Qafzezi per vepren &quot;Historiku i Kinematografise Boterore&quot;
Po ashtu ne vleresojme shume ndihmen e strukturave te ndryshme apo personave te cilet mund te ndihmojne per botimin e tij.
Dashamiresia dhe kontributi i sejcilit prej nesh ne kete rast,dio te ishte ne dobi te te rinve qe aspirojne te behen neser kineaste,por gjithashtu dhe gjithe te tjereve qe kane nevoje per informacione ne kete fushe.&quot;
Prof.Petrit Malaj
Rektor i Akademise se Arteve

&quot;Kineasti dhe novelisti Leon Qafzezi paraqitet me nje liber te ri sic eshte &quot;Intervista per Filmin&quot;nje liber qe hyn ne fushen e kritikes kinematografike.
Pavaresisht se keto intervista jane botuar ne vite te ndryshme deri ne ditet tona,kryesisht per regjisore,skenariste,operatore,
te filmit,shqiptare apo te huaj,kjo vetem se ja rit vleren ketij libri origjinal dhe qe sjell kronologjikisht fizionomin e kinematografise  shqiptare,perpjekjet e realizuesve te filmit ne periudhen e djeshme plot sakrifica,pasion,dashuri per kete art,por edhe perpjekjet  dhe perkushtimin e brezit te ri te kineasteve,te cilet mne talentin e tyre po i japin  nje fytyre te re  filmit shqiptar,jo vetem ne vendin tone por edhe ne bote...Eshte ajo rruge profesionale dhe qe sot lindi nga shkolla e Kinostudios&quot;Shqiperia e Re&quot;dhe me vone Alba Film...

-Sillet nga Leon QAFZEZI monografia e regjisorit qe beri emer dhe epoke-
Stanley Kubrick,versioni shqip
&quot;Kubrick&quot;regjisori i famshem amerikan vjen nepermjet nje monografie ne gjuhen shqipe.
Kjo monografi e fundit e Leon Qafzezit,eshte nje botim i plote i jetes,veprimtarise dhe opinionit qe ka qarkulluar per regjisorin e famshem nga koleget e tij.
Keshtu Stanley Kobrick u lind 73 vjet me pare ne qytetin e artit ne New York.Ai ishte regjisori  i pare i pas Luftes se Dyte Boterore qe beri emer dhe epoke..
Qe ne fillimet e tij,vepra krijuese e ketij kineasti te talentuar zgjoi interesin e mjaft krijuesve dhe kritikeve,te cilet nisen te vleresojne pretendimet e tij artistike,estetike,vizionin e ri te mjeteve shprehese,nje lloj ironie te lehte sociale,por gjithsesi i binte ne sy nje vezhguesei te holle te artit kinematografik.
Stanley Kubrick realizoi filmin e pare me metrazh te gjate&quot;Frike dhe Deshire&quot;(Fear and Desire)ne vitin 1953.Me pas &quot;Lolita&quot;ekranizim i romanit te Nobokov,&quot;Odisea e Hapesires&quot;e A.C.Clark&quot;Portokalli mekanik&quot;i nobelistit Borgess.
Megjithate ai u afrohet ketyre autoreve te medhenj duke u dhene nje domethenie dhe nje vizion  te ri,ai di &quot;te ndricoje ajrin&quot;me nje profesionalizem te rralle artistik.
I specializuar ne boten  etij kulturore ne raportet mes kinematografise dhe patologjise,Kubrick i referohet shpesh,megjithese jo fare hapur Zigmund Frojdit.
Ne galerine e filmave te tij(15)si tituj,si filmografi leviz nje bote e tere,e gjalle,levizin psikologji dhe karaktere te nje shoqerie kapitaliste te zhvilluar dhe jo pa probleme,leviz nje mjedis qe ne shumten e heres eshte tejet natyral.
Regjisori i &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;tashme jo me ne jete,ka mbetur i paharrueshem per vepren e tij ne kinematografi,por edhe ne kujtimet e kolegeve dhe te aktoreve qe kane punuar ne shume filma me ate.
Te gjithe keta njerez flasin per Kubrick ne monografine e botuar ne shqip,nderkohe qe ne kete liber ka edhe mjaft opinione te kritikeve te Stanley Kubrick...
Gjithsesi,te gjithe ata qe jane te pasionuar pas filmave te ketij regjisori te madh,mund te shuajne kureshtjen per aspekte te ndryshme te jetes dhe aktivitetit te tij ne monografine e ketij personaliteti te kinematografise boterore&quot;

Nepermjet intervistave te plota te Shefit te Misionit WHO-se, Santino Severonit,Liliana Urbines,menazhere e semundjeve mendore,Stefania Pace-Shankli,oficere e programit kunder sides si dhe intervistave te drejtoreshes Anila Aliko,etj u dha nje panorame e plote filmike e punes ne keto fusha,jo vetem persa i perket trajnimit,propagandes me broshura,por edhe nje ndihme e materializuar ne mjete logjistike dhe te infrastruktures se spitaleve ne disa rrethe te vendit tone.
Keto dite do te nisin xhirimet per nje dokumentar te dyte,ku vendin kryesor do e zere puna ne terren,pra do te kemi nje dokumentar....
Me nje interes te vecante jane xhirimet ne Institutin e Shendetit Publik(ISHP) me drejtoreshen Silva Bino dhe xhirimet ne nje vend te &quot;infektuar&quot; si fshati..
Eshte nje film qe tregon per solidarizimin e bluzave te bardha,Organizates Boterore te Shendetesise dhe Ministrise Shendetsore me mbrojtje te jetes.
Filmi i Leon Qafzezit ka vlera njohese dhe informacion qe vjen organikisht me nje gjuhe artistike,kerakteristike per kete autor&quot;
Korresp.i gazetes&quot;Tirana&quot;Qershor 2002

-Per mbrojtjen e jetes,premiere nga Leon QAFZEZI-
Filmi -dokumentar rrefen perpjekjet e bluzave te bardha ne bashkepunim me WHO ne lufte per nje shendet te mire
&quot;Per mbrojtjen e jetes&quot;titullohet filmi dokumentar i cili u shfaq keto dite ne &quot;BBF Television&quot;
nga kineasti Leon Qafzezi.
Ky dokumentar e merr spunton e tij artistike nga veprimtaria qe zhillon ne Shqiperi &quot;World Health Organization&quot;me qender ne Gjeneve te Zvicres.
Filmi pershkruan me nje gjuhe filmike larg nje reklamimi te bujshem ate pune dhe kontribut te vlefshem qe kjo organizate jep ne luften kunder semundjeve te rrezikshme te kohes sic jane tuberkulozi,ende evident ne Shqiperi,SIDA e konstatuar jo ende ne permasat e vendeve te tjera,por perseri shqetsuese si dhe ne luften per nje shendet te mire mendor,duke e pare kete te fundit jo si nje deshtim personal.
Eshte pra,nje fushe e gjere trajningu dhe nje pervoje e ndihme konkrete per dispancerine dhe senatoriumin ne vendin tone,duke u  nderruar atyre pamjen dhe duke i rinovuar nga ana e infra-struktures dhe materialeve logjistike.
Ekipi i &quot;WHO&quot;(Organizata Boterore e Shendetesise)me shef misioni Santino severonin,Stafania Pace- Shanklin,Liliana Urbina,Nertila Tavanxhi etj,spikaten ne filmin dokumentar me personalitetin e tyre  ne menazhimin  e semundjeve specifike qe permendem me siper dhe ne strukturat e kujdesit komunitar ne nje perqindje te madhe te territorit te vendit.
Pervec intervistave eskluzive te Santino severonit,i cili beri nje rezume te gjere te vete aktivitetit te WHO ne vendin tone,nje aspekt i bukur ishte dhe organizimi i Dites Boterore te Shendetesise.Krosi masiv ne kodrat e Liqenit ,ku mosha te ndryshme vraponin nene tingujt e Bandes se Ushtrise,i dhane filmit nje frymemarrje lirike qe kontrastonte me ambientet e disapncerise se Tiranes apo sanatoriumit&quot;Ndroqi&quot;,qe vertet i rinovuar nga WHO dhe ECHO,gjithsesi ruante atmosferen e mbylluar te spitalit.
Me nje interes te vecante ishet dhe intervista e dhene nga drejtoresha e Sanatoriumit Anila Aliko e cila evidentoi  punen e madhe e bere nga Organizata Boterore e Shendetesise per sektore te ndryshem te ketij spiatli kunder tuberkulozit...
Kete pune ,kamera e Leon Qafzezit e dha edhe ne ambjentet e dsipancerise ku doktor Rifati konkretizoi kete ndihme ,duke krahasuar aparaturat e vjetra te skopise te dala jashte perdorimit me ardhjen e te rejave nga me modernet per ekzaminimin e bronkeve.
Liliana Urbina qe vjen nga Argjentina shpalosi edhe perspektiven e nje lufte te re kunder semundjeve mendore duke theksuar mendimin e drejtoreshes se pergjithshme te WHO-s zonjes Harlem Brundtland qe ne mesazhin e saj te Dites Boterore te Shendetesise 2001 ishte&quot;Mos perjashto.Fillo te ndihmosh&quot;Pra do te ishte nej lufte per te mos patur diskriminim ndaj te semureve mendore,kjo ne bashkepunim me shume organizata te tjera boterore.
Stafania Pace-Shanklin,evidentoi punen e bere per rastet e zbulimt te SIDA-s dhe luftes kunder saj me nje plan stategjik te detajuar mire,por  et shoqeruar edhe me nje propagandim me efekt parandalues.
Pas realizimit te filmave&quot;Mesazh Humanitar&quot;film per &quot;Croix Rouge Francaise&quot;,&quot;Mesazh dashurie&quot;,film per Luigi Montin,&quot;Per mbrojtjen e jetes&quot;perben nje trilogji ne krijimtarine artistike e kineastit dhe novelistit Leon Qafzezi,me teme nga fusha e shendetesise,filma keta sa artistik aq edhe promovues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''MultiCamera''' folder in the SwisTrack examples folder contains a small program to start and stop multiple SwisTrack instances at (almost) the same time. The program provides 3 buttons
* Start (production)
* Start (testing)
* Stop
and can be used for up to 16 cameras.

Note that the program does not merge the output of all SwisTrack instances - it simply starts and stops them. While this functionality may be sufficient in some cases, the example is rather thought of as starting point for your multi-camera project.

The code compiles on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A.2.6 Why is solidarity important to anarchists?==

Solidarity, or mutual aid, is a key idea of anarchism. It is the link between the individual and society, the means by which individuals can work together to meet their common interests in an environment that supports and nurtures both liberty and equality. For anarchists, mutual aid is a fundamental feature of human life, a source of both strength and happiness and a fundamental requirement for a fully human existence.

Erich Fromm, noted psychologist and socialist humanist, points out that the ''&quot;human desire to experience union with others is rooted in the specific conditions of existence that characterise the human species and is one of the strongest motivations of human behaviour.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;To Be or To Have, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore anarchists consider the desire to form ''&quot;unions''&quot; (to use Max Stirner's term) with other people to be a natural need. These unions, or associations, must be based on equality and individuality in order to be fully satisfying to those who join them -- i.e. they must be organised in an anarchist manner, i.e. voluntary, decentralised, and non-hierarchical.

Solidarity -- co-operation between individuals -- is necessary for life and is far from a denial of liberty. Solidarity, observed Errico Malatesta, ''&quot;is the only environment in which Man can express his personality and achieve his optimum development and enjoy the greatest possible wellbeing.''&quot; This ''&quot;coming together of individuals for the wellbeing of all, and of all for the wellbeing of each,''&quot; results in ''&quot;the freedom of each not being limited by, but complemented -- indeed finding the necessary raison d'etre in -- the freedom of others.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Anarchy, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, solidarity and co-operation means treating each other as equals, refusing to treat others as means to an end and creating relationships which support freedom for all rather than a few dominating the many. Emma Goldman reiterated this theme, noting ''&quot;what wonderful results this unique force of man's individuality has achieved when strengthened by co-operation with other individualities . . . co-operation -- as opposed to internecine strife and struggle -- has worked for the survival and evolution of the species. . . . only mutual aid and voluntary co-operation . . . can create the basis for a free individual and associational life.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Red Emma Speaks, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Solidarity means associating together as equals in order to satisfy our common interests and needs. Forms of association not based on solidarity (i.e. those based on inequality) will crush the individuality of those subjected to them. As Ret Marut points out, liberty needs solidarity, the recognition of common interests:

''&quot;The most noble, pure and true love of mankind is the love of oneself. I want to be free! I hope to be happy! I want to appreciate all the beauties of the world. But my freedom is secured only when all other people around me are free. I can only be happy when all other people around me are happy. I can only be joyful when all the people I see and meet look at the world with joy-filled eyes. And only then can I eat my fill with pure enjoyment when I have the secure knowledge that other people, too, can eat their fill as I do. And for that reason it is a question of my own contentment, only of my own self, when I rebel against every danger which threatens my freedom and my happiness. . .''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Ret Marut (a.k.a. B. Traven), The BrickBurner magazine quoted by Karl S. Guthke, B. Traven: The life behind the legends, pp. 133-4&lt;/ref&gt;
To practice solidarity means that we recognise, as in the slogan of Industrial Workers of the World, that ''&quot;an injury to one is an injury to all.''&quot; Solidarity, therefore, is the means to protect individuality and liberty and so is an expression of self-interest. As Alfie Kohn points out:

''&quot;when we think about co-operation. . . we tend to associate the concept with fuzzy-minded idealism. . . This may result from confusing co-operation with altruism. . . Structural co-operation defies the usual egoism/altruism dichotomy. It sets things up so that by helping you I am helping myself at the same time. Even if my motive initially may have been selfish, our fates now are linked. We sink or swim together. Co-operation is a shrewd and highly successful strategy - a pragmatic choice that gets things done at work and at school even more effectively than competition does. . . There is also good evidence that co-operation is more conductive to psychological health and to liking one another.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;No Contest: The Case Against Competition, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
And, within a hierarchical society, solidarity is important not only because of the satisfaction it gives us, but also because it is necessary to resist those in power. Malatesta's words are relevant here:

''&quot;the oppressed masses who have never completely resigned themselves to oppress and poverty, and who . . . show themselves thirsting for justice, freedom and wellbeing, are beginning to understand that they will not be able to achieve their emancipation except by union and solidarity with all the oppressed, with the exploited everywhere in the world.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Anarchy, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
By standing together, we can increase our strength and get what we want. Eventually, by organising into groups, we can start to manage our own collective affairs together and so replace the boss once and for all. ''&quot;Unions will. . . multiply the individual's means and secure his assailed property.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Max Stirner, The Ego and Its Own, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; By acting in solidarity, we can also replace the current system with one more to our liking: ''&quot;in union there is strength.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Solidarity is thus the means by which we can obtain and ensure our own freedom. We agree to work together so that we will not have to work for another. By agreeing to share with each other we increase our options so that we may enjoy more, not less. Mutual aid is in my self-interest -- that is, I see that it is to my advantage to reach agreements with others based on mutual respect and social equality; for if I dominate someone, this means that the conditions exist which allow domination, and so in all probability I too will be dominated in turn.

As Max Stirner saw, solidarity is the means by which we ensure that our liberty is strengthened and defended from those in power who want to rule us: ''&quot;Do you yourself count for nothing then?''&quot;, he asks. ''&quot;Are you bound to let anyone do anything he wants to you? Defend yourself and no one will touch you. If millions of people are behind you, supporting you, then you are a formidable force and you will win without difficulty.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;quoted in Luigi Galleani's The End of Anarchism?, p. 79 - different translation in The Ego and Its Own, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Solidarity, therefore, is important to anarchists because it is the means by which liberty can be created and defended against power. Solidarity is strength and a product of our nature as social beings. However, solidarity should not be confused with ''&quot;herdism,''&quot; which implies passively following a leader. In order to be effective, solidarity must be created by free people, co-operating together as equals. The ''&quot;big WE''&quot; is not solidarity, although the desire for ''&quot;herdism''&quot; is a product of our need for solidarity and union. It is a ''&quot;solidarity''&quot; corrupted by hierarchical society, in which people are conditioned to blindly obey leaders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A.2.7 Why do anarchists argue for self-liberation?==

Liberty, by its very nature, cannot be given. An individual cannot be freed by another, but must break his or her own chains through their own effort. Of course, self-effort can also be part of collective action, and in many cases it has to be in order to attain its ends. As Emma Goldman points out:

&quot;''History tells us that every oppressed class [or group or individual] gained true liberation from its masters by its own efforts.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Red Emma Speaks, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
This is because anarchists recognise that hierarchical systems, like any social relationship, shapes those subject to them. As Bookchin argued, &quot;''class societies organise our psychic structures for command or obedience.&quot;'' This means that people internalise the values of hierarchical and class society and, as such, &quot;''the State is not merely a constellation of bureaucratic and coercive instituions. It is also a state of mind, an instilled mentality for ordering reality . . . Its capacity to rule by brute force has always been limited . . . Without a high degree of co-operation from even the most victimised classes of society such as chattel slaves and serfs, its authority would eventually dissipate. Awe and apathy in the face of State power are products of social conditioning that renders this very power possible.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Ecology of Freedom, p. 159 and pp. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt; Self-liberation is the means by which we break down both internal and external chains, freeing ourselves mentally as well as physically.

Anarchists have long argued that people can only free themselves by their own actions. The various methods anarchists suggest to aid this process will be discussed in section J (&quot;''What Do Anarchists Do?&quot;'') and will not be discussed here. However, these methods all involve people organising themselves, setting their own agendas, and acting in ways that empower them and eliminate their dependence on leaders to do things for them. Anarchism is based on people &quot;''acting for themselves&quot;'' (performing what anarchists call &quot;''direct action&quot;'' -- see section J.2 for details).

Direct action has an empowering and liberating effect on those involved in it. Self-activity is the means by which the creativity, initiative, imagination and critical thought of those subjected to authority can be developed. It is the means by which society can be changed. As Errico Malatesta pointed out:

&quot;''Between man and his social environment there is a reciprocal action. Men make society what it is and society makes men what they are, and the result is therefore a kind of vicious circle. To transform society men [and women] must be changed, and to transform men, society must be changed . . . Fortunately existing society has not been created by the inspired will of a dominating class, which has succeeded in reducing all its subjects to passive and unconscious instruments of its interests. It is the result of a thousand internecine struggles, of a thousand human and natural factors . . .
&quot;''From this the possibility of progress . . . We must take advantage of all the means, all the possibilities and the opportunities that the present environment allows us to act on our fellow men [and women] and to develop their consciences and their demands . . . to claim and to impose those major social transformations which are possible and which effectively serve to open the way to further advances later . . . We must seek to get all the people . . . to make demands, and impose itself and take for itself all the improvements and freedoms it desires as and when it reaches the state of wanting them, and the power to demand them . . . we must push the people to want always more and to increase its pressures [on the ruling elite], until it has achieved complete emancipation.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, pp. 188-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Society, while shaping all individuals, is also created by them, through their actions, thoughts, and ideals. Challenging institutions that limit one's freedom is mentally liberating, as it sets in motion the process of questioning authoritarian relationships in general. This process gives us insight into how society works, changing our ideas and creating new ideals. To quote Emma Goldman again: &quot;''True emancipation begins. . . in woman's soul.&quot;'' And in a man's too, we might add. It is only here that we can &quot;''begin [our] inner regeneration, [cutting] loose from the weight of prejudices, traditions and customs.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Op. Cit., p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; But this process must be self-directed, for as Max Stirner notes, &quot;''the man who is set free is nothing but a freed man. . . a dog dragging a piece of chain with him.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Ego and Its Own, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; By changing the world, even in a small way, we change ourselves.

In an interview during the Spanish Revolution, the Spanish anarchist militant Durutti said, &quot;''we have a new world in our hearts.&quot;'' Only self-activity and self-liberation allows us to create such a vision and gives us the confidence to try to actualise it in the real world.

Anarchists, however, do not think that self-liberation must wait for the future, after the &quot;''glorious revolution.&quot;'' The personal is political, and given the nature of society, how we act in the here and now will influence the future of our society and our lives. Therefore, even in pre-anarchist society anarchists try to create, as Bakunin puts it, &quot;''not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself.&quot;'' We can do so by creating alternative social relationships and organisations, acting as free people in a non-free society. Only by our actions in the here and now can we lay the foundation for a free society. Moreover, this process of self-liberation goes on all the time:

&quot;''Subordinates of all kinds exercise their capacity for critical self-reflection every day -- that is why masters are thwarted, frustrated and, sometimes, overthrown. But unless masters are overthrown, unless subordinates engage in political activity, no amount of critical reflection will end their subjection and bring them freedom.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
Anarchists aim to encourage these tendencies in everyday life to reject, resist and thwart authority and bring them to their logical conclusion -- a society of free individuals, co-operating as equals in free, self-managed associations. Without this process of critical self-reflection, resistance and self-liberation a free society is impossible. Thus, for anarchists, anarchism comes from the natural resistance of subordinated people striving to act as free individuals within a hierarchical world. This process of resistance is called by many anarchists the &quot;''class struggle&quot;'' (as it is working class people who are generally the most subordinated group within society) or, more generally, &quot;''social struggle.&quot;'' It is this everyday resistance to authority (in all its forms) and the desire for freedom which is the key to the anarchist revolution. It is for this reason that &quot;''anarchists emphasise over and over that the class struggle provides the only means for the workers [and other oppressed groups] to achieve control over their destiny.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise Berneri, Neither East Nor West, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolution is a process, not an event, and every &quot;''spontaneous revolutionary action&quot;'' usually results from and is based upon the patient work of many years of organisation and education by people with &quot;''utopian&quot;'' ideas. The process of &quot;''creating the new world in the shell of the old&quot;'' (to use another I.W.W. expression), by building alternative institutions and relationships, is but one component of what must be a long tradition of revolutionary commitment and militancy.

As Malatesta made clear, &quot;''to encourage popular organisations of all kinds is the logical consequence of our basic ideas, and should therefore be an integral part of our programme. . . anarchists do not want to emancipate the people; we want the people to emancipate themselves. . . , we want the new way of life to emerge from the body of the people and correspond to the state of their development and advance as they advance.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Op. Cit., p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless a process of self-emancipation occurs, a free society is impossible. Only when individuals free themselves, both materially (by abolishing the state and capitalism) and intellectually (by freeing themselves of submissive attitudes towards authority), can a free society be possible. We should not forget that capitalist and state power, to a great extent, is power over the minds of those subject to them (backed up, of course, with sizeable force if the mental domination fails and people start rebelling and resisting). In effect, a spiritual power as the ideas of the ruling class dominate society and permeate the minds of the oppressed. As long as this holds, the working class will acquiesce to authority, oppression and exploitation as the normal condition of life. Minds submissive to the doctrines and positions of their masters cannot hope to win freedom, to revolt and fight. Thus the oppressed must overcome the mental domination of the existing system before they can throw off its yoke (and, anarchists argue, direct action is the means of doing both -- see sections J.2 and J.4). Capitalism and statism must be beaten spiritually and theoretically before it is beaten materially (many anarchists call this mental liberation &quot;''class consciousness&quot;'' -- see section B.7.4). And self-liberation through struggle against oppression is the only way this can be done. Thus anarchists encourage (to use Kropotkin's term) &quot;''the spirit of revolt.&quot;''

Self-liberation is a product of struggle, of self-organisation, solidarity and direct action. Direct action is the means of creating anarchists, free people, and so &quot;''Anarchists have always advised taking an active part in those workers' organisations which carry on the direct struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector, -- the State.&quot;'' This is because &quot;''&lt;ref&gt;s&lt;/ref&gt;uch a struggle . . . better than any indirect means, permits the worker to obtain some temporary improvements in the present conditions of work, while it opens his [or her] eyes to the evil that is done by Capitalism and the State that supports it, and wakes up his [or her] thoughts concerning the possibility of organising consumption, production and exchange without the intervention of the capitalist and the state,&quot;'' that is, see the possibility of a free society. Kropotkin, like many anarchists, pointed to the Syndicalist and Trade Union movements as a means of developing libertarian ideas within existing society (although he, like most anarchists, did not limit anarchist activity exclusively to them). Indeed, any movement which &quot;''permit[s] the working men [and women] to realise their solidarity and to feel the community of their interests . . . prepare[s] the way for these conceptions&quot;'' of communist-anarchism, i.e. the overcoming the spiritual domination of existing society within the minds of the oppressed. &lt;ref&gt;Evolution and Environment, p. 83 and p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

For anarchists, in the words of a Scottish Anarchist militant, the &quot;''history of human progress [is] seen as the history of rebellion and disobedience, with the individual debased by subservience to authority in its many forms and able to retain his/her dignity only through rebellion and disobedience.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert Lynn, Not a Life Story, Just a Leaf from It, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This is why anarchists stress self-liberation (and self-organisation, self-management and self-activity). Little wonder Bakunin considered &quot;''rebellion&quot;'' as one of the &quot;''three fundamental principles &lt;ref&gt;which&lt;/ref&gt; constitute the essential conditions of all human development, collective or individual, in history.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;God and the State, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This is simply because individuals and groups cannot be freed by others, only by themselves. Such rebellion (self-liberation) is the only means by which existing society becomes more libertarian and an anarchist society a possibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}

[[w:Model_Driven_Engineering|Model-Driven Engineering]] (MDE) is an approach for developing complex, reliable and highly reusable systems. This is achieved with a set of tools which allow creation and subsequent transformation of models to the final system. Importantly, the efforts are concentrated on the definition of models and transformation facilities instead of hand-writing and iterative debugging of low level code. MDE is already successfully employed in a broad range of application domains such as controller design (e.g. Simulink), integrated circuit design and increasingly in software development.

== Standards ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture The Model Driven Architecture] (MDA) is an upcoming standard to obtain reusability, portability and interoperability developed by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group Object Management Group] (OMG). Implementation of this standard leads to modeling languages, which can be multi-domain like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica Modelica] (under development) or domain-specific  like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOSAR AUTOSAR] for the automotive industry, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language Unified Modeling Language] (UML) for software engineering and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Modeling_Language Systems Modeling Language] (SysML) for systems engineering. The [http://www.aadl.info Architecture Analysis &amp; Design Language] (AADL) is a language for modeling complex, distributed real-time systems and has been successfully used for model driven control system design &lt;ref&gt;John Hudak, Peter Feiler, [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/07.reports/07tr014.html &quot;Developing AADL Models for Control Systems: A Practitioner's Guide&quot;] ''Technical Report CMU/SEI-2007-TR-014'', Carnegie Mellon University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion ==
One of the most important advantages of standardisation is the boost it can give to the development of a new technology (e.g. the GSM standard for mobile phones and HTML for the World Wide Web). However most companies (e.g. Mathworks) currently have their own [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard de facto standard], which makes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability interoperability] and the creation of an industry-wide standard difficult.
When overall complexity of models increases, the creation of subsystems (or basic components) with a simple in-out structure can facilitate a higher level design. Nowadays domain-specific libraries exist in various software tool chains, with a level of abstraction suited for the applications. 

The current [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_chain software toolchains] are still underdeveloped at a number of levels, therefore some considerations should be made before choosing a MDE-based control design method: 

*	The reusability of a model, even within the original [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform platform]. Current modeling languages contain flaws, reused code usually requires debugging for a new application. 

*	The ability of a model to operate on a number of platforms ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portability portability]), caused by the lack of standardisation and the huge variety in hardware and software platforms.

*	The time consumption of the testing period: the process of deriving platform dependent code is time intensive in most domains.

*	Domain-specific libraries with the inherent choice of level of abstraction. Creating or refining a model from scratch is time intense and might not even be possible.

*	The hardware constraint satisfaction, hardware limitations of the target platform and the physical system are abstracted. Future modelling 	toolchains could provide methods to configure this abstration.

*	Predictability. The behaviour of a composite system usually differs from the subsystem behaviour. For example, by combining a mass and a spring component model, the resonance phenomenon can occur as a new, composite level, behaviour that was not present in each of the individual components. Also failure modes or the possibility and impact of a component failure for the global system are much more difficult to trace and interpret, because of the multitude of interactions that can occur between components.

* It is important to point out that all of the current standards and tools target applications of the C1 and C2 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Control_Systems_Design/Categories_of_system_complexity complexity classes] and none address aspects specifically relevant to C3.

Some control design methods rely on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_based_testing model-based testing], e.g. Rapid Control Prototyping, where the control algorithm is developed in simulation environment and validated afterwards with the real system using automatically generated platform dependent code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A.2.8 Is it possible to be an anarchist without opposing hierarchy?==

No. We have seen that anarchists abhor authoritarianism. But if one is an anti-authoritarian, one must oppose all hierarchical institutions, since they embody the principle of authority. For, as Emma Goldman argued, &lt;i&gt;&quot;it is not only government in the sense of the state which is destructive of every individual value and quality. It is the whole complex authority and institutional domination which strangles life. It is the superstition, myth, pretence, evasions, and subservience which support authority and institutional domination.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Red Emma Speaks, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; This means that &lt;i&gt;&quot;there is and will always be a need to discover and overcome structures of hierarchy, authority and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery, wage-slavery [i.e. capitalism], racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Language and Politics, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchical relationships as well as the state. Whether economic, social or political, to be an anarchist means to oppose hierarchy. The argument for this (if anybody needs one) is as follows:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;All authoritarian institutions are organised as pyramids: the state, the private or public corporation, the army, the police, the church, the university, the hospital: they are all pyramidal structures with a small group of decision-makers at the top and a broad base of people whose decisions are made for them at the bottom. Anarchism does not demand the changing of labels on the layers, it doesn't want different people on top, it wants us to clamber out from underneath.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
Hierarchies &lt;i&gt;&quot;share a common feature: they are organised systems of command and obedience&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and so anarchists seek &lt;i&gt;&quot;to eliminate hierarchy per se, not simply replace one form of hierarchy with another.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, The Ecology of Freedom, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy is a pyramidally-structured organisation composed of a series of grades, ranks, or offices of increasing power, prestige, and (usually) remuneration. Scholars who have investigated the hierarchical form have found that the two primary principles it embodies are domination and exploitation. For example, in his classic article &lt;i&gt;&quot;What Do Bosses Do?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (Review of Radical Political Economy, Vol. 6, No. 2), a study of the modern factory, Steven Marglin found that the main function of the corporate hierarchy is not greater productive efficiency (as capitalists claim), but greater control over workers, the purpose of such control being more effective exploitation.

Control in a hierarchy is maintained by coercion, that is, by the threat of negative sanctions of one kind or another: physical, economic, psychological, social, etc. Such control, including the repression of dissent and rebellion, therefore necessitates centralisation: a set of power relations in which the greatest control is exercised by the few at the top (particularly the head of the organisation), while those in the middle ranks have much less control and the many at the bottom have virtually none.

Since domination, coercion, and centralisation are essential features of authoritarianism, and as those features are embodied in hierarchies, all hierarchical institutions are authoritarian. Moreover, for anarchists, any organisation marked by hierarchy, centralism and authoritarianism is state-like, or &lt;i&gt;&quot;statist.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; And as anarchists oppose both the state and authoritarian relations, anyone who does not seek to dismantle all forms of hierarchy cannot be called an anarchist. This applies to capitalist firms. As Noam Chomsky points out, the structure of the capitalist firm is extremely hierarchical, indeed fascist, in nature:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;a fascist system. . . [is] absolutist - power goes from top down . . . the ideal state is top down control with the public essentially following orders.
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Let's take a look at a corporation. . . [I]f you look at what they are, power goes strictly top down, from the board of directors to managers to lower managers to ultimately the people on the shop floor, typing messages, and so on. There's no flow of power or planning from the bottom up. People can disrupt and make suggestions, but the same is true of a slave society. The structure of power is linear, from the top down.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Keeping the Rabble in Line, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

David Deleon indicates these similarities between the company and the state well when he writes:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Most factories are like military dictatorships. Those at the bottom are privates, the supervisors are sergeants, and on up through the hierarchy. The organisation can dictate everything from our clothing and hair style to how we spend a large portion of our lives, during work. It can compel overtime; it can require us to see a company doctor if we have a medical complaint; it can forbid us free time to engage in political activity; it can suppress freedom of speech, press and assembly -- it can use ID cards and armed security police, along with closed-circuit TVs to watch us; it can punish dissenters with 'disciplinary layoffs' (as GM calls them), or it can fire us. We are forced, by circumstances, to accept much of this, or join the millions of unemployed. . . In almost every job, we have only the 'right' to quit. Major decisions are made at the top and we are expected to obey, whether we work in an ivory tower or a mine shaft.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;For Democracy Where We Work: A rationale for social self-management&quot;, Reinventing Anarchy, Again, Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), pp. 193-4&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchy in all its forms, including the capitalist firm. Not to do so is to support archy -- which an anarchist, by definition, cannot do. In other words, for anarchists, &quot;[p]romises to obey, contracts of (wage) slavery, agreements requiring the acceptance of a subordinate status, are all illegitimate because they do restrict and restrain individual autonomy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Robert Graham, &lt;i&gt;&quot;The Anarchist Contract, Reinventing Anarchy, Again, Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchy, therefore, is against the basic principles which drive anarchism. It denies what makes us human and &lt;i&gt;&quot;divest[s] the personality of its most integral traits; it denies the very notion that the individual is competent to deal not only with the management of his or her personal life but with its most important context: the social context.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, Op. Cit., p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that as long as an association is voluntary, whether it has a hierarchical structure is irrelevant. Anarchists disagree. This is for two reasons. Firstly, under capitalism workers are driven by economic necessity to sell their labour (and so liberty) to those who own the means of life. This process re-enforces the economic conditions workers face by creating &lt;i&gt;&quot;massive disparities in wealth . . . [as] workers. . . sell their labour to the capitalist at a price which does not reflect its real value.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Therefore:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;To portray the parties to an employment contract, for example, as free and equal to each other is to ignore the serious inequality of bargaining power which exists between the worker and the employer. To then go on to portray the relationship of subordination and exploitation which naturally results as the epitome of freedom is to make a mockery of both individual liberty and social justice.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Robert Graham, Op. Cit., p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
It is for this reason that anarchists support collective action and organisation: it increases the bargaining power of working people and allows them to assert their autonomy (see section J).

Secondly, if we take the key element as being whether an association is voluntary or not we would have to argue that the current state system must be considered as &lt;i&gt;&quot;anarchy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; In a modern democracy no one forces an individual to live in a specific state. We are free to leave and go somewhere else. By ignoring the hierarchical nature of an association, you can end up supporting organisations based upon the denial of freedom (including capitalist companies, the armed forces, states even) all because they are &lt;i&gt;&quot;voluntary.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; As Bob Black argues, &quot;[t]o demonise state authoritarianism while ignoring identical albeit contract-consecrated subservient arrangements in the large-scale corporations which control the world economy is fetishism at its worst.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;ref&gt;The Libertarian as Conservative, The Abolition of Work and other essays, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchy is more than being free to pick a master.

Therefore opposition to hierarchy is a key anarchist position, otherwise you just become a &lt;i&gt;&quot;voluntary archist&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - which is hardly anarchistic. For more on this see section A.2.14 ( Why is voluntarism not enough?).

Anarchists argue that organisations do not need to be hierarchical, they can be based upon co-operation between equals who manage their own affairs directly. In this way we can do without hierarchical structures (i.e. the delegation of power in the hands of a few). Only when an association is self-managed by its members can it be considered truly anarchistic.

We are sorry to belabour this point, but some capitalist apologists, apparently wanting to appropriate the &lt;i&gt;&quot;anarchist&quot;&lt;/i&gt; name because of its association with freedom, have recently claimed that one can be both a capitalist and an anarchist at the same time (as in so-called &lt;i&gt;&quot;anarcho&quot;&lt;/i&gt; capitalism). It should now be clear that since capitalism is based on hierarchy (not to mention statism and exploitation), &lt;i&gt;&quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism is a contradiction in terms. (For more on this, see Section F)

Hi pretty! I love and miss you and require chill-time soon :)
Btw, your &quot;About Me&quot; is so cute :D

Angela,

I took a few moments to read about your background and your philosophy of education.  It seems that you have quite a remarkable background in music.  That is wonderful.  I can't say the same about myself.  I enjoy music, but am no as emersed in it as you--and certainly no where near as talented in music.  Looking over your paragraph on the philosophy of education, it sounds as though you are going to be an excellent teacher.  I can appreciate your intention of offering a variety of teaching strategies to your students and to look for ways to incorporate technology into your class.  If you give developing these ideas, starting at such a young as where you are now, I know that when you a finished your career in teaching, you will have made a tremendous impact on the lives of a lot of people.  Best of luck with all your pursuits!

Michael

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page list examples of how to create Multi-Methods with the Clojure API.
== defmulti ==
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(defmulti area :Shape)
(defn rect [wd ht] {:Shape :Rect :wd wd :ht ht})
(defn circle [radius] {:Shape :Circle :radius radius})
(defmethod area :Rect [r]
    (* (:wd r) (:ht r)))
(defmethod area :Circle [c]
    (* (. Math PI) (* (:radius c) (:radius c))))
(defmethod area :default [x] :oops)
(def r (rect 4 13))
(def c (circle 12))
(area r)
-&gt; 52
(area c)
-&gt; 452.3893421169302
(area {})
-&gt; :oops
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This is an example of using multi-methods without using a hierarchy:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(defmulti rand-str 
  (fn [] (&gt; (rand) 0.5)))

(defmethod rand-str true
  [] &quot;true&quot;)

(defmethod rand-str false
  [] &quot;false&quot;)

(for [x (range 5)] (rand-str))
-&gt; (&quot;false&quot; &quot;false&quot; &quot;true&quot; &quot;true&quot; &quot;false&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== defmethod ==
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(defmulti fib int) 
(defmethod fib 0 [_] 1) 
(defmethod fib 1 [_] 1) 
(defmethod fib :default [n] (+ (fib (- n 2)) (fib (- n 1)))) 
user=&gt; (map fib (range 10)) 
(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55) 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Another example where the '''defmulti''' takes arguments and evaluates them before calling the '''defmethod'''
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(defmulti multi-fun
  (fn [x y] (+ x y)))
(defmethod multi-fun 3 [x y]
  (print &quot;Specialisation 3&quot;))
(defmethod multi-fun :default [x y]
  (print &quot;Generic &quot; (+ x y)))
user=&gt; (multi-fun 1 2)
Specialisation 3
user=&gt; (multi-fun 3 4)
Generic 7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== doseq ==

(doseq [i [1 2 3 4]] (print i))

; This is an example of using destructuring to pair an index with each element of a seq.
(doseq [[index word] (map vector 
                          (iterate inc 0) 
                          [&quot;one&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;three&quot;])]

-&gt; {a=1, b=2}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
NB: doto returns the object after modification, which is very convenient.
Consider in the above example no variable binding is required to access the resultant object.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
(.addChild *scene-graph*
  (doto (KeyNavigatorBehavior.
         (-&gt; *universe* .getViewingPlatform .getViewPlatformTransform))
    (setSchedulingBounds (BoundingSphere. (Point3d.) 10000.0))))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Here you can see it is much more readable using doto than the alternative which would be to create a temporary binding with let.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Abitt002,

I completely understand where you are coming from with not ever being able to determine specifically what age group of children you would like to work with. I cannot tell you how many times, sometimes with a month's period of time, that I have flip flopped between what grade I would like to teach. I even considered school counseling, and also social work as well due to my degree. I recently graduated with my undergraduate degree in Sociology this past May, and have no intention of using it besides helping me to better understand interactions among people, including my future students. I decided to get my Master's and liscensure in Prek-6 recently(switched from 6-8) and am looking forward to working with the kids. I understand what you mean about not using the undergraduate degree you received, I love my degree and the coursework however the jobs associated with it most directly were not appealing to me. I hope to communicate with you more as the semester progresses, I am also a hardworking student like you and look forward to this class and what it can contribute to my knowledge! Good to know someone else has been in my shoes also! [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 16:48, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This case study examines Ritsumeikan University and their Kyoto Museum for World Peace.  Ritsumeikan--initially established as a military school focusing on law, politics, and military strategy to support and defend the emperor and Japan--has drastically changed over the years to emphasize peace and democracy across, not only Japan, but the world.  As such, they have established the Kyoto Museum for World Peace which seeks to portray honest and truthful facts and depictions of World War II as well as displaying their hopes and visions for a peaceful future.


Included in this short case study are Ritsumeikan and the Kyoto Museum of World Peace's missions and goals, their locations, partner nations and organizations, an abbreviated historical timeline, their local significance, and their global impact.

= Mission &amp; Goals =

=== Ritsumeikan University ===
“Ritsumeikan, as a Japanese institution located in the Asia Pacific region, is committed to sincerely reflecting upon history and to building an institution where many cultures coexist in the spirit of international mutual understanding.  …  Ritsumeikan will foster learning and the development of individual talents in order to nurture just and ethical global citizens.  Ritsumeikan, as an institute of education and research, pledges to promote peace, democracy and sustainable development in Japan and throughout the world, in keeping with the spirit of this Charter.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritsumeikan Charter&quot;&gt;[http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/eng/profile/charter/index.shtml The Ritsumeikan Charter.], Ritsumeikan University (2006). Retrieved on May 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kyoto Museum for World Peace ===
“Located just outside of the campus of Kyoto's Ritsumeikan University, the museum is in part the school's attempt at atoning for its war-time misdeeds. Like nearly all institutions, Ritsumeikan actively cooperated with the government and military in the pre-War build-up.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Visitor&quot;&gt;[http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=428&amp;pID=1692 Japan Visitor.] Japan Visitor: Kyoto Museum for World Peace (2000).

= Local Significance =

Ritsumeikan University has been a respected educational institute of Japan for over a century and their Kyoto Museum for World Peace is a testament to their mission and goals.  Both the Kyoto Museum for World Peace and the education which Ritsumeikan offers at its institutions serve to enrich the citizens of Japan and their diverse group of transfer students as well as encourage peaceful and democratic ways of thinking.


The location of the Kyoto Museum for World Peace is only two blocks away from Ritsumeikan University's main campus.  Since Ritsumeikan University was a military school which contributed to the war efforts of WWII and, after the war, drastically changed their emphasis to training their students for peaceful relations, it is only fitting that they open and maintain their museum close to the site of their main campus.


Considering that the Kyoto Museum of World Peace has hosted over 520,000 visitors&lt;ref name=&quot;Peace Museum&quot;&gt;[http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/eng/profile/peacemuseum/index.shtml Peace Museum.] Ritsumeikan Peace Museum (n.d.). Retrieved May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and school groups from over 3000 different schools,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritsumeikan Article&quot; /&gt; it would seem that the Japanese people seem to be interested in learning more on the whole truth of the war and on maintaining peace which the museum strives to display.


= Global Impact &amp; Significance =

Ritsumeikan University’s goal for the Kyoto Museum of World Peace is to tell the whole truth of the war; an effort few organizations or nations attempt.  If anything, Ritsumeikan serves as a prime example (in the opinion of the author) of what a peace organization should be: honest and forthcoming about past transgressions.  This helps everyone--Japanese as well as other nationalities--to move past these issues and move forward toward a more peaceful future.  It is the author's hope that more organizations and countries will realize this.


Ritsumeikan has affected the United States as well as many countries around the globe in that they have affiliations with over 300 universities, organizations, and institutions.  This facilitates multi-cultural learning, experience, and tolerance between Japan and these other nations--key factors in maintaining peaceful relations.  


= Impact on the Author =

While researching for this case study, the author has found that Ritsumeikan has opportunities for Summer study abroad programs which cater to both experienced and non-experienced Japanese language students.  From what I have learned thus far, Ritsumeikan seems to be a very warm and accepting environment which I feel would be a huge plus should a student wish to participate in such a program.  I, for one, am considering it, and I am looking forward to visiting the Suzaku campus while in Kyoto.


As for the Museum, I very much look forward to visiting and hope to report back with more in-depth information, insights, and pictures after doing so.

===Overview===

All living things are composed of cells which fall basically into two types '''eukaryotic''', or '''prokaryotic'''. Bacteria are prokaryotic cells. Typically there is no nucleus, and the intracellular structure lacks organules. 

Animals and plants are composed of Eukaryocytic cells, These cells contain a nucleus and are characterized by several different intra-cellular organules. This section deals mainly with animal eukaryocytic cells, although prokaryotic metabolism is touched on because of its importance in antibiotic action.

The thumbnail on the right shows the typical features of a cell as seen under with a light microscope using a standard stain. The chief features are a cell membrane, a granular cytoplasm, and a nucleus with in most cases a darker staining nucleous.

To see other features usually requires special stains, or an electron microscope.

The chief constituents of the cytoplasm are water, electrolytes, fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Water constitutes about 80% of the cell.

The chief electrolytes are potassium, phosphates sulfates, magnesium and bicarbonates. In smaller concentrations are sodium, calcium and chlorine. Sodium and chlorine are found outside the cell in the interstital fluid, in the same proportions as sea water, but less concentrated. It is hypothesized that the concentration seen probably represents the concentration of sea water when multicellular animals first evolved from single celled animals.

Fats include the fat soluble phospho-lipids and cholesterol. Phospholipids are of importance because they makeup the membrane of the cell wall, the nuclear membrane, and of the various organules found in the cell.

Carbohydrates include glucose and glycogen. Most cells have some glycogen - about 1%. Muscle cells have about 3%, and the liver up to 7%.

Apart from water, proteins are the next bigest constituent, between 15% and 20%. They fall into two categories, structural proteins and functional proteins. The structural proteins provide the skeleton of the cell, the functional proteins include numerous 'working' polypeptides including enzymes. The cell wall is studded with specialized proteins, indeed the cell wall is about 70% protein. Membranes of organules also have these specialized proteins in their wall. Many of these are concerned with transport of substances in and out of the cell.

In the next section we will look at the makeup and structure of the cell in more detail, and then we will look at how structure is married to function.

      <comment>/* Amino Acid Structure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Proteins are large molecules made from smaller building blocks called amino acids. If there are less than 10 amino acids the molecule is called a '''peptide'''; if 10 to 100 a '''polypeptide'''; and more than 100 a ''''protein'''. There are twenty different amino acids, and the body can synthesize eleven of them. The other nine &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be obtained in the diet, and are known as the ''essential'' amino acids.

==Amino Acid Structure==
Amino acids all have the basic backbone. They all consist of a carbon atom (C)  attached to a carboxyl group (-COOH),  an amino group, (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a Hydrogen,  and another group of atoms (R). The R group gives the amino acid its unique characteristics, and allows it to react with other amino acids in unique ways. Every amino acid starts with Methionine (Met). Met attaches to the N-terminal end (amine group). That amine group attaches to carboxyl group of the next amino acid. That carboxyl group then attaches to amine group of the next amino acid. Here is a  depiction of a 'model' amino acid:

[[File:Amino_Acid.JPG|400px|Amino acid  structure]]

And here is a group of typical amino acids. Note the sulphur atom in methionine:

[[File:Methionine.png|200px|Methionine]]

==The Amino Acids==
Below are the names of the 20 amino acids. Each amino acid has a three letter designation as well as a single letter designation. The amino acids are sorted in eight groups aliphatic, organic acid, amide, organic base, sulfur containing, alcohol containing, imine, and aromatic. Aliphatic (carbon side chains) groups consists of alanine, glycine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. The organic acid group consist of glutamic and aspartic acid. With a similar structure to the acids, the amides are aspargine and glutamine. The group of organic base consist of arginine, lysine, and histidine. Those amino acids consisting of sulfur are methionine and cysteine. Proline is the only imine. The alcohols are serine, threonine, and tyrosine (also an aromatic) and the aromatic amino acids consists of tryptophan and phenylalanine. 



{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Amino Acid||Three Letter &lt;br /&gt;Abbreviation||Single Letter &lt;br /&gt;Symbol
|-
|Alanine||Ala||A
|-
|Arginine||Arg||R
|-
|Asparagine||Asn||N
|-
|Asparagine or Aspartic Acid||Asx||B
|-

|-
|Threonine*||Thr||T
|-
|Tryptophan*||Trp||W
|-
|Tyrosine||Tyr||Y
|-
|Valine*||Val||V
|}

Asterix [*] denotes essential amino acid.

==Classification of Amino Acids==
Although there are many ways to classify amino acids, these molecules can be assorted into 6 main groups, on the basis of their structure and general chemical characteristics of their R groups.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Classes of Amino Acids||Name of the Amino Acid
|-
|Aliphatic|| Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine
|-
|Hydroxyl or &lt;br/&gt;Sulfur-containing|| Serine, Cysteine, Threonine, Methionine
|-
|Cyclic|| Proline
|-
|Aromatic||Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan
|-
|Basic||Histidine, Lysine, Arginine
|-
|Acidic and &lt;br/&gt; their amide|| Aspartate, Glutamate, Asparagine, Glutamate

|}



==Peptide Structure==
When two amino acids join together the amino group of one links with the acid group of the other, with the loss of a molecule of water. Amino acids are linked by peptide bond. 
[[File:Peptide_bond_formation.svg|Peptide bond formation.]]

==Protein Structure==
[[Image:Protein-structure.png|thumb|250px|'''Protein structure''', from primary to quaternary structure.]]
Because of their bonding proteins will take on numerous different forms and shapes. Proteins have what is called a primary, a secondary, a tertiary, and a quaternary structure. The primary structure describes the sequencing of the amino acid. It is very useful to know the amino acid sequence of a protein. Some of the uses of knowing amino acid sequences of proteins are following: similarity among proteins, evolution of proteins, existence of repeats or modules, identify localization signals, prepare antibodies against a protein, and  allow the design of DNA probes to locate a gene. The secondary structure describes the spatial arrangement of the amino acids in the chain and is usually either helical in nature, or so called beta-pleated; and the tertiary structure describes the three dimensional shape of the protein and is usually either fibrous or globular. The quaternary structure is the specific association of multiple polypeptide chains to form multisubunit complexes.

More can be found on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure protein structure]] at Wikipedia.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

==The Secondary Structure==
The secondary structure of amino acids consists of two major components: alpha helix and beta strands. The alpha helix consist of various hydrogen bonds to the nitrogen and oxygen components in a ''n + 4'' matter.  A looser or tighter alpha helices also exist: ''n + 5'' or ''n + 3.''  On the other hand, beta strands do not form helices: they form sheets. Beta sheets can be displayed in two different ways: parallel and antiparallel. As the title states, the parallel beta sheets run perfectly on top of each other, whereas antiparallel beta sheets alter in their direction. Even though it may sound as the parallel are more stable, the truth is the antiparallel are more stable. 
The beta sheets can be seen in the following weblink[[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/chemistry/Rizzo/Chem220b/beta_sheet.gif]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is very nice to &quot;meet&quot; you Amy Crowder! There is much to be said of someone who will help take care of their grandparents (as I am in the same situation), so I commend you for that. I guess the saying about ending up doing the one thing you said you would never do came true in your case! How neat that you are able to work alongside you mother teaching children. I'm sure you are learning a lot from her. As far as your teaching philosophy, I agree that children, no matter what their differences, should be given the best education possible. There should really be no special treatment as far as someone deciding who should be taught what. Each child should be given the same opportunities!


Hi Amy, just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot; for the encouraging words and just taking the time to respond to my article.  I also work with students in special education (going on nine years) and I do love the work.  Believe me, I doubt it very much if you will become an &quot;old crotchety school teacher&quot;. You are right about the use of technology being used the classroom; technology is becoming a very popular instrument when it comes to teaching students and completing paperwork.  I also agree with you on your teaching philosophy. All students should be taught on their level and given the same opportunities to succeed.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 23:21, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


Hello Amy.  You have a very interesting story!  I really enjoyed reading your page.  I can definitely relate to the way you decided later on to teach.  I said I would never be a teacher, and now look at me!  I also completely agree with what you said about all children being given an opportunity.  I am a strong believer that everyone has the ability to learn.  It sounds like you will become a great teacher!  Good luck with all you do!

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(map (fn [a] (str &quot;hi &quot; a)) [&quot;mum&quot; &quot;dad&quot; &quot;sister&quot;])

&lt;/source&gt;

== #() ==

See the [http://clojure.org/reader reader] page, (Macro characters -&gt; Dispatch -&gt; Anonymous function literal) for an explanation of the '%' and other characters used to refer to function arguments.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
user=&gt; (def sq #(* % %))
#'user/sq
user=&gt; (sq 3)
9
user=&gt; (map #(class %) [1 &quot;asd&quot;])      
(java.lang.Integer java.lang.String)
user=&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

== &quot;lambda&quot; ==
Use fn, or even better there is a custom syntax to create an anonymous function:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(map #(str &quot;hi &quot; %) [&quot;mum&quot; &quot;dad&quot; &quot;sister&quot;])
&lt;/source&gt;

== % ==
Represents an optional argument to an unnamed function:
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
#(+ 2 %)
#(+ 2 %1 %2)
&lt;/source&gt;

Arguments in the body are determined by the presence of argument literals taking the form %, %n or %&amp;. % is a synonym for %1, %n designates the nth arg (1-based), and %&amp; designates a rest arg.

== complement ==
Usage: (complement f)

Takes a fn f and returns a fn that takes the same arguments as f,
has the same effects, if any, and returns the opposite truth value.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
user=&gt; (defn single-digit[x] (&lt; x 10))
#'user/single-digit
user=&gt; (single-digit 9)
true
user=&gt; (single-digit 10)
false
user=&gt; (def multi-digit (complement single-digit))
#'user/multi-digit
user=&gt; (multi-digit 9)
false
user=&gt; (multi-digit 10)
true
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Regan, My name is Holly and first I would just like to say what an adorable little puppy you have! What kind is it? I have a little Pomeranian, and she is a little poof-ball too! I can somewhat relate to your story, because I started out wanting to teach and then changed my mind and majored in Graphic Design. I have just finished all of the classes and can graduate with a BFA, however now I've decided I still want to teach! I am working towards a teaching certification so I can teach art, and hope to graduate in the spring. 

I am new at thinking about teaching philosophies as well, however, I agree with your statement that all children are teachable. Excluding a student in the classroom, because they may have difficulties, is a terrible thing to think about! I recently was able to observe a special ed class in the art classroom. It was one of the most enjoyable experience I have had recently! To see the children's faces light up while making an art project was exciting. They were learning how fun it is to create something through art. :-)



== HELLO ==
I was browsing through the pages when I had to stop at yours because of the adorable puppy.  That is one of the cutest dogs ever!!!  You will have to let me know what kind of dog it is.  It is awsome how you love so many water activites.  I do as well.  I plan on moving to a beach area in the near future.  It is a great atmosphere.  I have always wnated to try surfing.  I do not know how good I would be at it.  I may just stick with the boogie board :):)  

I enjoyed reading your teaching philosophy.  I would totally agree with you that the teacher needs to have compassion and love for their job.  I have comes across so many teachers/educators who seem to be so cold hearted and not even want to help the children.  I want to stop and ask them &quot;Do you even like children or people in general.&quot;  It is shocking to me sometimes the attitude people have.  I would also agree with you that every child can learn.  It still amazes me that an educator or anyone else would ever question that.[[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 13:55, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

==Hi Regan==

Cute dog!  What kind is it?  Jamie and I (and Whiteknight [that's right, the administrator]) have a guess...  Awesome!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This case study examines a brief overview of &quot;Comfort Women&quot; during World War II.  This controversial issue involves girls and women termed 'comfort women' during WWII whose sole purpose was to be used as prostitutes by the Japanese soldiers.  There is debate between the Japanese government and actual comfort women survivors and sympathizers as to whether the comfort women were tricked or forced into the work or were actually willing volunteers.  Also debated is the Japanese government's involvement in contracting and employing the comfort women and operating the comfort stations.  Though WWII seems far behind us, this issue is still a hot and unresolved topic today.  

This article touches on these issues including such information as countries where the comfort women came from and the comfort stations existed, a brief timeline of important events relating to this topic, and the local as well as the global impact and significance of this controversial issue.  

For more detailed information, please visit [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women the Wiki for Comfort Women].

== Locations ==

Most of the comfort women during WWII were from Korea but others have been documented to have come from China, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. The comfort stations themselves were located in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, the then Malaya, Thailand, the then Burma, the then New Guinea, Hong Kong, Macau, and the then French Indochina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Factbox&quot;&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKSP21646220070305 Reuters UK] FACTBOX: Disputes over Japan's wartime &quot;comfort women&quot; continue (Mar. 5, 2007). Retrieved May 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==

Below are important dates and details of the comfort women issue, gathered from several sources referenced within.


'''1932''' – Japanese Lieutenant-General Okamura Yasuji seeks a solution to rapes reported by local residents, perpetrated by his Japanese troops in Shanghai, China.  He requests comfort women to be sent for his soldiers as an alternative.  This soon becomes common practice most anywhere the Japanese army send their troops.  In order to procure these tens of thousands of comfort women, many women and families with daughters are lied to--promised factory work for the women, for instance--and then taken to the comfort stations where they are held prisoner to work as sex slaves, being raped repeatedly day and night.  Other women are simply kidnapped outright or sold by parents or caretakers into the work.  Very few women enter into this work willingly, and those that do were usually current prostitutes or those poor enough that they have no other choice but to accept the work to avoid starvation.  An estimated 50,000 to 200,000 women are suspected to have been employed as comfort women for the over two million soldiers in service during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dottie Horn&quot;&gt;[http://research.unc.edu/endeavors/win97/comfort.html Comfort Women] by Dottie Horn (1997). Retrieved May 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''1945''' – The war ends and comfort stations with it.  Most comfort women, on penalty of both personal and family shame and embarrassment, do not talk about their experiences, much less make an issue of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dottie Horn&quot; /&gt;

'''1988''' – Professor Yun Chung Ok of Ehwa Women's University in Korea--where most comfort women are presumed to have come from--conducts and presents research about comfort women with her activist group, bringing the issue back into the spotlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dottie Horn&quot; /&gt;

'''1990''' – Thirty-seven Korean women's groups form the Voluntary Service Corps Problem Resolution Council and demand that the Japanese government admit that Korean women were forcibly drafted to serve as comfort women during the war, that they publicly apologize, fully disclose what happened, raise a memorial, compensate survivors or their living families, and include the facts in historical education.

== Local Significance ==

While the issue of comfort women took place mostly abroad during WWII, it is now an issue that threatens Japan’s reputation and standing with other nations (whether affected by this matter directly or not), most importantly and including their allies.  By prolonging an accepted resolution on this topic, especially after decades have passed since its occurrence, it casts a bad image of Japan and the Japanese government in many other nations' eyes.

The Japanese people as well as the government of Japan seem to be at different points of acceptance and belief with the comfort women issue.  Some are still in denial, saying that it either never happened or that the women voluntarily took the jobs knowing that they would be prostitutes, while yet others are pushing for their government to not only admit their involvement but to also make the proper reparations so that everyone--victims and transgressors alike--can move on and try, at long last, to put the past behind them.  

Admitting that one is wrong is a difficult thing to do.  For a government to admit their fault and, on top of that, pay great sums of money due to their admission, it is an even greater difficulty to overcome.  However, it is the belief of the author that if the Japanese government has more to gain from an admission, such as the strengthened alliances between other countries, then they may be more willing to work toward admitting this past transgression.  As it stands currently, they seem to believe that they have more to lose.

== Global Impact &amp; Significance ==

The issue of comfort women during WWII spans many countries around the world, even those not initially involved, such as the United States.  The comfort women matter is an unsightly obstacle in the way of Japan's relations with other countries and, though it may be viewed by some as a minor issue due to the length of time ago which it occurred, it is still a pebble in everyone's shoe and will continue to be an irritant until the matter is satisfactorily resolved.

After getting nowhere with the Japanese government for reparations, many countries whose citizens were victimized have turned to the UN and, specifically the United States, for help in convincing the Japanese government to make an official apology and make the proper reparations to the victims themselves or to their surviving families.  Thus far, Japan has yet to yield to these demands.&lt;ref name =&quot;Cold Comfort&quot; /&gt;

Lastly, lobbyists and supporters pushing for the Japanese government to atone for their involvement in the comfort stations have other motives besides aiding those victimized during WWII.  Such situations as the comfort women faced over 50 years ago are reported to be still continuing today in Southeast Asia in the form of those similar to the methods reportedly used to trick young girls and women into becoming comfort women--hiring agencies promising jobs abroad and then, when the girls and women arrive, their passports are taken and they are forced into prostitution.  Some Asian countries are even known to offer incentives to their male employees in the form of trips to brothels and/or tours to the brothels in other countries as a reward for a job well done.  

The fact that women are still seen by some as mere sex objects for the sole use of providing pleasure to men is an issue still occurring today all over the world as can be seen in media, cultural attitudes and double standards regarding sex, and political laws and policies.  By forcing Japan into fully admitting their fault and making satisfactory reparations, these women's and human rights supporters are hoping to send a message to those still believing that such acts are permissible and easily dismissed.  Hopefully by doing this, it will help change the way women are viewed and treated, especially during a war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dottie Horn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Cold Comfort&quot; /&gt;

== Impact on the Author ==

As a woman, the rape and commodification of other women is an issue that pains me deeply.  This research was difficult at times, especially reading some of the testimonials, both from comfort women victim survivors and those of former Japanese soldiers who used the comfort stations during the war.  I am sure that this is a matter which will take many more years to resolve, however I do hope that the Japanese government--whether directly at fault or not--will do the right thing and take responsibility for the matter.  This is not an issue that will disappear with time--at least, it shouldn’t be.  If something such as this is allowed to be forgotten, it will only help to ensure that it happens again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
===Fats===
Fats or lipids are the main way that the body stores excess nutrients. One Gram of fat will produce about 9 Kilocals, as opposed to 4 Kilocals for carbohydrate or protein. 

Fats consist of 1-3 fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. 

-IMAGE

Fatty acids consist of the general formular R-COOH, wher R is a carbohydrate chain. 

-IMAGE

Fatty Acids can be metablolised in almost all cells of the body, the notable exception are brain cells, to produce ATP from ADP. They are broken down by a process called beta-oxidation to produce two carbon units which are then fed into the Citric Acid Cycle via Acetyl CoA. 

-IMAGE

Other important lipid related compounds are Cholesterol, important in its own right and essential as a prcursor for Steroids, and phospholipids which form the walls of all cell membranes.

==Chemistry &amp;amp; Structure==
===Fatty Acids===
Fatty acids consist of a carbon chain radicle and an acidic carboxyl group - R-COOH: 

-IMAGE

A carbon chain with no double bonds is known as an saturated fatty acid; that with a single doublebond as a monounsaturated acid; and that with several saturated bonds as a polyunsaturated fatty acid. 

===Glycerides and Phospholipids===
Fatty Acids are combined with Glycerol to make Glycerides. This is the form in which fat is stored in the body. 

 -IMAGE

A Phospholipid substitutes a phosphate bond for a fatty acid. Phospholipids are important as they makeup cell membranes. The addition of a phosphate bond means that the molecule has two poles, a hydrophillic pole (the phosphate pole) and a hydrophobic pole (the lipid pole). This is covered further when we study cell membranes and the details of the phospholipid bilayer. 

-IMAGE

===Cholesterol, Steroids and Eicanoids===
Closely related to lipids are the steroids, whose structure contains four linked carbon rings. Cholesterol is the source of Steroids in the human body. Cholesterol is also an important component of cell membranes. Eicosanoids are modified twenty carbon fatty acids with a carbon ring, which makes the molecule appear to double back on itself. These molecules form important regulators of function. Prostaglandin is shown in the diagram below. 

-IMAGE

==Fats &amp;amp; Fatty Acid Metabolism==
Ingested nutrients that are surplus to requirements are stored in the fat cells of the body as triglycerides. They are called upon as an energy source when glucose and glycogen stores are running low. Fat contains far fewer Oxygen molecules than either sugars or proteins, and thus is an efficient storage vechicle. One gram of fat will produce about 9 Kilocals (9 Cals - note the capital C) of energy compared with about 4 Cals for sugar and protein.

The first step in mobilising fat as an energy source is to split the triglyceride into Glycerol and the fatty acids. Glycerol can be metabolised to pyruvate, and the fatty acid will enter the mitochondria where it is processed via the Citric Acid Cycle.

-IMAGE

===Fatty Acid Metabolism===
beta-oxidation is a complex process which essentially chops 2-carbon chains of the fatty acid. This then combines with Acetyl CoA, which is metabolised in the Citric Acid Cycle. 

-IMAGE

Most cells can utilise fatty acids directly, but note that they cannot be processed by brain cells which require glucos to function.

===Summary of Fat Metabolism===
The following flow chart illustrates the pathways of fat metabolism in the body. This will be explored further when we look at Digestion. Essentially, all surplus foods and nutrients are converted to fat, and stored in the fay stores of the body. The fat stores then slow down the individual.  This makes them more likely to be consumed by a zombie if running away.  Because zombies do not get tired, they will easily be able to chase down a fat individual who will get tired quickly.  The fat person will make for a large meal for multiple zombies.  Because of this it is good to keep fat friends around.  If you are attacked by zombies you can push your fat friend down and get away.

-IMAGE

===Cholesterol Metabolism===
Cholesterol is the source of all the Steroid drugs, as well as being important in its own right. Even in the absence of dietary intake (such as will occur with a vegan diet) it must be manufactured. Most synthesis takes place in the liver - about 25% - with the intestines, adrenals, and reproductive organs being other important sites of synthesis. The cholesterol molecule is synthesised from the two carbon molecules of Acetyl CoA in a somewhat complex process

{{fsharpTitle|Advanced Data Structures}}

F# comes with its own set of data structures, however its very important to know how to implement data structures from scratch.

Incidentally, hundreds of authors have written thousands of lengthy volumes on this single topic alone, so its unreasonable to provide a comprehensive picture of data structures in the short amount of space available for this book. Instead, this chapter is intended as a cursory introduction to the development of immutable data structures using F#. Readers are encouraged to use the resources listed at the bottom of this page for a more comprehensive treatment of algorithms and data structures.

== Stacks ==
F#'s built-in [[F_Sharp_Programming/Lists|list]] data structure is essentially an immutable stack. While its certainly usable, for the purposes of writing exploratory code, we're going to implement a stack from scratch. We can represent each node in a stack using a simple union:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack&lt;/source&gt;

It's easy enough to create an instance of a stack using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let stack = StackNode(1, StackNode(2, StackNode(3, StackNode(4, StackNode(5, EmptyStack)))))&lt;/source&gt;

Each StackNode contains a value and a pointer to the next stack in the list. The resulting data structure can be diagrammed as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
 ___    ___    ___    ___    ___ 
|_1_|-&gt;|_2_|-&gt;|_3_|-&gt;|_4_|-&gt;|_5_|-&gt;Empty
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can create a boilerplate stack module as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;module Stack =
    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
    let hd = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; hd
        
    let tl = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; tl
        
    let cons hd tl = StackNode(hd, tl)
    
    let empty = EmptyStack&lt;/source&gt;

Let's say we wanted to add a few methods to our stack, such as a method which updates an item at a certain index. Since our nodes are immutable, we can't update our list in place; we need to copy all of the nodes up to the node we want to update.

&lt;pre&gt;
Setting item at index 2 to the value 9.

         0      1      2      3      4
          ___    ___    ___    ___    ___ 
let x =  |_1_|-&gt;|_2_|-&gt;|_3_|-&gt;|_4_|-&gt;|_5_|-&gt;Empty
                              ^
                             /
          ___    ___    ___ /
let y =  |_1_|-&gt;|_2_|-&gt;|_9_|
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, we copy all of the nodes up to index 2 and reuse the remaining nodes. A function like this is very easy to write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec update index value s =
    match index, s with
    | index, EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Index out of range&quot;
    | 0, StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(value, tl)
    | n, StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(hd, update (index - 1) value tl)&lt;/source&gt;

Appending items from one stack to the rear of another uses a similar technique. Since we can't modify stacks in place, we append two stacks by copying all of the nodes from the &quot;front&quot; stack and pointing the last copied node to the our &quot;rear&quot; stack, resulting in the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
Append x and y

          ___    ___    ___    ___    ___ 
let x =  |_1_|-&gt;|_2_|-&gt;|_3_|-&gt;|_4_|-&gt;|_5_|-&gt;Empty
                                             ___    ___    ___ 
let y =                                     |_6_|-&gt;|_7_|-&gt;|_8_|-&gt;Empty
                                            ^
                                           /
          ___    ___    ___    ___    ___ /
let z =  |_1_|-&gt;|_2_|-&gt;|_3_|-&gt;|_4_|-&gt;|_5_|
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can implement this function with minimal effort using the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;let rec append x y =
    match x with
    | EmptyStack -&gt; y
    | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(hd, append tl y)&lt;/source&gt;

Stacks are very easy to work with and implement. The principles behind copying nodes to &quot;modify&quot; stacks is fundamentally the same for all persistent data structures.

'''Complete Stack Module'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;module Stack =
    type 'a stack =
        | EmptyStack
        | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
    let hd = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; hd
        
    let tl = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Emtpy stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; tl
        
    let cons hd tl = StackNode(hd, tl)
    
    let empty = EmptyStack
    
    let rec update index value s =
        match index, s with
        | index, EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Index out of range&quot;
        | 0, StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(value, tl)
        | n, StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(hd, update (index - 1) value tl)
        
    let rec append x y =
        match x with
        | EmptyStack -&gt; y
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(hd, append tl y)

    let rec map f = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; EmptyStack
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; StackNode(f hd, map f tl)
        
    let rec rev s =
        let rec loop acc = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; acc
            | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; loop (StackNode(hd, acc)) tl
        loop EmptyStack s

    let rec contains x = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; false
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; hd = x || contains x tl
        
    let rec fold f seed = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; seed
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; fold f (f seed hd) tl
&lt;/source&gt;

== Queues ==
=== Naive Queue ===
Queues aren't quite as straightforward as stacks. A naive queue can be implemented using a stack, with the caveat that that:

* Items are always appended to the end of the list, and dequeued from the head of the stack.
* -OR- Items are prepended to the front of the stack, and dequeued by reversing the stack and getting its head.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* AwesomeCollections.fsi *)

type 'a stack =
  | EmptyStack
  | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
  
module Stack = begin
  val hd : 'a stack -&gt; 'a
  val tl : 'a stack -&gt; 'a stack
  val cons : 'a -&gt; 'a stack -&gt; 'a stack
  val empty : 'a stack
  val rev : 'a stack -&gt; 'a stack
end

[&lt;Class&gt;]
type 'a Queue =
    member hd : 'a
    member tl : 'a Queue
    member enqueue : 'a -&gt; 'a Queue
    static member empty : 'a Queue&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* AwesomeCollections.fs *)

type 'a stack =
    | EmptyStack
    | StackNode of 'a * 'a stack
        
module Stack =        
    let hd = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Empty stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; hd
        
    let tl = function
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;Emtpy stack&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; tl
        
    let cons hd tl = StackNode(hd, tl)
    
    let empty = EmptyStack
        
    let rec rev s =
        let rec loop acc = function
            | EmptyStack -&gt; acc
            | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; loop (StackNode(hd, acc)) tl
        loop EmptyStack s
    
type Queue&lt;'a&gt;(item : stack&lt;'a&gt;) =
    member this.hd
        with get() = Stack.hd (Stack.rev item)
        
    member this.tl
        with get() = Queue(item |&gt; Stack.rev |&gt; Stack.tl |&gt; Stack.rev)
        
    member this.enqueue(x) = Queue(StackNode(x, item))
    
    override this.ToString() = sprintf &quot;%A&quot; item
    
    static member empty = Queue&lt;'a&gt;(Stack.empty)&lt;/source&gt;

We use an interface file to hide the &lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt; class's constructor. Although this technically satisfies the function of a queue, every dequeue is an O(''n'') operation where ''n'' is the number of items in the queue. There are lots of variations on the same approach, but these are often not very practical in practice. We can certainly improve on the implementation of immutable queues.

=== Queue From Two Stacks ===
The implementation above isn't very efficient because it requires reversing our underlying data representation several times. Why not keep those reversed stacks around for future use? Rather than using one stack, we can have two stacks: a front stack &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and a rear stack &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;.

Stack &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; holds items in the correct order, while stack &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; holds items in reverse order; this allows the first element in &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to be the head of the queue, and the first element in &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; to be the last item in queue. So, a queue of the numbers 1 .. 6 might be represented with &lt;code&gt;f = [1;2;3]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r = [6;5;4]&lt;/code&gt;.

To enqueue a new item, prepend it to the front of &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;; to dequeue an item, pop it off &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;. Both enqueues and dequeues are O(1) operations. Of course, at some point, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; will be empty and there will be no more items to dequeue; in this case, simply move all items from &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and reverse the list. While the queue certainly has O(n) worst-case behavior, it has acceptable O(1) amortized (average case) bounds.

The code for this implementation is straight forward:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type Queue&lt;'a&gt;(f : stack&lt;'a&gt;, r : stack&lt;'a&gt;) =
    let check = function
        | EmptyStack, r -&gt; Queue(Stack.rev r, EmptyStack)
        | f, r -&gt; Queue(f, r)

    member this.hd =
        match f with
        | EmptyStack -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
        | StackNode(hd, tl) -&gt; hd
        
    member this.tl =
        match f, r with
        | EmptyStack, _ -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
        | StackNode(x, f), r -&gt; check(f, r)
        
    member this.enqueue(x) = check(f, StackNode(x, r))
    
    static member empty = Queue&lt;'a&gt;(Stack.empty, Stack.empty)&lt;/source&gt;

This is a simple, common, and useful implementation of an immutable queue. The magic is in the &lt;code&gt;check&lt;/code&gt; function which maintains that &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; always contains items if they are available.

: '''Note: ''' The queue's periodic O(n) worst case behavior can give it unpredictable response times, especially in applications which rely heavily on persistence since its possible to hit the pathological case each time the queue is accessed. However, this particular implementation of queues is perfectly adequate for the vast majority of applications which do not require persistence or uniform response times.

As shown above, we often want to wrap our underlying data structure in class for two reasons:
# To simplify the interface to the data structure. For example, clients neither know nor care that our queue uses two stacks; they only know that items in the queue obey the principle of first-in, first-out.
# To prevent clients from putting the underlying data in the data structure in an invalid state.

Beyond stacks, virtually all data structures are complex enough to require wrapping up class to hide away complex details from clients.

== Binary Search Trees ==
Binary search trees are similar to stacks, but each node points to two other nodes called the left and right child nodes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a tree =
    | EmptyTree
    | TreeNode of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree&lt;/source&gt;

Additionally, nodes in the tree are ordered in a particular way: each item in a tree is greater than all items in its left child node and less than all items in its right child node.

Since our tree is immutable, we &quot;insert&quot; into the tree by returning a brand new tree with the node inserted. This process is more efficient than it sounds: we copy nodes as we traverse down the tree, so we only copy nodes which are in the path of our node being inserted. Writing a binary search tree is relatively straightforward:

We're using an interface and a wrapper class to hide the implementation details of the tree from the user, otherwise the user could construct a tree which invalidates the specific ordering rules used in the binary tree.

This implementation is simple and it allows us to add and lookup any item in the tree in O(log n) best case time. However, it suffers from a pathological case: if we add items in sorted order, or mostly sorted order, then the tree can become heavily unbalanced. For example, the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;[1 .. 7] |&gt; Seq.fold (fun (t : BinaryTree&lt;_&gt;) x -&gt; t.insert(x)) BinaryTree.empty&lt;/source&gt;
Results in this tree:

&lt;pre&gt;
    1
   / \
  E   2
     / \
    E   3
       / \
      E   4
         / \
        E   5
           / \
          E   6
             / \
            E   7
               / \
              E   E
&lt;/pre&gt;

A tree like this isn't much better than our inefficient queue implementation above! Trees are most efficient when they have a minimum height and are as full as possible. Ideally, we'd like to represent the tree above as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
         
        _ 4 _
       /     \
      2       6
     / \     / \
    1   3   5   7
   / \ / \ / \ / \
   E E E E E E E E
&lt;/pre&gt;

The minimum height of the tree is ceiling(log n + 1), where n is the number of items in the list. When we insert items into the tree, we want the tree to balance itself to maintain the minimum height. There are a variety of self-balancing tree implementations, many of which are easy to implement as immutable data structures.

=== Red Black Trees ===
Red-black trees are self-balancing trees which attach a &quot;color&quot; attribute to each node in the tree.  In addition to the rules defining a binary search tree, red-black trees must maintain the following set of rules:
# A node is either red or black.
# The root node is always black.
# No red node has a red child.
# Every simple path from a given node to any of its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes. 

[[Image:Red-black tree example.svg|thumb|500px|An example of a red-black tree|center]]

We can augment our binary tree with a color field as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type color = R | B    
type 'a tree =
    | E
    | T of color * 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree&lt;/source&gt;

When we insert into the tree, we need to rebalance the tree to restore the rules. In particular, we need to remove nodes with a red child. There are four cases where a red node may have a red child. They are depicted in the diagram below by the top, right, bottom, and left trees. The center tree is the balanced version.

                        /  \

                         /  \
                        b    c
  
                         ||
                         \/

                         /\
                         ||

                       B(x)
                       /  \
                      a   R(z)
                          /  \
                        R(y)  d
                        /  \
                       b    c
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can modify our binary tree class as follows:

                if item = y then node
                elif item &lt; y then balance(c, ins a, y, b)
                else balance(c, a, y, ins b)

        (* Forcing root node to be black *)

        | E -&gt; ()
        | T(c, l, x, r) -&gt;
            print (spaces + 4) r
            printfn &quot;%s %A%A&quot; (new System.String(' ', spaces)) c x
            print (spaces + 4) l
    
type 'a BinaryTree(inner : 'a tree) =
    member this.hd = Tree.hd inner
    member this.left = BinaryTree(Tree.left inner)
    member this.right = BinaryTree(Tree.right inner)
    member this.exists item = Tree.exists item inner
    member this.insert item = BinaryTree(Tree.insert item inner)
    member this.print() = Tree.print 0 inner
    static member empty = BinaryTree&lt;'a&gt;(E)
&lt;/source&gt;

All of the magic that makes this tree work happens in the &lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; function. We're not performing any terribly complicated transformations to the tree, yet it comes out relatively balanced (in fact, the maximum depth of this tree is 2 * ceiling(log n + 1) ).

=== AVL Trees ===
AVL trees are named after its two inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis. These trees are self-balancing because the heights of the two child subtrees of any node will only differ 0 or 1; therefore, these trees are said to be height-balanced.

An empty node in a tree has a height of 0; non-empty nodes have a height &gt;= 1. We can store the height of each node in our tree definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type 'a tree =
    | Node of int * 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree  (* height, left child, value, right child *)
    | Nil&lt;/source&gt;

The height of any node is equal to &lt;code&gt;max(left height, right height) + 1&lt;/code&gt;. For convenience, we'll use the following constructor to create a tree node and initialize its height:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
let height = function
    | Node(h, _, _, _) -&gt; h
    | Nil -&gt; 0
    
let make l x r =
    let h = 1 + max (height l) (height r)
    Node(h, l, x ,r)&lt;/source&gt;

Inserting into an AVL tree is very similar to inserting into an unbalanced binary tree with one exception: after we insert a node, we use a series of tree rotations to re-balance the tree. Each node has an implicit property, its ''balance factor'', which refers to the left-child's height minus the right-child's height; a positive balance factor indicates the tree is weighted on the left, negative indicates the tree is weighted on the right, otherwise the tree is balanced.

We only need to rebalance the tree when balance factor for a node is +/-2. There are four scenarios which can cause our tree to become unbalanced:

'''Left-left case''': root balance factor = +2, left-childs balance factor = +1. Balanced by right-rotating the root node:

&lt;pre&gt;
         5                            3
       /   \    Root                /   \
      3     D   Right rotation     2     5
    /  \            -----&gt;        / \   / \
   2    C                        A   B C   D
  / \
 A   B
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Left-right case''': root balance factor = +2, right-child's balance factor = -1. Balanced by left-rotating the left child, then right-rotating the root (this operation is called a double right rotation):

&lt;pre&gt;
       5                              5                                 4
     /   \      Left child          /   \        Root                 /   \
   3      D     Left rotation      4     D       Right rotation      3     5
  / \                -----&gt;       / \               -----&gt;          / \   / \
 A   4                           3   C                             A   B C   D
    / \                         / \
   B   C                       A   B
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Right-right case''': root balance factor = -2, right-child's balance factor = -1. Balanced by left-rotating the root node:

&lt;pre&gt;
    3                                 5
  /   \         Root                /   \
 A     5        Left rotation      3     7
      / \           -----&gt;        / \   / \
     B   7                       A   B C   D
        / \
       C   D
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Right-left case''': root balance factor = -2, right-child's balance factor = +1. Balanced by right-rotating the right child, then left-rotating the root (this operation is called a double-left rotation):

&lt;pre&gt;
     3                               3                                 4
   /   \        Right child        /   \        Root                 /   \
  A      5      Right rotation    A     4       Left rotation       3     5
        / \         -----&gt;             / \         -----&gt;          / \   / \
       4   D                          B   5                       A   B C   D
      / \                                / \
     B   C                              C   D
&lt;/pre&gt;

With this in mind, its very easy to put together the rest of our AVL tree:

: '''Note:''' The &lt;code&gt;[&lt;GeneralizableValue&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; attribute indicates to F# that the construct can give rise to generic code through type inference . Without the attribute, F# will infer the type of &lt;code&gt;AvlTree.empty&lt;/code&gt; as the undefined type &lt;code&gt;AvlTree&lt;'_a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in a &quot;value restriction&quot; error at compilation.

: '''Optimization tip:''' The tree supports inserts and lookups in &lt;code&gt;log(n)&lt;/code&gt; time, where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the number of nodes in the tree. This is already pretty good, but we can make it faster by eliminating unnecessary comparisons. Notice when we insert a node into the left side of the tree, we can only add weight to the left child; however, the &lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; function checks both sides of the tree for each insert. By re-writing &lt;code&gt;balance&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;balance_left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;balance_right&lt;/code&gt; function to handle, we can handle left- and right-child inserts separately. Similar optimizations are possible on the red-black tree implementation as well.

An AVL trees height is limited to &lt;code&gt;1.44 * log(n)&lt;/code&gt;, whereas a red-black tree's height is limited to &lt;code&gt;2 * log(n)&lt;/code&gt;. The AVL trees smaller height and more rigid balancing leads to slower insert/removal but faster retrieval than red-black trees. In practice, the difference will be hardly noticeable: a lookup on a 10,000,000 node AVL tree lookup requires at most 34 comparisons, compared to 47 comparisons on a red-black tree.

=== Heaps ===
Binary search trees can efficiently find arbitrary elements in a set, however it can be occasionally useful to access the ''minimum'' element in set. Heaps are special data structure which satisfy the ''heap property'': the value of every node is greater than the value of any of its child nodes. Additionally, we can keep the tree approximately balanced using the ''leftist property'', meaning that the height of any left child heap is at least as large as its right sibling. We can hold the height of each tree in each heap node.

Finally, since heaps can be implemented as min- or max-heaps, where the root element will either be the largest or smallest element in the set, we support both types of heaps by passing in an ordering function into heap's constructor as such:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a heap =
    | EmptyHeap
    | HeapNode of int * 'a * 'a heap * 'a heap
    
type 'a BinaryHeap(comparer : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int, inner : 'a heap) =
    static member make(comparer) = BinaryHeap&lt;_&gt;(comparer, EmptyHeap)&lt;/source&gt;

: '''Note:''' the functionality we gain by passing the &lt;code&gt;comparer&lt;/code&gt; function into the &lt;code&gt;BinaryHeap&lt;/code&gt; constructor approximates OCaml functors, although its not quite as elegant.

An interesting consequence of the leftist property is that elements along any path in a heap are stored in sorted order. This means we can merge any two heaps by merging their right spines and swapping children as necessary to restore the leftist property. Since each right spine contains at least as many nodes as the left spine, the height of each right spine is proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements in the heap, so merging two heaps can be performed in O(log n) time. We can implement all of the properties of our heap as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* AwesomeCollections.fsi *)

[&lt;Class&gt;]
type 'a BinaryHeap =
    member hd : 'a
    member tl : 'a BinaryHeap
    member insert : 'a -&gt; 'a BinaryHeap
    member merge : 'a BinaryHeap -&gt; 'a BinaryHeap
    interface System.Collections.IEnumerable
    interface System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;
    static member make : ('b -&gt; 'b -&gt; int) -&gt; 'b BinaryHeap
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
(* AwesomeCollections.fs *)

type 'a heap =
    | EmptyHeap
    | HeapNode of int * 'a * 'a heap * 'a heap
 
module Heap =
    let height = function
        | EmptyHeap -&gt; 0
        | HeapNode(h, _, _, _) -&gt; h
 
    (* Helper function to restore the leftist property *)        
    let makeT (x, a, b) =
        if height a &gt;= height b then HeapNode(height b + 1, x, a, b)
        else HeapNode(height a + 1, x, b, a)
 
    let rec merge comparer = function
        | x, EmptyHeap -&gt; x
        | EmptyHeap, x -&gt; x
        | (HeapNode(_, x, l1, r1) as h1), (HeapNode(_, y, l2, r2) as h2) -&gt;
            if comparer x y &lt;= 0 then makeT(x, l1, merge comparer (r1, h2))
            else makeT (y, l2, merge comparer (h1, r2))
 
    let hd = function
        | EmptyHeap -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
        | HeapNode(h, x, l, r) -&gt; x
 
    let tl comparer = function
        | EmptyHeap -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
        | HeapNode(h, x, l, r) -&gt; merge comparer (l, r)
        
    let rec to_seq comparer = function
        | EmptyHeap -&gt; Seq.empty
        | HeapNode(h, x, l, r) as node -&gt; seq { yield x; yield! to_seq comparer (tl comparer node) }
 
type 'a BinaryHeap(comparer : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int, inner : 'a heap) =
    (* private *)
    member this.inner = inner
 
    (* public *)
    member this.hd = Heap.hd inner
    member this.tl = BinaryHeap(comparer, Heap.tl comparer inner)
    member this.merge (other : BinaryHeap&lt;_&gt;) = BinaryHeap(comparer, Heap.merge comparer (inner, other.inner))
    member this.insert x = BinaryHeap(comparer, Heap.merge comparer (inner,(HeapNode(1, x, EmptyHeap, EmptyHeap))))
    
    interface System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt; with
        member this.GetEnumerator() = (Heap.to_seq comparer inner).GetEnumerator()
            
    interface System.Collections.IEnumerable with
        member this.GetEnumerator() = (Heap.to_seq comparer inner :&gt; System.Collections.IEnumerable).GetEnumerator()
 
    static member make(comparer) = BinaryHeap&lt;_&gt;(comparer, EmptyHeap)&lt;/source&gt;

This heap implements the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; interface, allowing us to iterate through it like a &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt;. In addition to the leftist heap shown above, its very easy to implement immutable versions of splay heaps, binomial heaps, Fibonacci heaps, pairing heaps, and a variety other tree-like data structures in F#.

== Lazy Data Structures ==
Its worth noting that some purely functional data structures above are not as efficient as their imperative implementations. For example, appending two immutable stacks &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; together takes O(''n'') time, where ''n'' is the number of elements in stack &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. However, we can exploit [[F_Sharp_Programming/Caching#Lazy_Values|laziness]] in ways which make purely functional data structures just as efficient as their imperative counterparts.

For example, its easy to create a stack-like data structure which delays all computation until its really needed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;type 'a lazyStack =
    | Node of Lazy&lt;'a * 'a lazyStack&gt;
    | EmptyStack
 
module LazyStack =
    let (|Cons|Nil|) = function
        | Node(item) -&gt;
            let hd, tl = item.Force()
            Cons(hd, tl)
        | EmptyStack -&gt; Nil
 
    let hd = function
        | Cons(hd, tl) -&gt; hd
        | Nil -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
 
    let tl = function
        | Cons(hd, tl) -&gt; tl
        | Nil -&gt; failwith &quot;empty&quot;
 
    let cons(hd, tl) = Node(lazy(hd, tl))
    
    let empty = EmptyStack
 
    let rec append x y =
        match x with
        | Cons(hd, tl) -&gt; Node(lazy(printfn &quot;appending... got %A&quot; hd; hd, append tl y))
        | Nil -&gt; y
 
    let rec iter f = function
        | Cons(hd, tl) -&gt; f(hd); iter f tl
        | Nil -&gt; ()&lt;/source&gt;
		
In the example above, the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; operation returns one node delays the rest of the computation, so appending two lists will occur in constant time. A &lt;code&gt;printfn&lt;/code&gt; statement above has been added to demonstrate that we really don't compute appended values until the first time they're accessed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&gt; open LazyStack;;
&gt; let x = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4, EmptyStack))));;

val x : int lazyStack = Node &lt;unevaluated&gt;

&gt; let y = cons(5, cons(6, cons(7, EmptyStack)));;

val y : int lazyStack = Node &lt;unevaluated&gt;

&gt; let z = append x y;;

val z : int lazyStack = Node &lt;unevaluated&gt;

&gt; hd z;;
appending... got 1
val it : int = 1

&gt; hd (tl (tl z) );;
appending... got 2
appending... got 3
val it : int = 3

&gt; iter (fun x -&gt; printfn &quot;%i&quot; x) z;;
1
2
3
appending... got 4
4
5
6
7
val it : unit = ()&lt;/source&gt;

Interestingly, the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; method clearly runs in O(1) time because the actual appending operation is delayed until a user grabs the head of the list. At the same time, grabbing the head of the list may have the side effect of triggering, at most, one call to the append method without causing a monolithic rebuilding the rest of the data structure, so grabbing the head is itself an O(1) operation. This stack implementation supports supports constant-time consing and appending, and linear time lookups.

Similarly, implementations of lazy queues exists which support O(1) worst-case behavior for all operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Overview===
The most important source of energy for cells is the monosaccharide sugar '''glucose''', which has the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. This is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce energy, carbon dioxide, and water: 

&lt;math&gt; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \longrightarrow 6H_2O + 6CO_2 + Energy &lt;/math&gt; ''(36-38 mols of STP from ADP)''

Glucose is taken into the body as various sugars and complex carbohydrates (such as starches). Enzymes in the digestive process (and various other cells) then produce glucose. In the body, glucose can be built up into a starch called '''glycogen''', which can be stored in the liver and in muscles. This is the body's &quot;reserve supply&quot; of glucose. Energy can be also obtained from proteins and fats, but glucose is particularly important, because it is the only source of energy for brain cells. In fact, if the brain is without glucose for a period of 6-8 minutes, brain  death will occur. Here is the structure of Glucose. It is usually represented as the first image, or simply a hexagonal ring. 

[[Image:Glucose structure.png||||Ring Structure of Glucose]]

Glucose is broken down in a two step process. First, it is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate by a process called '''glycolosis'''. This occours in the cytoplasm of the cell. Then, if oxygen is present, the pyruvate is taken into the mitochondria, and is broken down into Acetyl-CoA (Acetyl coenzyme A), which enters the citric acid cycle, producing high energy hydrogen bonds. The mitochondria process these bonds into high energy ATP (Adenosine tri-phosphate) from ADP (Adenosine di-phosphate). This ATP powers the reactions of the cell. Some 36-38 molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule so processed. This process is shown graphically in the following flow chart.
 
[[Image:Aerobic pathways.png||||Aerobic pathways of Glucose metabolism]]

In the absence of oxygen (such as may occur during severe exercise), the pyruvate is processed into lactic acid (anaerobic tissue respiration), and only two molecules of ATP are produced. In mammals, this is insufficient for the body's needs, and, in the absence of oxygen, cell death occurs in most tissues.

==Sugar Chemistry and Structure== 
Sugars are taken into the body mainly in the form of sugars, monosaccharides &amp; disaccharides, and complex carbohydrates, mainly plant starches. Glucose is the main source of energy in the body, and is the most important of the sugars as its breakdown provides most of the body's energy in the form of the production of ATP from ADP.

===Glucose===
Glucose is a monosaccharide with the general formula '''C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;''', and when it is oxidized by the process of glycolosis and the Citric Acid Cycle, it produces 36-38 molecules of ATP from ADP.

&lt;math&gt; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 + \text{36-38 mols ADP} \longrightarrow 6H_2O + 6CO_2 + \text{36-38 mols ATP} &lt;/math&gt;

Here is the structure of Glucose: 

[[Image:Glucose structure.png||||Ring Structure of Glucose]]

The first form is usually used in illustrations

This process is described in the section on Glycolosis and Energy Production below.

===Other Monosaccharides &amp; Disaccharides===
Besides glucose, other important monosaccharides include fructose, the sugar found in fruits, and galactose, the sugar of milk.  Note that the only difference between glucose and galactose is the arrangement of the hydroxyl groups. These are often ingested in the form of disaccharides.

===Sugar polymers===
Sugars are built into polymers - polysaccharides - in both plants and animals. Animals produce glycogen, plants produce carbohydrates, and insects produce chitin. Much of the sugar that is taken into the body is in the form of carbohydrates. Plants also create a structural compound called cellulose from sugars, which is unfortunately undigestible by humans, even though it is the largest source of carbohydrates!

The important polysaccharide in animal physiology is glycogen, a diagram of its structure is shown here: 

[[Image:Glycogen chain.png||||glycogen structure]]
 
A detail of the bonds is also shown: 

[[Image:Glycogen bonds.png||||glycogen structure]]
 
We will look at Glycogen and glycogenesis pathways in more detail elsewhere.

===Galactose Metabolism===
Galactose is the sugar in milk. Infants have an enzyme in the small intstine that metabolizes Lactose to galactose and glucose. In areas where milk products are regularly consumed, adults have also evolved this enzyme. Galactose is converted in the liver to Glucose-6-phoshpate, and can thus enter the Glycolysis pathway.

                              epimerase
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Fructose Metabolism===
Fructose is absorbed from the small intestine, and passes to the liver where it is metabolised. Most fructose is converted to Glycogen. 


[[Image:Fructose-glycogen.jpg|500px|||fructose conversion]]

The following description and the above flow sheet is taken from the 2009 wiki: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Although the metabolism of fructose and glucose share many of the same intermediate structures,&quot; they have very different metabolic fates in human metabolism. Fructose is metabolized almost completely in the liver in humans, and is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis, while much of dietary glucose passes through the liver where it is metabolized in skeletal muscle to CO2, H2O and ATP, and to fat cells where it is metabolized primarily to glycerol phosphate for triglyceride synthesis as well as energy production. The products of fructose metabolism are liver glycogen and de novo lipogenesis of fatty acids and eventual synthesis of endogenous triglyceride can be divided into two main phases: The first phase is the synthesis of the trioses, dihydroxyacetone(DHAP) and glyceraldehyde; the second phase is the subsequent metabolism of these trioses either in the gluconeogenic pathway for glycogen replenishment and/or the complete metabolism in the fructolytic pathway to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle, is converted to citrate and subsequently directed toward ’’de novo’’ synthesis of the free fatty acid palmitate. &quot; 
(From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructolysis)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Glycolysis &amp; Energy Production== 
Energy is for the most part utilized by cells as ATP which is broken down into ADP with the release of energy. The main source of energy in the cell is glucose, although both fats and amino acids can produce energy by entering into the glycolysis pathway, as is illustrated below. The end product of the glycolysis pathway is pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is taken into the mitochondria, and processed in the citric acid cycle (CAC), producing some ATP but also a lot of high-energy hydrogen bonds in the form of FADH and NADH. These bonds are then taken into the mitochondrial membrane space and are processed into ATP via the electron transport system. A feature of this process is the way that the various metabolic pathways occur in different parts of the cell. Glycolysis occurs in the cell cytoplasm; the citric acid cycle occurs in the inner mitochondrial space; and the High Energy Transport system occurs in the intermembraneous space of the mitochondria. A summary of the process is shown in the following flow diagram: 

[[Image:Aerobic production pathways.png ||||Aerobic production of ATP]]

Between 36 and 38 molecules of high energy ATP are produced in the breakdown of a single glucose molecule in the process. A more detailed flow diagram is given in the flow charts below.

===Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycles===
In the flow sheets each black dot represents a Carbon atom. We will see how glycerol, fats and amino acids enter the system when we look at these molecules. 

Glucose is first broken down into Pyruvate in the Glycolosis pathway:
[[Image:Glycolosis sm.png||||Glycolosis pathway]]

The pyruvate is taken into the Mitochondria, where it is processed in the Citric Acid Cycle:
[[Image:Citric acid cycle pathways.png||||Citric Acid Cycle pathway]]
  
===Localisation of Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycles===
The organules of the cell localise the place where reactions take place. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. In the presence of oxygen pyruvate is transfered into the interior of the mitochondria where it is processed in the Citric Acid Cycle to produce some ATP, and many High Energy Hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds are transported into the inter-membranous space of the mitochondria where the Electron Transport System produces ATP by utilizing the enzyme ATPase.

[[Image:Aerobic mitochondria process.png||||Localisation of aerobic reactions in Mitochondria]]

The following flow sheet illustrates how The high energy hydrogen ions move through the High energy transport system, finally using ATPase to produce ATP from ADP

[[Image:mitochondria hydrogen transfer.png||||Hydrogen transport system pathway]]
 
The 'spent' (now low-energy) hydrogen ions combine with oxygen to produce water.

===Anerobic Respiration===
In the absence of oxygen, such as can occur in heavily exercising muscle, pyruvate does not enter the mitochondria, but the pyruvate is converted to lactic acid.


Pyruvate ---&gt; Lactic Acid

The net gain of ATP by this process is 2 molecules - as opposed to 38 in aerobic respiration. This is not enough to sustain cell activity in most cells. In the absence of oxygen, cell death will rapidly occur. As few as 4 minutes of anoxia will cause irreversible damage to the brain cells.

===Lipolysis===
Fats are broken down by a complex process to produce energy. The following flow chart shows the pathways involved.

[[Image:Lypolosis.png||||Lypolysis pathway in mitochondria]]
 
Fats are first broken down into glycerol and fatty acids. The glycerol molecule enters directly into the glycolysis pathway, and the fatty acid is taken into the mitochondria. There, by a complex process called beta-oxidation, it is broken down into two carbon atom units and is then converted to Acetyl coA

===Protein Catabolism===
Proteins are broken down by hydrolysis of the terminal amino acid. This amino acid is then deaminated, and the resulting organic acid either enters the glycolysis pathway or the Citric Acid Cycle

[[Image:Protein catabolism.png||||protein catabolism]]

==Glycogen &amp; Gluconeogenesis==
Glycogen is a polysaccharide of glucose and is used to produce glucose. Although it is stored in all cells, most of it is stored in the liver and muscle cells. It is broken down to produce about 10% Glucose and 90% Glucose-6-phosphate. It is important to note that because only liver cells have an enzyme for converting G-6-P into glucose, only the liver glycogen can supply glucose to the circulating glucose pool. 

===Structure===

[[Image:Glycogen chain.png||||glycogen polymer]]

Glycogen is a branching chain of glucose molecules. 

===Glycogen Catabolism===
A flow chart of glycogen catabolism is shown here: 

[[Image:Glycogen catabolism.png||||glycogen catabolism]]

The reverse reaction, the synthesis of glycogen from glucose, is quite complex, and the details need not bother us. However it is useful to consider the reaction from glucose to glycogen as reversible: &lt;math&gt; Glucose \rightleftharpoons Glycogen &lt;/math&gt;

===Gluconeogenesis===
Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from precursors, and follows the opposite pathways to glycolysis. Note that the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate can only take place in the kidney and liver, so in practice gluconeogenesis is confined to the liver. A flow sheet is shown: 

[[Image:Gluconeogenesis.png||||Gluconeogenesis]]

Although theoretically glucose can be made from fatty acids via Acetyl CoA, because cells can metabolise fatty acids directly as a source of ATP, it is doubtful if much or any glucose is made this way.

      <comment>/* Sugars */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A knowledge of the basics of biochemistry is important for the understanding of physiology. This section acts as an introduction to biochemistry, and is really the minimum that you need to understand.
 
The four main biochemical groups are '''Sugars, Fats, Amino Acids''', and '''Nucleotides'''. We will look briefly at each of these in turn and see how they play their roll in energy storage, energy production, protein synthesis, &amp; cell reproduction. We will also look at how energy is utilized by the cell.

==Sugars==
The most important source of energy for cells is the mono-saccharide sugar glucose which has the general formula '''C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''. This is broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce energy, carbon dioxide and water: 

   '''C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ---&gt;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 + 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Energy (36-38 mols of ATP from ADP).'''

Glucose is taken into the body as various sugars and complex carbohydrates (starches). The enzymes in the digestive process and various cells produces Glucose. In the body glucose can be built up into a starch Glycogen which can be stored in the liver and in muscle. This is the body's reserve supply of glucose. Energy can be also obtained from Proteins and Fats, but Glucose is particularly important, because it is the only source of energy for the brain cells. and if the brain is without glucose for a period of 6-8 minutes, brain death will occur. Here is the structure of Glucose. It is usually represented as the first image, or simply a hexagonal ring. 

[[Glucose2.png]]

Glucose is broken up in a two step process. First it is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate by a process called glycolosis. This occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. Then if oxygen is present, the pyruvate is taken into the mitochondria, and is broken down into Acetyl CoA which enters the citric acid cycle, producing high energy hydrogen bonds. The mitochondria will process these bonds into high energy ATP (Adenosine tri-phosphate) from ADP (Adenosine di-phosphate). This ATP is used to power the reactions of the cell. Some 36-38 molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule so processed.This process is shown graphically in the following flow sheet.

[[File:ATP Production Pathways.jpg]]

In the absence of oxygen (such as may occur in severe exercise), the pyruvate will be processed into lactic acid (anaerobic tissue respiration), and only two molecules of ATP will be produced. In mammals this is insufficient for the body's needs, and in the absence of oxygen cell death will occur in most tissues. 

See Sugars for more details.

==Fats==
Fats or lipids are the main way that the body stores excess nutrients. One Gram of fat will produce about 9 Kilocals, as opposed to 4 Kilocals for carbohydrate or protein. 

Fats consist of 1-3 fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. 

[[File:Fats1.png]]

Fatty acids consist of the general formular R-COOH, where R is a carbohydrate chain. 

[[File:Fatty acids.png]]




Fatty Acids can be metabolized in almost all cells of the body, the notable exception are brain cells, to produce ATP from ADP. They are broken down by a process called beta-oxidation to produce two carbon units which are then fed into the Citric Acid Cycle via Acetyl CoA.

Other important lipid related compounds are Cholesterol, important in its own right and essential as a precursor for Steroids, and phospholipids which form the walls of all cell membranes.

See Fats for more details.

==Amino Acids &amp; Proteins==
Proteins are made from several amino acids strung together as a chain. They are important for the structuaral elements of the body, either as intracellular components, or as the substrate of body tissues. Most enzymes and hormones are also proteins. Their versatility is due to the many shapes that they can take up.

===Overview===
Proteins are made from several amino acids strung together as a chain. They are important for the structural elements of the body, either as intracellular components, or as the substrate of body tissues. Most enzymes and hormones are also proteins. Their versatility is due to the many shapes that they can take up.

===Amino Acid===
A typical amino acid consists of a carbon atom attached to a carboxyl group -COOH and an amino -NH2 group. Below is shown the general model, and the isoleucine amino acid as an example.

Amino acids are strung together to form peptides - less than 100 amino acids - and proteins - more than 100 amino acids. Peptides are assembled on RNA templates. 

==Protein Synthesis==
An RNA template is made from the DNA, and after processing this leaves the nucleus and is attached to a ribosome. The following illustrates this process 


 -IMAGE


After becoming attached to the ribosome, Transfer RNA molecules will attach to individual amino acids and transfer them on to the RNA template: 

 -IMAGE

The attachment is formed by the removal of a molecule of water between the carboxyl and the amino group:

As well as being important for structural elements, amino acids are an important source for the manufacture of Glucose in the starvation state. 

==Protein Metabolism==
If Glycogen supplies are exhausted, glucose can be made from amino acids by a process called gluconeogenesis. The amino acid is de-aminated, and the resulting organic acid will be utilized either in the Glycolosis pathway or the Citric Acid Cycle to make Glucose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Summary of Energy Pathways==
The following flow sheet is a summary of the energy producing pathways.

   [[File:Energy Production Pathways.jpg]]

Most ATP is produced in the mitochondria via the Citric Acid Cycle, which can utilise both Pyruvate from Glycolosis and Acetyl CoA from fatty acid metabolism. Note that amino acids must be deaminated before entering into the energy production chain. 



In a fasting state liver glycogen is the main source of glucose, as only the liver (and the kidney) has the enzymes to convert glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. If the supply of liver glycogen becomes exausted as can occur with prolonged exercise or starvation (the liver has about 6 hours supply of Glycogen) then fatty acids become the main source of energy for cells, however glucose levels must be maintained for brain function, and amino acid catabolism will be come the main source of glucose.

Cells, particularly muscle cells can store their own supply of glycogen, and they can utilise this, but because of a lack of glucose-6-phosphatase they cannot produce glucose for the main pool.

==Summary of Protein Catabolism==
Protein is an important source of glucose in the fasting state. Excess protein is also converted to Fat - via. the glucose pool - for storage. Individual acids are cleaved off the peptide chain, and then the amino acid is deaminated producing a fatty acid which enters either the glycolysis path way or the CAC. 

   [[File:Cell Protein Catabolism.jpg]]

==Metabolism Summary ==
The following diagram is fairly self explanatory, and summarizes how the body nutrition metabolism all fits together.

Hi Edgar/Bebe,
I enjoyed reading about you and your educational philosophy. I too would like to be a teacher that makes a difference in my students' lives, and I greatly support your ideas of bilingual education. Even as young as they are, elementary students can pick on the fact that now in the 21st century, it is not always enough to be proficient in just one language. In the classroom, children cannot and will not learn subject material if they cannot understand the language it is being instructed in. I think this is why students from minority-language backgrounds have higher dropout rates, and lower test scores. If children are taught a second language such as Spanish when they begin school, they will have the ability to learn a great deal more of a language than if they only took a few years of it in high school. For example, they could learn nouns and verbs in elementary school, and sentence structure in middle and high school. I also think students can learn a second language more proficently when they are young. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 01:24, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Prostate Anatomy and Target Definition'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Contouring Landmarks==
*'''Michigan; 2009''' PMID 19515511 -- &quot;Radiographic and Anatomic Basis for Prostate Contouring Errors and Methods to Improve Prostate Contouring Accuracy.&quot; (McLaughlin PW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jun 8. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 300 patients. Comparison of CT and MRI contours using deformable registration
**Conclusion: Many prostate CT contouring errors can be improved without MRI fusion


==Prostate Apex Location==
*'''UT San Antonio; 2008''' PMID 18164852 -- &quot;Anatomic-based three-dimensional planning precludes use of catheter-delivered contrast for treatment of prostate cancer.&quot; (Boersma M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 May 1;71(1):51-7. Epub 2007 Dec 31.)
**15 patients simulated +/- bladder, urethral and rectal contrast. Prostatic base and apex identified
**Outcome: On lateral view, urethra exits prostate ~17 mm below posterior-most fusion of pubic symphysis
**Conclusion: Prostatic apex can easily and consistently be identified


==Seminal Vesicles==
*'''Michigan; 2009''' PMID 19147014 -- &quot;Evaluating the relationships between rectal normal tissue complication probability and the portion of seminal vesicles included in the clinical target volume in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.&quot; (Gluck I, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Feb 1;73(2):334-40.)
**Treatment planning. 10 patients, 3 matched IMRT plans: SV 1cm, SV 2 cm, and entire SV. Prescribed 79.2 Gy
**Outcome: Mean rectal NTCP 14% vs. 17% vs 18%; correlated with size of PTV-rectum overlap (r=0.86, SS) but not SV volume. Magnitude of difference modest in high-dose range
**Conclusion: SV treatment (2cm or comprehensive) is feasible without exceeding RTOG dose-volume limits

*'''Beaumont; 2002''' (1987-2000) PMID 12377319 -- &quot;Treatment of prostate cancer with radiotherapy: should the entire seminal vesicles be included in the clinical target volume?&quot; (Kestin L, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Nov 1;54(3):686-97.)
**Retrospective. 344 RP specimens reviewed for SV involvement. Low risk 31%. Median SV length 3.5 cm (0.7 - 8.5 cm). 
**Outcome: SV involvement in 15% patients (51 patients, 81 SV+). If low risk, only 1% SV+; if intermediate/high risk, 27% SV+. If only one high-risk feature (PSA &gt;10, GS &gt;=7, or cT2b), 15% SV+
**SV anatomy: median length of SV involvement 1.0 cm (0.2-3.8 cm). SV+ &lt;1cm in 59%, &lt;2cm 94%. No factor predictive of involved length
**Conclusion: Proximal 2.0-2.5 cm of SV should be included in CTV if PSA &gt;10, GS &gt;=7, or cT &gt;=T2b


==Neurovascular Bundle==
*'''Columbia; 2004''' PMID 15145159 -- &quot;Localization of neurovascular bundles on pelvic CT and evaluation of radiation dose to structures putatively involved in erectile dysfunction after prostate brachytherapy.&quot; (Wright JL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Jun 1;59(2):426-35.)
**Right/left NVB identified on 9 prostate MRIs. Method for localizing NVBs on CT developed


==Pelvic Lymph Nodes==
*'''RTOG; 2009'''
**[http://www.rtog.org/atlases/PelvicLymphNodeProstateAtlas/main.html RTOG Pelvic LNs Guideline]
**PMID 18947938 (2009) - RTOG consensus guidelines
**PMID 18947941 (2009) - Variation in definition of CTVs among RTOG GU experts


==Post-RP Volumes==
*'''RTOG; 2009'''
**[http://www.rtog.org/atlases/Post-OpProstateContoursAtlas/Post-Op%20Positive%20Apex%20Margins.ppt RTOG Positive Apex Guideline (.ppt)]
**[http://www.rtog.org/atlases/Post-OpProstateContoursAtlas/Post-Op%20Positive%20Seminal%20Vesicle.ppt RTOG Positive SV Guideline (.ppt)]
**PMID 19394158 (2009) - &quot;Development of RTOG Consensus Guidelines for the Definition of the Clinical Target Volume for Postoperative Conformal Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer&quot; (Michalski JM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):361-8.)

*'''Princess Margaret; 2007''' PMID 17967303 -- &quot;Anatomic boundaries of the clinical target volume (prostate bed) after radical prostatectomy.&quot; (Wiltshire KL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 15;69(4):1090-9.)
**Anatomic boundaries described for CTV (prostate bed)

*'''EORTC; 2007''' PMID 17706307 -- &quot;Guidelines for target volume definition in post-operative radiotherapy for prostate cancer, on behalf of the EORTC Radiation Oncology Group.&quot; (Poortmans P, Radiother Oncol. 2007 Aug;84(2):121-7. Epub 2007 Aug 13.)
**Recommendations for target volumes


==Prostadoodle==
*[http://www.prostadoodle.com/ Prostadoodle link] 
*CT and MR atlas for radiographic landmarks for prostate contouring (Microsoft Powerpoint format).


==Contouring Intervention==
*'''Princess Margaret''' (2007) -- interactive prostate MRI/CT vs general anatomy CT contouring
**Randomized. 31 trainees. Pretest contouring of prostate and rectum. Then randomized Arm 1) interactive session on prostate volumes using fused CT/MRI vs Arm 2) interactive session on general contouring using CT. Then retested
**'''2010''' PMID 19467804 -- &quot;Effectiveness of educational intervention on the congruence of prostate and rectal contouring as compared with a gold standard in three-dimensional radiotherapy for prostate.&quot; (Szumacher E, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):379-85. Epub 2009 May 19.)
***Outcome: No difference in score gains between groups. No difference in prostate contour, but improved rectal contour
***Conclusion: Similar improvement in technical preformance; participants in both groups satisfied

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a large number of [[w:software tools|software tools]] or software applications that have been specifically developed for the field sometimes referred to as [[w:molecular microscopy|molecular microscopy]] or [[w:cryo-electron microscopy|cryo-electron microscopy]] or cryoEM.  Several special issues of the [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/yjsbi Journal of Structural Biology] (see references below) have been specifically devoted to descriptions of these applications and several web sites provide partial lists of the software packages and where to obtain them.  This article attempts to provide a complete list and up-to-date distribution information of all of the software of interest to the cryoEM community.  Everyone in the community is encouraged to add content, correct errors, and make any other contributions that might be useful. 

  
The software tools described here have been loosely and somewhat arbitrarily organized into several categories as follows:

* '''[[Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy/General packages|General packages]]:'''  Packages that offer a comprehensive set of tools to permit the analysis of data in several classes of structural problems. 

* '''[[Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy/Specific packages|Specific packages]]:'''  Packages that offer a comprehensive set of tools to permit the analysis of data in a single class of structural problem.  For example packages specifically focused on objects with helical, icosahedral, crystalline symmetry, etc.
 
* '''[[Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy/Application tools|Application tools]]:'''  Packages that offer a tool or a set of tools to permit the analysis of data in one or more class of structural problems.  These have generally been developed to manage one specific step in the structural analysis, for example CTF correction, particle picking etc.  

* '''[[Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy/Visualization and modeling tools|Visualization and docking/modeling tools]]:'''  Packages that facilitate the interpretation, analysis or presentation of the results.

* '''[[Software Tools For Molecular Microscopy/Utilities|Utilities]]:''' General utilities like file format conversion, difference mapping, etc.

== Fancy shmancy words ==

One thing that struck me while writing the Intermediate Grammar section is that this section introduces the distinction between morphology and syntax, but I don't think it should; after all the Beginner Sounds article doesn't mention the word &quot;phonology&quot;. I propose that we remove the definition paragraph and attempt to re-target the sections as something like &quot;Word Properties&quot; and &quot;Arranging Words&quot; respectively. Anyone got any thoughts? [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 10:10, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

:Hm.  Well, there is another side to the question.  When I was going through these Beginner sections, and one of the things I was particularly doing was pruning technical terms, I pondered for some time over the word &quot;morphology&quot;.  (The word &quot;syntax&quot; didn't bother me; I think its technical meaning is pretty much in line with general usage.)  Eventually I put together a case in favor of keeping &quot;morphology/syntax&quot; here, but didn't write it down at the time.  As I recall, it went something like this:

:The word &quot;morphology&quot; comes in handy several times in this section; there does come a point of diminishing returns, at which eliminating the last few specialized words creates ambiguity and/or awkward verbosity and makes things ''harder'' for laymen to understand.  It's a relatively painless term in itself; and it's one of the major taxon names of the subject (as opposed to narrow terms like &quot;evidentiality&quot; and &quot;case&quot;), making it potentially very helpful for a beginner to already know when approaching more advanced materials &amp;mdash; as when trying to follow the gist of a more advanced discussion, or when tackling the spate of narrower technical terms in the Intermediate section.

:Having left &quot;morphology&quot; in place here, I also let stand the even gentler preview of the term that occurs in Beginner/Words, where it occurs exactly once, as the title of the first of two subsections (the second being &quot;Vocabulary&quot;).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:11, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

::I see your point and having thought some more, I think I agree.

::However, I would like to note that when I asked five laymen friends to explain to me what they thought the word &quot;syntax&quot; meant, they were unable to do so. The best response I got was &quot;it's something to do with grammar&quot; but he was unable to elaborate further. Perhaps it would be prudent for us to get a person who is not familiar with the subject to read through it and determine whether the terms are acceptable? [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 21:21, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

::: A few thinking points.  (These aren't meant to complicate the actual act of asking someone to look over the material and tell-me-what-you-think.)
:::* It's not clear to me that the common usage status of &quot;syntax&quot; is necessarily a tipping point on this.  We define both &quot;morphology&quot; and &quot;syntax&quot; here, and in effect by doing so we are also approximately defining &quot;grammar&quot;; so we're not actually relying much on the reader's prior knowledge of them.  Big taxon names, all, and they're a matched set, too.
:::* That leads into the potentially deep question of what level of knowledge we expect from the readers of this section.  We ''do'' assume that the reader won't be uncomfortable with in-context use, without explicit definition, of terms like &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;object&quot;, and &quot;auxiliary verb&quot;.  I'm not actually proposing to open that can of worms, but it's something to keep in mind when choosing a lay test audience for the material, and certainly when interpreting the results of the test.
:::* In having the material vetted by a layman, one really needs to think through carefully what kind of feedback to ask for.  It would, for example, be pretty biasing to ask them to see if they thought the terminology was too technical.
:::* High-quality victims, er, test subjects may not be easy to acquire in large numbers, and a given subject is really unfamiliar with the material only once.  So one ought to be fairly selective about the version of the material that one spends such an opportunity on.
::: I can't say I'm really surprised to hear the reactions you got on the word &quot;syntax&quot;; it's not the first time I've found that parts of my idiolect are products of my atypical background.
::: BTW, the title you chose for this talk thread appears to be an instance of reduplication.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 04:10, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

:::: I too do not think that &quot;syntax&quot; (or any other single word) is necessarily problematic. I was mostly just using it as an example to point out how we (with our particular biases) may not be the best people to evaluate it's usefulness to our target audience. You've already convinced me that, as things stand, there's no pressing need to simplify the vocabulary beyond it's current state.
:::: I must admit that I'm in no position to actually do any testing. It's hard enough to get people IRL to be interested in my own conlanging, nevermind to go through the effort of critiquing a meta-article... :) [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] ([[User talk:Ingolemo|talk]]) 14:16, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

::::: The word &quot;syntax&quot; is a somewhat exceptional example, actually.  My formal training is in computer science, rather than linguistics &amp;mdash; but for trained computer scientists, &quot;syntax&quot; is what a parser analyzes.  Modulo automated parsing, I should (ideally) be able to identify with non-linguists trying to break in to conlanging.

::::: But I too would be hard put to actually do any testing.  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:39, 28 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

Given &lt;math&gt;f \in C[a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;p_n^* \!\,&lt;/math&gt; denote the best uniform approximation to &lt;math&gt; f\!\,&lt;/math&gt; among polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;\leq n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.


:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)-p_n(x)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


is minimized by the choice &lt;math&gt;p_n=p_n^* \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;e(x)=f(x)-p_n^*(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that there are at least two points &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2 \in [a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that


:&lt;math&gt;|e(x_1)|=|e(x_2)|=\max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-p_n^*(x)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


and &lt;math&gt;e(x_1)=-e(x_2) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Solution 1==
Since both &lt;math&gt;f(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_n^*(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are continuous, so is the function


:&lt;math&gt;e(x)=f(x)-p_n^*(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


and therefore &lt;math&gt;e(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; attains both a maximum and a minimum on &lt;math&gt;[a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;M=\max_{x \in [a,b]}e(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m=\min_{x \in [a,b]}e(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


If &lt;math&gt;M \neq -m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a polynomial &lt;math&gt;q(x)=p_n^*(x)+\frac{M+m}{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (a vertical shift of the supposed best approximation &lt;math&gt;p_n^*(x)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; which is a better approximation to &lt;math&gt;f(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
f(x)-q(x) &amp;= f(x)-p_n^*(x)-\frac{M+m}{2} \\
          &amp;\leq M-\frac{M+m}{2} \\
          &amp;= \frac{M-m}{2}\\
\\
\\
f(x)-q(x) &amp;\geq m - \frac{M+m}{2}\\
          &amp;=\frac{m-M}{2}
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)-q(x)\| \leq \frac{M-m}{2} \leq \|f-p_n^*\| = M \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;m=-M \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

is exact for linear functions.  (No knowledge of orthogonal polynomials is required.)

==Solution 2a==
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^{\frac12}}=w_1 \cdot 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies after computation


&lt;math&gt;w_1=2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then 


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1\frac{x}{x^{\frac12}}=w_1\cdot x_1 = 2 x_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Solution 2b==

Suppose there is a one-point rule for approximating &lt;math&gt; I\!\,&lt;/math&gt; that is exact for quadratics.


Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then, 


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \frac{x^2}{x^{\frac12}}= \frac25 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


but


&lt;math&gt;w_1x_1^2=2(\frac13)^2=\frac29 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,

|}

==Solution 2c==
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f''(x)=2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Using the values computed in part (b), we have


&lt;math&gt;\frac25-\frac29=c \cdot 2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c=\frac{4}{45} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt; f\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g \!\,&lt;/math&gt; agree at &lt;math&gt;x=a \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x=b \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x=(a+b)/2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show


&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^b g(x) dx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Solution 2d==

There exist &lt;math&gt;w_1,w_2,w_3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that  if &lt;math&gt; f(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;\leq 3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)dx= w_1f(a)+w_2f(b)+w_3f(\frac{a+b}{2}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x)dx &amp;= w_1f(a)+w_2f(b)+w_3f(\frac{a+b}{2}) \\
                &amp;= w_1g(a)+w_2g(b)+w_3g(\frac{a+b}{2}) \\

Discuss how to choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; optimally in case &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric and determine the rate of convergence.

|}

==Solution 3a==

===Convergence of any starting vector===
Using the iteration &lt;math&gt; \,\!  x_{k+1}=x_k + \alpha(b-Ax_k)&lt;/math&gt;, we have that


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e_{k+1}	&amp;= x_{k+1}-x^* \\
		&amp;= x_k - x^* + \alpha(b-Ax_k)\\
		&amp;= x_k - x^* + \alpha(Ax^*-Ax_k)\\
		&amp;= e_k - \alpha A e_k \\
		&amp;= (I-\alpha A)e_k
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, computing norms we obtain

&lt;math&gt; \,\!  \| e_{k+1}\| \leq \|I-\alpha A \| \| e_k\|  &lt;/math&gt;.


In particular, considering &lt;math&gt; \,\!  \| \cdot \|_2   &lt;/math&gt;, we have that

&lt;math&gt; \,\!  \| e_{k+1}\|_2 \leq \|I-\alpha A \|_2 \| e_k\|_2  &lt;/math&gt;.



Now, in order to study the convergence of the method, we need to analyze 
&lt;math&gt; \,\!  \|I-\alpha A \|_2  &lt;/math&gt;. We use the following characterization:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|I-\alpha A \|_2^2  &amp;= \rho\left(  (I-\alpha A) (I-\alpha A)^* \right) \\
                     &amp;=  \rho\left(  I-\alpha A^*-\alpha A+ |\alpha|^2 AA^*\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Let's denote by &lt;math&gt; \,\!  \lambda &lt;/math&gt; an eigenvalue of the matrix &lt;math&gt; \,\!  A &lt;/math&gt;. Then  &lt;math&gt; \rho\left(  (I-\alpha A) (I-\alpha A)^* \right) &lt; 1\,\!  &lt;/math&gt;
implies


&lt;math&gt; 1-2\alpha Re(\lambda)+ \alpha^2 |\lambda|^2 &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


i.e.


&lt;math&gt; -2\alpha Re(\lambda)+ \alpha^2 |\lambda|^2 &lt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The above equation is quadratic with respect to &lt;math&gt; \alpha\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and opens upward. Hence using the quadratic formula we can find the roots of the equation to be


&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1=0 \quad \alpha_2= 2\frac{Re(\lambda)}{|\lambda|^2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then, if &lt;math&gt; \,\!  Re(\lambda)&gt; 0  &lt;/math&gt; for all the eigenvalues of the matrix &lt;math&gt; \,\!  A &lt;/math&gt;, we can find &lt;math&gt; \,\!  \alpha \in (0,2\frac{Re(\lambda)}{|\lambda|^2})  &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \,\!\rho\left(  (I-\alpha A) (I-\alpha A)^* \right) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the method converges.

===Choosing alpha if A symmetric===

On the other hand, if the matrix &lt;math&gt; \,\!  A &lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, we have that &lt;math&gt; \,\! \|I-\alpha A \|_2  = \rho\left(  I-\alpha A \right) &lt;/math&gt;. Then using the Schur decomposition, we can find a unitary matrix &lt;math&gt; \,\!  U &lt;/math&gt; and a diagonal matrix &lt;math&gt; \,\!  \Lambda &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \,\!  A=U^*\Lambda U &lt;/math&gt;, and in consequence,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

\|I-\alpha A \|_2&amp;=\|I-\alpha \Lambda \|_2  \\
                 &amp;= \rho(I-\alpha \Lambda) \\
                 &amp;= \max_{i=1,\dots,n}(1-\alpha \lambda_i) \\

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


This last expression is minimized if &lt;math&gt; \,\!  (1-\alpha \lambda_1)=-(1-\alpha \lambda_n) &lt;/math&gt;, i.e, if &lt;math&gt; \,\! \alpha_{opt}=2/(\lambda_1+\lambda_n) &lt;/math&gt;. With this optimal value of &lt;math&gt; \,\! \alpha &lt;/math&gt;, we obtain that



&lt;math&gt; \,\!  (I-\alpha_{opt} \Lambda)_{i,i}= 1-\frac{2}{\lambda_1+\lambda_n}\lambda_i, &lt;/math&gt;


which implies that 



&lt;math&gt; \,\!  \| I-\alpha_{opt} \Lambda \|_2= \frac{\lambda_n-\lambda_1}{\lambda_1+\lambda_n} &lt;/math&gt;.


Finally, we've obtained that

==Solution 3b==
If &lt;math&gt;Re(\lambda_i) &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then convergence occurs if 


&lt;math&gt;\alpha \in (0, 2\frac{Re(\lambda)}{|\lambda|^2}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;Re(\lambda_i) &lt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then convergence occurs if

Hence &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


If some eigenvalues are positive and some negative, there does not exist a real &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for which the iterations converge since &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; cannot be both positive and negative simultaneously.

By Gerschgorin's theorem, the magnitude of all the eigenvalues are between 1 and 5 i.e.


&lt;math&gt;1 &lt; |\lambda| &lt; 5 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt;\rho(I-\alpha A) = \max_i (|1-\alpha \lambda_i|) \leq |1 - \alpha 5 | \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We want 


&lt;math&gt;\rho(I-\alpha A) &lt; |1 -\alpha 5| &lt; 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac25 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

To compute &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we consider the following Eudoxos iterations: starting with &lt;math&gt;x_0=y_0=1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we set &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}=x_n+y_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; followed by &lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}=x_{n+1}+x_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;y_n / x_n \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Explain the Eudoxos method in terms of the power method.

|}

== Solution 1a ==

The iteration can be represented in matrix formulation as follows:


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
x_{n+1} &amp;= x_n +y_n \\
y_{n+1} &amp;= x_{n+1}+x_n = 2x_n + y_n
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which can be written as 


&lt;math&gt; 
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 \\
2 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
}_A
\begin{bmatrix}
x_n \\
y_n 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{n+1} \\
y_{n+1}
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Thus the iteration is just the power method since each step is represented by a multiplication by the matrix &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


The power method converges to the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue.


The eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are computed to be &lt;math&gt;1 \pm \sqrt{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the largest eigenvalue is &lt;math&gt;1 + \sqrt{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The corresponding eigenvector is then 


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{2} \\
2
\end{bmatrix}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then &lt;math&gt;y_n / x_n \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as desired.

Since convergence is linear, 7 steps is required to achieve the error bound.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{ p_n(x) \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of monic polynomials orthogonal on &lt;math&gt;[a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the positive weight function &lt;math&gt;w(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; ( &lt;math&gt;p_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; has degree &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;). Show that &lt;math&gt; p_n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; satisfy a three term recursion formula of the form


&lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=(x-a_n)p_{n-1}(x)-b_n p_{n-2}(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Give expressions for the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 2a==

First notice that &lt;math&gt;p_n - x p_{n-1} \in \Pi^{n-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and therefore we can express it as a linear combination of the monic polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;n-1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; or less i.e.


&lt;math&gt;p_n - x p_{n-1}= -a_n p_{n-1}-b_n p_{n-2} + \sum_{i=0}^{n-3} \alpha_i p_i \qquad (*)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Taking the inner product of both side of &lt;math&gt;(*) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p_{n-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields from the orthogonality of the polynomials:


&lt;math&gt;-\langle x p_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle = -a_n \langle p_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Rearranging terms then yields


&lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{\langle xp_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle}{ \langle p_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Similarly, taking the inner product of both side of &lt;math&gt;(*) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p_{n-2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields from the orthogonality of the polynomials:


&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{\langle xp_{n-1}, p_{n-2} \rangle}{ \langle p_{n-2}, p_{n-2} \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Notice that 


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\langle xp_{n-1}, p_{n-2} \rangle &amp;= \langle p_{n-1}, x p_{n-2} \rangle \\
                                  &amp;= \langle p_{n-1}, p_{n-1}+ \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} \alpha_i p_i \rangle \\
                                  &amp;= \langle p_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt;b_n = \frac{\langle p_{n-1}, p_{n-1} \rangle}{ \langle p_{n-2}, p_{n-2} \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Finally, taking inner product of both side of &lt;math&gt;(*) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; p_k, k=0,\ldots,n-3\!\,&lt;/math&gt;  yields,


&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k = - \frac{ \langle xp_{n-1}, p_k \rangle }{ \langle p_k, p_k \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Notice that 


&lt;math&gt; \langle xp_{n-1},p_k \rangle = \langle p_{n-1},\underbrace{x p_k}_{\in \Pi^{n-2}} \rangle = 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=0,1\ldots, n-3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using Gram Schmidt with inner product defined as

Let &lt;math&gt;a=x_0&lt; x_1&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n=b\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary fixed partition of the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  A function &lt;math&gt;q(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic spline function if

(ii) On each subinterval &lt;math&gt;[x_i,x_{i+1}]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic polynomial


The problem is to construct a quadratic spline &lt;math&gt;q(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; interpolating data points &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0), (x_1,y_1),\ldots, (x_n,y_n)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. The construction is similar to the construction of the cubic spline but much easier.

Show that if we know &lt;math&gt;z_i \equiv q'(x_i), i=0,\ldots,n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct &lt;math&gt;q\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Solution 1a==
Consider interval &lt;math&gt;[x_i,x_{i+1}]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;q'_i(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is linear on this interval, using the point slope form we have


:&lt;math&gt;q_i'(x)=\frac{z_{i+1}-z_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}(x-x_i)+z_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Integrating, we have


:&lt;math&gt;q_i(x)=z_ix+\frac{z_{i+1}-z_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\frac{(x-x_i)^2}{2}+K_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or, in a more convenient form,


:&lt;math&gt;q_i(x)=z_i(x-x_i)+\frac{z_{i+1}-z_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\frac{(x-x_i)^2}{2}+y_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 1==
Since &lt;math&gt;q\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;q_{i-1}(x_i)=q_i(x_i)=y_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_{i-1}(x_i-x_{i-1})+\frac{z_i-z_{i-1}}{x_i-x_{i-1}}\frac{(x_i-x_{i-1})^2}{2}+y_{i-1}=y_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Simplifying and rearranging terms yields the reoccurrence formula

The shifted iteration appears to work better because its diagonal entries are closer to the actual eigenvalues than the diagonal entries of the unshifted iteration.

Since &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric


:&lt;math&gt;(Ax,y)=(x,A^Ty)=(x,Ay) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


This relationship will used throughout the solutions.


===Substitute into Functional===

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F(x_v+\alpha d_v) &amp;= \frac12\langle x_v+\alpha d_v, Ax_v+\alpha A d_v \rangle - \langle b, x_v + \alpha d_v \rangle  \\
                  &amp;= \frac{\langle d_v,Ad_v \rangle}{2}\alpha^2+\alpha \langle d_v,Ax_v \rangle - \alpha \langle b, d_v \rangle + \frac12 \langle x_v, A x_v \rangle - \langle b, x_v \rangle
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Take Derivative With Respect to Alpha===

&lt;math&gt;F'(x_v+\alpha d_v)=\langle d_v, Ad_v \rangle \alpha + \langle d_v, Ax_v \rangle - \langle b, d_v \rangle \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Set Derivative Equal To Zero===


&lt;math&gt;0=\langle d_v, Ad_v \rangle \alpha + \langle d_v, Ax_v -b \rangle \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{\langle d_v, r_v \rangle}{\langle d_v, A d_v \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\{d_j\}_{j=1}^N \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;-orthogonal basis of &lt;math&gt;R^N \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle d_j, Ad_k \rangle=0, j\neq k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the expansion of the solution &lt;math&gt;x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in this basis:


:&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{j=1}^N \hat{x_j}d_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Use that &lt;math&gt;A-\!\,&lt;/math&gt;orthogonality of the &lt;math&gt;d_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt; to compute the &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the solution &lt;math&gt;x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt; d_j\!\,&lt;/math&gt;'s

                        &amp;= \hat{x}_k \langle d_k, Ad_k \rangle
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_k = \frac{\langle x, Ad_k \rangle}{ \langle d_k, A d_k \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_v = \sum_{j=1}^{v-1}\hat{x}_j d_j, \quad v=2,3,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


so that &lt;math&gt;x_{v+1}=x_v+\hat{x}_v d_v \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_v \!\,&lt;/math&gt;'s are the coefficients found in (b). Use the fact that &lt;math&gt;x_v \in \mbox{span}\{d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_{v-1}\} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt;-orthogonality of the &lt;math&gt;d_j \!\,&lt;/math&gt;'s to conclude that the coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_v \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by the optimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha_v \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_v=\frac{\langle r_v, d_v \rangle}{\langle d_v, Ad_v \rangle}=\alpha_v \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;A,B \in R^{n \times n} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be symmetric and positive definite matrices, and let &lt;math&gt;b \in R^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the quadratic function &lt;math&gt; Q(x)=\frac12 x^T Ax - x^Tb \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in R^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and a descent method to approximate the solution of &lt;math&gt;Ax=b \!\,&lt;/math&gt;:

Define the concept of steepest descent &lt;math&gt;d_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and show how to compute the optimal stepsize &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

===Descent Direction===

&lt;math&gt;\nabla Q(x_k) \cdot d_k &lt; 0  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Optimal step size ===


Choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Q(x_k+\alpha_k d_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is minimized i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k : \min_{\alpha_k} Q(x_k+\alpha_k d_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
Q(x_k+\alpha_kd_k) =  \langle x_k + \alpha_k d_k, Ax_k + \alpha_k A d_k \rangle - \langle x_k + \alpha_k d_k, b \rangle 
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d \alpha} Q(x_k+\alpha_k d_k)= \langle A d_k, x_k \rangle + \alpha_k \langle A d_k, d_k \rangle - \langle d_k , b \rangle \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Setting the above expression equal to zero gives the optimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;:


&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k = \frac{\langle d_k, b-Ax_k \rangle}{\langle A d_k, d_k \rangle} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Note that since &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric


&lt;math&gt;\langle d_k, A x_k \rangle = \langle A d_k, x_k \rangle \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Formulate the steepest descent (or gradient method) method and write a pseudocode which implements it.

|}

== Solution 3b==

Note that &lt;math&gt;d_k = -\nabla Q(x_k) = b - Ax_k = r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the minimal &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle }{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle_A} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Given &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in R^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
 For &lt;math&gt; k=0,1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     r_k &amp;= b- Ax_k \\
     &amp;\mbox{If } r_k =0, \mbox { then quit } \\
     d_k &amp;= r_k  \\
     \alpha_k &amp;= \frac{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle }{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle_A} \\
     x_{k+1}&amp;=x_k + \alpha_k d_k
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;

| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

Let &lt;math&gt;B^{-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be a preconditioner of &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show how to modify the steepest descent method to work for &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}Ax=B^{-1}b \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and write a pseudocode.  Note that &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; may not be symmetric. (Hint: proceed as with the conjugate gradient method).
|}

==Solution 3==

Since &lt;math&gt; B \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, positive definite, &lt;math&gt;B=E^TE \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;E \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is upper triangular (Cholesky Factorization).


Then &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}=E^{-1}E^{-T} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence,


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
B^{-1} Ax &amp; = B^{-1}b  \\
E^{-1}E^{-T} Ax &amp;= E^{-1}E^{-T} b \\
E^{-T} Ax &amp;=E^{-T}b \\
\underbrace{E^{-T}A E^{-1}}_{\tilde{A}} \underbrace{ Ex}_{\tilde{x}} &amp;= \underbrace{E^{-T}b}_{\tilde{b}}
\end{align}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric:


&lt;math&gt;(E^{-T}AE^{-1})^T=E^{-T}A E^{-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; symmetric


&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite:


&lt;math&gt;x^TE^{-T}AE^{-1}x= (E^{-1}x)^T A(E^{-1}x) &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; positive definite


===Pseudocode===

Given &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in R^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
 For &lt;math&gt; k=0,1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     \tilde{x_k} &amp;= E x_k \\
     r_k &amp;= \tilde{b}- \tilde{A} \tilde{x_k} \\
     &amp;\mbox{If } r_k =0, \mbox { then quit } \\
     d_k &amp;= r_k  \\
       \alpha_k &amp;= \frac{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle }{\langle r_k, r_k \rangle_{\tilde{A}}} \\
     x_{k+1}&amp;=x_k + \alpha_k d_k
  \end{align}

Suppose there is a quadrature formula 


&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)dx \approx w_af(a)+w_bf(b)+\sum_{j=1}^n w_j f(x_j) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;


which produces the exact integral whenever &lt;math&gt;f \!\, &lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;2n+1 \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.  Here the nodes &lt;math&gt;\{ x_j \}_{j=1}^n \!\, &lt;/math&gt; are all distinct.  Prove that the nodes lies in the open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; and the weights &lt;math&gt;w_a, w_b \!\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{w_j\}_{j=1}^n \!\, &lt;/math&gt; are positive.

|}

==Solution 2==

===All nodes lies in (a,b)===

Let &lt;math&gt; \{x_i\}_{i=1}^l \!\, &lt;/math&gt; be the nodes that lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;q_l(x)=\prod_{i=1}^l(x-x_i) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; which is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt; l\!\, &lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;p_n(x)=\prod_{i=1}^n(x-x_i)=q_l(x)\prod_{i=1}^{n-l}(x-x_i) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; which is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n &gt;l \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.


Then 


&lt;math&gt; \langle p_n, q_l \rangle = \int_a^b q_l^2(x) \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^{n-l}(x-x_i)}_{r(x)} \neq 0 \!\, &lt;/math&gt;


since &lt;math&gt;r(x) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; is of one sign in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; since for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots n -l \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_i  \not \in (a,b).\!\, &lt;/math&gt;


This implies &lt;math&gt;q_l \!\, &lt;/math&gt; is of degree &lt;math&gt;n \!\, &lt;/math&gt; since otherwise 


&lt;math&gt;\langle p_n, q_l \rangle  = 0\!\, &lt;/math&gt;


from the orthogonality of &lt;math&gt;p_n \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.
===All weights positive===

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f: R \rightarrow R \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is smooth and that the boundary value problem

For &lt;math&gt;N \in \mathbb{N} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;x_i=\frac{1}{N},i=0,\ldots,N \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Write down a system of &lt;math&gt;N+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; equations to obtain an approximation &lt;math&gt;u_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for the solution &lt;math&gt;u \!\,&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; by replacing the second derivatives by a symmetric difference quotient.

|}

== Solution 4a==

The symmetric difference quotient is given by


&lt;math&gt;\frac{u(x+h)-2u(x)+u(x-h)}{h^2}=u''(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence we have the following system equations that incorporates the initial conditions &lt;math&gt;u(0)=u(1)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Formulate Newton's method for the solution of the system in (b) with &lt;math&gt;U^{(0)}=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Give explicit expressions for all objects involved (as far as this is reasonable). Determine a sufficient condition that ensures that the iterates &lt;math&gt;U^{(k)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  in the Newton scheme are defined.  Without doing any further calculations, can you decide whether the sequence &lt;math&gt;U^{(k)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; converges. Why or why not?


|}
==Solution 4c ==



===Newton's Method===

&lt;math&gt;U^{k+1}=U^{k}-J(F(U^{(k)})^{-1}F(U^{(k)}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;J(A) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Jacobian of a matrix &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Specifically,


&lt;math&gt;J(F(U^{(k)})=J(AU-F)=A-J(F) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Sufficient Condition===

If &lt;math&gt;J(F(U^{(k)})^{-1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; exists, then &lt;math&gt;U^{(k)}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; iterates are defined.


===Convergence of sequnce===

We cannot decide if the sequence converges since Newton's method only guarantees local convergence.


In general, for local convergence of Newton's method we need:


* &lt;math&gt;F \!\,&lt;/math&gt; differentriable


* &lt;math&gt;D(F(U^*)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; invertible


* &lt;math&gt;D(F) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; Lipschitz


* &lt;math&gt;U^{(0)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; close to solution &lt;math&gt;U^* \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Describe a Galerkin method to solve this problem using piecewise linear functions with respect to a uniform mesh.

|}

===Weak Formulation===
Find &lt;math&gt;u \in U=\{u \in H^1 : u(0)=0 \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  such that for all &lt;math&gt; v \in U\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 -u''v=\int_0^1 fv \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which after integrating by parts and plugging in initial conditions we have


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 u'v'= \int_0^1 fv - \alpha u(1)v(1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the nodes of a uniform partition of &lt;math&gt; [0,1]\!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_0=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i=ih \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_i \}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the standard &quot;hat&quot; functions defined as follows:


For &lt;math&gt;i=1,2\ldots,N \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\phi_i =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h} &amp; \mbox{ for } x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i] \\
\frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h} &amp; \mbox{ for } x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}] \\
0                   &amp; \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{N+1}=
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_N}{h} &amp; \mbox{ for } x \in [x_N, x_{N+1}] \\
0               &amp; \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;


Also &lt;math&gt;\phi_0=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;u(0)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; forms a basis for the discrete space &lt;math&gt;U_h=\{ u \in H^1[0,1] : u(0)=0, u \mbox{ piecewise linear } \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Derive the matrix equations for this Galerkin method.  Write out explicitly that equation of the linear system which involves &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


|}

===Discrete Weak Formulation===

Find &lt;math&gt;u_h \in U_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;v \in U_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 u_h' v_h' = \int_0^1 f v_h - \alpha u(1) v(1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; forms a basis, we have


&lt;math&gt;u_h = \sum_{i=0}^{N+1}u_{hi}\phi_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Also for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,N+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{N+1}u_{hi} \int_0^1 \phi_i' \phi_j' = \int_0^1 f \phi_j + \alpha \sum_{i=0}^{N+1} u_{hi} \phi_i(1) \phi_j (1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


In matrix form

State the condition for consistency of a linear multistep method and verify it for the scheme in this problem.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y_{n+1} &amp;=\sum_{j=0}^p a_j y_{n-j}+h\sum_{j=-1}^p b_j f(t_{n-j},y_{n-j}) \\

Does the scheme satisfy the root condition and or the strong root condition?

|}


The scheme satisfies the root condition but not the strong root condition since the roots are given by


&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{\frac43 \pm \sqrt{\frac{16}{9}-\frac43} }{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 =1  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2=\frac13 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f''(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is bounded and &lt;math&gt; x_0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt; x_* \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then the secant method has convergence order &lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1+ \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.6180339887 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (the Golden ratio).

Define the concept of absolute stability. That is, consider applying the method to the case &lt;math&gt;f(t,y)=\lambda y \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with real &lt;math&gt;\lambda \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show that the region of absolute stability contains the entire negative real axis of the complex &lt;math&gt;h \lambda \!\,&lt;/math&gt; plane.

|}

== Solution 5b ==

Letting &lt;math&gt;f(t,y) = \lambda y \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have


&lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}=y_n+\frac{h}{2}\lambda y_{n+1}+\frac{h}{2} \lambda y_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


If we let &lt;math&gt;h \lambda =z  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and rearrange the equation we have


&lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}=  \underbrace{\left(  \frac{1+\frac{z}{2}}{1-\frac{z}{2}}\right)}_M y_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We require &lt;math&gt;M &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. This is true if &lt;math&gt;\lambda  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a negative real number.

Examine the properties of &lt;math&gt; A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; which guarantee that the method is absolutely stable (Hint: study the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;).

|}

==Solution 5==

We now want instead

&lt;math&gt;\left\| \frac{1+\frac{h}{2}A}{1-\frac{h}{2}A} \right\| &lt;1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


i.e.


&lt;math&gt; \|1+ \frac{h}{2}A \| &lt; \| 1- \frac{h}{2} A \| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or (since &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric)


&lt;math&gt;\rho(I+\frac{h}{2}Q \Lambda Q^T) &lt; \rho(I-\frac{h}{2} Q \Lambda Q^T) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or (since multiplying by orthogonal matrices does not affect the norm)


&lt;math&gt;\rho(I+\frac{h}{2}\Lambda ) &lt; \rho(I-\frac{h}{2}  \Lambda) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or (by definition)


&lt;math&gt;\max_i \{ 1+\frac{h}{2}\lambda_i\} &lt; \max_i \{ 1 - \frac{h}{2}\lambda_i \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


If &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is negative definite (all its eigenvalues are negative), the above inequality holds.

Show that the solution &lt;math&gt;u \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is unique.

== Solution 6a ==


===Variational Form ===
Derive the variational form by multiplying by test function &lt;math&gt;v \in H \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and integrating from 0 to 1. Use integration by parts and substitute initial conditions to then have:


Find &lt;math&gt;u \in H = \{ v \in H^1(0,1) \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;  such that for all &lt;math&gt; v \in H\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\int_0^1 u'v' + \int_0^1 uv}_{a(u,v)} = \underbrace{\int_0^1 v}_{F(v)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Relationship between (1) and (2) ===

(2) is an equivalent formulation of (1) but it does not involve second derivatives.


===Existence of Unique Solution ===

By the Lax-Milgram theorem, we have the existence of a unique solution.


* bilinear form continuous/bounded: &lt;math&gt; a(u,v) \leq C \|u\|_1 \|v\|_1  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


* bilinear form coercive: &lt;math&gt; a(u,u) \geq 1 \cdot \|u\|_1^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Consider two partitions &lt;math&gt;P_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; [0,1]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;P_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; a refinement of &lt;math&gt;P_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;V_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the corresponding piecewise linear finite element spaces.  Show that &lt;math&gt;V_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt; V_2\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

== Solution 6c ==

If &lt;math&gt;v \in V_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; then it is also in &lt;math&gt;V_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt; P_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a refinement of &lt;math&gt;P_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, since &lt;math&gt; V_1\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is piecewise linear over each intervals, it is also piecewise linear over a refinement of its interval.

&lt;math&gt;\|u-u_1\|_{H^1}^2= \|u-u_2\|_{H^1}^2 + \|u_1 - u_2 \|_{H^1}^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 6==

From orthogonality of error, we have


&lt;math&gt;a(u-u_h, v_h)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Specifically,


&lt;math&gt;a(u-u_2, u_1-u_2)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a(u-u_1,u-u_1)}_{\|u-u_1\|_{H^1}^2}+2\underbrace{a(u-u_2,u_1-u_2)}_0=\underbrace{a(u-u_2,u-u_2)}_{\|u-u_2\|_{H^1}^2}+\underbrace{a(u_1-u_2,u_1-u_2)}_{\|u_1-u_2\|_{H^1}^2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;f: R^n \rightarrow R \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be a nonlinear smooth function. To determine a (local) minimum of &lt;math&gt;f \!\,&lt;/math&gt; one can use a descent method of the form


:&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}=x_k+\alpha_k d_k \quad (k \geq 0)\quad \quad (1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


where &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \alpha_k \leq 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a suitable parameter obtained by backtracking and &lt;math&gt; d_k &lt;/math&gt; is a descent direction i.e. it satisfies


:&lt;math&gt;f(x_{k+1}) &lt; f(x_k) \quad \quad (2) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Write the steepest descent method (or gradient) method and show that there exist &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \alpha_k \leq 1\!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that the resulting method satisfies (2)

|}

==Solution 4a==

===Steepest Descent Method===

&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}=x_k-\alpha_k \nabla f(x_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \in (0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;f(x_k-\alpha_k \nabla f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. 


&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k : \min_{0 &lt; \alpha_k \leq 1} f(x_k - \alpha_k \nabla f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Directional Derivative Negative===

To satisfy (2), the directional derivative should be negative i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{d_k} f(x_k) = \lim_{\alpha_k \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_k+\alpha_k d_k)-f(x_k)}{\alpha_k} &lt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{f(x_k+\alpha_kd_k)}_{f(x_{k+1})} &lt; f(x_k)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


since &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \in (0,1]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Write the Newton method and examine whether or not there exist &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; which yield (2). Establish conditions on the Hessian &lt;math&gt;H(f(x)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; f(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; which guarantee the existence of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

|}

==Solution 4b==
===Newton's Method===
&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}=x_k-H^{-1}(f(x_k))\nabla f(x_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Directional Derivative Negative===
To have descent, we want the directional derivative to be negative i.e.


&lt;math&gt; 
\nabla_{\alpha_k d_k} f(x_k) = \nabla f(x_k) \cdot \alpha_k d_k=               - \nabla f(x_k) \cdot H^{-1}(f(x_k)) \nabla f(x_k) &lt; 0 
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x_k)^T H^{-1}(f(x_k)) \nabla f(x_k) &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}(f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite and therefore &lt;math&gt;H(f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite.

If we replace the Hessian by the matrix &lt;math&gt;H(f(x))+ \gamma_k I \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k \geq 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix, we obtain a quasi-Newton method. Find a condition on &lt;math&gt;\gamma_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; which leads to (2).
|}

==Solution 4c==

We now want &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}(f(x_k))=H(f(x_k))+\gamma_kI \!\,&lt;/math&gt; to be positive definite.


Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;H(f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then &lt;math&gt; \lambda_i + \gamma_k \cdot 1\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; i=1,2,\ldots,n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}(f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Since we want &lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}(f(x_k)) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; to be positive definite, we equivalently have for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\lambda_i + \gamma_k &gt; 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


i.e.


&lt;math&gt;\gamma_k &gt; -\lambda_i \quad i=1,2,\ldots,n  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y(x_{n+1})-y(x_n)=\int_{x_n}^{x_{n+1}} f(y(x))dx \approx h \cdot f\left(\frac{y_{n+1}+y_n}{2}\right)  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|e_{n+1}| &amp;= |y(t_{n+1}) - y_{n+1}| \\
          &amp;\leq |y(t_n) - y_n| + h \underbrace{\left| f \left( \frac{ y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_{n}) }{2} \right) - f \left( \frac{ y_{n+1} - y_{n} }{2}\right) \right| }_{\leq \frac{\gamma}{2}|y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_{n}) - y_{n+1} + y_{n}|} + \mathcal{O}(h^3) \\

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the Lipschitz constant of &lt;math&gt;f \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Rearranging terms we get


&lt;math&gt;|e_{n+1}| \leq \underbrace{\frac{1+\frac{h\gamma}{2}}{1-\frac{h\gamma}{2}}}_{C}|e_n| + \mathcal{O}(h^3) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


In particular, &lt;math&gt;|e_1| \leq C \underbrace{|e_0|}_{0} +\mathcal{O}(h^3)  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then &lt;math&gt;e_{N} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by

The midpoint method may be rewritten as follows:


&lt;math&gt;y(t_{n+1})=y(t_n)+\frac{h}{2}y'(t_{n+1})+\frac{h}{2}y'(t_n) + T_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which implies


&lt;math&gt;y(t_{n+1})-y(t_n)-\frac{h}{2}y'(t_{n+1})-\frac{h}{2}y'(t_n) = T_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Expanding each term around &lt;math&gt;\tau_n=t_n+\frac{h}{2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt; T_n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Weak Variational Formulation===

Multiplying the given equation by a test function &lt;math&gt;v \in H_0^1 [0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and integrating from 0 to 1 gives the equivalent weak variational formulation:


Find &lt;math&gt;u \in H_0^1 [0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;v \in H_0^1 [0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; the following holds


:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\epsilon \int_0^1 u' v' dx + b \int_0^1 u' v dx}_{a(u,v)} = \underbrace{\int_0^1 v dx}_{f(v)}  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Discrete Variational Formulation===

Let &lt;math&gt;V_h = \{ v \in H_0^1 [0,1] :  \left. v_h \right|_{[x_{i-1},x_i]}\mbox{ linear }  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,n \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then we have the discrete variational formulation which is an approximation to the weak variational formulation.  


Find &lt;math&gt;u_h \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;v_h \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;a(u_h,v_h)=f(v_h) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
===Define basis for V_h===

Let &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the linear &quot;hat&quot; functions which defines a basis for &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


&lt;math&gt;
\phi_i(x)= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in[x_{i-1},x_i] \\
\frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in[x_i,x_{i+1}] \\
0                   &amp; \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then calculation yields the following: (draw pictures)


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \phi_i(x) dx = h  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
\phi_i'(x)= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in[x_{i-1},x_i] \\
-\frac{1}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in[x_i,x_{i+1}] \\
0                   &amp; \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^1 \phi_i'(x)\phi_j'(x) dx= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{2}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } i=j \\
-\frac{1}{h} &amp; \mbox{ if } |i-j|=1 \\
0                   &amp; \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^1 \phi_i(x)\phi_j'(x)dx= 
\begin{cases}
0        &amp; \mbox{ if } i=j \\
\frac12  &amp; \mbox{ if } i-j=1 \\
-\frac12 &amp; \mbox{ if } i-j=-1 \\
0        &amp;  \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Discrete Variational Formulation in Matrix Form=== 
Since &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,


:&lt;math&gt;u_h=\sum_{i=1}^n u_{hi}\phi_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Also, the discrete variational formulation may be expressed as 


:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon \sum_{i=1}^n u_{hi} \int_0^1 \phi_i'(x)\phi_j'(x)dx+ b \sum_{i=1}^n u_{hi} \int_0^1 \phi_i'(x) \phi_j(x)dx = \int_0^1 \phi_j(x) dx \mbox{ for  }j=1,2,\ldots,n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


which in matrix form is 


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
2\frac{\epsilon}{h} &amp; -\frac{\epsilon}{h}+\frac{b}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp;\cdots &amp; 0 \\
-\frac{\epsilon}{h}-\frac{b}{2} &amp; 2\frac{\epsilon}{h} &amp; -\frac{\epsilon}{h}+\frac{b}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \ddots &amp;\ddots &amp; \ddots &amp;  \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cdots &amp;\cdots &amp; 0 &amp;  -\frac{\epsilon}{h}-\frac{b}{2} &amp; 2\frac{\epsilon}{h}

\vdots \\
u_n
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
h\\
h\\

&lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetric. &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite if

|}

== Solution 6c ==

Substituting &lt;math&gt;\epsilon+\frac{b}{2}h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields the following matrix &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;:

All off diagonal entries are &lt;math&gt;\leq 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Diagonal entries are &lt;math&gt; &gt;0\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The first row meets the last condition since


:&lt;math&gt; 2\frac{\epsilon}{h} +b \geq \frac{\epsilon}{h}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;



The second row through (n-1) rows meets the last condition since


:&lt;math&gt; 2\frac{\epsilon}{h} +b \geq \frac{\epsilon}{h}+b + \frac{\epsilon}{b}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The last row meets the last condition since


:&lt;math&gt; 2\frac{\epsilon}{h} +b \geq \frac{\epsilon}{h}+b\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

What is the typical order of convergence? Are there situations in which the order of convergence is higher? Explain your answers to these questions.

|}

==Solution 5c==

The typical order of local convergence is quadratic.


Consider the Newton's method as a fixed point iteration i.e.:


&lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}=\underbrace{x_k-\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}}_{g(x_k)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Then


&lt;math&gt;g'(x_k)=1-\frac{f'(x_k)^2-f'(x_k)f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)^2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;g'(x_*)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Expanding &lt;math&gt;g(x_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; around &lt;math&gt;x_* \!\,&lt;/math&gt; gives an expression for the error


&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{g(x_k)}_{x_{k+1}}=\underbrace{g(x_*)}_{x_*}+\underbrace{g'(x_*)}_0 e_k +\frac{g''(x_*)}{2}e_k^2 + \frac{g'''(\xi)}{6}e_k^3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Note that if &lt;math&gt;g''(x_*) =0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then we have better than quadratic convergence.

Let &lt;math&gt; P=\{x_i\}_{i=0}^{N} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be a partition of &lt;math&gt;[0,1] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Choose a an appropriate discrete subspace &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and basis functions &lt;math&gt; \{\phi_i\}_{i=0}^N\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then

==Solution 6c ==

Cea's Lemma:


&lt;math&gt;\|u-u_h\|_1 \leq \inf_{v \in V_h} C \|u - v\|_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


In particular choose &lt;math&gt;v_I \!\,&lt;/math&gt; to be the linear interpolant of &lt;math&gt; u\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Then,


&lt;math&gt;\|u-u_h\| \leq C \|u''\|_\infty h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


==Alternative Solution 6c==

Let &lt;math&gt; \{x_k\}_0^n &lt;/math&gt; be a discrete mesh of &lt;math&gt; [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; with step size &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt;. Consider the the following integral

&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}} |u(x)-u_h(x)|^2 dx &lt;/math&gt;.

For some &lt;math&gt;\xi_k\in [x_k, x_{k+1}]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; u(x)-u_h(x)=u'(\xi_k)*h &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; u_h &lt;/math&gt; is just a linear interpolation on this interval. Hence 

&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}} |u(x)-u_h(x)|^2 dx=\int_{x_k}^{x_{k+1}} h^2 u'(\xi_k)^2 dx=h^3 u'(\xi_k)^2\leq h^3 ||u'||_\infty &lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we can bound the &lt;math&gt; L_2(x_k, x_k+h) &lt;/math&gt; norm of the error in the derivatives with &lt;math&gt; h^3 ||u''||_\infty &lt;/math&gt;. With &lt;math&gt; n=1/h &lt;/math&gt; such intervals we have 

&lt;math&gt;\ ||u-u_h\||^2 \leq 2nh^3 \max(||u'||^2_\infty, ||u''||^2_\infty)=2h^2 \max(||u'||^2_\infty, ||u''||^2_\infty) .&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|y_0-\hat{y_0}| \leq \epsilon, \quad |y_1-\hat{y_1}| \leq \epsilon \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


then there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;C\!\,&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that


:&lt;math&gt;|y_n -\hat{y_n}| \leq C \epsilon \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq n \leq M \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

\begin{align}
y_{n+1}       &amp;= y_{n-1} + 2h f(t_n,y_n)  \\
\hat{y}_{n+1} &amp;= \hat{y}_{n-1} + 2h f(t_n, \hat{y}_n) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Subtracting both equations, letting &lt;math&gt;e_n \equiv y_n -\hat{y}_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and applying the Lipschitz property yields,


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
e_{n+1} &amp;\leq e_{n-1} + 2hL e_n \\
        &amp;\leq (1+2hL) \max \{ e_n, e_{n-1} \}

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e_n &amp;\leq (1+2hL)^{n-1} \epsilon \\

    &amp;\leq  e^{2Lhn} \epsilon \\

Suppose instead we are interested in the long term behavior of the midpoint rule applied to a particular example &lt;math&gt;f(t,y)=\lambda y \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. That is, let &lt;math&gt; h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be fixed and let &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt; so that the rule is applied over a long time interval. Show that in this case the midpoint rule does not produce an accurate approximation to the solution to the initial value problem.

|}

== Solution 7b ==

Substituting into the midpoint rule we have,


&lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}=y_{n-1}+2h \lambda y_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or


&lt;math&gt;y_{n+1}-2h\lambda y_n - y_{n-1}=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The solution of this equation is given by


&lt;math&gt;y_n = C_1 z_1^n + C_2 z_2^n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; or the roots of the quadratic


&lt;math&gt;z^2-2h\lambda z - 1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


The quadratic formula yields


&lt;math&gt;z= h\lambda \left(1 \pm \sqrt{1+\frac{4}{4h^2 \lambda^2}} \right) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


If &lt;math&gt;\lambda \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a small negative number, than one of the roots will be greater than 1.  Hence,  &lt;math&gt;y_{n} \rightarrow \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty\!\,&lt;/math&gt; instead of converging to zero since &lt;math&gt;y(t)=e^{\lambda t} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we are integrating hat functions on the right hand side, an appropriate quadrature formula would be to take half of the midpoint rule.  The regular midpoint rule would give double the actual integral value of a hat function.


Therefore &lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f(x) \phi_i(x) \approx h f(x_i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


Then the finite difference method and the finite element method yield the same matrix.

Show that the matrix in &lt;math&gt;(b) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is non singluar.

|}

==Solution 4c==

Since the matrix is diagonally dominant, it is non-singular.

To show that the matrix has a non-zero determinant, 2n elementary row operation can be used to show that 

&lt;math&gt;

\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{h}  &amp; -\frac{1}{h} &amp;             &amp;               \\ 
-\frac{1}{h} &amp; \frac{2}{h}  &amp;-\frac{1}{h} &amp;               \\
             &amp; \ddots       &amp; \ddots      &amp;         \\
             &amp;              &amp;             -\frac{1}{h}&amp; \frac{2}{h}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

has the same determinant as 


&lt;math&gt;

\begin{bmatrix}
 
-\frac{1}{h} &amp; \frac{2}{h}  &amp;-\frac{1}{h} &amp;              \\
             &amp; \ddots       &amp; \ddots      &amp; \ddots      &amp;  \\
              &amp;             &amp; -\frac{1}{h}&amp; \frac{2}{h}\\
  &amp;             &amp;             &amp; \frac{n+1}{h} \\
\end{bmatrix}


&lt;/math&gt;

which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{n+1}{h^n}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the following dissipative initial value problem,


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{cases}
y'+f(y)=0, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
y(0)=y_0
\end{cases}
\qquad (2)

Write the Backward Euler Method for (2).  This gives rise to an algebraic equation. Explain how you would solve this equation.

|}

== Solution 5a ==

Using Taylor Expansion we have


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
y(x-h) &amp;= y(x)-y'(x)h +\frac{y''(\xi)}{2} h^2 \\
 y(x)  &amp;= y(x-h)+y'(x)h - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2}h^2 \\
 y(x_n)  &amp;= y(x_{n-1})+\underbrace{y'(x_n)}_{-f(y(x_n))}h - \underbrace{\frac{y''(\xi)}{2}h^2}_{O(h^2)}  \qquad (*) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Thus we have Backwards Euler Method:


&lt;math&gt; y_n = y_{n-1} - h f(y_n)\qquad (**)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;e_n \equiv y(x_{n-1})-y_n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Derive an error estimate of the form


:&lt;math&gt; |y(x_n)-y_n | \leq \frac{M}{2}h, n=1,2,\ldots \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;M=\max_{0 \leq x \leq 1} |y''(x)| \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Do this directly, not as an application of a standard theorem. (Note that there is no exponential on the right hand side.
|}

==Solution 5b==

Subtracting &lt;math&gt;(*) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(**) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have 


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e_n &amp;= e_{n-1}-h [ f(y(x_n))-f(y_n)] - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2}h^2 \\
    &amp;= e_{n-1}-h  f'(y(\alpha)) e_n - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2} h^2 \quad \mbox{ (by MVT) } \\
e_n^2 &amp;= e_{n-1}e_n - h \underbrace{f'(y \alpha)}_{&lt; 0} e_n^2 - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2} h^2 e_n \\
      &amp;\leq e_{n-1}e_n - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2}h^2 e_n \\
e_n  &amp;\leq e_{n-1} - \frac{y''(\xi)}{2}h^2 \\
\| e_n \| &amp;\leq \|e_{n-1}\|+ \frac{\|y''\|_\infty}{2}h^2 \\
\| e_n \| &amp;\leq n \frac{\|y''\|_\infty}{2}h^2 \\
          &amp;\leq \frac{M}{2} h

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Maria,
I enjoyed reading about your personal background and educational philosophy. I am also going for my Interdisciplinary Studies Pk-6 degree. And like you, I was first thinking about going into the nursing/pediatric field, but decided teaching was my dream. El Savador sounds like a wonderful place I would absolutely love to visit one day. I really admire your parents for giving you and your sister a bilingual experience. I am interested in your thoughts on bilingual education. Do you think learning a second language beginning in the elementary years would be beneficial to students? I greatly agree with your educational philosophy. Teachers should strive to learn and understand the needs of their students. You spoke of children with special needs. I think labeling these students in Kindergarten with the special needs they have will give the students the best placement and opportunities for their unique learning styles. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 14:04, 27 May 2009 (UTC)


Hi Maria, 
I like the way you worded your Philosophy. It was short and to the point, and I think that is great. Although it could have been a little more detailed. I also figured out that i wanted to work in a field that involved children at a young age. I think the majority of the students in this class would agree with you when it comes to finding a job shortly after graduation. Addressing whether or not a student has a learning disability at a young is very important. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 1:27, 28 May 2009 (UTC)


Maria,
I like your &quot;About the Author&quot; Page since I can identify with it as well. I am also of hispanic decent and the bilingual experience has been unforgettable for me, therefore I will teach it in the future as a foreign language education teacher.  Your philosophy is very true. Catering to each child's need is the primordial part of teaching and Im glad you see it as well. Every child has a different learning method and as teachers we should all see that we may have to vary our curriculums.[[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 15:30, 30 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">you shall *NOT* add specialization of swap in std, you shall provide overload in the type's namespace [27 May 2009]
: True, although it's not illegal provided it's a specialization (as opposed to an overload), and even Sutter and Alexandrescu in their Coding Standards book (item 66) imply that this is a commonly adopted, acceptable solution if your compiler(s) don't support Koenig lookup. At least, that's my reading. [[Special:Contributions/221.47.185.5|221.47.185.5]] ([[User talk:221.47.185.5|talk]]) 03:27, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

This page is very wrong.  Defining swap in both std and class namespace?  Calling it a &quot;common practice&quot;?  A link to comp.lang.c++.moderated discussion at the end of the page provides the correct solution, but it's completely ignored here.  As it was already mentioned, you should provide an overload in the namespace of the class.  When using swap, however, you shouldn't qualify it.  You should do an unqualified call: 'using std::swap; swap(...);'.  All compilers support ADL nowadays.  It's not 1990ies any more.

I should add that for class templates it's not even possible to provide a swap specialization in the std namespace (no partial specializations for functions allowed).  But if someone wants to do it as this page suggests, he'll end up with an overload.  This overload will be illegal according to the Standard and it will interfere with swap specializations.  '''Specializations do not overload''' - this language rule will put the ill-conceived swap overload ahead of properly written specializations in the overload resolution order.  And it will likely result in some very strange compile-time error messages or runtime bugs.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Angelia, nice to meet you in Wiki-world. That was some planning on the birth of your children.  I have a son and a neice that was born on the same day (15 hours apart).  I have worked with fifth and sixth graders going on nine years now, and have thought about working with the primary school students. I think I would like the change.  What are the ages in your daycare?  I like your educational philosophy, especially about how the classroom should bright and fun.  I like doing the bullentin boards and seeing if the students notice the change.  I like the idea about group assignments because it would give the students a chance to get to know each other and bounce ideas off each other and it helps them become critical thinkers. Parents should not only be involved in their child's classroom but also involved in the school (PTA). Good luck to you and all your endeavors.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 23:52, 30 May 2009 (UTC)



Hi Angelia!

I think you have a great educational philosophy.  I too firmly believe that parental involvement in your child’s education is so vitally important.  My two youngest attend a small Catholic school in which I would describe the involvement of the parents as “nurturing”.  Unfortunately, from my friends who teach in public schools at all grade levels, parental involvement seems to be more an exception than the rule.  You sound like you have a great plan for your future classroom and I’m sure you’ll be a great teacher who really connects with your students.  It is clear you really care about them.

Hi Angelia, 

I also agree with Sandra, you have great philosophy.  I have always believed that children can tell the difference between a teacher who is there because they love it and the teacher that is there for the paycheck.  I have had the experience with my daughters that I could see that they were not important to their teachers.  That was frustrating for me and also for them because there was no motivation to please their teacher.  One of my daughter had a teacher that left in the middle of the year to finish up her masters in library science and told the kids over and over that she was leaving teaching to go into library science because it was quieter.  I was so upset, my daughter hated to go to school that year because she did not want to have to be in a class where a teacher did not want to be there.  It has been my experience that as a supervisor of our aquatics instructional program that the teachers who engage their children, continue to make them feel special and important, and also who are present; have the most success with their children.  That is what I hope to be able to do and in reading your philosophy, I am sure that you also concur.  Parents are the bridges between students and teachers, that is one philosophy that we share!
Good luck, 
Jill</text>

Hi Rachel!

Reading about your educational philosophy was so interesting! For a long time I did not know much about home schooling; however, I have 5 little cousins who are now home schooled (and have been for about 5 years or so) Learning about their educational experience is fascinating to me! They live in PA and have a huge home schooling community up there. So they do a lot of things at home where they are taught by their mom, but also get to do many activities and things with other home schooled children. Did you have any of that here in VA? I totally agree with the concept of finding teaching methods to benefit each child. Kids are SO different and all have unique needs. I think with your experience as a child combined with your chance to nanny will give you such a great foundation for teaching. I hope this semester goes well for you! See you in class!

Hi Rachel-

Wow, you were blessed to have such a wonderful mother!  My youngest nephew was diagnosed with ADD and with a little medication and a lot of nurturing from his Mom and Dad; he too has had great success in school.  I feel so badly for all those kids out there that don’t get the support they need from their home and family like you had.  Great teachers, like you said, are so often few and far between.  I think about how differently their lives might be if they have someone who takes them by the hand and helps them understand how they need to learn and gives them the support and foundation they need to build upon for success when they move on to the next classroom.  You have a unique experience, empathy and knowledge to take into your classroom to help all your students attain their goals.  [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 16:26, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

Hi Rachel

I would also like to commend your mom! Homeschooling can be difficult at times...especially with several children who have different learning styles. I agree with you that it is imperative to teach the classroom as a whole, but at the same time, understanding and accomodating the variances in learning styles. I think you will be able to use your homeschooling experiences to go above and beyond the traditional classroom setting in regards to curriculum, ie. a more hands-on approach. Enjoyed getting to know you...great outlook![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 06:31, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello Rachel!

I believe your experiences in life will really help you in the classroom.  Seeing teachers that come to the classroom after having &quot;real world&quot; experiences are a treat.  Those teachers are able to relate to the kids and put education in real and interactive terms.  While I understand the need for teachers to come straight out of school and into the classroom, it would be very beneficial for teachers to have some life experiences to draw on before teaching.  For example in the business world, most MBA programs want their potential students to have real world experience to draw on before coming into their program.  For them it helps bring the program alive.  I believe the same is true for teachers who come into the classroom after spending time &quot;living&quot; before teaching.  I look forward to working with you during this class! [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 21:25, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

Rachel,

While I can see that a lot of people have already commented on your page, I also wanted to after reading your philosophy of education. First of all, I wanted to tell you that you should be very proud of what you have accomplished despite the severe ADD you faced. Your mother must have been a wonderful teacher to be able to guide you and prepare you so well to succeed even in a regular high school environment. I also agree that teachers need to assess the strengths and weaknesses of individual students in their classrooms so that inclusive classrooms can be successful. Interactive teaching strategies help to include all students and give everyone a chance to participate and learn something in the process. When a child stuggles in school, they may get discouraged. But if teachers can include them in various learning activities as you state in your philosophy, then they will not get so overwhelmed and feel better about learning. Thanks for such an interesting page! Have a great semester! [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 20:19, 31 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hey cutie. I would love to eat you like a donut. I tried to look for something wrong in your writing, but I had difficulty because it was so damn funny. [[User:Rebecca.hechler|Rebecca.hechler]] ([[User talk:Rebecca.hechler|talk]]) 23:04, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

Confession: Teaching is my back-up too. I want, more than anything, to be an opera singer. You want your life to be more like an elaborate fantasy novel, and I want my life to be more like an elaborate musical; specifically an opera. Try not to be so bitter :)[[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 17:01, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

I really enjoyed reading your User page because not only did it make me laugh, it also made me believe in your philosophy of education. I think your future students will be lucky to have you as their professor because you are not afraid to take a risk with regards to teaching methods. I especially enjoyed reading how you propose to help your students become passionate about literature and learning in general...don't change a thing. Making learning correlate with students lives is novel approach...Kudos![[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 06:16, 28 May 2009 (UTC)


Even though we've never met, and I certainly did not take that picture or buy that donut that you were consuming, I must congratulate you on your unorthodox approach. I too have plans to raise an army. May chance have it that we construct some massive chess board for scrimmage purposes and entice them to commence the battle of academic reckoning. It will be overwritten versus sloppily written– superheroes versus indieheroes– flip versus brit. There will be no parley... only the sweet sound of thundering war drums, the ripping of pages and the splatter of the darkest ancestral ink. In the end, we shall forge a new era. I dream of a day where I walk in a classroom as a teacher, make a Lovecraft or a Gaiman reference and hear a thunderous cacophony of voices asking for a high-five.

Hello BitterAsianMan,
How intriguing it is to come across such an honest individual, their aren't many of you out there.  I think your future classes will appreciate and remember you for it.  I was off my chair at your wit and general approach to life.  It's sad, because I remember reading Beowolf in high school, but nothing about the experience was memorable or offered a connection.  It's nice to finally see someone in opposition to the norm, your passion will transfer to the students and ultimately resonate with them. Good luck, I look forward to reading about you someday!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Graphs ==
For C1 it is important to be able to draw graphs and labelling points of intersection between graphs, as well as axes intersection points i.e., where the graph crosses the x-axis and the y-axis.
You must be familiar with the equation y = mx + c which is the equation for any straight line graph.
For drawing a line graph, you must be able to put any linear equation into the above form and work out the gradient (m) and the y-intercept (+c) For example, the line y + x = 7, we must put it into the y = mx + c form, so we get y = -x + 7. From here we can see that the gradient is -1 and the line crosses the y axis at 7. We can substitute in anotehr x value, say 1, to get another y value (-1 + 7 = 6) so we have a gradient, -1, a y-intercept = 7, and a co-ordinate (-1,6) so now we can draw the line.
To draw a quadratic graph, we must be familiar with factorizing (see relevant page) and from here we get the roots of the graph. The general shape for a quadratic is the parabola which is a U shape for a positive quadratic, and an upside-down U shape for a negative one. We can substitiue x = 0 into the equation of the quadratic to get the y-interecept.

== Transformations ==
There are 4 basic types of transformations
y = f(x)+a - movement up by a units
y = f(x-a) - movement along by a units (for f(x+a) it would be a movement along by -a units)
y = af(x) - a vertical stretch of sf a
y = f(ax) - a horizontal stretch of sf 1/a

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Susan,

You article is starting to look great! As beneficial as it is to have links to other articles within yours, more information should be included within your answers.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Have a great day! [[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 18:10, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

Hi Susan! 

When I read your &quot;About the Author&quot; page I couldn't believe how many things we have in common.  The most obvious is that we are &quot;teacher kids.&quot;  I can still remember being in elementary school and being put in the other teacher's room so that I wouldn't have my mom in 5th grade.  That same year a kid tried to pay me a quarter to get the answers for her on a math test.  Don't worry, I didn't take the bait.

Do your fuzzy children have long lost siblings somewhere in Southside Virginia?  I think I may have two of their long lost relatives living at my house.  My Gertrude and Morticia look suspiciously like your two kitties.  Hmmmmmm....

I, too, enjoy reading in what little spare time I have.  Usually my nose is stuck in a textbook.  When I get the opportunity to read &quot;just for fun&quot; I enjoy southern literature, especially Mary Kay Andrews and Ann B. Ross.  I can't stand trashy romance novels!  Give me a book with a juicy plot that makes you think anyday.

I agree with your philosophy of utiliziing a variety of instructional strategies in the classroom.  It is important for all students to have the opportunity to learn regardless of their learning abilities.  I love using technology in the classroom because it provides hands-on and visual learners an easier way to understand new concepts while reinforcing previously taught material.  

It's great to see someone else interested in special education, too!  Good luck this semester.

Hi Susan,
I was looking through some of the pages and your cats caught my eye. I too grew up with a cat.  I got her when I was nine and she just went to kitty heaven almost two years ago.  I am also a dog lover. I have a airedale/blacklab mix named Lola who runs my life.  I have had her since she was seven weeks and she is still as hyper as the day I got her.  She definately keeps me on my toes.

I also in my very little spare time enjoy a good book.  I got sucked into the Twilight series and it was actually really good. I am also reading a world geogrphy textbook right now, but it is not as good. haha.

I was a special education assistant all throughout high school.  I started in eighth grade and loved the students so much I followed them to high school, well the ones that went on to my high school.  I currently am observing in a kindergarten class and they are always using a large variety of educational tools.  I agree with you it really does make a difference introducing students to a variety of tools. The teacher even has computers she sends the kids to use.  I am very excited to be the teacher one day soon! 

Good Luck with everything!! [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 19:35, 27 May 2009 (UTC)

I appreciate the efforts to document the images, but information has not been provided on the options others have to reuse the above images. One of the licenses at [[WB:FILES#Licensing_Information]] would need to be placed on the image pages so that the terms of reuse are known.

:Thanks for updating the images. [[:File:Kiwi sitting on a chair.JPG]] and [[:File:Belleoncouch.JPG]] now have the information needed. The other images listed above still do not have information on them. However, they are not used by any pages, so maybe they were mistakenly uploaded and will not be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Mary!

When I was reading your &quot;About the Author&quot; page, Blackstone caught my eye.  I have a relative that is a police officer in Blackstone and another that works for VDOT.  Also, I adopted my two cats from Donna at Critter Care.  Small world, huh?

I think that it is wonderful that you have chosen to work towards your teaching license.  Your work as an intructional assistant has and will continue to provide you with much needed experience.  I have been a substitute and taught for one full year before making the decision to move forward with my education.  Like you, I know the experience I gained in the classroom will serve me well in the future.

I, too, also prefer working with upper elementary students, specifically special education.  I love to use tecnology in the classroom and love using the SMART board.  It is great for showing multimedia clips, Powerpoint presentations, and allowing the students to participate in interactive lessons.  What student likes to hear the teacher go on and on about a topic?  Technology keeps students interested in the lesson being presented.  

Good luck this semester and keep up the hard work!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Heather,

Unlike you I am awful at biology, but high five to you for enjoying science.  I also am not married yet, just waiting on that ring! :)  I am currently working on my teaching licensure at ODU and have a bachelor's degree in psychology.  I also very clearly remember some of the teacher's who changed my life.  My high school psychology teacher is the reason I majored in psychology.  I also remember my third grade teacher, only because she was very scary.  

When reading your philosophy on teaching I felt many of our point were similar.  I am a neat freak so I definately would like a well organized classroom.  Although I do not know how long it will last teaching kindergarteners.  I also enjoy group work.  I always enjoyed group work in school therefore I believe I will utilize it in my classroom.  I also believe visual learning is key.  I overall would like my students to feel comfortable in the classroom and enjoy being there.  I think how you set up a classroom is very important.  I hope that both of our future students will enjoy our tidy classrooms.[[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 19:50, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Lwill031,

I was skimming through these friendly about me profiles and came across your page.  It seems as though we have lots in common, so I figured this would be an easy response.  I also love the beach and have two mouthy hound dogs that keep me on my toes.  They love a good, quiet beach and constantly require something to burn off all that extra energy.  My dachshund is hilarious however, while his tiny legs just sink in the sand.  They love their long walks though. (I think I love them too.) :D    

Let’s see...I am originally from Western MD and then the Shenandoah Valley.  However, once I came to the ocean, I figured there was no turning back.  I also have a huge passion for cooking and a wonderful boyfriend who appreciates that.  I have worked in restaurants for a long time, and although a not so fabulous career, I have learned many valuable &quot;tricks of the trade&quot;.  Nonetheless, I am always up for a new recipe.  I graduated from ODU in 2004 with the same Psychology/Human Services degree.  It seems as though you have put it to better use than I have.  I really wanted to work with at risk teenagers, but found it difficult to obtain an okay paying job with my bachelors.  So...here I am, happily pursuing my prek-6 licensure and then hopefully my masters in school counseling.  Let's see...you had me until the kindergarten grade.  I can really appreciate the impact kindergarten teachers have on emotional development, but am more of a 3rd grade teacher myself.  I love the little ones and am hoping to soon teach the kindergarten class at my church.  However, at the end of the day, I think I have a niche with third graders who still love their teachers, but are also ready to explore the world on their own.  Lastly, I could not agree with you more about the ways in which you will structure your classroom.  I feel children, especially at that age, need all forms of activities to engage their senses.  Colors, music, dancing...fun and happiness.  I also believe however, that amidst all the happiness, we must also send our students home with better emotion regulation skills, coping strategies, and preparation for everything the world has to offer.  

Take care, have a wonderful summer, and a successful semester.

Hello,Lyndsey

I loved reading your philosophy on education.  It was great hearing from someone who has been in the classroom already and has seen first hand what it is like.  I too love working with kids.  I have ran a daycare out of my home for the past four years. I am pursuing the PreK-6 liscensure. It sounds like you will be a wonderful teacher and love every minute of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Afett001,
Ahh...a fellow Winchester individual.  I actually spent ten years of my life in the Shenandoah Valley.  All of my high school years and then community college at Lord Fairfax.  I came to Virginia Beach to attend ODU.  It wasn't too far away from my family, but just far enough. Oh...and who could forget the beach?  That was definitely a plus.  I hope you are enjoying the beautiful mountains though.  I always enjoyed being able to get lost on any of the side roads down route 50, 522, or even route 7.  You don't realize how important wide-open spaces are until you don't have them anymore.  There are not too many places to get lost in VA Beach.  Maybe pungo...?  I'm sure that area has grown a lot though. In the now eight years I have been away, I hear it has changed tremendously.  I hope not too much.  I don't get to visit that area too often anymore, as my parents have moved to Richmond and the rest of my family is in Western, MD.  However, I will be driving through there over the weekend to visit my grandfather.  I'll tell you, every October I miss those mountains.  I miss skyline drive and even tacky apple blossom festival.  I certainly miss the Long Branch hot air balloon and wine festival.  If you haven't done that...I highly recommend it.  I miss Sweet Caroline's, Brewbakers, and even Coalie Harry's for after work drinks with friends.  I miss that old town feel that has live bands on weekends.  I'm assuming none of this has changed, but perhaps it has.  Nonetheless, I also love the beach.  Wouldn't trade it either.  I think it's funny that we never truly appreciate where we live until we are gone.  Anywho...enough of the nostalgia...

I too ended up in a career that wasn't my passion.  I am now happily pursuing my prek-6 licensure and would love to eventually finish my masters in school counseling.  I think that teachers today face one of the most challenging, yet rewarding careers.  We have opportunities to provide equality in our classrooms.  We have opportunities to appreciate and respect the diversity of all our students.  I'm with you...I believe that all elementary grades would be fine to teach, but I really love third grade.  Fourth grade and fifth grade would be more preferable than the earlier years.  I want to work with children who still love their teachers, but are secure enough and curious enough to explore their own curiosities.  Well...take care, good luck, and have a wonderful summer.
Autumn

Hello. My name is Heather. I couldn't help but respond to your page because we share the same views. I am amazed that some people don't encourage group work. I am like you...it enables students to feed off of each other and see things in different perspectives. I couldn't agree with you more about patience. As an educator you must possess patience; if not, lord help ya!! Not all students are sweet and behave well. Believe me I know all about those don't listen, talk out of turn, yell at ya type of students. They can be very hard to deal with sometimes. However if we have patience it makes it easier, but then their are some that just can't be tamed and for those we have alternative school.:) Good luck with class and I hope you enjoy your career as an educator.

Hola Anakristen, beautiful name by the way. My name is Bianca. I could not help not to write on your page.  As I read the information you wrote about yourself, I was intrigued on how much you have done in such a short life. You seem like a very hard working and nice loving person as well, I can imagine the chaos in the house with so many people and pets. As you, I love being around children. They always seem to light up the room but as I read your educational philosophy I had to strongly disagree with a specific point. Yes, teachers are great role models for students. They teach them to be not only good learners but they also instill basic positive personal experiences in their younger years. We are all entitled to our own opinion with that said I cannot help to understand why you believe that English is the only language that should be taught in school. Teachers not only should be able to handle diversity but they should also be diverse as well. I am not saying that all teachers should know more than one language but they should promote to students learning another language because of the benefits. This world has become so small, mixed and competitive especially in the job market. Having more than one language regardless of which one, it is such a privilege a benefit to students in their future. I love how you said that lecture lessons that are enforced by group activities reinforce a subject matter. I think this is true in every way and that some teachers don’t do it enough. Students benefit so much from other students when they are engaged in group projects. Different skills and ideas can be learned from others, this helps them not only learn how to work with other people but to develop a larger range of problem solving since they learn more and more with each project they are assigned.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 17:18, 30 May 2009 (UTC)


Hello Anakristen! I have lived in Virginia for several years, but I have never been to northern Virginia. Although I do not have six cats, I do have a German Shepherd, so my own house does not have too many dull moments either. My degree is also for PreK-6, and I would prefer to teach fourth or fifth grade. I would not have a problem teaching 6th grade, however that is my limit, because I could never see myself teaching middle school or high school. Good instructional strategies are also essential in a classroom; even though student will constantly need your guidance as a teacher, it is good to teach them methods where they can solve problems on their own. This is especially true for special needs students, who need as much confidence and independence as they can receive. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 20:25, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

Hello Anakristen,  I had the privelege of reading your author page.  I see that you have had a remarkable background in just the few years you've been out of high school.  I can appreciate how you started a career as a banker.  This gave you experience in a particular field, but now after some other experiences, you feel that teaching is right for you.  I would like to congratulate you on finding a career path that you feel fits your interests and personal mission.  I wish you all the best as you contine to pursue this track of work....I have zero dogs and cats, and so if and when I decided to get one or more such pets, I will contact you for some input.  Thanks.
Michael

      <text xml:space="preserve">:::::::::'''Semester Two Review'''

A major theme we focused on this semester was the American Dream. The American Dream will be examined by looking back on some of the novels read this year. Some of these novels are: ''The Great Gatsby'' by F. Scott Fitsgerald, ''Of Mice and Men'' by John Steinbeck, and ''A Raisin in the Sun'' by Lorraine Hansberry. I only intend to show the theme as it is demonstrated in the literature.


The American Dream changes throughout ''The Great Gatsby''. At first, the American Dream seems like something that only the greatly wealthy possess. Yet, the American Dream seems to fade with exceeding wealth. So it can be noted that it's not as exciting to be rich and famous as it seems to be.


The American Dream is illustrated at different viewpoints in ''Of Mice and Men''. One biew is the pursuit of happiness, but with obstructions in the way. On the other hand, are the elderly really helpful to society? So it may be noted that there are different values for the American Dream.


The American Dream is displayed as a set of values in ''A Raisin in the Sun''. It appears as a person's dreams at first. Then it becomes a sense of one's goals, and the personal bond of a family. Thus, giving an even closer understanding of the American Dream.


All in all, it can be summarized that the American Dream is a subject that is often reviewed. In fact, many American novels touch the subject of the American Dream. Thus, the American Dream is recognized as a common subject in literature. Lastly, the imaginary in the novels mentioned above, help to describe the American Dream.</text>

[[Image:George-W-Bush.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|George W. Bush]][[Image:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Al Gore]]
As Clinton's presidency came to a close, Democrats nominated Al Gore, Clinton's vice president, as their nominee, and the Republicans chose George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former President George H.W. Bush.

Florida had traditionally been a Democratic-leaning state, but explosive population growth in the late nineties had brought many social and economic conservative Cubans to southern Florida. The growth had left Florida very evenly split among the parties. 

On election night, the news media outlets first predicted Florida to go to Gore, then to Bush, and then decided that the race was too close to call. Florida law provided for an automatic recount when votes differ by such a small margin, and when Florida decided that Bush had won, Gore sued Bush to force further recounts in several Florida counties. Bush counter-sued, and the case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Court decided that the state of Florida must recount all the ballots in all the Florida counties and not just those for which Gore had sued, in accordance with the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As Florida was required by the Florida Constitution to certify its election within days of the Court's decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/14mar20010800/frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.fdf Supreme Court decision]&lt;/ref&gt;, there was not enough time to recount the entire state. Thus, the final state count stood, with Bush winning Florida by 537 votes, (and as a result receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 267, and therefore gaining the presidency), although he lost the popular vote.

== Early Bush Administration Policy ==

=== Domestic Affairs ===

=== Foreign Affairs ===

During the 2000 campaign, some had criticized George W. Bush on his qualifications in the realm of foreign relations as a state governor.  One such incident which supposedly epitomized this lack of experience was when Bush was interviewed by a local television reporter and asked if he knew who the leader of Chechnya was and the name of the general who had recently taken over the government of Pakistan, to which Bush could not answer either.  The perception early on in the Bush presidency was that his administration was relatively disinterested in foreign policy.

During the first eight months of his administration, one of the major issues concerned how to deal with North Korea, an issue which had also plagued his predecessor.  On February 9, 2001, a U.S. Navy submarine, the USS ''Greeneville,'' collided with a Japanese fishing vessel, killing all nine aboard.  President Bush promptly apologized for the incident.

The administration's first major foreign policy crisis came, however, on April 1, 2001, in the form of the '''Hainan Island incident,''' during which a U.S. Navy EP-3E ARIES II surveillance aircraft was forced to land at a Chinese military airport after colliding with a Chinese aircraft.  One Chinese pilot was killed and the 24 member crew of the U.S. aircraft were detained by the Chinese government.  The flight had occurred over a portion of the South China Sea over which the U.S. and China disagreed on the issue of U.S. naval overflights.  The administration issued an apology for the death of the Chinese pilot as well as the entering of China's airspace to land, which the U.S. Ambassador Joseph Prueher said &quot;did not have verbal clearance.&quot;

However, the early happenings of the Bush administration would be largely forgotten after the tragedy that struck one Tuesday morning.

==The Closing Decade==
As the decade closes, it is hard to say what people will say of it. There has not yet been a name picked for this new decade.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Gastrointestinal Physiology looks at the functioning of the Gastro-Intestinal (GI) system. The four basic functions of the GI system are '''digestion''', '''absorption''', '''motility''' and '''secretion'''. '''Digestion''' describes how ingested food is broken down into smaller biochemical components; '''absorption''' how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body; '''motility''' how food and waste products are moved from mouth to anus; and '''secretion''' how digestive juices etc. are controlled and secreted. About 9 liters of fluid pass through the GI system every day, and of these only two are taken by mouth, the rest represents secretions by the system itself.

The whole is under the control of the hormonal and nervous systems, although the GI system has it's own autonomous nervous system, the '''enteric nervous system'''. 

The digestive system is the body's major interface with the out side world, and as such it is richly supplied with immune cells, indeed by some estimates 80% of the bodies immune cells are in the GI tract.

===Esophageal Reflux===
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), Gastric reflux disease, or Acid reflux disease is defined as chronic symptoms or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux in the esophagus.[1]

This is commonly due to transient or permanent changes in the barrier between the esophagus and the stomach. This can be due to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, impaired expulsion of gastric reflux from the esophagus, or a hiatus hernia. If the reflux reaches the throat, it is called laryngopharyngeal reflux disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC CORDIC] (standing for '''CO'''ordinate '''R'''otation '''DI'''gital '''C'''omputer) circuit serves to compute several common mathematical functions, such as trigonometric, hyperbolic and exponential functions.

==Application==

A CORDIC uses only adders to compute the result, with the benefit that it can therefore be implemented using relatively basic hardware. 

Methods such as power series or table lookups usually need multiplications to be performed. If a hardware multiplier is not available, a CORDIC is generally faster, but if a multiplier can be used, other methods may be faster.

CORDICs can also be implemented in many ways, including a single-stage iterative method, which requires very few gates when compared to multiplier circuits. Also, CORDICs can compute many functions with precisely the same hardware, so they are ideal for applications with an emphasis on reduction of cost (e.g. by reducing gate counts in FPGAs) over speed. An example of this priority is in pocket calculators, where CORDICs are very frequently used.

==History==

The CORDIC was invented in 1959 by J.E. Volder, in the aeroelectronics departments of Convair, and was designed for the B-58 Hustler bomber's navigational computer to replace an analogue resolver, a device that computed trigonometric functions.

In 1971, J.S. Walther, at Hewlett-Packard, extended the method to calculate hyperbolic and exponential functions, logarithms, multiplications, divisions, and square roots.

==General Concept==

Consider the following rotations of vectors:

{| align=center
|-
|[[Image:CORDIC Vector Rotation 1.svg]]
|[[Image:CORDIC Vector Rotation 2.svg]]
|-
|
*Start at (1, 0)
*Rotate by ''θ''
*We get (cos''θ'', sin''θ'')
|
*Start at (1, ''y'')
*Rotate until ''y'' = 0
*The rotation is tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''y''
|}

If we were to have a computationally efficient method of rotating a vector, we can directly evaluate sine, cosine and arctan functions. However, rotation by an arbitrary angle is non-trivial (you have to know the sine and cosines, which is precisely what we don't have). We use two methods to make it easier:

*Instead of performing rotations, we perform &quot;pseudorotations&quot;, which are easier to compute.
*Construct the desired angle ''θ'' from a sum of special angles, ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':
::&lt;math&gt;\theta = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \ldots + \alpha_m&lt;/math&gt;

The diagram belows shows a rotation and pseudo-rotation of a vector of length ''R''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; about an angle of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; about the origin:

[[File:CORDIC Pseudo-rotation.svg|center]]

A rotation about the origin produces the following co-ordinates:

::&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i \cos \alpha_i - y_i \sin \alpha_i &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i \cos \alpha_i - y_i \sin \alpha_i &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i + \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

Recall the identity &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta \equiv 1 \Big / \sqrt{1+ \tan^2 \theta } &lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = \left( x_i - y_i \tan \alpha_i \right) \Big / \sqrt{1+ \tan^2 \alpha_i } &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = \left( y_i - x_i \tan \alpha_i \right) \Big / \sqrt{1+ \tan^2 \alpha_i } &lt;/math&gt;

Our strategy will be to eliminate the factor of &lt;math&gt;1 \Big / \sqrt{1+ \tan^2 \alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt; and somehow remove the multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;. A pseudo-rotation produces a vector with the same angle as the rotated vector, but with a different length. In fact, the pseudo-rotation changes the length to:

::&lt;math&gt;R_{i+1} = \frac{R_i}{\cos \alpha_i } = R_i \sqrt{  1+ \tan^2 \alpha_i }&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we now have these co-ordinates following a pseudo-rotation:

::&lt;math&gt;x^\prime_{i+1} = \left( x_i - y_i \tan \alpha_i \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y^\prime_{i+1} = \left( y_i - x_i \tan \alpha_i \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i - \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

The pseudo-rotation has succeeded in removing our length-factor, which would have required a costly division operation. However, the vector will grow by a factor of ''K'' over a sequence of ''n'' pseudo-rotations:

::&lt;math&gt;K = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \sqrt{  1+ \tan^2 \alpha_i }&lt;/math&gt;

The co-ordinates following the ''n'' pseudo-rotations are then:

::&lt;math&gt;x_{n} = K \left( x_i \cos \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {\alpha_i} - y_i \sin \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{n} = K \left( y_i \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\cos \alpha_i - y_i \sin \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i \right) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_{n} = \theta_i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\alpha_i}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:CORDIC Pseudo-rotation Example.svg|right|frame|The first three pseudo-rotations. Note how we converge on the correct angle, ''&amp;theta;'']]
If the angles are always the same set, then ''K'' is fixed, and can be accounted for later. We choose these angle according to two criteria:
*We must also choose the angles so that any angle can be constructed from the sum of all them, with appropriate signs.
*We make all &lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; a power of 2, so that the multiplication can be performed by a simple logical shift of a binary number.

The tangent function has a monotonically increasing gradient on the interval [0, ''&amp;pi;''/2], so the tangent of a given angle is always less than twice the tangent of half the angle. This means that if we make the angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = \tan^{-1} 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;, we can satify both criteria. Note that the tangent function is odd, which means that to pseudo-rotate the other way, you just subtract, rather than add, the tangent of the angle.

In step ''i'' of the process, we pseudo-rotate by &lt;math&gt;d_i 2^{-i}\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d_i\,&lt;/math&gt; is the direction (or sign) of the rotation, which will be chosen at each step to force the angle to converge to the desired final rotation. For example, consider an rotation of 28°:

::&lt;math&gt;28 \approx 45.0 - 26.57 + 14.04 - 7.13 + 3.58 - 1.79 +0.90 - 0.45 + 0.22 + 0.11&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;28 \approx 27.91&lt;/math&gt;

Them more steps we take, the better the approximation that we can make by successive rotations. Thus, we have the following iterative co-ordinate calculation:

::&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i - d_i y_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i + d_i x_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\theta_{i+1} = \theta_i - d_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

In order to achieve ''k'' bit of precision, ''k'' iterations are needed, because &lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1} 2^{-i} \lessapprox 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;, converging as ''i'' increases.

==Using CORDICs==

[[File:CORDIC Block.svg|right]]
CORDICs can be used to compute many functions. A CORDIC has three inputs, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on the inputs to the CORDIC, various results can be produced at the outputs ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Using CORDIC in rotation mode===

{|
|-
|width=250|
&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i - d_i y_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i + d_i x_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z_{i+1} = z_i - d_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

|width=250|
&lt;math&gt; x_{n} = K \left( x_0 \cos \theta_0 - y_0 \sin \theta_0 \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y_{n} = K \left( y_0 \cos \theta_0 + x_0 \sin \theta_0 \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; z_{n} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For convergence of ''&amp;theta;''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to 0, choose &lt;math&gt;d_i = \mbox{sgn }  z_i &lt;/math&gt;.

If we start with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''K'' and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=0, at the end of the process, we find ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=cos ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=sin ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The domain of convergence is &lt;math&gt;-99.7^{\circ} &lt; z_{0} &lt; 99.7^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; because 99.7° is the sum of all angles in the list.

===Using CORDIC in vectoring mode===

{|
|-
|width=250|
&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i - d_i y_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i + d_i x_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z_{i+1} = z_i - d_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

|width=250|
&lt;math&gt;x_{n} = K \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y_{n} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z_{n} = z_0 + \tan^{-1} \left( y_0 / x_0 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|}

For convergence of ''y''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to 0, choose &lt;math&gt;d_i = - \mbox{sgn }  (x_i y_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we start with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, we find ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

==Implementations of CORDICs==
===Bit-parallel, unrolled===
[[File:CORDIC (Bit-Parallel, Unrolled, Circular Rotation).svg|center]]

===Bit-parallel, iterative===
[[File:CORDIC (Bit-Parallel, Iterative, Circular Rotation).svg|center]]

If a high speed is not required, this can be implemented with a single adder and a single shifter.

===Bit-serial===

==The Universal CORDIC==

By introducing a factor ''&amp;mu;'', we can also cater for linear and hyperbolic functions:

::&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i - \mu d_i y_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i + d_i x_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;z_{i+1} = z_i - d_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

===Summary of Universal CORDIC implementations===

::&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = x_i - \mu d_i y_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y_{i+1} = y_i + d_i x_i 2^{-i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;z_{i+1} = z_i - d_i \alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;

===Indirectly computable functions===

In addition to the above functions, a number of other functions can be produced by combining the results of previous computations:

::{|

|width=200|&lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1} w = \tan^{-1} \frac{\sqrt{1-w^2}}{w}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|height=30|&lt;math&gt;\tanh z = \frac{\sinh z}{\cosh z}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\sin^{-1} w = \tan^{-1} \frac{w}{\sqrt{1-w^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|height=30|&lt;math&gt;\ln w = 2 \tanh^{-1} \left| \frac{w-1}{w+1} \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\log_b w = {\ln w \over \ln b}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|height=30|&lt;math&gt;w^t = e^{t \ln w}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\cosh^{-1} = \ln \left( w + \sqrt{1-w^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|height=30|&lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1} (y/x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\sinh^{-1} = \ln \left( w + \sqrt{1+w^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|height=30|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ x^2 - y^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{w} = \sqrt{ (w+1/4)^2 - (w-1/4)^2 }&lt;/math&gt;
