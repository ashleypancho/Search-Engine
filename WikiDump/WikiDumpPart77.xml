      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Often it happens that, while processing an expression, a temporary object is created, which is destroyed at the end of that expression.
If such object is of a fundamental type, almost always the compiler succeeds in avoiding its creation, and anyway the creation and destruction of an object of a fundamental type are quite fast.
Instead, if the object is of a composite type, its creation and destruction have an unlimited cost, as they cause the call of a constructor and the call of the destructor, that may take any time.

In this section some techniques are presented to avoid that composite temporary objects are created, and therefore that their constructors and destructors are called.

=== Functions return value ===

'''For non-inlined functions, try to declare a return type for which an object copy moves no more than 8 bytes. If unfeasible, at least construct the result object in the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement.'''

While compiling a non-inlined function, the compiler cannot know if the return value will be used, and therefore it must generate it anyway.
To generate and assign an object whose copy moves no more than 8 bytes has little or no cost, but to generate and assign more complex object takes time.
If the temporary object owns resources, the taken time is enormously bigger, but even without allocations, the taken time grows with the number of machine words used by such object.

However, if the object to return is constructed in the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; instructions themselves, therefore without assigning such value to a variable, the language standard guarantees an optimization called ''Return Value Optimization'', that prevents the creation of temporaries.

Some compilers succeeds to avoid creating temporaries, even when the returned object is associated to a local variable (with the so-called ''Named Return Value Optimization''), but this is not generally guaranteed and has anyway some limitations. [http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/ctors.html#faq-10.9 C++ FAQ]

To check whether one of the above optimizations is applied, increment a static container in every constructor, destructor, and in assignment operators of the returned object class.
In case no optimization is applied, resort to one of the following alternative techniques:
* Make &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; the function return type, and add to it a passed-by-reference argument, acting as return value.
* Transform the function into a constructor of the return type, taking the same function arguments.
* Make the function return an object of an auxiliary type, that steals the resources from the return object and passes them to the destination object, without copying their contents.
* Use an [[More C++ Idioms/Expression-template|''expression template'']], that is an advanced technique, part of the programming paradigm called [[w:Template metaprogramming|''template metaprogramming'']].
* If using the C++11 standard, use an ''rvalue reference''.

=== Moving declarations outside loops ===

'''If a variable is declared in the body of a loop, and an assignment to it costs less than a construction plus a destruction, move that declaration before the loop.'''

If the variable is declared in the body of a loop, the associated object is constructed and destructed at every iteration, while if it is outside the loop, such object is constructed and destructed only once, but is presumably assigned one more time in the body of the loop.

Though, in many cases, an assignment costs exactly as much as a pair construction+destruction, and thus in such cases there is no gain in moving the declaration outside the loop and adding an assignment inside.

=== Assignment operator ===

'''In an assignment operator overload (operator=), if you are sure that it will never throw exceptions, copy every member variable, instead of using the ''copy&amp;swap'' idiom.'''

The most efficient way to copy an object is to imitate an appropriate initialization list of a copy constructor, that is, first, to call the analogous member functions of the base classes, and then to copy every member variable, in declaration order.

Unfortunately, such technique is not ''exception-safe'', that is if during this operation an exception is thrown, the destructors of some already constructed sub-objects could never be called.
Therefore, if there is the chance that during the copy an exception is thrown, you must use an ''exception-safe'' technique, although it won't have optimal performance.

The most elegant ''exception-safe'' assignment technique is the one called ''copy&amp;swap''.
It is exemplified by the following code, in which &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; represents the name of the class, and &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; a member function to define:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
C&amp; C::operator=(C new_value) {
    swap(new_value);
    return *this;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Overload to avoid conversions ===

'''To avoid costly conversions, define overloaded functions for the most typical argument types.'''

Let's assume you wrote the following function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int f(const std::string&amp; s) { return s[0]; }
&lt;/source&gt;

whose purpose is to allows to write the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::string s(&quot;abc&quot;);
int n = f(s);
&lt;/source&gt;

But it can be used also by the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int n = f(string(&quot;abc&quot;));
&lt;/source&gt;

And, thanks to the implicit conversion from &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, it can be used also by the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int n = f(&quot;abc&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Both the last two calls to the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; function are inefficient, as they create a temporary non-empty &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; object.

To keep the efficiency of the first example call, you have to define also the following function overload:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int f(const char* s) { return s[0]; }
&lt;/source&gt;

In general, if a function is called by passing to it an argument of an unexpected type but that can be implicitly converted to an expected type, a temporary of the expected type is created.

To avoid such temporary object, you have to define an overload of the original function that takes an argument of the type of the actual passed object, thus avoiding the need of a conversion.

      <comment>That is not the worst case.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The conditional jump machine language instructions (aka ''branches''), may be generated by many C++ language features, among which there are the &lt;code&gt;if-else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;do-while&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;switch-case&lt;/code&gt; statements, and by boolean and conditional expressions operators.

Modern processors handle branches efficiently only if they can predict them.
In case of prediction error, the steps already done by the [[Microprocessor Design/Pipelined Processors|pipeline]] on the following instructions are useless and the processor must restart from the branch destination instruction.

The branch prediction is based on the previous iterations on the same instruction.
If the branches follow a regular pattern, the prediction are successful.

The best cases are those in which a branch instruction has always the same effect; in such cases, the prediction is almost always correct.
The worst case is that in which the branch instruction has an outcome pattern the opposite of the branch prediction behavior. As predictors usually assume reoccurrence of results, this would be a branch that outcome is always the opposite of the previous outcome. In this case the prediction is never correct and the pipeline is always interrupted. Not all processors use such prediction behavior, with some simple ones always assuming no jump will occur.
The case where the branch instruction has a random outcome results in the prediction being on average correct half of the times. However random distribution means that actual results will vary from being always right to always wrong in a Gaussian shaped distribution.

In bottlenecks, the hard-to-predict branches should be avoided.
If a branch is predicted very badly, even replacing it with a rather slow sequence of instructions may result in a speed up.

In this section, some techniques are presented to replace branches with equivalent instructions.

=== Integer interval check ===

'''If you have to check whether an integer number &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is between two integer numbers &lt;code&gt;min_i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max_i&lt;/code&gt; included, and you are sure that &lt;code&gt;min_i &lt;= max_i&lt;/code&gt;, use the following expression:'''

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
unsigned(i – min_i) &lt;= unsigned(max_i – min_i)
&lt;/source&gt;

In the given conditions, the above formula is equivalent to the following, more intuitive formula:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
min_i &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt;= max_i
&lt;/source&gt;

The former formula performs two differences and one comparison, while the latter formula performs no difference and two comparisons.
For pipelined processors, comparisons are slower than differences, because they imply a branch.

In addition, if &lt;code&gt;min_i&lt;/code&gt; is a constant expression with zero value, the two differences disappear.

In particular, to check whether an integer &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is a valid index for an array of &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; elements, that is to perform array bounds checking, use the following expression:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
unsigned(i) &lt; unsigned(size)
&lt;/source&gt;

Obviously, if the expressions are already of an &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt; type, conversions are unneeded.

=== The binary look-up table ===

'''Instead of a conditional expression in which both cases are constants, use a look-up table with two-places.'''

If you have a statement like the following, where &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; represent constant expressions, and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; represents a boolean expression:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a = b ? c : d;
&lt;/source&gt;

that is equivalent to the following code:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (b) a = c;
else a = d;
&lt;/source&gt;

try to replace it with the following code, equivalent but perhaps faster:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static const type lookup_table[] = { d, c };
a = lookup_table[b];
&lt;/source&gt;

The conditional expression is compiled into a branch.
If such a branch is not well predicted, it takes longer than the lookup-table.

This technique may be applied also to a sequence of conditional expressions.
For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a = b1 ? c : b2 ? d : b3 ? e : f;
&lt;/source&gt;

that is equivalent to the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (b1) a = c;
else if (b2) a = d;
else if (b3) a = e;
else a = f;
&lt;/source&gt;

try to see if the following code is faster:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static const type lookup_table[] = { f, e, d, d, c, c, c, c };
a = lookup_table[b1 * 4 + b2 * 2 + b3];
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Early address calculation ===

'''Try to calculate the value of a pointer or iterator somewhat before when you need to access the referenced object.'''

For example, in a loop, the following statement:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a = *++p;
&lt;/source&gt;

may be a bit less efficient than the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a = *p++;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first case, the value of the pointer or iterator is calculated just before it is used to access the referenced object, while in the second case it is computed in the previous iteration.
In a pipelined processor, in the second case, the increment of the pointer may be performed simultaneously with the access of the referenced object, while in the first case the two operations must be serialized.

      <comment>/* Bit-fields */ Bit fields have a lot of draw backs that were not mentioned.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

When the application accesses main memory, it implicitly uses both the various processor caches and the disk swapping mechanism by the virtual memory manager of the operating system.

Both the processor caches and the virtual memory manager process data block-wise, and therefore the software is faster if the few memory blocks contain the code and the data used by a single command.
The principle that the data and the code processed by a command should reside in near regions of memory is called [[w:Locality of reference|''locality of reference'']].

This principle becomes even more important for performance in multi-threaded applications on multi-core systems, as if several threads running on different cores access the same cache block, the contention causes a performance degradation.

In this section techniques are proposed to optimize usage of the processor caches and of the virtual memory, by incrementing the locality of reference of code and data.

=== Nearing the code ===

'''Put near in the same compilation unit all the function definitions belonging to the same bottleneck.'''

In such a way, the machine code generated by compiling such functions will have near addresses, and so greater code locality of reference.

Another positive consequence is that the local static data declared and used by such functions will have near addresses, and so greater data locality of reference.

=== &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;s ===

'''In medium or large arrays or collections, use &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;s.'''

&lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt;s allow to save memory space in variable type structures, and therefore to make them more compact.

Though, don't use them for small or tiny objects, as there are no significant space gains, and with some compilers the objects put in a &lt;code&gt;union&lt;/code&gt; are not kept in processor registers.

=== Bit-fields ===

'''If a medium or large object contains several integer numbers with a small range, transform them in bit-fields.'''

Bit-fields decrease the object size.

For example, instead of the following structure:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    bool b;
    unsigned short ui1, ui2, ui3; // range: [0, 1000]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

that takes up 8 bytes, you can define the following structure:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    unsigned b: 1;
    unsigned ui1: 10, ui2: 10, ui3: 10; // range: [0, 1000]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

that takes up only (1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 31 bits, 31 &lt;= 32) 4 bytes.

For another example, instead of the following array:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
unsigned char a[5]; // range: [-20, +20] 
&lt;/source&gt;

that takes up 5 bytes, you can define the following structure:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    signed a1: 6, a2: 6, a3: 6, a4: 6, a5: 6; // range: [-20, +20]
};
&lt;/source&gt;

that takes up only (6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30 bits, 30 &lt;= 32) 4 bytes.

Though, there is a performance penalty in packing and unpacking the field.
In addition, in the last example, the field can no more be accessed by index.

It should be noted that bit field behavior is not well defined so different compilers will give different results. Bit field struct members are not thread safe due to memory granularity so have undefined behavior when accessed concurrently on multi-processor platforms which can result in hard to detect faults. As such many compilers will attempt to ignore them completely.

This optimization is best used on micro-processors. As these devices are usually single processor devices there is no problem with concurrent access. They also have very limited memory so cannot afford wasted bits. In addition, many micro-processors have special instructions designed to improve performance of bit manipulation, eg an instruction to test if a single bit is set within a byte at an offset.

=== Template code independent of parameters ===

'''If in a class template a non-trivial member function does not depend on any template parameter, define a non-member function having the same body, and replace the original function body with a call to the new function.'''

Let's assume you wrote the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;typename T&gt;
class C {
public:
    C(): x_(0) { }
    int f(int i) { body(); return i; }
private:
    T x_;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Try to replace the above code with the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;typename T&gt;
class C {
public:
    C(): x_(0) { }
    void f(int i) { return f_(i); }
private:
    T x_;
};

void f_(int i) { body(); return i; }
&lt;/source&gt;

For every instantiation of a class template that uses a function of that class template, the whole code of the function is instantiated.
If a function in that class template do not depend on any template parameters, at every instantiation the function machine code is duplicated.
Such code replication bloats the program.

In a class template or in a function template, a big function could have a large part that do not depend on any template parameters.
In such a case, first, factor out such a code portion as a distinct function, and then apply this guideline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Optimizing C++}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Some elementary operations, even being conceptually as simple as others, are much faster for the processor.
A clever programmer can choose the faster instructions for the job.

Though, every optimizing compiler is already able to choose the fastest instructions for the target processor, and so some techniques are useless with some compilers.

In addition, some techniques may even worsen performance on some processors.

In this section some techniques are presented that may improve performance on some compiler/processor combinations.

=== Structure fields order ===

'''Arrange the member variables of classes and structures in such a way that the most used variables are in the first 128 bytes, and then sorted from the longest object to the shortest.'''

If in the following structure the &lt;code&gt;msg&lt;/code&gt; member is used only for error messages, while the other members are used for computations:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    char msg[400];
    double d;
    int i;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

you can speed up the computation by replacing the structure with the following one:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    double d;
    int i;
    char msg[400];
};
&lt;/source&gt;

On some processors, the addressing of a member is more efficient if its distance from the beginning of the structure is less than 128 bytes.

In the first example, to address the &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; fields using a pointer to the beginning of the structure, an offset of at least 400 bytes is required.

Instead, in the second example, containing the same fields in a different order, the offsets to address &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; are of few bytes, and this allows to use more compact instructions.

Now, let's assume you wrote the following structure:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    bool b;
    double d;
    short s;
    int i;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because of fields alignment, it typically occupies 1 (bool) + 7 (padding) + 8 (double) + 2 (short) + 2 (padding) + 4 (int) = 24 bytes.

The following structure is obtained from the previous one by sorting the fields from the longest to the shortest:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct {
    double d;
    int i;
    short s;
    bool b;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

It typically occupies 8 (double) + 4 (int) + 2 (short) + 1 (bool) + 1 (padding) = 16 bytes.
The sorting minimized the paddings (or holes) caused by the alignment requirements, and so generates a more compact structure.

=== Floating point to integer conversion ===

'''Exploit non-standard routines to round floating point numbers to integer numbers.'''

The C++ language do not provide a primitive operation to round floating point numbers.
The simplest technique to convert a floating point number &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the nearest integer number &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the following statement:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
n = int(floor(x + 0.5f));
&lt;/source&gt;

Using such a technique, if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is exactly equidistant between two integers, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; will be the upper integer (for example, 0.5 generates 1, 1.5 generates 2, -0.5 generates 0, and -1.5 generates -1).

Unfortunately, on some processors (in particular, the Pentium family), such expression is compiled in a very slow machine code.
Some processors have specific instructions to round numbers.

In particular, the Pentium family has the instruction &lt;code&gt;fistp&lt;/code&gt;, that, used as in the following code, gives much faster, albeit not exactly equivalent, code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#if defined(__unix__) || defined(__GNUC__)
    // For 32-bit Linux, with Gnu/AT&amp;T syntax
    __asm (&quot;fldl %1 \n fistpl %0 &quot; : &quot;=m&quot;(n) : &quot;m&quot;(x) : &quot;memory&quot; );
#else
    // For 32-bit Windows, with Intel/MASM syntax
    __asm fld qword ptr x;
    __asm fistp dword ptr n;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code rounds &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to the nearest integer, but if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is exactly equidistant between to integers, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; will be the nearest even integer (for example, 0.5 generates 0, 1.5 generates 2, -0.5 generates 0, and -1.5 generates -2).

If this result is tolerable or even desired, and you are allowed to use embedded assembly, then use this code.
Obviously, it is not portable to other processor families.

=== Integer numbers bit twiddling ===

'''Twiddle the bits of integer numbers exploiting your knowledge of their representation.'''

A collection of hacks of this kind is [http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html here].
Some of these tricks are actually already used by some compilers, others are useful to solve rare problems, others are useful only on some platforms.

=== Floating point numbers bit twiddling ===

'''Twiddle the bits of floating point numbers exploiting your knowledge of their representation.'''

For the most common operation, compilers generate already optimized code, but some less common operation may become slightly faster if the bits are manipulated using bitwise integer operators.

One of such operations is the multiplication or the division by a power of two.
To perform such operation, it is enough to add or subtract the exponent of the power of two to the exponent part of the floating point number.

For example, given a variable &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, conforming to IEEE 754 format, and given an integer positive expression &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, instead of the following statement:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
f *= pow(2, n);
&lt;/source&gt;

you can use the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (*(int*)&amp;f &amp; 0x7FFFFFFF) { // if f==0 do nothing
    *(int*)&amp;f += n &lt;&lt; 23; // add n to the exponent
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Array cells size ===

'''Ensure that the size (resulting from the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; operator) of non-large cells of arrays or of &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;s be a power of two, and that the size of large cells of arrays or of &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;s be not a power of two.'''

The direct access to an array cell is performed by multiplying the index by the cell size, that is a constant.
If the second factor of this multiplication is a power of two, such an operation is much faster, as it is performed as a bit shift.
Analogously, in multidimensional arrays, all the sizes, except at most the first one, should be powers of two.

This sizing is obtained by adding unused fields to structures and unused cells to arrays.
For example, if every cell is a 3-tuple of &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; objects, it is enough to add a fourth ''dummy'' &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; object to every cell.

Though, when accessing the cells of a multidimensional array in which the last dimension is an enough large power of two, you can drop into the ''data cache contention'' phenomenon (aka ''data cache conflict''), that may slow down the computation by a factor of 10 or more.
This phenomenon happens only when the array cells exceed a certain size, that depends on the data cache, but is about 1 to 8 KB.
Therefore, in case an algorithm has to process an array whose cells have or could have as size a power of two greater or equal to 1024 bytes, first, you should detect if the data cache contention happens, e in such a case you should avoid such phenomenon.

For example, a matrix of 100 x 512 &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; objects is an array of 100 arrays of 512 &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s.
Every cell of the first-level array has a size of 512 x 4 = 2048 bytes, and therefore it is at risk of data cache contention.

To detect the contention, it is enough to add an elementary cell (a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;) to every to every last-level array, but keeping to process the same cells than before, and measure whether the processing time decrease substantially (by at least 20%).
In such a case, you have to ensure that such improvement be stabilized.
For that goal, you can employ one of the following techniques:
* Add one or more unused cells at the end of every last-level array. For example, the array &lt;code&gt;double a[100][1024]&lt;/code&gt; could become &lt;code&gt;double a[100][1026]&lt;/code&gt;, even if the computation will process such an array up to the previous sizes.
* Keep the array sizes, but partition it in rectangular blocks, and process all the cells in one block at a time.

=== Prefix vs. Postfix Operators ===
'''Prefer prefix operators over postfix operators.'''

When dealing with primitive types, the prefix and postfix arithmetic operations are likely to have identical performance.  With objects, however, postfix operators can cause the object to create a copy of itself to preserve its initial state (to be returned as a result of the operation), as well as causing the side-effect of the operation.  Consider the following example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class IntegerIncreaser
{
    int m_Value;

public:
    /* Postfix operator. */
    IntegerIncreaser operator++ (int) {
        IntegerIncreaser tmp (*this);

        ++m_Value;
        return tmp;
    };

    /* Prefix operator. */
    void operator++ () {
        ++m_Value;
    };
};&lt;/source&gt;

Because the postfix operators are required to return an unaltered version of the value being incremented (or decremented) &amp;mdash; regardless of whether the result is actually being used &amp;mdash; they will most likely make a copy.  STL iterators (for example) are more efficient when altered with the prefix operators.

=== Explicit inlining ===

'''If you don't use the compiler options of whole program optimization and to allow the compiler to inline any function, try to move to the header files the functions called in bottlenecks, and declare them &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;.'''

As explained in the guideline &quot;Inlined functions&quot; in section 3.1, every inlined function is faster, but many inlined functions slow down the whole program.

Try to declare &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; a couple of functions at a time, as long as you get significant speed improvements (at least 10%) in a single command.

=== Operations with powers of two ===

'''If you have to choose an integer constant by which you have to multiply or divide often, choose a power of two.'''

The multiplication, division, and modulo operations between integer numbers are much faster if the second operand is a constant power of two, as in such case they are implemented as bit shifts or bit maskings.

=== Integer division by a constant ===

'''When you divide an integer (that is known to be positive or zero) by a constant, convert the integer to &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt;.'''

If &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt; integer, &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt; integer, and &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; is a constant integer expression (positive or negative), the operation &lt;code&gt;s / C&lt;/code&gt; is slower than &lt;code&gt;u / C&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;s % C&lt;/code&gt; is slower than &lt;code&gt;u % C&lt;/code&gt;.  This is most significant when &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; is a power of two, but in all cases, the sign must be taken into account during division.

The conversion from &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;unsigned&lt;/code&gt;, however, is free of charge, as it is only a reinterpretation of the same bits.  Therefore, if &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;signed&lt;/code&gt; integer that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; to be positive or zero, you can speed up its division using the following (equivalent) expressions: &lt;code&gt;(unsigned)s / C&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(unsigned)s % C&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Processors with reduced data bus ===

'''If the data bus of the target processor is smaller than the processor registers, if possible, use integer types not larger than the data bus for all the variables except for function parameters and for the most used local variables.'''

The types &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; are the most efficient, after they have been loaded in processor registers.
Though, with some processor families, they could not be the most efficient type to access in memory.

For example, there are processors having 16-bit registers, but an 8-bit data bus, and other processors having 32-bit registers, but 16-bit data bus.
For processors having the data bus smaller than the internal registers, usually the types &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; match the size of the registers.

For such systems, loading and storing in memory an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; object takes a longer time than that taken by an integer not larger than the data bus.

The function arguments and the most used local variables are usually allocated in registers, and therefore do not cause memory access.

=== Rearrange an array of structures as several arrays ===

'''Instead of processing a single array of aggregate objects, process in parallel two or more arrays having the same length.'''

For example, instead of the following code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int n = 10000;
struct { double a, b, c; } s[n];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    s[i].a = s[i].b + s[i].c;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

the following code may be faster:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int n = 10000;
double a[n], b[n], c[n];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using this rearrangement, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; may be processed by array processing instructions that are significantly faster than scalar instructions.
This optimization may have null or adverse results on some (simpler) architectures.

'''Shared''' is an [[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada 83]] [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation pragmas|representation pragma]] equivalent to [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic|Atomic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

== Portability ==

Shared is a standard pragma of Ada 83, so it must be implemented by all Ada 83 compilers. It is obsolescent in successive versions of the language, but it is equivalent to pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic|Atomic]] and thus it is usually implemented by Ada 95 compilers for compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Project Valuation=
== Discounted Cash Flow ==
In Corporate Finance, it is often necessary to determine if a project is worthwhile to undertake. Sometimes, there will only be enough investment capital to undertake some projects, in which case, one must determine which project to do.

The standard approach is to use the '''Net Present Value''', or NPV. The NPV is calculated by finding all of the cash flows which will occur, and discount them back to the present time. This also includes expenses, hence, ''net'' present value.

For example:

STDs Unlimited is trying to determine whether to purchase a new piece of machinery. This machine will cost $1,000,000, and save $170,000 per year for 10 years, at which point it will be sold for $50,000. After 5 years, the machine will require an overhaul which will cost $100,000. If the company uses a 7% discount rate for projects of this type, what is the NPV of purchasing the machine? Should the company do it?

The first thing we must do is find the total cost savings of this project. Each year there will be a positive cash flow of $170,000, which must be discounted each year back to the present time:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=1}^{10}\frac{170,000}{(1.07)^t} = 1,194,009&lt;/math&gt;

So we can see that this project will bring in $1,194,009 worth of savings. In addition, it will bring in $50,000 in year 10 when it is sold, so we find the present value of that:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{50,000}{(1.07)^{10}}=25,417&lt;/math&gt;

So we add those up to get the total positive cash flow of $1,219,426.

From this amount, we must subtract the costs. We know the initially cash outlay is $1,000,000, but we must find the present value of the overhaul which will occur at year 5:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{100,000}{(1.07)^5} = $71,299&lt;/math&gt;

So now we can calculate the present value of all costs: 1,000,000 + 71,299 = 1,071,299.

Then we simply subtract the negative cash flows from the positive and see that

&lt;math&gt;NPV = 1,219,426 - 1,071,299 = $148,127&lt;/math&gt;

So, since this project has a positive NPV, the company should go ahead and do it.


== Depreciation Tax Shield ==

In the previous example, we did not calculate an important benefit which must be considered in real life examples: taxes. When a company purchases a piece of equipment, they will '''depreciate''' it. This means that they do not have to pay taxes on an amount of income equivalent to what they are spending on capital investment.

Let's consider our example above. We arrived at the NPV of $148,127 without taxes, so lets look at what happens when we depreciate the initial investment:

Assume STDs unlimited decides to depreciate the $1,000,000 machine using straight line depreciation for 10 years. What is the value of the depreciation tax shield? What is the new NPV?

Straight line depreciation means an equivalent amount is depreciated each year, for 10 years. So in this example, depreciation is $100,000 per year. This means that on the books, the company will spend $100,000 per year on the machine, instead of $1,000,000 up front. This makes more sense logically, since the company will be using the machine for 10 full years. The tax shield is equal to the following:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{Annual Depreciation*Tax rate}{(1 + r)^t}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case it will be:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(100,000*.35)}{1.07} + \frac{(100,000*.35)}{1.07^2} + \frac{(100,000*.35)}{1.07^3} + ... +\frac{(100,000*.35)}{1.07^{10}} = $245,825&lt;/math&gt;

As we can see, this is a significant savings. 

There is one more step we must take in this example. Since we depreciated the entire value of the machine, we are basically telling the government that it is worthless at the end of 10 years. However, since we sell at at the end of year 10 for $50,000, it is clearly not worthless. In order to make this right (and avoid an audit and costly fines), we must pay taxes on that $50,000 in year 10. This amount is clearly .35 * 50,000 = 17,500. Since we don't pay this until year 10, we discount this amount by ten years (17,500/(1.07^10)) to get $8,896. We then subtract this amount from the $245,825 tax shield to get $236,929. 

So we see that our total tax savings from depreciation is $236,929, which we add to our NPV of 148,127 to get a final NPV on this project of $385,056.

==Equivalent Annual Costs==
When a company is considering two machines which will be used for a long period of time, it is sometimes necessary to use equivalent annual costs to determine which machine is a better investment.

For example:

Suppose an upscale vodka company is looking to purchase one of the two distilling machines. Machine A costs $45,000, lasts for 5 years before replacement, and costs $10,000 per year to operate. Machine B costs $50,000, lasts for 7 years, and costs $11,000 per year to operate. Now, if we were to take the NPV of the costs, it looks quite obvious that machine B's NPV will be lower (meaning it costs more). We shall use an 8% discount rate.

NPV&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=-$84,927

NPV&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;=-$107,270

Now, if we were to just look at NPV, we would choose machine A, as it has lower costs. However, this fails to take into account that machine B has to be replaced less often. In order to correctly evaluate these options, we must use '''Equivalent Annual Cost'''.

&lt;math&gt;EAC = \frac{NPV}{n-year  annuity  factor}&lt;/math&gt;

An '''annuity factor''' is defined as the present value of $1 received every year for ''n'' years, at a discount rate of ''r''.The formula to find the n-year annuity factor is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this formula, we can see that the 5 year annuity factor at 8% is 3.99, and the 7 year annuity factor is 5.2.

So, in order to find the equivalent annual costs of these projects, we shall divide their respective NPVs by their respective annuity factors:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Machine A
!Machine B
|-
|&lt;math&gt;EAC_A = \frac{84,927}{3.99} = $21,284&lt;/math&gt; 
| &lt;math&gt;EAC_B = \frac{107,270}{5.2} = $20,628&lt;/math&gt;

|}

And so, we can see that although machine A appears to have lower costs, machine B is actually cheaper in the long run, since it must be replaced less frequently.

== Synergy/Cannibalism ==
When valuing a project, it is necessary to take into consideration how it will affect other parts of your business. For example, say you are the CFO of a computer store that sells X1000 high end computers, and X500 budget computers. If you are considering introducing a new line of X750 mid-range computers, you must consider that this may '''cannibalize''' some business from the high end line. That is, some customers who might have otherwise purchased a more expensive X1000 may now settle for the X750.

On the other hand, some new projects may create '''synergies''', or benefits, to other product lines. For example, if you are in the oil refining business, and you are considering opening up you own oil well, this may reduce the costs for your refinery. So this too, must be added in as an additional benefit in your NPV calculation.

==Sunk Costs ==
'''Sunk Costs''' are expenditures which a company has already spent on a project. It is important to realize that sunk costs are already spent, and are not factored into an NPV equation. For example, if your corporation hires a consulting firm to evaluate customer reaction to a new product line, that is not included in the NPV calculation. Whether or not you decide to initiate the new product line, you already spend money on the consultants.

It is also important to understand the difference between opportunity cost and sunk costs. Lets suppose XYZ Corp. buys a parcel of land for $100,000. They do not do anything with this land for a number of years, and then decide to build a factory on it. When calculating the NPV of the factory, the cost of the land is NOT a sunk cost. It is still possible to sell the land or do something else with it, and it therefore must be included.


==Internal Rate of Return==

Another common yardstick of valuing projects is '''Internal Rate of Return''', or IRR. IRR is the discount rate which, when applied to a project, will cause the NPV to be zero. Let us use a simple example:

Say you are going to lay out $100,000 for a project. This project will produce cash flows of $15,000 in year 1, and $50,000 in year 2, and $70,000 in year 3. What is the IRR?

In order to solve this problem, we must set up an equation for NPV and set it to zero:

&lt;math&gt; 0 = -100,000 + \frac{15,000}{1+r} + \frac{50,000}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{70,000}{(1+r)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we simply solve for r. Of course, as there are 3 variables in this equation, we cannot solve it algebraically, and must use either a financial calculator, Excel, or some type of graphing program or calculator. Using a financial calculator, the answer can be found as 13.454%. So, if the company's cost of capital is 13%, then this project is good to take. However, if the company requires a 13.5% return, the project would not be wise.

There is one caveat to using IRR to evaluate projects. IRR is a rate, not an amount. So if your company must choose between two projects, one with an IRR of 8%, and another with an IRR of 11%, the 11% IRR project is not always the best choice.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
!Project A
!Project B
|-
!Initial Investment
|$100,000
|$1,000
|-
!Return after 1 yr
|$108,000
|$1,110
|-
!Total Profit
|$8,000
|$110
|-
!IRR
|8%
|11%
|}

So you see, the project with the higher IRR ends up netting the company far less money, as the projects are mutually exclusive.

This is Gareth-Lee here. 
The subject is well-known actually. It was first concieved by Arthur Eddington, who called them ''spacetime theories.'' Wiki has a specific article claiming that they are not pseudoscience, but a protoscience. 
If it is the quality of the work in question, then i apologise.
::{{comment}}I know Eddington wrote extensively on Physics &amp; Cosmology, but I am not aware that he ever published anything significant about the mind. Regardless of the quality of the material, it contravenes the Wikibooks policy on original research ([[WB:OR]]). Ultimately this is why it will have to go, sorry. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 00:22, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

Are you refuting the fact that spacetime theories are not in use? I ask you to google 'spacetime theories - wiki' - and you will find my reference about Arthur Eddington. I think he was inspired by his work on relativitistic maps. 

Either way, if you feel this need to be deleted, then go right ahead. Nothing i can do that will stop you.

::{{comment}}It would help a bit if you were able to provide definite references to any actual publications by Eddington himself on spacetime and the mind. So far I have only found anecdotal claims from your hints and suggestions. The whole subject in so far as it exists seems far too speculative to present from a neutral point of view in a textbook. Of course the final decision on this book will be made by the Wikibooks community not me alone. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 20:31, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">When valuing a company's stock, there is an important distinction which must be made between that and an ordinary perpetuity. A company has the capacity to grow, which must be reflected in the current price.

If a stock price were to valued using a standard annuity formula, it would look something like this:

&lt;math&gt; P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r}&lt;/math&gt; (*edit* it should be &lt;math&gt; P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r-g}&lt;/math&gt;)

Where P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the price at time 0, D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the dividend at time 1, and r is the required rate of return. However, this clearly does not reflect the level at which a company is expected to grow. This is especially pertinent to start up companies, who may not pay any dividends for a long time, but are expected to become highly profitable in the future. A formula which takes this into consideration is as follows:

&lt;math&gt; P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r} + PVGO&lt;/math&gt; (*edit* it should be &lt;math&gt; P_0 = \frac{EPS_1}{r} + PVGO&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt;g = plowback * ROE&lt;/math&gt;

Hi. I saw your edit at [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment/Edition 2/Table of Contents/Chapter 13/13.1.1]] and I am wondering (since you signed your name) if you made a mistake or are uncertain about something?. I tagged the page, because I'm a little confused myself. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 00:05, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

:Prior to recent edits on the page, all that was there was this:
[[:Category:Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]][[User:Mmann019|Mmann019]] ([[User talk:Mmann019|talk]]) 21:42, 16 May 2008 (UTC)
That is not a book. However, now you and someone else have expanded it and there is nothing wrong with it. It is just not common to see someone sign their name on a book, unless they were a little confused about something.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Capital Allocation Line''' shows how an investor can use an optimal market portfolio matched to his risk preferences. According to capital market theory, there is one particular portfolio that has the highest expected returns for its risk. However, the risk category that this portfolio is in may not be suitable for all investors. Some investors will naturally prefer lower risk, lower return securities. Other investors will prefer riskier ventures with the possibility of higher returns. The Capital Allocation Line is kinked at one point in the middle, this represents the optimal market portfolio. 

The line slopes down and to the left from this point. All of the points on this left half of the line represent a '''lending portfolio'''. A lending portfolio consists of the market portfolio, plus some risk free government securities. These securities serve to reduce the risk profile of the portfolio, while of course also reducing expected returns. 

The line slopes up and to the right from the point in the middle. Every point on the right half of the line represents a '''borrowing portfolio'''. This shows how an investor can buy the market portfolio, and also borrow money in order to buy more of the market portfolio. Therefore, an investor can hold the same market portfolio and increase his risk and expected return. Notice that the slope of the lending portfolio is less than that of the borrowing portfolio. This is because the rate at which one can borrow money will always be higher than the risk free lending rate.

      <comment>/* Weak squares */  add diagram 39.b4!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The importance of individual squares==
Many amateurs make a mistake in chess. They play for mate, or the win of material, or even the creation of a weak pawn. But many of these amateurs fail to recognize the importance of squares. Seizing squares is just as important as taking pawns, or getting a lead in development, or getting a better minor piece, etc.

==Weak squares==
Weak squares are squares which cannot be defended by a pawn. These weak squares are thus open to occupation by an enemy piece. For White, weak squares can usually be found along the 4th and 3rd ranks, while Black's weak squares are often on the 5th and 6th ranks. One of the qualities of a weak square is that it increases the value of the piece that occupies it. This is especially true for knights, which need advanced support points to be effective.

Let's look at a classic example from the sixth World Champion, Mikhail Botvinnik. At right is the game Botvinnik--Flohr, Moscow 1936. White here played '''33.c5!'''

This move has a manifold purpose. For one thing, it prepares the queenside attack with b3-b4-b5, and more importantly, it clears a route for the knight to d6 via b1-a3-c4-d6. d6 is White's stronghold and Black's weak point. A knight there would be a thorn in Black's side, and he would feel compelled to hack it off, bequeathing on White a strong, protected, passed pawn. '''33...a5''' Black stops the advance of the b-pawn, but the knight maneuver cannot be stopped. '''34.Nb1 Qf8 35.Na3 Bd8 36.Nc4 Bc7 37.Nd6''' The White knight has reached its dream square and dominates the board. Now he has a beautiful position--but what to make of it? Botvinnik gives us an instructive lesson. '''37...Rb8 38.Rb1 Qd8 39.b4!''' So White gets in his advance after all. This is the point--Black can tolerate a knight on d6 by itself. However, by opening a second front against the b-pawn, he forces Black to exchange off the knight on d6, leaving White with a strong, passed pawn. Incidentally, this is another example of the common theme of the principle of two weaknesses. '''39...axb4 40.Rxb4 Bxd6 41.exd6''' And now White gets his passed pawn, plus pressure against the weak pawns on b7 and e6. '''41...Qa5 42.Rdb3 Re8 43.Qe2 Qa8 44.Re3 Kf7''' Here White should play 45.Kg1! to take the sting out of Black's next move, but he still won anyway: '''45.Qc4? b5! 46.Qc2 Rxd6 47.cxd6 c5+ 48.Kh3 cxb4''' Although Black has succeeded in taking off the protector of the d-pawn, it is still a strong passed pawn and White is still winning. '''49.Qc7+ Kg8 50.d7 Rf8 51.Qd6 h6 52.Qxe6+ Kh7 53.Qe8 b3 54.Qxa8 Rxa8 55.axb5 Rd8 56.Rxb3 Rxd7 57.b6''' and Black resigned. The theme of a two-front war held through until the very end--Black was unable to handle both passed pawns at the same time and so capitulated.

==Weak complexes of squares==
Oftentimes, it is not just a single square that is weak. Sometimes, a whole network of same-colored squares can be weak. These weaknesses can be accentuated by the elimination of the bishop that stands on the color of those squares, because that is one less defensive force for those squares. In a practical game situation, this often occurs when a fianchettoed bishop is exchanged on g7, leaving a '''complex of weak dark squares''' on the squares f6-g7-h6, and sometimes the squares f8 and h8. Here is a classic example of such complexes of weak squares.

| '''Rubinstein--Salwe'''
'''Łódź, 1908'''
''Position after Black's 14th move''
|}

This is Rubinstein-Salwe, Łódź, 1908. Black is here ready to rectify the dark-squared holes in his position with 15...Nd7 and 16...c5, therefore '''15.Bc5!''' is necessary. White could then continue blockading the dark squares on the queenside: '''15...Rfe8 16.Rf2 Nd7 17.Bxe7 Rxe7 18.Qd4 Ree8 19.Bf1 Rec8 20.e3 Qb7 21.Nc5 Nxc5 22.Rxc5 Rc7 23.Rfc2''' White has achieved a full blockade of the queenside pawns and the Black pawns are now fixed targets. The dark squares become staging points for the White heavy pieces. Now Black's best was to play 23...a5 to stake out some space of his own. However, Black lost after '''23...Qb6? 24.b4! a6 25.Ra5 Rb8 26.a3 Ra7 27.Rxc6! Qxc6 28.Qxa7''' White won a pawn and soon, the game.

While examining this game I want the reader to realize that not only did Black lose control of the dark squares on the queenside, the weaknesses on them, e.g. d4, c5, a5, and a7, served as strong outposts for White's heavy pieces. On these squares White was able to build up pressure, until something finally cracked and Black lost material. Then, through his pawn advantage, White was able to convert to a win.

==&quot;Empty&quot; square complexes==
Sometimes, the weak square complexes in the center are not so easily visible. Of course, it is pretty easy to see that Black has enormous dark-square holes with a king on g8, pawns on f7, g6, and h7, with a White queen on h6 and a White bishop on b2. However, sometimes the holes are not easily seen and are not really holes. This most usually occurs in the center, a pawn-free, open center. The principles are still the same, though. Take the next example, Tukmakov--Palatnik, Odessa 1970. '''1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.Ne5 e6 7.f3 Bb4 8.Nxc4 Nd5 9.Qd2 c5 10.e4 cxd4 11.Qxd4''' Here is a critical opening moment. Black's two pieces are forked. In addition, the pawn on g7 is hanging. What should he do about it? '''11...0-0!''' Of course! Now the captures open the board for Black's pieces to get to the White king. '''12.exd5 Nc6 13.Qf4 exd5 14.Qxf5 dxc4''' Black has dangerous threats, and the White king is still wide open to Black's rooks. '''15.Kf2 Re8 16.Ne4 Qd4+ 17.Be3 Qxb2+ 18.Be2 Nd4 19.Nf6+!?''' White attempts to regain the initiative. '''19...gxf6 20.Qg4+ Kh8 21.Qxd4 Bc3 22.Qxc4''' Black would seem to be in trouble. He is a piece down, his kingside pawns are ragged, and White has nearly completed his development, but wait--the idea of the dark squares is still alive! '''22...Rxe3!''' A brilliant move that allows the remaining Black pieces to assume the role of custodians of the dark squares. Although there are no pawns to &quot;outline&quot; the dark squares in the center, they are still there! '''23.Kxe3 Re8+ 24.Kf2 Bd4+ 25.Kg3 Qd2!''' A clever little &quot;quiet&quot; move that continues to follow Black's plan of dominating the dark squares. The threat is 26...Rg8+ and 27...Qh6#. '''26.f4 Rxe2 27.Ra3 Rxg2+ 28.Kh3 Rg6 29.Rg3 Rh6+''' and White resigned, because Black has an unstoppable attack on the dark squares and mates after 30.Kg4 f5+ 31.Kxf5 Rf6+ 32.Kg4 Qxf4+ 33.Kh3 Rh6+ 34.Kg2 Qf2#.

==Project==
Currently I am working on a [[Wikibooks:Chess|project about chess]]. I have released (on Wikibooks, at least) my first book, [[Elements of chess strategy]], on 31 May 2008. My next book is called [[Play the Najdorf]] and is about the most popular opening line at the tournament level.

==Journal==

===5 Sept 2008===
Sorry about the long hiatus. I was out on vacation without a computer, so no wikibooks for anyone during the period from 19 July to 30 Aug. I'm starting work immediately.

===17 July 2008===
Part 3 of the ECO series is out on Wikibooks, the codes from C00 to C99. They are the third most-played group of openings in chess, after B00 to B99, which covers the semi-open games (the Sicilian Defence is covered, which would explain the section's popularity), and E00 to E99, which covers the Indian Defences (1.d4 Nf6). ECO is now 60% done.

===15 July 2008===
The ECO index is now about 175,000 bytes of HTML long. This would probably be acceptable if it were finished. However, my math tells me that it is only 40%, or 2/5 finished. This means that the finished index will be over twice that size. Thus, I have moved the B section to a new page and split up the index. Then, I start work on C00--C99, which will also take up its own page.

===12 July 2008===
[[Play the Najdorf]] (which as everyone by now knows is the next book) has again been postponed. In addition, some of the lines may be the main lines, or possibly even tactically sharper than the book lines. That's why I'm writing a book on tactics first, to give the readers of the book a tactical background before studying the opening. It is recommended that the student study both [[Elements of chess strategy|the principles of strategy]] and elementary and intermediate tactics before taking on the Najdorf Sicilian, one of the sharpest of openings.

===27 June 2008===
An extra update on the [[Opening theory in chess/ECO index|ECO index]]--I've just finished typing in what may be the most important section in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. It's [[Chess/ECOB|codes B00 to B99]], and that encompasses a diverse variety of openings, such the likes of the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...d5|Scandinavian Defence]], the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...d6|Pirc Defence]], the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c6|Caro-Kann Defence]], and of course, the [[Opening theory in chess/1. e4/1...c5|Sicilian Defence]]. The page now has over 160,000 bytes of HTML, so some people with [[User:Anonymouse#25 June 2008|certain browsers]] may have trouble editing the page. It's becoming very long.

===25 June 2008===
Today I have finished--and it's quite a large section--[[Opening theory in chess/ECO_index#A|the ECO codes from A00-A99 in the ECO index]]. And let me tell you, I have learned ''a lot'' from typing all of this up. For example, there are more variations in the Dutch Defence than I ever would have expected. Also, the sheer number of opening variations, and how little progress we've made in the Wikibook on [[Opening theory in chess|opening theory in chess]]. MCO-15, for example, analyzes the Modern Benoni, Taimanov Variation, to '''18''' moves in depth. Our Wikibook has only heard of the Modern Benoni in name, and does not even go to move nine in most variations! And if there's one thing that's clearly obvious from this, it's that we are not working hard enough. As the British say, &quot;Let's get cracking!&quot;

===24 June 2008===
I have de-postponed working on the book--you know which one. It seems that the ECO index is longer than I expected (we've done less than 20% of all of the openings of chess theory), so I'm postponing ''that'' until after the book is finished. In fact, it is so long that users of older versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape may have problems editing the page (it's almost 50 kilobytes long). 

Currently, in the book, I am trying to devise new lines and plans. These are to be strategically and tactically simpler than the &quot;book&quot; lines. For example, in the 6.g3 variation of the Najdorf Defence, I came up with '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 cxd4 5.Nxd4 a6 6.g3 e5 7.Nde2 Nbd7 8.Bg2 b5 9.h3 Bb7 10.g4 Nc5 11.Ng3 g6 12.O-O Ne6 13.a3 Rc8 14.Be3 Rc4!?''' The move played before was 14...h5?!, which doesn't look that sound in view of 15.g5 Nfd7 16.Nd5 Be7 17.h4, and White has a lot of space. The idea of my new move is to pressure c4 in a very direct manner. Now after '''15.Qd2 h6 16.Rad1''', Black has '''16...Qa8''' as part of his positional plan to target e4. Then, if '''17.b3''', then simply '''17...Rc7''', followed by doubling on the c-file, with pressure on c2, as opposed to e4. However, even after this Black may get pressure on e4, e.g. '''18.Rdc1 Qc8 19.Nce2 Nc5 20.f3 Ncd7''', with a good game.

That was just a sneak peek at some of the new stuff coming in, say, November? For more details, read the book when it comes out.

===22 June 2008===
Currently I am postponing work on the next book, [[Play the Najdorf]]. This is in part due to the fact that I am currently working on the [[ECO index, which is finished only up to B10 or something. The ECO index encompasses all openings from A00 to E99, so there is still a lot of work to be done!

===13 June 2008===
I have started work on an opening repertoire for [[Play the Najdorf|the next book]]. This involves making a tree of variations. The criteria for the variations I choose are:
::1. Objective soundness.
::2. Ease of recollection.
::3. Limits opponent's options.
::4. Ability to transpose to other variations.
If there are any objections, please comment on [[User talk:Anonymouse|my talk page]]. The variations listed for White will be grouped in this manner:
::1. '''The classical 6.Be2'''
::2. '''The positional 6.g3'''
::3. '''The aggressive 6.Be3/6.f3'''
::4. '''The traditional main line, 6.Bg5'''
::5. '''The sharp 6.f4'''
::6. '''The tactical 6.Bc4'''
::7. '''The prophylactic 6.a4'''
::8. '''The others: 6.h3, 6.Bd3 and 6.Rg1'''


===6 June 2008===
Planning has been started on my next book, [[Play the Najdorf]]. The book will be about the strategic elements involved in playing the Najdorf Sicilian ('''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6''') and the masses of theory involved in playing it. It is recommended that you read my other book, [[Elements of chess strategy]], first, so that you will have a better grasp of the strategic ideas found in the book.

===31 May 2008===
I've finished work on [[Elements of chess strategy]]! The book is about the various strategic elements (IM Jeremy Silman refers to them as ''imbalances'') and how to formulate a plan based on them. It is ten pages long, including the intro page.</text>

      <comment>/* Build you own Maple package */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Maple components ===

Maple has three main components: user interface, kernel and library.

Recent versions of Maple include three user interface executables (for most operating systems), two graphical  user interfaces (GUI): Standard GUI and Classic GUI, and a command-line (character-based) interface.

The Standard GUI is a Java application, while the Classic GUI is a native application.

The kernel (interpreter) deals with Maple's basic features (e.g. elementary data structures, input/output, integer and rational arithmetic, simple
polynomial calculations and elementary simplification). It 
is written in C and C++. It  is loaded in its entirety when a Maple
session is initiated.

The Library contains most of the routines of the system. It is written in the Maple high-level programming language. This is an interpreted language. It is not compiled. Its routines are stored in the .mla archives. Library routines are loaded into the system as required. The modularity of this design allows users to consume computer resources
proportional to the algebraic facilities actually used.

Some numerics are also inplemented in C and C++ and accessed on the fly by Library routines using Maple's external calling mechanism. 

With the exception of the builtin functions, the Maple source code for each
routine may be displayed.

Maple has a comprehensive on-line help facility.

=== Operation ===

Maple appears to the user as an &quot;interactive calculator&quot;.

Input to the Maple system consists of a sequence of statements separated by
the statement separators (semicolon '';'' and colon '':'').
The system operates in an interactive mode,
executing statements as they are entered.

The main program reads input, calls the parser, and then calls the statement
evaluator for each complete statement encountered.

There are eight types of statements in Maple: assignment statement,
expression, read statement, save statement, selection statement, repetition
statement, empty statement and quit statement.

Maple will read an infinite number of statements; its normal conclusion is
achieved by the evaluation (not the parsing) of the quit statement.

The parser and some basic internal functions are responsible for building all
the data structures used internally by Maple.


=== Maple Language ===

The Maple language was designed to be used interactively.

A unifying point of view is that all variables in Maple are programming
variables. The ones that are used as mathematical symbols have as their value
their own name; those used as programming variables have something else
assigned as their value.

The Maple character set consists of letters, digits, and special characters.

The tokens consist of keywords, programming-language operators, strings,
natural integers, and punctuation marks.

Numbers, strings, and names are the simplest objects in Maple.

A natural integer is any sequence of one or more digits. The numeric constants
in Maple (integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers) are formed
from natural integers using programming-language operators. The length of a
natural integer, and hence the length of integers, rational numbers, and
floating point numbers, is arbitrary (that is, the length limit is system
dependent but generally much larger than users will encounter).

==== Names and strings ====

A name is a sequence of characters that can be assigned a value, hence it represents a variable. Any expression can be assigned to a name. If no value has been assigned to the name, then it stands for itself. 

The simplest instance of a name is a letter (a-z, A-Z) followed by zero or more letters, digits (0-9), and underscores (_). Ie. Maple distinguishes between upper and lower case letters. Thus the names 
''pvar'', ''Pvar'', ''PVAR'', ''pVaR'' all refer to different variables. The maximum length of a name is system dependent. On 32-bit platforms, it is 524,271 characters; on 64-bit platforms, it is 34,359,738,335 characters. On 16-bits was  499 characters?

Another instance of a name is the
underscore followed by zero or more letters, digits, and underscores.
Such names  are used as global variable names by Maple and are effectively reserved for use by library code. The exception are names beginning with ''_Env'', considered environment variables.

Some other names are already defined by Maple, either as keywords (e.g. ''if'', ''then'', ''else'', ''do'', ''quit''), as command names (e.g. ''sin'', ''cos'', ''ln'', ''diff'', ''int''), environment variables (e.g. ''Digits'', ''UseHardwareFloats'', ''printlevel'', ''Rounding'') or as pre­defined mathematical constants (e.g. ''Pi'', ''I'', ''GAMMA''). 

Therefore such names should be avoided by the users.

A name may also be formed by enclosing any sequence of characters in a pair of backquote characters (left single quotes) (` `). For example: 

 &gt;`This is a name`;

A string is a sequence of characters that has itself as a fixed value (it cannot be assigned any other value). The maximum length of a string is system-dependent. On 32-bit platforms, it is 268,435,439 characters; on 64-bit platforms, it is 34,359,738,335 characters. 

A string is written by enclosing any sequence of characters within a pair of double quote characters (&quot; &quot;). For example: 

 &gt;&quot;This is a string&quot;;

==== Expressions ====

Expressions are the fundamental entities in the Maple language.

Every Maple expression is kept in a data structure.

A set is a non-ordered collection of expressions. Any valid Maple expression
can be contained in a set.

==== Types and Properties ====

Each object in Maple has a type associated with it.

A type is defined by a domain or a subdomain of computation.

Unassigned names in Maple, since there are no declarations, can represent any
data type.

In Maple, a type is any expression which is recognized by the type function
and causes it to return true from some set of expressions and false otherwise.

A type can be a simple type or a structured type. They can be predefined
within Maple or defined by the user. A simple type is one which is identified
by a single name, while structured types can be composed from simple
types or other structured types. Structured types can also be defined
recursively.

Keep in mind that while you can always query the type of an object, there is
no way in Maple to stipulate that a certain variable will always be of a
certain type.

In general, Maple tries to preserve the type of data.

There is a fundamental difference in Maple between the type of an object,
which generally deals with the kind of data structure the object actually is,
and the properties, which deal with the kind of mathematical object it can
stand for.

There is a distinction between types and properties.  An *object* *has*
types inherent to its nature -- it cannot be given or &quot;assigned&quot; or 
declared to be a type.

A name or symbol can be given properties.  Some objects which are more complicated
than symbols can also be given such properties.  Many properties have names 
that are the same as types.  &quot;float&quot; is a property and a type.  A symbol 
could never be of type float, integer, etc., but it can be assigned that 
property.

==== Operators ====

There are three types of programming-language operators, namely the binary,
unary, and nullary operators.

The Concatenation or ''||'' Operator (formerly dot operator) is a name-forming operator in Maple -- it produces global names.

The ditto operator, ''%'' , which recalls the last result, is local to procedures
but Maple evaluates it fully.

''@'' is the function composition operator.

''@@'' is the repeated function composition operator

==== Evaluation ====

In Maple, statements are normally evaluated as far as possible in the current
enviroment.

Evaluation of an expression in Maple is normally performed in a full,
recursive evaluation mode.

Whether within a procedure or at the interactive level, Maple always applies
the same evaluation rules to global variables. It evaluates all global names
fully, except when (*) the value (*) of such variable is a table or a
procedure, in which case, Maple halts its evaluation at the last name in the
chain of assignments. This evaluation rule is called last-name evaluation.

(*) full evaluation (*)

The main exceptions to the rule of full evaluation are special data structures
like tables, matrices, and procedures, and the behavior of local variables
inside a procedure.

Put simply, enclosing an expression in forward quotes delays evaluation of
that expression for one trip through Maple's parser.

Quoting an expression delays evaluation, but does not prevent automatic
simplifications and arithmetic.

Concatenation generally follows the full evaluation rule except that the
leftmost symbol is not evaluated.

The evaluation of Boolean expressions in Maple uses three-valued logic.

=== Internal Representation ===

In Maple, there is only one instance of each object in memory.

Internally, Maple breaks down each object into logical subobjects, which are
then again broken down into even smaller subobjects, until basic elements are
reached.

Every expression in Maple is represented internally by an expression tree
where each node is a particular data type.

Every structure in Maple is made up of individual parts, or operands, strung
together by various operators.

The structure of an expression can be modeled after a tree. These tree models
are also known as &quot;directed acyclic graphs&quot; or DAGs.

Maple's overall performance is in part achieved by the use of table-based
algorithms for critical functions. Tables are used within the maple kernel in
both evaluation and simplification, as well as less crucial functions. For
simplification, Maple keeps a single copy of each expression or subexpression
within an entire session.

By far, the most important table maintained by the Maple kernel is the
simplification table. The main purpose of this table is to ensure that
simplified expressions have a unique instance in memory. Every expression,
which is entered into Maple or generated internally, is chequed against the
simplification table, and if found, the new expression is discarded and the
old one is used.

Every expression is entered in the simplification table using its signature as
a key. The signature of an expression is a hashing function itself, with one
very important attribute: signatures of trivially equivalent expressions are
equal. If two expressions disagree then the expressions cannot be equal at the
basic level of simplification.

If the signature is found then a full comparison is performed to verify that
it is the same expression.

Also, since the relative order of live objects is preserved during garbage
collection, this means that sequences of objects can be ordered by machine
address.

It is possible to store Maple objects in a sequential file using a
fast-loading internal format.

Arrays and tables are implemented using Maple's internal hash tables. Because
of this, sparse arrays are equally as efficient as dense arrays.


=== Packages ===

A package in Maple is a collection of related functions stored together in the
Maple library.

A package is really a table of functions, and the table-lookup syntaxes
invokes a procedure in the package directly.

A package is simply a table in which the entries are procedures and the
indices are &quot;short forms&quot; for the names of the procedures.

The concept of a package in Maple permits the user to define an entire
collection of new functions with just one Maple command, namely the ''with''
command.

Maple packages load very quickly because, in effect, loading a package
requires nothing more than defining the locations of the new functions in the
library. No code is loaded, but each of the member functions of the package
becomes readlib-defined. (update)
====Build you own Maple package====
To build a Maple package, start with  module,with option  package

 modu:=module();
option package;
...........
...........
..............
end module;

type(modu, package);

          ''true''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maple is a programming language as well as a mathematical system.

Maple, as a programming language, has several attributes common to object
oriented languages. In particular variables and procedure parameters can hold
any valid Maple object. In principle Maple has no declarations, it is up to
the functions and up to the user to enforce typing restrictions.

Maple is a procedural programming language. It also includes a number of functional pro­gramming constructs. Maple is a dynamically typed, interpreted language. Ie 
not strongly typed like C and Pascal. No declarations are required. 

=== Procedures ===

All Maple procedures are functions, in that they are given values or names of
objects as arguments, and return a value as a result.

In Maple, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way numbers or
expressions can be.

One form of Maple function definition consists assigning a programming
variable a ''proc'' expression.

Each variable in a Maple procedure is either a formal parameter, a local
variable or a global variable.

Only two possibilities exist: either a variable is local to the one procedure
which it immediately occurs in, or it is global to the entire Maple session.
Local variables are local only to their own procedure. They are not known in
other procedures, even within procedures which appear within the procedure
which defines them.

If you do not declare your variables to be global or local, Maple decides for
you. If a variable appears on the left-hand side of an explicit assignment,
then Maple assumes that you intend the variable to be local. Otherwise , Maple
assumes than the variable is global to the whole session.

Maple evaluates parameters to zero levels, local variables to one level and
global variables fully, except for last name evaluation.

The standard Maple behavior is that a command does not directly affect the
value of the parameters passed to it.

In terms of traditional parameter passing mechanisms used by various computer
languages, Maple's parameter passing could be termed called by evaluated name.

Maple evaluates the arguments before invoking the procedure. Once, Maple
evaluates the arguments, it replaces all occurrences of the procedure's formal
parameters with the actual arguments. Then Maple invokes the procedure.

When you call a procedure, Maple evaluates the arguments appropriately, given
the context in which the call occurs.

The modest performance penalty incurred by type checking is usually worth the
price because it reduces programming or usage errors.

Maple creates the local variables of a procedure each time you call the
procedure. Thus, local variables are local to a specific invocation of a
procedure.

Local variables are programming variables that are used only during execution
of the procedure, and then discarded.

Local variables are temporary storage places within a procedure.

Global variables are available from inside any procedure in Maple as well as
at the interactive level.

Parameters and local variables in Maple procedures are not subject to aliases.

==== Functional Operators ====

A functional operator in Maple is a special form of a procedure. Functional operators are written using the arrow operator ''-&gt;'': 

 &gt;f := x -&gt; 3*x + 5;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f := x\to 3x+5 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 &gt;f(2);

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;11\; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 &gt;g:=(u,v,w)-&gt;1/u+exp(u+v)+(u-v+w)^2;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;g:=(u,v,w)\rightarrow \frac{1}{u}+{e^{u+v}}+\left (u-v+w\right )^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 &gt;g(2*a,b,3*c);
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2a}+{e^{2\,a+b}}+\left (2\,a-b+3\,c\right )^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Ie.  functional operators are written using the notation  

&lt;center&gt;'''vars -&gt; result'''&lt;/center&gt;

where '''vars''' is a name (the variable), or a sequence of names between brackets (for two or more variables), and '''result''' is an expression (the result of the function acting on the variable(s) '''vars''').

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Running the programme==
When I run this programme:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
mass_kg = int(raw_input(&quot;What is your mass in kilograms?&quot; ))
mass_stone = mass_kg * 2.2 / 14
print &quot;You weigh %d stone.&quot; % mass_stone
&lt;/source&gt;

The output I get is in an integer format. For example:&lt;br&gt;
What is your mass in kilograms?71&lt;br&gt;
You weigh 11 stone.&lt;br&gt;

When I changed the programme to read

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
mass_kg = int(raw_input(&quot;What is your mass in kilograms?&quot; ))
mass_stone = mass_kg * 2.2 / 14
print &quot;You weigh %s stone.&quot; % mass_stone
&lt;/source&gt;

Then I get the long string of numbers after the decimal point:&lt;br&gt;
What is your mass in kilograms?71&lt;br&gt;
You weigh 11.1571428571 stone.&lt;br&gt;

The rest of the suggested changes work well when I make this change. Should the programme say %s or is this some sort of quirk on the computer I am using (an apple mac running OS X)? [[User:Wobble|Wobble]] ([[User talk:Wobble|talk]]) 09:40, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

:&quot;%s&quot; treats the variable ''mass_stone'' as a string rather than a float or integer, when combined with the % operator.  Because of how Python works, it is autocasted from a float.  See the [http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting Python documentation] for more information. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 15:24, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

note from another user: the program terminates too fast. i can't seem to fix it. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:2l0t0k9|2l0t0k9]] ([[User talk:2l0t0k9|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/2l0t0k9|contribs]]) 15:50, 8 February 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: If &quot;terminates too fast&quot; means the window is closing before you can read the output, you're launching it wrong.  Either use an interactive interpreter (such as IDLE), or run it from a command prompt. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 15:24, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

== What am I doing wrong? ==

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
import math
a = int(input(&quot;What is A? &quot;))**2
b = int(input(&quot;What is B? &quot;))**2
c = math.sqrt(a + b)
roundnum = int(input(&quot;To how many decimals? &quot;))
print(&quot;C is &quot; round(c, roundnum) &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
I've tried everyting. It's probably something blatantly obvious.

I believe you forgot the commas in the print command. Correct code is: 
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
print(&quot;C is &quot;, round(c, roundnum), &quot;.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the only move for Black's queen, and so should be self explanatory. Another move, 9...Nxe4? drops a piece not to 10.Nxe4?? Qxb1+ and Black is winning, but 10.Rxb2 Nxd2 11.Kxd2 and White is winning.

Here White has a few choices. The most popular is 10.f5, applying direct pressure to e6. Then Black usually plays 10...Nc6 11.fxe6 fxe6 12.Nxc6 bxc6 13.e5 dxe5 14.Bxf6 gxf6 15.Ne4, when Black's best is 15...Qxa2 (or 15...Be7 16.Be2 h5 17.Rf1!, with a strong attack).

White's other choices are 10.e5 and 10.Bxf6.

      <comment>hierarchy of attribute categories</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Representation clauses ==

&quot;Representation clauses&quot; are renamed to &quot;aspect clauses&quot; since Ada 95 with the Technical Corrigendum 1.[http://www.adaic.com/standards/05aarm/html/defect1.html#8652/0009] So now Ada doesn't only have &quot;representation items&quot; but &quot;operational items&quot; too. As can be read in [http://www.adaic.com/standards/05aarm/html/AA-13-1.html AARM 13.1(1.a.1/1)]:
:''Aspects of representation are intended to refer to properties that need to be known before the compiler can generate code to create or access an entity. For instance, the size of an object needs to be known before the object can be created. Conversely, operational aspects are those that only need to be known before they can be used. For instance, how an object is read from a stream only needs to be known when a stream read is executed. Thus, aspects of representation have stricter rules as to when they can be specified.''
So for example, 'Size and 'Alignment are representation attributes, whereas 'Write and 'External_Tag are operational attributes. So the question is: Should we explain this in the wikibook? The term ''representation clauses'' is far more extended in the Ada community than ''aspect clauses''. In addition, that distinction is just useful for the compiler writers and not for the programmer, so maybe we shouldn't try to explain the distinction. What I propose is to always use the term ''representation clauses'' for simplicity (maybe saying that it is more formally called ''aspect clauses'' once), also creating two categories following the strict terminology to distinguish between &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming/Operational attributes|operational attributes]]&quot; and &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation attributes|representation attributes]]&quot;. &amp;mdash;[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 14:54, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

:I agree with your proposal. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 20:25, 29 May 2008 (UTC)



BTW, I'm trying to create a hierarchy of attribute categories, but in the ARM only a few have specific categories (they usually are just called &quot;attributes&quot;):
*specifiable attributes
**representation attributes
**operational attributes
*primitive-function attributes
*representation-oriented attributes (different from ''representation'' attributes)
*(other...)
This is not really important (it would be more important for an encyclopedia), but instead of creating a category for each group of attributes and another for all the attributes, I think just the categories   &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming/Specifiable attributes|specifiable attributes]]&quot;, &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming/Operational attributes|operational attributes]]&quot; and &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation attributes|representation attributes]]&quot; should be created (the rest are just in the &quot;[[:Category:Ada Programming]]&quot;, like all the other pages of the wikibook, although this can be easily changed in the future if we discover a better method). Maybe we can be more strict in the definition of these aspect attributes in the category page, but stating that this is only important for compiler writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definitions and Overview=

This chapter is all about the science of ecology - how whole communities of living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. Two important points to remember throughout this chapter - the flow of energy through ecological systems and how materials are used and reused within those systems. Before the chapter starts properly, it is necessary to define several terms that you may not be familiar with.

|-
|Habitat
|A place that an organism lives in.
|The habitat of a caterpillar might be inside a leaf.
|-
|Population
|Group of organisms of the same species, in the same place (at the same time), which can interbreed with each other.
|All the oak trees in a wood
|-
|Community
|All the organisms living in a habitat.
|All the organisms in a woodland, including the trees and animals that live in them.
|-
|Ecosystem
|A relatively self-contained, interacting community of organisms, including the environment in which they live and interact with.
|Everything contained within a wood, including energy flowing into the ecosystem (such as sunlight)
|-
|Niche
|The role of an organism in the ecosystem
|An oak tree's niche is to produce carbohydrates and other organic substances, which are used as food for other organisms in the ecosystem.

=Energy Flow=

Every organism requires constant energy to stay alive - it drives many of the chemical reactions that control the metabolism of cells, and if that stops, the cell stops dead. The immediate source of energy for cells is ATP (adenosine triphosphate [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/atp/atp.gif]), and when it is needed it is broken down by hydrolysis and its energy is used for the cells processes.

ATP isn't just freely available indefinitely - it must be created from other organic molecules like the ones we discussed in Chapter 2 - when these molecules are broken down their energy is used to make ATP in the process of '''respiration'''. This leads us to the question, where does the energy in those carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, among others, come from? The process starts all the way back in plants - inside the mesophyll cells of plant leaves, capturing sunlight for energy to drive '''photosynthesis'''. Together with carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil, carbohydrates and other organic chemicals are produced, thus, energy taken from sunlight is converted into chemical energy in, for example, carbohydrate molecules. 

How does it get to us? When we, and other animals eat these plants, we take in the carbohydrates and use them for ATP. Thus, plants that photosynthesis are very important - they are '''producers'''. The '''consumers''', all animals, fungus and many microorganisms consume the organic chemicals created by plants.

=Food Chains =

Food chains are usually diagrammatic representations of the way in which energy flows from producers                      to consumers, and arrows always indicate which way the energy is going (so a plant would have an arrow pointing toward a rabbit for example). The different positions in a food chain is known as the trophic level. A food web is an extension of a food chain - in that it shows the inter relationships between elements of the food chain.

Animals that routinely feed as both primary and higher level consumers, such us the human race, are known as omnivores. They are said to occupy different positions in a food chain depending on what they are eating. In the food web way of showing things, it shows how all energy from the food web goes to a group of organisms known as decomposers. These mostly live in the soil and their role in ecosystems is to feed on detritus (waste material, including dead organisms). They are very important in the nitrogen cycle, more on that later. 


==Energy loss==

As energy moves through the food chain, some of it is lost at every level through heat and a variety of other ways. Of the sunlight that an ecosystem receives, only a small fraction is used in photosynthesis. This is due to sunlight not reaching the leaves, being reflected from the leaves, passing through the leaves without hitting chlorophyll molecules, and the wrong wavelengths of light not being used. Also, energy is lost when it is converted to carbohydrates during photosynthesis. See picture:[http://www.lastfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/enerloss.GIF] 

Once in the plants, the chemical energy can be consumed by primary consumers, but the plant must respire to stay alive, and thus loses at least half of this energy to heat and the process of conversion to ATP do so. Even when the primary consume does eat a plant, there is still more energy loss - not all parts of all plants can be eaten, and even the bits that can be eaten, some cannot be digested. Also, during the digestion, heat may be lost from the consumers digestive system. Similar losses occur all throughout the food chain. See diagram: [http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/gctext/Inquiries/Inquiries_by_Unit/Unit_4a_files/image007.jpg]


==Organic molecule recycling==

As well as energy, organisms require matter for structure within their bodies - for example hydrogen carbon and oxygen. Proteins need nitrogen, and some need sulphur, while phosphorous is an important component of nucleotides. Others needed include magnesium, calcium, iodine and iron. All of these ions pass from one organism to another, being recycled from organism to organism. The example of this you are required to know for Foundation is the nitrogen cycle.

=The Nitrogen Cycle=

Nitrogen, in its molecular form is two nitrogen atoms with a triple covalent bond (N&lt;u&gt;=&lt;/u&gt;) - and this form is very unreactive, and most organisms cannot use it in this form. Despite this, nitrogen is essential for all living organisms, because of its use in both nucleic acids and proteins. Before nitrogen can be used, it must be converted from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a more reactive form, such as ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). This process is known as nitrogen fixation.

                                                     The nitrogen cycle


==Nitrogen Fixation==

===Bacteria===
Only prokaryotes (See Chapter 1) are capable of fixing nitrogen, and one of the best known is a bacterium known as Rhizobium. Rhizobium lives freely in the soil and in the roots of many plants, especially leguminous plants, and when free in the soil its abilities are severely limited, and so the rhizobium and the plant it lives in have a mutalistic relationship - they help each other to help themselves.

When a leguminous plant germinates, the roots produces a protein known as lectin which binds to the poly saccharides on the rhizobium's surface, resulting in the bacteria invading the roots, spreading along the root hairs. They stimulate the plant to form root nodules, in which they live. An enzyme known as nitrogenase helps to catalyse the conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonium ions - and this process requires hydrogen, ATP and anaerobic conditions.The hydrogen is produced as a by-product of NADP, ATP from the metabolism of sucrose by the plant. Anaerobic conditions are maintained again by the plant - by producing a protein known as leghaemoglobin, a molecule with a high affinity for oxygen which uses the oxygen that diffuses into the nodules.

===Atmosphere===

When lightning strikes, the huge amount of energy passing through causes nitrogen molecules to react with oxygen, forming nitrogen oxide. These dissolve in the rain and be carried into the ground, and can become a significant source of fixed nitrogen if there are thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.

===Haber Process===

The Haber process is an industrial process used to create fertiliser - nitrogen and hydrogen gases are reacted to form ammonia and this ammonia is usually converted to ammonium nitrate - the most widely used inorganic fertiliser.

===Use of fixed nitrogen by organisms===

The fixed nitrogen in root nodules, sometimes in combination with other supplys of fixed nitrogen (nitrate ions in the soil, converted to nitrite in the roots, then to ammonia) is used to make amino acids, transported out of the roots into the xylem and distributed to all parts of the plant and used within cells to synthesise proteins.

Animals cannot fix nitrogen, and thus can only use it as part of an organic molecules - our nitrogen comes from protein in our diet. During digestion, amino acids (broken down from proteins), are absorbed by the blood and distributed in the body. Any excess is deanimated in the liver, and excreted in urine.

===Return of nitrate to the soil===

When an organism dies, the group of organisms known as decomposers break the protein in its cells down to amino acids and the nitrogen is released as ammonia into the soil. Ammonia is also put into the soil via excretion - the production of ammonia is known as ammonification. This ammonia is then converted to nitrite, which is then converted to nitrate, by nitrifying bacteria, including Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. These bacteria derive their energy from nitrification, and unlike nitrogen fixation, this can occur in aerobic conditions. Boggy soils are often short of nitrates for these reason - for example troughs in a field.

===Denitrification===
 
These bacteria reverse the process of nitrogen fixation, providing themselves with energy, by converting it back to nitrogen gas, bringing the nitrogen cycle round.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Membranes=

All living cells have something known as a cell membrane. This selectively-permeable membrane controls the exchange of materials, receives hormone messages and is very thin. It can be described as a phospholipid bi-layer - meaning that it is made from phospholipid molecules and has two layers.

==Structure==
[[Image:Fluid Mosaic.svg|right|thumb|A phospholipid bi-layer]]
The phospholipid bi-layer is so thin it can barely even be seen by an electron microscope - a x100,000 magnification is required, and only shows a double black line around 7&amp;nbsp;nm wide. Since we cannot properly see the membrane, we have to take what we know about it and create a model - in this case known as a fluid mosaic model.

===Fluid Mosaic Model===
A diagram of the fluid mosaic model can be seen below. 

Features of the fluid mosaic model;
*The membrane primarily consists of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules. These molecules can move about by diffusion in their own layer.
*Width is about 7&amp;nbsp;nm on average
*Some of the phospholipids are saturated and some are unsaturated. This affects the fluidity of the membrane; an unsaturated membrane means a more fluid membrane. This is due to the kink in unsaturated tails causing the molecules to not sit closely together.
*Phospholipid tails point inwards, facing each other, meaning that inside the membrane it is non-polar hydrophobic.
*The protein molecules within the structure can move around although some are fixed to structures inside the cell and do not move. Also, some of them span the width of the membrane, some are only on the inner layer and some on the outer layer.
*Many proteins and lipids have short carbohydrate chains attached to them, forming glycoproteins and glycolipids.
*Contains cholesterol.

[[Image:Cell membrane detailed diagram en.svg]]

==Components==

The previous section spoke about several components that may be new to you, their structures and roles are below.

===Phospholipids===

Phospholipids have hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, the importance of which should be becoming clear. A phospholipid bi-layer forms the body of the membrane, creating a hydrophobic interior and isolating the cell from the outside environment. Do not forget that organelles within a cell are also often surrounded by a membrane, and this too is a phospholipid membrane.

===Proteins===

Proteins have a variety of functions within membranes. Some membrane proteins are enzymes, catalysing reactions such as the ones in the surface of the cell membrane. However, most are transport proteins, providing hydrophilic channels through the bi-layer for ions and polar molecules to pass through. They are usually specific to a certain ion or molecule. They can control the types of substances that can leave or enter the cell. The membranes of organelles also hold proteins. Can you think of any EG.'s?

===Glycoproteins and Glycolipids===

Lipid and proteins on the cell membrane surface often have short carbohydrate chains protruding out from the cell surface, known as glycolipids and glycoproteins. They form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules surrounding the cell and thus help to stabilise membrane structure. However, more importantly, they are used as receptor molecules, binding with hormones or neurotransmitters to trigger a series of chemical reactions within the cell itself. Using insulin as an example, only some cells within the body (liver, muscles), have receptors for insulin and as such, insulin can be released to the entire body without upsetting anything as any cell without an insulin receptor will not be affected. In this way they make the cell specific.

===Cholesterol===

Cholesterol helps to regulate fluidity of the membrane and also to provide mechanical stability of the membranes - without it cells will burst open as their membranes break. Their hydrophobic regions help to prevent ions or polar molecules inadvertently passing through the membrane.

=Transport=

Transport across the phospholipid bi-layer is regulated, and it is an effective barrier - but exchange is necessary. Methods of exchange are discussed here.

==Diffusion==

'''Diffusion''' is defined as the net motion of a substance from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, 'down a '''concentration gradient''''. 

Factors which affect diffusion;

*How steep the concentration gradient is. 
*Temperature. 
*Surface area. 
*Type of molecule.

Molecules and ions that are small enough can cross membranes easily, regardless of polarity, but large polar molecules such as glucose cannot diffuse through a cell membrane. They can only pass through hydrophilic protein channels - this process is known as '''facilitated diffusion'''. All the factors that affect diffusion affect facilitated diffusion, and an additional one - how many transport proteins are available.

Facilitated diffusion: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Scheme_facilitated_diffusion_in_cell_membrane-en.svg]

==Osmosis==

Osmosis is best described as a special type of diffusion '''involving water molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) only'''. 

See these two diagrams:[http://www.cellprotect.net/osmosis.gif] [http://www.cellprotect.net/osmosis2.gif]

The first diagram is the experiment just set up, the 'before diagram', and as you can see, water is moving from the more dilute substance to the less dilute solution, separated by a partially permeable membrane - down the concentration gradient. The second picture shows the substance after it has been left for a while - there is the same concentration of solute molecules and thus the same concentration of water molecules, this is known as equilibrium. The fact that this is the movement of water molecules alone that has bought about the equilibrium is characteristic of osmosis.

===Water Potential===

The propensity for water molecules to move from one place to another is known as the water potential, and the symbol for water potential is the Greek letter 'psi', Ψ. Water always moves from a area of high water potential to a low water potential area - equilibrium as mentioned before is the equaling of two adjacent (separated by a selectively-permeable membrane) water potentials. Pure water has a water potential of 0, and any solutes make the water potential negative, the degree to which they do called the solute potential.

===Pressure Potential===

Net movement of water from a high to low concentration gradient can be prevented or slowed by increasing the pressure in the low concentration gradient solution, since pressure increases the water potential.

===In plant cells===

Plants have cell walls, and thus pressure potential is especially important - if the volume of the cell increases as a result of water entering the cell via osmosis, the cell starts to push against the cell wall and pressure builds up rapidly. This pressure increases the water potential of the cell so that water stops entering it, creating a 'false-equilibrium' (in that pressure helps it) preventing it from bursting. When a cell is fully inflated it is described as turgid. 

The opposite to turgidity is plasmolysis - when a cell is placed in a concentrated sucrose solution, the cell begins to shrink away from the cell wall, creating a pressure potential of 0, and so the water potential is equal to its solute potential. Eventually cytorrhysis – the complete collapse of the cell wall – can occur. There is no mechanism in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain, but plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a weaker solution . The equivalent process in animal cells is called crenation. The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to diffusion. Plasmolysis is extremely rare in nature.

===In animal cells===

In animal cells however, there is no cell wall, and so if the water potential of the solution around the cell is too high, the cell will swell and burst, but if it is too low, the cell shrivels or shrinks. This is why it s important to keep a constant water potential inside animal bodies.

==Active Transport==

'''Active transport''' is defined as the '''energy-consuming''' transport of molecules or ions across a membrane '''against a concentration gradient''', made possible by transferring energy from respiration. The energy is supplied by ATP, and is used to make the transport protein change its 3-d shape, transferring the molecules or ions across the membrane in the process. Something to note is that cells that do a lot of active transport are likely to have many mitochondrion to provide the energy for it.

It is particularly important in reabsoprtion in the kidneys where certain useful molecules must be reabsorbed into the blood after filtration. In plants it is used to load sugar from photosynthesising cells into the phloem tissue for transport.
Facilitated Diffusion of Ions

Facilitated diffusion of ions takes place through proteins, or assemblies of proteins, embedded in the plasma membrane. These transmembrane proteins form a water-filled channel through which the ion can pass down its concentration gradient.

The transmembrane channels that permit facilitated diffusion can be opened or closed. They are said to be &quot;gated&quot;.
Some types of gated ion channels:

    * ligand-gated
    * mechanically-gated
    * voltage-gated
    * light-gated

Ligand-gated ion channels.
Many ion channels open or close in response to binding a small signaling molecule or &quot;ligand&quot;. Some ion channels are gated by extracellular ligands; some by intracellular ligands. In both cases, the ligand is not the substance that is transported when the channel opens.
External ligands

External ligands (shown here in green) bind to a site on the extracellular side of the channel.

Examples:

    * Acetylcholine (ACh). The binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at certain synapses opens channels that admit Na+ and initiate a nerve impulse or muscle contraction.
    * Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). Binding of GABA at certain synapses — designated GABAA — in the central nervous system admits Cl- ions into the cell and inhibits the creation of a nerve impulse. [More]

Internal ligands

Internal ligands bind to a site on the channel protein exposed to the cytosol.

Examples:

    * &quot;Second messengers&quot;, like cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), regulate channels involved in the initiation of impulses in neurons responding to odors and light respectively.
    * ATP is needed to open the channel that allows chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions out of the cell. This channel is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although the energy liberated by the hydrolysis of ATP is needed to open the channel, this is not an example of active transport; the ions diffuse through the open channel following their concentration gradient.

Mechanically-gated ion channels

Examples:

    * Sound waves bending the cilia-like projections on the hair cells of the inner ear open up ion channels leading to the creation of nerve impulses that the brain interprets as sound. [More]
    * Mechanical deformation of the cells of stretch receptors opens ion channels leading to the creation of nerve impulses. [More]

Voltage-gated ion channels

In so-called &quot;excitable&quot; cells like neurons and muscle cells, some channels open or close in response to changes in the charge (measured in volts) across the plasma membrane.

Example: As an impulse passes down a neuron, the reduction in the voltage opens sodium channels in the adjacent portion of the membrane. This allows the influx of Na+ into the neuron and thus the continuation of the nerve impulse. [More]

Some 7000 sodium ions pass through each channel during the brief period (about 1 millisecond) that it remains open. This was learned by use of the patch clamp technique:

    * A very fine pipette (with an opening of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm) is pressed against the plasma membrane of
    * either an intact cell or
    * the plasma membrane can be pulled away from the cell and the preparation placed in a test solution of desired composition.
    * Current flow through a single ion channel can then be measured. 

Such measurements reveal that each channel is either fully open or fully closed; that is, facilitated diffusion through a single channel is &quot;all-or-none&quot;.

This technique has provided so much valuable information about ion channels that its inventors, Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1991.
Facilitated Diffusion of Molecules

Some small, hydrophilic organic molecules, like sugars, can pass through cell membranes by facilitated diffusion.

Once again, the process requires transmembrane proteins. In some cases, these — like ion channels — form water-filled pores that enable the molecule to pass in (or out) of the membrane following its concentration gradient.

Example: Maltoporin. This homotrimer in the outer membrane of E. coli forms pores that allow the disaccharide maltose and a few related molecules to diffuse into the cell.

Another example: The plasma membrane of human red blood cells contain transmembrane proteins that permit the diffusion of glucose from the blood into the cell.

Note that in all cases of facilitated diffusion through channels, the channels are selective; that is, the structure of the protein admits only certain types of molecules through.

Whether all cases of facilitated diffusion of small molecules use channels is yet to be proven. Perhaps some molecules are passed through the membrane by a conformational change in the shape of the transmembrane protein when it binds the molecule to be transported.
In either case, the interaction between the molecule being transported and its transporter resembles in many ways the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate. Link to a discussion of the energetics of enzyme-substrate interactions.
Active Transport

Active transport is the pumping of molecules or ions through a membrane against their concentration gradient. It requires:

    * a transmembrane protein (usually a complex of them) called a transporter and
    * energy. The source of this energy is ATP. 

The energy of ATP may be used directly or indirectly.

    * Direct Active Transport. Some transporters bind ATP directly and use the energy of its hydrolysis to drive active transport.
    * Indirect Active Transport. Other transporters use the energy already stored in the gradient of a directly-pumped ion. Direct active transport of the ion establishes a concentration gradient. When this is relieved by facilitated diffusion, the energy released can be harnessed to the pumping of some other ion or molecule.

Link to a quantitative analysis of these processes.
Direct Active Transport
1. The Na+/K+ ATPase

The cytosol of animal cells contains a concentration of potassium ions (K+) as much as 20 times higher than that in the extracellular fluid. Conversely, the extracellular fluid contains a concentration of sodium ions (Na+) as much as 10 times greater than that within the cell.

These concentration gradients are established by the active transport of both ions. And, in fact, the same transporter, called the Na+/K+ ATPase, does both jobs. It uses the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP to

    * actively transport 3 Na+ ions out of the cell
    * for each 2 K+ ions pumped into the cell.

This accomplishes several vital functions:

    * It helps establish a net charge across the plasma membrane with the interior of the cell being negatively charged with respect to the exterior. This resting potential prepares nerve and muscle cells for the propagation of action potentials leading to nerve impulses and muscle contraction.
    * The accumulation of sodium ions outside of the cell draws water out of the cell and thus enables it to maintain osmotic balance (otherwise it would swell and burst from the inward diffusion of water).
    * The gradient of sodium ions is harnessed to provide the energy to run several types of indirect pumps.

The crucial roles of the Na+/K+ ATPase are reflected in the fact that almost one-third of all the energy generated by the mitochondria in animal cells is used just to run this pump.
2. The H+/K+ ATPase

The parietal cells of your stomach use this pump to secrete gastric juice. These cells transport protons (H+) from a concentration of about 4 x 10-8 M within the cell to a concentration of about 0.15 M in the gastric juice (giving it a pH close to 1). Small wonder that parietal cells are stuffed with mitochondria and uses huge amounts of energy as they carry out this three-million fold concentration of protons.
3. The Ca2+ ATPases

A Ca2+ ATPase is located in the plasma membrane of all eukaryotic cells. It uses the energy provided by one molecule of ATP to pump one Ca2+ ion out of the cell. The activity of these pumps helps to maintain the ~20,000-fold concentration gradient of Ca2+ between the cytosol (~ 100 nM) and the ECF (~ 20 mM). [More]

In resting skeletal muscle, there is a much higher concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum than in the cytosol. Activation of the muscle fiber allows some of this Ca2+ to pass by facilitated diffusion into the cytosol where it triggers contraction. [Link to discussion].

After contraction, this Ca2+ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is done by another Ca2+ ATPase that uses the energy from each molecule of ATP to pump 2 Ca2+ ions.

Pumps 1. - 3. are designated P-type ion transporters because they use the same basic mechanism: a conformational change in the proteins as they are reversibly phosphorylated by ATP. And all three pumps can be made to run backward. That is, if the pumped ions are allowed to diffuse back through the membrane complex, ATP can be synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate.
4. ABC Transporters
ABC (&quot;ATP-Binding Cassette&quot;) transporters are transmembrane proteins that

    * expose a ligand-binding domain at one surface and a
    * ATP-binding domain at the other surface.

The ligand-binding domain is usually restricted to a single type of molecule.so this is called the phosphilid layer

The ATP bound to its domain provides the energy to pump the ligand across the membrane.

The human genome contains 48 genes for ABC transporters. Some examples:

    * CFTR — the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
    * TAP, the transporter associated with antigen processing. [Discussion]
    * the transporter that liver cells use to pump the salts of bile acids out into the bile.
    * ABC transporters that pump chemotherapeutic drugs out of cancer cells thus reducing their effectiveness. 

ABC transporters must have evolved early in the history of life. The ATP-binding domains in archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryotes all share a homologous structure, the ATP-binding &quot;cassette&quot;.
Indirect Active Transport

Indirect active transport uses the downhill flow of an ion to pump some other molecule or ion against its gradient. The driving ion is usually sodium (Na+) with its gradient established by the Na+/K+ ATPase.
Symport Pumps

In this type of indirect active transport, the driving ion (Na+) and the pumped molecule pass through the membrane pump in the same direction.
Examples:

    * The Na+/glucose transporter. This transmembrane protein allows sodium ions and glucose to enter the cell together. The sodium ions flow down their concentration gradient while the glucose molecules are pumped up theirs. Later the sodium is pumped back out of the cell by the Na+/K+ ATPase.
      External Link
     
      The Na+/glucose transporter is used to actively transport glucose out of the intestine and also out of the kidney tubules and back into the blood.
      The energy relationships for these processes can be quantified. Link to a discussion.

    * All the amino acids can be actively transported, for example
          o out of the kidney tubules and into the blood [Example]
          o the reuptake of Glu from the synapse back into the presynaptic neuron 
      by sodium-driven symport pumps.
    * The Na+/iodide transporter. This symporter pumps iodide ions into the cells of the thyroid gland (for the manufacture of thyroxine) and also into the cells of the mammary gland (to supply the baby's need for iodide).

    * The permease encoded by the lac operon of E. coli that transports lactose into the cell. 

Antiport Pumps

In antiport pumps, the driving ion (again, usually sodium) diffuses through the pump in one direction providing the energy for the active transport of some other molecule or ion in the opposite direction.

Example: Ca2+ ions are pumped out of cells by sodium-driven antiport pumps [Link].
Antiport pumps in the vacuole of some plants harness the outward facilitated diffusion of protons (themselves pumped into the vacuole by a H+ ATPase)

    * to the active inward transport of sodium ions. This sodium/proton antiport pump enables the plant to sequester sodium ions in its vacuole. Transgenic tomato plants that overexpress this sodium/proton antiport pump are able to thrive in saline soils too salty for conventional tomatoes.
    * to the active inward transport of nitrate ions (NO3−).

==Bulk Transport==

Bulk transport can be defined as the movement of large quantities of materials into or out of cells, '''endocytosis''' and '''exocytosis''', respectively.

Exocytosis is the process by which materials are removed from cells - for example the secretion of digestive enzymes, where vesicles from the Golgi apparatus carry the enzymes to the cell surface, bind to it, and release their contents. See: [http://www.linkpublishing.com/exocytosis5.jpg]

Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis and involves the engulfing of the material by the cell to form a small sac inside the cell. The most common form is phagocytosis, performed by phagocytes - an example of which would be white blood cells engulfing bacteria. The second form of endocytosis is pinocytosis, the bulk uptake of liquid, and the human egg cell takes up nutrients from cells that surround it by this method.

=Exchange Surfaces=

This relates to how substances move in and out of whole organisms, using two examples.

==Mammalian Lungs==
[[Image:Alveolus diagram.svg‎|thumb|An alveolus]] 
All mammals need a supply of oxygen to use in respiration - and in mammals the cells that require the oxygen are too far for diffusion to be effective and so they have a specialised gaseous exchange surface, where oxygen can diffuse into the body and carbon dioxide can diffuse out. In humans, this exchange surface is the alveoli in the lungs, and as you can see in the diagram below, each alveolus is tiny but collectively they have a huge surface area, totaling around 70m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an adult. This increases the net rate of diffusion. Alveoli also have extremely thin walls, no more than 0.5 μm thick, directly next to blood capillaries also with very thin cell membranes. This thinness allows diffusion to be extremely speedy.

Since diffusion only works down a concentration gradient, and the steeper said concentration gradient, the faster diffusion, the concentration gradient between the alveoli and the blood must be kept steep constantly to ensure speedy diffusion. Carbon dioxide is rapidly breathed out, meaning that carbon dioxide transported to the alveoli will be quickly transported into them and breathed out, and deoxygenated blood is constantly kept coming to the alveoli, meaning that oxygen diffuses into it quickly. 

See picture: [http://thegreenie.googlepages.com/Gaseousexchange.PNG]

==Plant Roots==

Root hairs of a flowering plant are also specialised exchange surfaces - they are extensions of the cells that make up the epidermis of a root, and are each around 200-250μm across, providing an enormous total surface area that is in contact with the soil surrounding the root. Both water and mineral ions are absorbed by diffusion and facilitated diffusion/active transport respectively.

Hi! My name is Daiva, and I joined the ODU course to complete my licensure requirements. Eighteen years ago I came to U.S. from Lithuania - one of the three Baltic States, situated on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea across from Scandinavia. I have MA in Linguistics, and taught English Language and Literature while living there.

Today I am an elementary school ESL teacher in Warrenton, Virginia. I absolutely love teaching these youngest of our English language learners! Being not a native English speaker myself I believe I understand well the confusions and difficulties my students are facing in daily acquisition of their new language. Previously in my teaching career I dealt mostly with college students, military and private individuals. However, nothing compares to the delight of working with elementary age children (ESL instruction covers grades 1 through 5). This is what Dr. Montessori calls “the sponge mind” stage of human development, where our higher level thinking takes root, and the foundations for academic mentality are instilled – harvest time for educators: talk about instant rewards!  

Since I myself came from a country devastated by the totalitarian regime, I am a determined opponent of the one size fits all approach in education. United States, like no other country on the face of the earth, was established not by the people with common territory, one language and same traditions, but by individuals with common ideals and common structure of believes. Respect and protection of individuals rights, not crowd convictions is the core of America. So, ideally, in my mind, educators should aspire towards individualized, custom tailored instruction, which, by the way, is quite a risky and way much more demanding endeavor in comparison to “what’s good for the most will have to do for you too” method. 
Instead of distancing myself from my captive audience, and just delivering the product, I focus my energies primarily to develop personal relationships with the students. Ultimately, it all boils down to an undeniable practicality – education is an extremely personal and delicate aspect of human interaction. 

I truly love my kids. All of them: the more talented and better mannered, with courageous aspirations for their future, as much as those with nearly untraceable signs of self-esteem, often carrying on their shoulders unsightly consequences of generational ignorance. It would be misleading to think that the purpose of education is to merely deliver the academic content. Education affects a student as a whole. Teachers are there to demonstrate respect to our young, as well as belief in their potential. We have the privilege to convince them that mistakes produce maturity and expand knowledge, to teach them to stick out from the crowd, and to question ideas and authority. Educators have the undeniable influence to instill in their students confidence to embrace life with perseverance and gusto. The challenge is ours. Each of us decides individually if we are willing and equipped to take it on. Aristotle warned us a while ago “The fate of empires depends upon education of the youth”. Good luck to all of us!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing MySQL ==
=== All in one solutions ===
As MySQL alone isn't enough to run a real database server, the more practical way to install it is to deploy an [[w:List of Apache–MySQL–PHP packages|all in one pack]] in this purpose, including all the needed additional elements: [[Apache]] and [[PHP_Programming/Setup_and_Installation|PHP]].
# On Windows: [[w:XAMP|XAMP]], [[w:WAMP|WAMP]], or [[w:EasyPHP|EasyPHP]].
# On Linux: XAMP or [[w:LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]].

=== Single installation ===
''This guide is written from the perspective of using the Linux Shell with Ubuntu and apt-get''[http://www.zolved.com/synapse/view_content/27986/How_to_install_MySQL_On_Ubuntu].

&lt;u&gt;If you want to solely use the Terminal&lt;/u&gt;:

Make sure you have the MySQL Client and Server installed.

(Just to be safe.)

&lt;pre&gt;apt-get install mysql-client mysql-client-5.0 mysql-server mysql-server-5.0&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;u&gt;About the MySQL package:&lt;/u&gt;

[http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tutorials/sql/mysql_database_introduction_mysql_beginners_tutorial.php3]


&lt;u&gt;Having a secure installation&lt;/u&gt;:

If all your answers are &quot;yes&quot; to what follows, this cleans up your installation, forces you to set a root password, asks you to test for anonymous users and makes your database internal.

Just be careful. Be sure that you are configuring MySQL to the specifications you want.

Here's the code:

&lt;pre&gt;mysql_secure_installation&lt;/pre&gt;

== Creating your own MySQL account and database: ==
Now that MySQL is installed, you wouldn't necessarily have your own account, so you have to log in as root.

To do this type:

&lt;pre&gt;sudo mysql -u root -p&lt;/pre&gt; (This means that you're logging on as the user &quot;root&quot; ('''-u root''') and that you're requesting the password for &quot;root&quot; ('''-p''') )


Once you've managed to log in, your command-line should look like this: '''mysql&gt;'''



By the way, if your command-line ends up looking like this: '''-&gt;'''          theres an explanation behind it.

In MySQL each command you do has to end with ''';'''    . This way it knows that everything behind ''';''' is a command.

So to get out of there, simply type ''';'''    There will be more on this later.



Now you can check what databases (if any) are available to your user (in this case &quot;root&quot; ): &lt;pre&gt;show databases;&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's get straight to the chase and create our own database. Let's call it '''people'''. While we're doing this we can also create our own user account. Two birds with one stone.

So first create the database: &lt;pre&gt;create database people; &lt;/pre&gt;

(NOTE: in this particular case, you have to be &quot;root&quot; to create new databases.)


Now we want to grant ( '''GRANT''' ) all user rights ( '''ALL''' ) from ( '''ON''' ) the entire ( '''*''' ) '''people''' database to ( '''TO''' ) your account ( ''yourusername'''''@localhost''' ) with your user password being ''stuffedpoodle'' ( '''IDENTIFIED BY &quot;stuffedpoodle&quot;''' ).


So we'd input this as: &lt;pre&gt;GRANT ALL ON people.* TO yourusername@localhost IDENTIFIED BY &quot;stuffedpoodle&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;

Tada! You now have your own user account. Let's say you chose '''ted''' as your username. You've configured MySQL to say that '''ted''' can play around with the '''people''' database in whatever ways he wishes.


Now get out of MySQL by typing &lt;pre&gt;exit&lt;/pre&gt;

To start working with the '''people''' database, you can now login as '''ted''': &lt;pre&gt;mysql -u ted -p&lt;/pre&gt;

== Creating tables with information in your database: ==
In MySQL information is stored in tables. Tables contain columns and rows.

'''Ted''' has now created a '''people''' database. So we want now to enter some information into a table.

Login as '''ted'''.

Firstly, we need to make sure we're working with the '''people''' database. So typing: &lt;pre&gt; select database(); &lt;/pre&gt; will show you what database your currently using. You should see a '''NULL''' , meaning that your working with nothing at the moment.


So to start using the people database, type: &lt;pre&gt;\u people&lt;/pre&gt;

(NOTICE: Typing: '''USE people''' OR logging in as '''mysql people -u ted -p''' is also acceptable.)


So how to create a table.

Keep in mind that we need to set all the column values (like surname, age etc.).


Now, remember that annoying '''-&gt;''' symbol? MySQL reads your command as just one command, not a series. So, '''-&gt;''' enables you to enter your inputs in a nicer way than just writing everything on one line.
(NOTE: The problem with this method is that if you screw up on a line and press ENTER to go to the next line, you can't go back and fix your mistake. That's why a nice way to do this is using something like ''SciTE Text Editor'' (set language to '''SQL''') to write your code and just copy/paste that into the shell.)

Another thing is that you must separate your lines with ''',''' at the end of each line except when you've written your two last lines. On the second to last line, '''don't''' add ''',''' and the last line always ends with ''';'''  .



First I have to explain a few things so you're not blown away by an unfamiliar bunch of code.

If you don't know, we use brackets '''()''' to '''encapsulate''' code. (Often called ''parenthesis'').

The first thing we will be writing after the '''CREATE TABLE ''tableName''''' and the first bracket will be the ''database ID'' number(we use integers [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer]) of each person, mainly known as the '''Primary Key'''. It's kinda like a passport ID number. Each number is unique to its owner and it has to be to prevent duplication and imposters. 

Now, any variable in SQL is created as &lt;pre&gt; variableNAME variableTYPE otherVariableAttributes&lt;/pre&gt; . So in order to '''define''' the Primary Key variable, we need to type for example: 

'''peopleID'''(variableNAME) '''int'''(variableTYPE - short for &quot;integer&quot;) '''unsigned'''(means we want our integer value to always be a positive number) '''not null'''(we want each row to have a value, so obviously the value can't be empty(NULL) ) '''auto_increment'''(this ensures that each new row that is created will be a unique value) '''primary key'''(we are saying that this particular variable will be our Primary Key for this Table.)''',''' (a reminder that the ''',''' symbol indicates the end of this line so MySQL knows to go to the next line)

You already know about the '''int''' variable. There is another which is kinda like ''String'' (for example: if you've programmed in Java before). It's called '''varchar''' which stands for ''variable characters''. You set the amount of characters someone is able to input into a '''varchar''' variable. Like this: '''nameOfFattestMooseAlive varchar(30)''' So '''nameOfFattestMooseAlive''' can have a maximum of 30 characters.



Okay, so let's see an example of how to create a table relating to the '''people''' database:

&lt;pre&gt;
CREATE TABLE peopleInfo

(

peopleID int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,

firstName varchar(30),

lastName varchar(30),

age int,

gender varchar(13)

);
&lt;/pre&gt;
Just a note that I set the maximum value of '''gender''' to 13 because &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; has 13 characters. :)


Now you can type: '''CREATE TABLE peopleInfo''' and press ENTER if you'd like to start '''-&gt;''' and write the rest of the code or you can use SCITE and copy/paste it into your shell.


Great. We now completed our first Table.

&lt;u&gt;Now comes the part when we have to get some actual people into our '''peopleInfo''' Table.&lt;/u&gt;


Since your already using the '''people''' database, you can type &lt;pre&gt;show tables;&lt;/pre&gt; to see what tables are currently in your database.

To see the ''properties'' of your table type: &lt;pre&gt;describe peopleInfo;&lt;/pre&gt;


So, how to fill in our '''peopleInfo''' table with people...

This is done by telling MySQL '''what''' ''rows'' you are filling in and the '''actual information/data''' you want to fill in.

So we want to '''insert into''' our table (specifying the rows) and inputting the '''values'''(actual data) that we want.
(NOTE: We are not filling in the primary key.)


To create our first person you would type this:
&lt;pre&gt;
INSERT INTO peopleInfo

(firstName, lastName, age, gender)

values

(&quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Harper&quot;, 17, &quot;male&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;


Great. Now if you want to printout to the screen all the information about your table, type: &lt;pre&gt;select * from peopleInfo;&lt;/pre&gt;
and there you have it. Your table now has one person stored in it.

&lt;u&gt;
Inserting lots of information into your table:&lt;/u&gt;

A brief point that shall be covered later, MySQL backs-up itself in .sql files. The reason this is smart is because it backs-up the actual code inside the text file.


Keeping this in mind, let's say we want to add 10 other people into your peopleInfo table. It would be one hell of a hassle typing each person into existence. What if there were a 1000?


So I've graciously typed out the code of filling in 10 other people to a database. :) Create a blank .txt file and copy/paste this information into it, saving it as '''tenPeople.sql''' .
&lt;pre&gt;
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Jones&quot;, 21, &quot;female&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;Harrington&quot;, 19, &quot;female&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Mill&quot;, 26, &quot;male&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Alfred&quot;, &quot;Jinks&quot;, 23, &quot;male&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Sandra&quot;, &quot;Tussel&quot;, 31, &quot;female&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Habraha&quot;, 45, &quot;male&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Murry&quot;, 22, &quot;male&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Jake&quot;, &quot;Mechowsky&quot;, 34, &quot;male&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Hobrah&quot;, &quot;Hinbrah&quot;, 24, &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;);
INSERT INTO peopleInfo (firstName, lastName, age, gender) values (&quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;, 17, &quot;female&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Excellent. Now we want to get all these people in our table.
'''exit''' MySQL and go to the directory where you saved the '''tenPeople.sql''' file.

Once there, to get all the the data into your database, type: &lt;pre&gt;mysql -u ted -p people &lt;tenPeople.sql&lt;/pre&gt; and enter your password.

Now log into MySQL and remember to select the database your using. '''\u people'''

Now check again what information you have. There ya go.

== Manipulating your database: ==


Now that we have a database full of people. We can display that information anyway we want.
A brief example would be &lt;pre&gt;select firstName, lastName, gender from peopleInfo;&lt;/pre&gt; This would display to the screen only peoples name, surname and gender. You've not specified that you want peoples Database ID Number or Age to be displayed. And the great thing is you can choose whatever you want from the database to be displayed.

Now, if you want to delete your table, simply type: &lt;pre&gt;drop table peopleInfo;&lt;/pre&gt;


Extra conditions:

You can also you extra conditions (filters) through when displaying data. &lt;pre&gt;select * from peopleInfo where gender = 'female';&lt;/pre&gt; will display everyone who is female.

(NOTE: letters are enclosed with ''' ' ''' while numbers are plain.)

You can also compare numbers. For example: &lt;pre&gt;select * from peopleInfo where age &gt; 17;&lt;/pre&gt; will show everyone in your table who is older than 17.

Little index here:
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;   greater than
&lt;   less than
&gt;=  greater or equal to
&lt;=  less than or equal to
&lt;&gt;  not equal to
&lt;/pre&gt;


Let's say we wanted to display all people whose first names began with the letter &quot;j&quot;. We would use the LIKE condition. (Makes sense, is your name LIKE the letter &quot;j&quot;, well it start with j so yes. :) )

About the LIKE condition.

[http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tutorials/sql/mysql_reference_guide_pattern_matching_with_text_data.php3]
&lt;pre&gt;select * from peopleInfo where firstName LIKE &quot;j%&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;

(NOTE: LIKE 's evil opposite cousin is NOT LIKE)



== Backing up and restoring your MySQL database: ==

There is a function called '''mysqldump'''. This is a way to backup your database.

Remember how you managed to get information into your database from '''tenPeople.sql'''? Well that's how you restore information to a database.

(In this particular case you gotta make sure that in your database you have a table called &quot;peopleInfo&quot;)


Now...

To backup your database (in this case backup the '''people''' database):

We first have to create the .txt file that we will be backing it up to. Open a blank .txt file and save it as '''backupfile.sql''' .

Now we can type: &lt;pre&gt;mysqldump -u ted -p people &gt; backupfile.sql&lt;/pre&gt;

Congratulations. You have now backuped your people''' database.'''


&lt;b&gt;WARNING!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; is one of the worst ways to backup production databases for the following reasons:
* it will take quite a lot of time to dump data
* even more time to restore. Depends on datasize, it can be counted in days!
* locking problem with MyISAM tables or mixed environment

Better solutions are based on binary copy. It allows you to perform non-locking, consistent backups.

For MyISAM or mixed environment:
* LVM snapshots

For InnoDB:
* LVM snapshots
* ZFS snapshots (for Solaris systems)
* InnoDB Hot Backup
* XtraBackup (similar to InnoDB Hot Backup but free)

Hey! I really agree with your philosophies for teaching. I also feel that teaching should be more hands on instead of just reading about things. Hands on work is a way to peak the student's interest and make them want to learn even more. I also agree with you when it comes to how to treat each student individually. No two students are the same, and they shouldn't be treated as if they are. They should feel like they all are unique with their own opinions, and should not be afraid to express them. Way to go!

I do agree that education is the realm of relationships!  A successful teacher has to be seen by the students as a whole complete human person: being just a skilled instructor in your field won't cut it. Once they know you are real, they pay back in kind - just watch out and enjoy!

I am glad that someone also understand the idea that not all children are exactly the same. Being able to have childern come to you as a mentor is wonderful. To me that is what the education system is all about. We are here to coach the childern towards one common goal. You also realize that childern are not a pile of clay that needs molding, they are already sent to us molded. Us as educators have to send them in the correct direction

[[User:Abcallahan|Abcallahan]] ([[User talk:Abcallahan|talk]])

Greetings,
Thank you for completing a constructive review on the article on NCLB. I thought it was especially helpful that you pasted the entire article and noted needed changes. I noticed that you left the areas of rubric bolded from my example. You indicated your own ratings and explanantion underneath which was very helpful but I thought the bolded remanants might be confusing. Perhaps you could go back and remove the bolding? Thanks for your hard work. [[User:Jenniferjkidd|Jenniferjkidd]] ([[User talk:Jenniferjkidd|talk]]) 18:40, 9 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

== [[Cookbook:Chicken Brown Rice Soup]] ==

You'll notice that I've made quite a few edits to the recipe you recently wrote.  Hope you don't mind!  I have fixed a bit of the formatting so that it fits in with other Cookbook recipes and added the recipe to categories so that people can find the recipe more easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The soul of the game==
In every chess primer, there seems to be one bit of wisdom that is quoted over and over again. This is the quote by the French master [[wikipedia:Andre Philidor|Philidor]], who said, two hundred and fifty years ago, &quot;Pawns are the soul of chess.&quot; But what does it mean? GM Andrew Soltis expresses everyone's feelings in his excellent book, &lt;u&gt;Pawn Structure Chess&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;There always used to be one bit of advice that was always fobbed off by the authors. 'As Andre Philidor once said, the pawns are the soul of the game.' 'Great,' I'd say to myself every time I read this. 'A Frenchman who's been dead for two hundred years is saying I shouldn't worry about losing my queen or being checkmated. I should be worried about pawns.'&quot;

He then goes on to explain why pawns are so important in chess strategy. The answer is simple. Pawns are very immobile, almost motionless for the majority of the game. But it is this immobility that gives the position its character. The pawn structure lays out the terrain for the coming battle, providing lines for your army. &lt;u&gt;Pawn Structure Chess&lt;/u&gt; is more about characteristic, specific structures that can arise from certain openings and the basic plans for each side. However, we are not going to go so in-depth in this book.

==&quot;Weak&quot; pawns==
Often the amateur will cringe in horror when noticing &quot;weak&quot; pawns. They notice the doubled pawns on c3 and c2 and immediately favor the other side. This is not right! Chess is a game of dynamics. While &quot;textbook weak&quot;, &quot;weak&quot; pawns may not really be weak and in fact may offer dynamic chances for one side or another! To illustrate this point, let's look at a generalized example, Hammie--Silman, San Francisco 1975. '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6''' The popular Accelerated Dragon. '''5.Nc3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Bc4 Qa5 8.O-O O-O 9.Nb3 Qc7 10.f4 d6 11.Be2 b6 12.Bf3 Bb7 13.Rf2''' (diagram)

'''San Francisco, 1975'''
''Position after White's 13th move''
|}

Black is cramped. He would like to get his natural play on the queenside (since that is usually where Black plays in the Sicilian), but it seems that White's knights are hampering him. So, what does he play? '''13...Na5!''' Black is willing to accept doubled pawns in exchange for dynamic play on the queenside. In this case, the pawns cannot be easily attacked, so what's the big deal? However, the challenging reader may ask, &quot;What's so great about the doubled, isolated pawns? Did they play a part in the fight?&quot; Silman gives us an instructive lesson. '''14.Nxa5 bxa5 15.Bd4 Nd7 16.Nd5 Bxd5 17.exd5 Bxd4 18.Qxd4 Qc5!''' Black wishes to trade queens, because then White will be deprived of any counterplay on the kingside. '''19.Rd1 Rab8 20.c4 Rb7!''' Black eventually won. Now suppose, for instructional purposes, the game went on: '''21.Qxc5 Nxc5 22.b3 Rb4 23.Rb2 Rab8 24.Rab1 Kf8 25.g3'''. The sharp reader might be saying that the doubled pawns did not actually give Black the advantage; it was the open b-file. He would be proved wrong after '''25...a4! 26.Bd1 a3!''' The typical idea is to take on b3 and advance the other pawn. However, another equally strong idea is available in the position. '''27.Rc2 a5 28.Rc3 a4''' Now we see the point--after ...axb3 axb3, the &quot;weak&quot; pawn on a3 has been turned into a powerful passed pawn.

==The different types of structure==
These structures have dynamism to them; they can be classified as either good or bad.

===Doubled pawns===
Doubled pawns are most commonly seen on c2-c3, f2-f3, c6-c7, or f7-f6. This occurs when a bishop exchanges itself for a knight on one of those natural developing squares. Doubled pawns are not always weak. However, it is true that the flexibility of a pair of pawns is significantly decreased if they are doubled. Let's look at a line in the Nimzo-Indian Defense: '''1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3''' White has doubled pawns now. The pawn on c3 is safe from harm, but the pawn on c4 is a target for Black's pieces. Or, in a famous game from their 1972 World Championship match, between Spassky and Fischer, the doubled pawns ensured that White's queenside play was shut down and Black could freely proceed on the kingside. He eventually won.

===The isolani===
When we talk about an isolated pawn we are usually speaking of a d-pawn. This IQP (Isolated Queen's Pawn) formation usually occurs in the Queen's Gambit. The main negative of an isolated pawn is that it itself is weak and has no neighboring pawns to guard it. In addition, the square in front of an isolated pawn becomes an excellent outpost for a knight, since there are no neighboring pawns to kick out the rude knight.

However, isolated pawns have their pluses, too. An isolated queen pawn, especially, has additional pluses. Isolated queen pawns stake out a slight central space advantage, give its owner play down the open c- and e-files, and provide chances for a dynamic attack. The sacrifice on d5 of a pawn on d4 is the same as converting potential energy into kinetic energy. Let's look at an example.

| '''Keene--Miles'''
'''Hastings, 1975-76'''
''Position after Black's 10th move''
|}

This is Keene--Miles, Hastings 1975. White has an isolated queen pawn. However, Black has no really great way to make use of this fact. '''11.Bg5''' Note that Black cannot take on d4 because of 11...Nxd4 12.Nxd4 Qxd4 13.Bxh7+ winning the queen. '''11...Nb4?!''' Black should have taken time to develop his bishop. '''12.Bb1 b6 13.Ne5''' The e5-outpost is another benefit that is derived from the isolated d-pawn. '''13...Bb7 14.Re3!''' White plays for mate. He must play actively, lest the pawn on d4 becomes a problem for him. '''14...g6 15.Rg3 Rc8?''' Black does not sense the danger. Instead, he plays a move which wastes time. According to Keene, Black should have sacrificed the Exchange with 15...Nc6 16.Bh6 Qxd4! 17.Qxd4 Nxd4 18.Bxf8 Kxf8, with only a slight advantage to White. '''16.Bh6 Re8 17.a3 Nc6''' Now a series of sacrifices tear apart the Black king. '''18.Nxg6! hxg6 19.Bxg6! fxg6 20.Qb1! Ne5 21.dxe5 Ne4 22.Nxe4 Kh7 23.Nf6+ Kh8 24.Bg7+! Kxg7 25.Qxg6+''' with mate to follow.

As you can see, this was not a really great example of the &quot;weakness&quot; of the isolated queen pawn. Instead, it was a perfect illustration of the active piece play that such an isolani gives its opponent.

===Other isolated pawns===
Isolated pawns are not always on d4. Sometimes Black has them on d6, which makes the weakness look even bigger than usual because now White has an outpost on d5, not d4--which is even further advanced then the post given to White in a normal IQP position. However, these pawns have their pluses, too. d5 is more easily guarded by Black pieces, so a White knight will find it hard to occupy without being exchanged. For example, d5 in the Najdorf Sicilian is usually guarded by a knight on f6, a bishop on e6, and occasionally, a knight on b6. A d6-pawn also covers the important e5- and c5-squares.

===Hanging pawns and the isolated pawn couple===
A structure that can easily derive from the IQP is what Nimzowitsch dubbed &quot;the isolated pawn couple&quot;, with pawns on c3 and d4. A formation like this gives the second player good outposts on the squares in front of the isolated pawn couple (for an example, refer back to Rubinstein--Salwe, Łódź 1908). However, this is not the whole story. These pawns have the potential to become &quot;hanging pawns&quot;, on c4 and d4. In addition, the pawn on d4 is no longer weak with the c-pawn there, and White still gets his kingside chances as in the IQP.

Hanging pawns on c4 and d4 are very hard to evaluate. Nimzowitsch once said that the hanging pawns must be advanced, but most players advance it either too early or too late, that the human consciousness is not used to the idea of &quot;being in the air&quot;. In addition, the advance of either pawn leaves weak squares in its wake. Either way, the hanging pawns on c4 and d4 gain space, but are subject to pummeling down the open c- and d-files. Let's look at an example.

| '''Ogaard--Flesch'''
'''Hastings, 1975-76'''
''Position after White's 16th move''
|}
 
Black is playing against the hanging pawns, which take away the knights' posts on c5, d5, and e5. If he could get one to advance he would have nice outposts for his knights. Therefore, he plays '''16...e5!''' This forces the d-pawn to leave. '''17.Be3 exd4 18.Bxd4 Ne5 19.Qf5 Nxd3''' Now Black eliminates White's bishop pair advantage. '''20.Qxd3 Rfd8 21.Qc3 Ne4''' Heading for c5. It's clear that Black has taken the upper hand. '''22.Qb2 Nc5 23.Qc3 Ne6''' Black's nimble knight dominates the clearly worse bishop on d2. '''24.Be3 Rd6 25.Rc2 Qd7 26.Qb4 Rd3 27.a4''' It may seem as if White has made progress. He is about to play a4-a5 when Black's queenside is weak. However, Black gets a strong attack on White's king by marching forward his f-pawn. The knight on e6 is also useful in this respect, guarding f4. '''27...f5 28.g3 f4 29.gxf4 Nd4! 30.Bxd4 Qg4+ 31.Kh1 Qf3+ 32.Kg1 Rc6!''' Lifting the rook to assist in the devastation. '''33.f5 Rxd4 34.h3 Rg4+!''', and White had to resign (35.hxg4 Qxg4+ 36.Kh2 Rh6#, checkmate). 

Note how masterfully Black played against the hanging pawns. First he isolated one, then eliminated the advantage of two bishops. With White advancing on the queenside, Black was able to launch a successful attack on a weakened White king while White's forces were distracted on the queenside. Eventually Black converted his structural and minor piece advantage into victory.

===Backward pawns===
A backward pawn is a pawn whose neighbors have advanced ahead of it and cannot advance. In the past, backward pawns were always looked down upon as weaknesses. However, today they are considered an intrinsic part of modern opening theory. For example, in the 6.Be2 variation of the Najdorf Sicilian, Black often accepts a backward pawn on d6 after the moves '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Be2 e5!''' Black voluntarily takes a backward pawn on d6. Although the knight will move, Black's pawn on e5 controls d4 and f4 and also blockades e4, giving Black pressure there. In addition, Black is also threatening to play the thematic ...d6-d5 at any moment in the game, giving White something to worry about. The move ...e7-e5 also kicks back the White knight to a less enticing square.

However, backward pawns can be weak. Specifically, although the pawn itself may be easily defensible, the square in front of it is a tasty outpost for the enemy pieces, especially a knight. Also, due to its inability to advance, the backward pawn is an easy target for heavy pieces. At right is the game Unzicker--Taimanov, Stockholm 1952.

''Position after White's 13th move''
|}

White has just played '''13.b3?''', a move which weakens the knight on c3 and thus, the pawn on e4. This is the kind of pressure I was talking about earlier--if Black can line up his queen and bishop to target e4, White will be forced to defend passively to preserve material equality. Black also has a backward pawn. However, it can hardly be considered a weakness, since it is securely defended by a bishop and queen, while White cannot muster enough force to take the pawn. Nor can he move his knight to d5, since then Black would take it, retreat his knight to b8, advance the kingside pawns, redeploy his knight to f6, and have good kingside chances due to his space advantage in that area and active bishop pointing in that direction. So in this position Black played '''13...Rc8 14.Bb2 Rc7!''' A multi-purpose move. The first purpose is to gang up on the c3-knight with ...Rf8-c8, after Black moves his queen to a8 to target the e4-pawn. '''15.Nb1 Qa8 16.Nbd2 Ne8!''' (&lt;-- I think Nd8 ?????)Black redirects his knight to e6, where it can choose from c5 and f4 as squares. In addition, Black has opened the long, light diagonal for his queen-and-bishop battery, and opened the c-file for his rooks. '''17.Bd3 Ne6 18.Rc1 Rfc8 19.Nh2 Nd7 20.Nhf1 Ndc5 21.Ng3 g6''' White was aiming for f5, where he would exert pressure on d6 and its only defender, the bishop on e7. '''22.Ne2 Bg5!''' After ''22...Nxe4 23.Nxe4 Bxe4 24.Bxe4 Qxe4 25.Nc3'' White has lost a pawn, but he has gained use of d5 and e4 as outposts. Black's move is stronger, keeping White tied down. '''23.Nc3 Nd4 24.Ncb1 d5!''' Breaking open the center and exposing White's confused pieces. All of Black's pieces are active. '''25.exd5 Nxd3 26.cxd3 Rxc1 27.Bxc1 Bxd5 28.f3 Rc2 29.a4''' If ''29.Rxe5? Qc6 30.Re1 Rxc1 31.Rxc1 Qxc1 32.Qxc1 Ne2+'' and Black wins. '''29...b4 30.Kh1 Qc6''' and White resigned! He has no good way to prevent ...Nxb3.

So the backward pawn was not really &quot;bad&quot;, but what good did it do for Black's position? For one thing, it protected e5 for a while. Second, without the backward pawn on d6, Black would never have been able to force in the line-opening 24...d5!. The result of the game depended on this advance--without it, Black could not have broken through. The reason this advance was so effective is that White's pieces were confused and passive. There was no way to get to them except through the center. After the center was open, White's ranks were in chaos ''and'' they were subject to attack by Black's active, well-coordinated army. As any general knows, this is a recipe for disaster.

===Passed pawns===
Most players think passed pawns are always good. In the endgame, this is certainly true. However, this is sometimes not true, especially in the middlegame. Passed pawns can get in the way of their own pieces and become a bottleneck. This is especially true when a knight blockades it. Knights are excellent blockading pieces because, although relegated to the role of defensive barricade, their ability to jump over pieces allows them to exert pressure on the squares behind the pawn. The American World Champion, Bobby Fischer, played a famous game against the then-World Champion, Boris Spassky, in the World Championship match in 1972, with a passed pawn.

Most masters of the early twentieth century would here conclude that White has a large advantage. After all, he has more central space, a protected passed pawn on d5, two bishops, and a weak pawn on b6 to target! The opposite is in fact true: Black has the advantage because he has a knight versus a bishop in a closed position; the pawn on b6 is easily defended, White has weak pawns on c4, c3, and a4, and the d-pawn only serves to block White's actions on the d-file. As a result, White has no plan. '''18.Rb2 Rb8 19.Rbf2''' Spassky correctly transfers the rooks to the kingside, which is where all the action is taking place. '''19...Qe7 20.Bc2 g5 21.Bd2''' Notice how White is playing planlessly, due to the passivity of his two bishops. However, Black has a clear plan of playing his knight to f4 while exchanging White's best pieces, the rooks. Then he will target the weak White pawns. Thus, he plays: '''21...Qe8 22.Be1 Qg6 23.Qd3 Nh5!''' Trading off the rooks and swinging the knight into f4. '''24.Rxf8+ Rxf8 25.Rxf8+ Kxf8 26.Bd1 Nf4''' The difference between minor pieces is clear. Here Spassky blundered with 27.Qc2 and promptly resigned after 27...Bxa4!, which wins two pawns and crashes through. However, it is more instructive to see what would have happened had Spassky played 27.Qb1. '''27.Qb1 Qf6 28.g3 Ng6 29.Bf2 Ne7 30.Bc2 31. Nc8 31.Qd1 Ke7 32.Be3 Kd8 33.Kg2 Nd6 34.Qe2 Qf7!''' There is little that White could do about Black reaching this setup. Black's knight sits unassailably on d6. Were the pawn on d5 not there, White could play Qd2 and chase it away. However, the pawn ''is'' there, and it sits on its outpost attacking both c4 and e4. This shows the disadvantage of White's passed pawn--it blocks the actions of his pieces. Black's next move will be 35...Qe8, winning a pawn. So White probably would have lost the game in any case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The genetic molecule must be able to carry instructions for the creation of new cells, and have the ability to be copied, exactly the same each time, many many times.

=DNA &amp; RNA Structure=

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are both macromolecules.They are also polynucleotides - polymers made from many similar molecules known as nucleotides. Both DNA and RNA can simply be known as nucleic acids. Nucleotides are joined together by condensation reactions.

==Nucleotides==

Nucleotides are organic compounds that consist of three joined structures: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. DNA contains only four nucleotides - adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. RNA contains the same four except thymine is replaced with Uracil. The joined sugar is either ribose or deoxyribose, and the only difference is that deoxyribose has one fewer oxygen atoms in its molecule. There are two types of bases - purine and pyrimidine - you only really need to know that adenine and guamine are the purine bases and that purine bases are larger.

==Polynucleotides==
[[Image:DNA_chemical_structure.svg|150px|right]]
To form both DNA and RNA, many of these nucleotides are linked together in a polynucleotide chain. The structure of this poly nucleotide chain is seen in this picture: [http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/lifescience/physicalanthropology/HeredityBeyond/DNA/DNAStructure/NucleicAcids/3baseschem.gif]. As you can see, it is formed by alternating sugars and phosphates, and the nitrogen bases project sideways. DNA molecules are simply two of these strands next to each other, running in opposite directions held together by hydrogen bonds.

In a DNA molecule, there isn't enough room for two purine strands to be opposite each other, and thus only one strand of the two can be a purine base. This however, isn't a problem since the bases are paired - '''complementary base pairing''' - Adenine always pairs with thymine, cytosine always pairs with guanine (A-T, C-G, and in RNA, it is A-U, since thymine does not appear). DNA molecules forms a 3D helix shape, bonded by hydrogen, whereas RNA remains as single strands of polynucleotide.

To the right is a rather complicated diagram, but you only really need to take note of the hydrogen bonds between the bases, the sugar phosphate backbone and the complimentary base pairing - the specific structures are not required for A-Level.

=DNA Replication=
[[Image:DNA_replication_split.svg|150px|thumb|right]]

For DNA to be viable, it must have the ability to be copied perfectly many times - the discoverers of DNA, Waston and Crick suggested that the two polynucleotide strands of DNA could spilt apart, and new nucleotides (the correct, complimentary ones) could like up along each strand, making a new DNA molecule. The DNA molecule can then wind back up into a double helix. This process is known as semi-conservative replication, since half of the original molecule is conserved in each of the new molecules.



===Experimental proof===

Nitrogen is a major constituent of DNA, and there are two different isotopes - 14N and 15N. 14N is by far the most abundant isotope of nitrogen, but DNA with the heavier 15N isotope also works.

The experiment, performed by Meselsohn and Stahn in 1958, is as follows;

E. coli, a harmless bacterium that lives in the human alimentary canal, were grown for several generations in a medium with 15N. The DNA of the resulting cells had a higher density (they were heavier). After that, E. coli cells with only 15N in their DNA were put back into a 14N medium and some were allowed to divide only once, some twice, thrice or more times. DNA was then extracted from each groups cells and was put into a solution of caesium chloride and spun in a centrifuge. The heavier the DNA ended up, the closer to the bottom of the tube it rested. The DNA that had only been grown in 15N rested nearest the bottom, whereas the group that had divided once in 14N rested in between pure 14N and pure 15N - an intermediary group, showing that that DNA had half 14N and half 15N for it's nitrogen.

=DNA/RNA Synthesis=
This section discusses how DNA, RNA and proteins are synthesised.

===DNA Control===

All cell activities are chemical reactions, and all chemical reactions are controlled by enzymes - so what controls enzymes? DNA. DNA codes for proteins, controlling which and how many proteins are made. Proteins are made from strings of amino acids, and the structure and function of a protein depends on the exact sequence of these amino acids - DNA controls this protein structure by determining the exact order in which amino acids join together.

===The Triplet code===

A sequence of amino acids is coded for by the sequences of nucleotides in a DNA molecule - three bases form a triplet code. Each triplet code codes for one amino acid (T-T-T, thymine-thymine-thymine stand for the amino acid lysine, for example), and it is always read in the same direction.

===Genes===

A gene is a part of a DNA molecule that codes for just one polypeptide, and in humans alone there is an estimated 140,000 genes. The genome is the total information in one cell, the set of genes for that organism.

===Protein Synthesis===

Transfer RNA (tRNA, picture below), are free molecules within the cytoplasm - in the picture at the location marked with 'a' is the anticodon, three unpaired bases, and each tRNA thus bonds with a particular amino acid. These amino acids are also free within the cytoplasm and bond at the point β in the diagram under the control of enzymes.

[[Image:Schema ARNt 448 658.png|150px|right]]
Process

:1. Inside the nucleus, the DNA double helix unwinds to expose a sequence of nitrogenous bases.

:2. Transcription - a copy of the strand is made of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) which, following transcription, travels out of the nucleus through a pore in the nuclear envelope, into the main body of the cell, where protein synthesis occurs.

:3. The mRNA couples with the small subunit of the ribosome. Transfer RNA (tRNA), brings free amino acids to the ribosome.

:4. The anticodon present on the tRNA recognises the codon present on the mRNA string (copied from the DNA string in the nucleus), and the ribosome adds the amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain, cleaving it away from the tRNA. This process is known as translation.

:5. As the polypeptide chain grows, it folds to form a protein.

=Genetic Engineering=

Since 1950, when we first determined protein synthesis as well as semi-conservative replication, we have progressed to the level where we can now change and insert DNA into cells. A good example of this is industrial insulin production.

==Insulin==

Diabetes mellitus is most often caused by the persons pancreas not being able to produce insulin, and victims of diabetes type I (insulin-dependent diabetes) need regular injections of insulin to survive. This insulin used to come from the pancreases of animals, such as cows or pigs - this was ''expensive, more risky as the insulin was not human insulin and people had ethical objections''. So something had to be done - science to the rescue. The insulin gene was extracted, inserted into a bacterial vector, multiplied and extracted, details follow.

===The insulin gene===

To use the insulin gene (a relativley small one), it first had to be isolated - and it could not be done directly, so mRNA carrying the insulin code was extracted instead. This mRNA strand was then incubated with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase - an enzyme that reverses transcription, making DNA from RNA, two strands were made, creating a DNA double helix gene coding for insulin. To enable these insulin genes to stick onto other DNA, they were given sticky ends - a short string of guanine at each end of the polynucleotide strand.

===Vector===

In order to get a e. coli bacterium to replicate the insulin gene, as it is human, a vector has to be used, and in this instance the vector is known as a plasmid. A plasmid is a circular loop of DNA found in prokaryotic cells, and human DNA can be added to it. The plasmid is taken from the bacteria by dissolving their cell walls with enzymes, centrifuging them - leaving the smaller plasmids at the top. These plasmids are taken, cut with a restriction enzyme and sticky ends added - this time with  cytosine ends, so that the guanine ends of the DNA strand can be attached using an enzyme known as DNA ligase. The product is called recombinant DNA.

===Bacteria===

The plasmids were then mixed with the bacterium E. coli - not all of them take the plasmid up, and the ones that do not are killed off with antibiotics. The ones that took the plasmid up also receive antibiotic resistance, and so only those with the plasmid survive. These genetically modified bacteria are cultured on a large scale, secreting insulin which is extracted and purified, and can then be used by people with diabetes.

==Other genetic engineering==

There have been many other uses of genetic engineering - we have since learnt to insert genes into any organism, and we are even beginning to have success in the field of gene therapy - replacing defective genes with good ones, which could be used to treat genetic diseases. 

However, people with haemophilia have been helped massively by a protein known as human factor VIII, which several companies have produced by genetically modified hamster cells. Haemophilia is a disease in which the blood cannot clot, and this protein makes the blood clot - these people do need regular human factor VIII injections though. It is considered better than recombinant DNA from donated blood, which carries infection risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Testing water absorbsion  ==

In the text we are told ''Also, make sure the ground absorbs moisture quick enough. To test this, dig a hole in the ground and pour a little water into it.''

A &quot;'''test'''&quot; involves performing a prescribe action, then comparing the results against a standard to get a '''pass''' or '''fail''' score.

This part of the text lacks the required prescribed action in measurable terms. In other words, we need to be told the dimensions of the hole to be dug - this effects the surface area of the ground to absorb the water. Then we need to know exactly how much water to pour into the hole to be sure our test is comparable with all the others and the results will provide accurate information.

Having completed the filling of the hole with water, we need a standard to measure the results. This would be in the form of how many minutes it should take for the hole to be either drained completely, or the water level to drop by some prescribed amount.</text>

      <comment>/* Cell Cycle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All living organisms, grow, repair themselves and reproduce. Chapter 1 told us that all cells arise from pre-existing cells, and we are going to see how in this chapter. The nucleus is responsible for the cells activities and does so through DNA. All cells in an organism are genetically identical.

=Chromosomes=

Chromosomes are thread-like structures found within the nucleus, and the number of chromosomes in a cell is characteristic of the species - for example, we humans have 46 of them. A photograph of chromosomes taken from an electron microscope is known as a karyotype. Animals have two sets of matching chromosomes, and as such their cells (except for reproductive cells, gametes) are called diploid. Gametes, which only have one set of chromosomes are described as haploid cells. In humans, a diploid cell has 46 chromosomes and a haploid cell has 23.

==Structure==
[[Image:Chromosome-upright.png|right]]

Look at the image to the right - it is a simplified drawing of chromosomal structure - and it can be seen that a chromosome is a double structure, made from two identical structures called chromatids (1). This is so because during interphase, a period between nuclear divisions, each DNA molecule makes an identical copy of itself contained in a chromatid - these chromatids are held together by a centromere (2). Each chromatid is one DNA molecule. The gene for a particular characteristic is always located at the same place on a chromosome.

===Homologous Pairs===

Every chromosome is part of a matching pair known as a homologous (because they are the same) pair. Each member of a pair posses genes for the same characteristic, known as an allele - they may differ in how they code for those characteristics. Eye colour, for example is coded for by one allele that may be different, but there are dominant and recessive alleles and that is how the eye colour is 'presented'. There are two separate chromosomes which determine the sex of the individual, known as sex chromosomes, all others are known as autosomes. Females have a double X chromosome, whereas males have a X-Y chromosome.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty allele in a gene that codes for a chloride channel protein that produces normal mucus, and the mutated allele causes very thick mucus to be produced indeed, leading to cystic fibrosis. Only when both homologous chromosomes have a copy of the faulty allele will the person be a victim of the disease - if not, the person will simply be a carrier.

=Nuclear Division=
Nuclear division is used for three things, growth, asexual production or sexual reproduction - and two different types are used - mitosis and meiosis respectively.

===Growth and Asexual Reproduction===

When a diploid cell divides, it must maintain the same number of chromosomes as the original cell, this is known as mitosis

===Sexual Reproduction===

Meiosis is used for sexual reproduction, and the resultant cell is a gamete - a haploid cell with half the full number of chromosomes.

=Mitosis=

Mitosis is the type of nuclear division used for growth and repair within organisms - it produces genetically identical cells with the full number of cells (diploid cells). It is a precisely controlled process known as the '''cell cycle'''.

==Cell cycle==
[[Image:Mitoticcellcycle.PNG|right|400px]]
The cell cycle is the period between one cell division and the next - it's three phases are '''interphase''', '''nuclear division''' and '''cell division'''. During interphase, the cell regrows to its normal size following cell division and then carries on its normal processes, whatever its task may be. When a signal is received to divide, the DNA replicates so that each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids. Nuclear division then follows, and the whole cell then divides. In animals cells, cell division also involves construction of cytoplasm - known as cytokinesis - between the two new nuclei.

==IPMAT cycle==
[[Image:Gray2.png|right|200px]]

Interphase is stage I of the diagram


* Prophase, Stage II,III- The chromatin condenses into a highly ordered structure called chromosomes and the nuclear membrane begins to breakup. The nucleus also breaks up and forms part of several chromosomes. Centrioles move to opposite poles of nucleus.


* Metaphase, Stage IV - Condensed chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the middle of the cell at their centromeres before being separated into each of the two daughter cells.


* Anaphase - Stage V, VI Chromatids (identical copies of chromosomes) separate at their centromeres as they are pulled towards opposite poles within the cell. They are pulled because the microtubule fibres begin to shorten, pulling them along.


* Telophase - Nucleus, nucleolus reforms and chromosomes unravel into longer chromatin structures for reentry into interphase. Cytokinesis also occurs - the division of cytoplasm and cell into two by constriction from edges of cell.


This section is called the IPMAT section as it is an easy way to remember the stages of mitosis ('''I'''nterphase-'''P'''rophase-'''M'''etaphase-'''A'''naphase-'''T'''elophase)

===Significance===

*Replacement of cells and repair of tissues is done via mitosis - cells are constantly being replaced by mitosis. In some animals mitosis can regenerate entire sections of their bodies.

*Mitosis is also the basis for '''asexual''' reproduction. This is more prevalent in unicelluar organisms and plants. Plants bud off of their stem which simply grows into a new plant, becoming detached from the parent and then living independently.

*The nuclei of the two new cells have the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus and are genetically identical.

=Cancer=

Cancer is a common disease in developed countries, with over 140,000 deaths in the UK alone in 2005. There are many different forms of cancer. Cancer is a result of uncontrolled mitosis, that is to say that they divide repeatedly and are out of control. This uncontrolled mitosis produces an irregular mass of cells known as a tumour, and these cells are usually abnormal in shape.

==Carcinogens==

Cancers are as a result of mutation to the genes that control cell division, and divide continuously from there, passing the mutated gene to all its descendants. There are many different reasons that a gene may mutate, and any factor that may cause it to do so is known as a mutagen - several of them at once are thought to have to happen in one cell. A carcinogen is an agent that causes cancer, and some mutagens are carcinogenic.

===Radiation===

X-rays, radioactive decay elements and gamma rays can all form damaging ions inside cells which can break dna strands. UV light can damage genes, potentially causing skin cancer.

===Chemicals===

Chemicals in tar from cigarettes or cigars is an extremely common killer - 25% of all cancer deaths are due to tar carcinogens. These chemicals can damage DNA molecules.

===Viruses===

More rarely, cancers can be caused by viruses, including Pallipoma, a virus that can be transmitted sexually and has been linked to cervical cancer.

===Predisposition===

You do not inherit cancer, but you can inherit faulty genes that cause it, or simply a great susceptibility to developing cancer.

==Primary Growths==

Primary growths are small groups of tumour cells. Both tumour types place a huge drain on the bodys resources because of the constant cell division.

===Benign===

*Do not spread from origin
*Compress and displace surrounding tissues

===Malignant===

*Far more dangerous
*Spread through body, invade tissues and destroy them.
*Distributed around the body via blood stream
*Interfere with the functioning of the area where they started to grow.
*Cancerous cells can break off and spread through the blood and lymphatic system to other parts of the body to form secondary growths.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Health=

Health is more than just being free from disease - it is a good physical feeling, a well-adjusted, positive individual who is able to undertake the tasks of their day without much difficulty.We also say &quot;HEALTH IS WEALTH&quot;.

=Disease=

Disease is as broad a term as health is - but simply it is a disorder or malfunction of the mind or body which stops good health. Diseases usually have more than one factor - i.e. an attempted suicide might be a self-inflicted physical disease. Acute diseases are sudden onset, rapidly changing disease with a short life-span, whereas chronic are diseases that continue for a long time (months or years).

===Cystic Fibrosis===

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease, and is the most common in Britain. The disease is because of fault in a gene coding for a channel protein that is meant to allow chloride ions to flow out of cells, and since chloride ions take water with them this presents a problem. If neither move out, the alveoli is hindered by a thick sticky mucus, making breathing difficult and forming a breeding ground for bacteria, resulting in infections. Regular physiotherapy can help to loosen and remove the mucus.

There are two versions of every gene in each of the bodies cells, called alleles. There are two types of alleles - dominant and recessive, and cystic fibrosis is caused by a recessive allele. Let's say that A is the healthy allele, and a is the cystic fibrosis allele, and is recessive. Someone with AA is healthy, someone with Aa is a carrier but is healthy (because the healthy A is dominant over the unhealthy a). Two people with Aa and Aa are both healthy, but if they produce a child there is a 1/4 chance that this child will have the genotype aa, which means they will suffer from cystic fibrosis.

===Degenerative Diseases===

There are three major types of degenerative disease;

*Diseases of the skeletal, muscular and nervous systems. Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease.
*Cardiovascular diseases. Coronary Heart Disease and strokes
*Cancers

=Epidemiology=

Epidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and control of diseases in populations. The statistics reflect the amount of people who are ill and the amount that have died and are particular to a population under the study. Three types of data provide information on the spread of disease - incidence, prevalence and mortality. This refers to the number of new cases per time period, the number of people in a population with the disease and the amount of people who have died from the disease, respectively.

===Uses===

Epidemiology can be used by a variety of people for many things. One of its most important uses is by governments to increase funding for research into rising causes of death, such as AIDS was in the 1980s. They can also show differences between economic levels and separate countries, or promote mass screening to prevent disease before they start, such as cervical cancer.

===Disease Descriptions===

*Endemic - Disease is always present in the population. TB is an example.
*Epidemic - Disease spreads rapidly to affect many people. Influenza is an example.
*Pandemic - Disease spreads over a very large area. AIDS is an example.

==Disease patterns==

In developed countries, disease such as CHD and cancer are much more common than in third world countries. This is as a result of developed countries having better health care, including vaccination and treatment against serious infectious diseases such as measles, polio, TB and malaria. Also, smoking and foods high in fat are more prevalent in developed countries. Attitudes towards drinking, smoking or obesity may affect a countries overall incidences of disease - for example, incidences of lung cancer are expected to fall following the United Kingdom's smoking ban as it forces people to quit and reduces the effects of secondary smoke.

      <comment>/* Trachea, Bronchi and Bronchioles */ changed 'that' for 'which' - just seems to flow better</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The gaseous exchange system has four functions:

*Maximise the surface area for diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and atmosphere.
*Minimise the distance for this diffusion, and maintain adequate concentration gradients for it.
*Clean and warm the air that enters during breathing.


=Breathing=
[[image:Respiratory_system_complete_en.svg‎|thumb|The complete respiratory system]]
For mammals, the usual method of getting oxygen to where it is needed in the body is breathing and then having it transported via the blood. Lungs are vital in the former.

===Trachea, Bronchi and Bronchioles===

The air for the lungs comes from the mouth, which leads into the trachea. At the base of the trachea, it breaks into two bronchi which further sub-divide and branch, forming a bronchial 'tree'. Cartilage in the trachea and bronchi keep the airways open and prevent them from collapsing. The trachea has a regular arrangement of c-shaped cartilage, whereas the bronchi have irregular blocks of cartilage. The smaller bronchioles can relax using their surrounding smooth muscle, this is useful during exercise to allow a greater flow of air. 

Airways in the human body have mucus lining them which helps to catch pathogens and other foreign material entering the body through the air passages. In the trachea and bronchi, it is the goblet cells of the cilliated epithelium that produces this mucus. Mucus is a slimy solution of mucin, which is glycoproteins with many carbohydrate chains that make them sticky and able to trap inhaled particles. Chemical pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, can dissolve in the mucus to form an acidic solution that irritates the airways. The nasal passages have tiny hairs lining them as well. 

Macrophages, phagocytic white blood cells patrol the surfaces of the airways remove particles such as bacteria.

==Lungs==
[[image:Alveolus_diagram.svg‎|thumb|An Alveoli]]
The trachea feeds into the lungs, and their job is to provide an enormous surface area for gaseous exchange to happen and are surrounded by an airtight space. This airtight space contains a small amount of fluid to allow friction-free movement so that the lungs can be moved by the diaphragm and the ribs (the action of breathing).

===Alveoli===

Alveoli have a &lt;u&gt;very thin epithelial lining&lt;/u&gt; and are surrounded by many &lt;u&gt;blood capillaries&lt;/u&gt; that carry &lt;u&gt;deoxygenated&lt;/u&gt; blood. They provide a &lt;u&gt;short distance&lt;/u&gt; and a &lt;u&gt;large surface area&lt;/u&gt; over which &lt;u&gt;oxygen and carbon dioxide&lt;/u&gt; can be exchanged. They also contain &lt;u&gt;elastic fibres&lt;/u&gt; which expand to &lt;u&gt;allow air in&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;snap back&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;help force out air&lt;/u&gt;.

===Breathing Rate===

Changing the depth and rate of breathing enables us to adjust our intake of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide to suit our level of activity. At rest, we require 6.0dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per minute, and about 0.35 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; enters the alveoli with each breath.

The lungs cannot be emptied of air - at least 1.0dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air will always remain, and is known as the residual volume.

*Tidal volume - the volume of air breathed in and out in a single breath
*Breathing rate - breaths per minute
*Ventilation rate - tidal volume x breathing rate
*Vital capacity - the maximum volume of air that can be breathed in and then out again.


Lung volume changes can be measured by a spirometer.

=Heart Rate=

When we do exercise, our heart rate must increase to provide more oxygen to our muscles and expel carbon dioxide faster.

==Pulse rate==

The stroke volume from the heart is defined as the volume of blood pumped out from each ventricle during each contraction, and per minute it is called the cardiac output. The pulse is the wave caused by the stretch and subsequent recoil of the aorta, and moves all along the arteries, and is identical to the heart rate. A high stroke volume and a low resting pulse is an indication of aerobic fitness, as it only requires a small increase in pulse to achieve a much larger blood supply required for heavy exercise.

==Blood pressure==

When the left ventricle contracts to force oxygenated blood out of the heart, the maximum arterial pressure during this process is known as the systolic pressure - the pressure at which the blood leaves the heart. The minimum pressure is the diastolic pressure, and it reflects the resistance of the small arteries and capillaries. This can be due to hardened arteries from atherosclerosis. Typical blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg.

===Hypertension===

Hypertension is the condition in which both systolic and diastolic blood pressures are high at rest, and the heart is working too hard. In the short term, high blood pressure occurs because of contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of small arteries and arterioles, which is a result of the hormone noradrenaline. This hormone stimulates arterioles to contract therefore increasing the resistance, forcing the heart to work harder.

However, long term hypertension imposes a strand on the cardiovascular system and is not fully explained. If not correct, it can lead to heart failure. It has been closely linked to;

*excessive alcohol intake
*smoking
*high salt levels in the diet
*genetic predisposition
*obesity

=Energy and Exercise=

ATP, as you will remember is the energy currency for all cells - muscles need it as well, but cannot store large amounts of it, and thus it is soon exhausted during exercise. Muscles will release will utilise chemical potential energy in other molecules to make ATP for exercise that lasts longer than this. These sources include glycogen breaking down to glucose in the muscles, liver stores of glycogen being converted to glucose and fatty acids in the blood from fat stores in the body.

==Respiration==

Respiration is the process by which new ATP is produced, and there are two forms. If there is enough oxygen, aerobic respiration occurs, where glucose, fatty acids and oxygen are broken down to form carbon dioxide and water, releasing a lot of energy in the process - some is converted to ATP, the rest is lost in heat. 

This respiration usually occurs in mitochondria, with the oxygen coming from two sources - oxyhaemoglobin in the blood and oxymyoglobin store in muscle. Oxyhaemoglobin readily dissociates and releases oxygen which diffuses into muscle tissue, some is used immediately by the mitochondria, some is kept by myoglobin which acts as an oxygen store since it has a higher affinity for oxygen, thus will only release it when oxygen levels in the muscle cells is very low.

Mitochondria can not function efficiently in anaerobic conditions, but glucose can still be respired to make ATP, forming lactate in the process.

==Aerobic exercise==

Any exercise powered by aerobic respiration is called aerobic exercise. With training, the lungs and heart become better at oxygenating the blood and transporting it around the body.

===Changes===

All the changes listed below are used to more efficiently supply the body with oxygen where it needs it the most during exercise.


Just before exercise
*Adrenaline - Causes heart and ventilation rates to increase
*Arterioles in your skin and gut constrict and those in your muscles dilate
*Glucose is released from the liver and fatty acids are released from fat stores.


During exercise
*Energy demand increases steeply as your muscles use up their supply of ATP
*The limited supply of oxygen forces your muscles to respire anaerobically, producing lactate. 
*Lactate diffuses into the blood along with carbon dioxide, stimulating the arterioles to dilate further and increase blood flow to the muscles.
*Adrenaline stimulate the bronchioles to widen, reducing air resistance.
*Output of blood from your heart also increases.
*The Bohr effect allows oxyhaemoglobin's oxygen to dissociate better.

===Training===

During aerobic exercise, especially if somebody starts rapidly, it can take up to four minutes for their heart and lungs to reach the oxygen demand placed on them by the muscles - and an unfit person may never be able to reach the demand and have to stop. During the time it takes for the heart and lungs to catch up, the person builds up an oxygen deficit, otherwise known as an oxygen debt - and the heavy breathing after exercising is 'paying off' that oxygen debt. It does the following;

*Respiration of the lactate produced (done in the liver)
*Reoxygenation of haemoglobin in the blood
*Reoxygenation of myoglobin in the muscles
*High metabolic rate, as the whole body is operating at above resting levels.

==Aerobic Fitness==

There are a variety of factors that affect aerobic fitness.

*Initial level of aerobic fitness
*Intensity of training
*Duration of training
*How often the training occurs


===Benefits of aerobic fitness===


Health benefits

*Loss of weight
*Improved infection resistance
*Slows down atherosclerosis
*Improvement in balance and strength
*Reduced chance of lower back pain
*Exercise releases endorphins which improve mood
*decrease in cholesterol concentration
*Reduced risk of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease and strokes
*Reduces hypertension


Muscles

*Increase in muscle size (including muscle fibres)
*Increase in capillaries - shorter diffusion for oxygen to muscles
*Increase in mitochondria
*Increase in myoglobin
*Increase in glycogen and fat in muscles
*Increase in respiratory enzymes


Cardiovascular Fitness

*Increase in stroke volume
*increase in cardiac output
*Increase in heart beat power
*Increase in heart size
*Decrease in resting blood pressure
*Decrease in resting heart rate


Respiratory Fitness

*Increase in vital capacity
*Increase in tidal volume
*Body 'catches up' with the muscles demand faster

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Triple sec}}
'''Triple sec''', the most common type of orange liqueur, gets its name from the distillation process.  ''Sec'' means dry.  ''Triple sec'' means triple dry, or triple distilled.  It's a useful orange-flavored liqueur.

Inexpensive triple secs tend to be much sweeter and with a less assertive orange flavour than Cointreau and other high-end triple secs.  Therefore they will balance cocktails differently, often making them too sweet or not as orange-flavoured as would be expected.  Different triple secs will require different proportions, and with some of the cheapest, which are low-proof grain alcohol and artificial flavorings, no proportion will be quite right.  Be sure to taste your ingredients and invest in those which will create a more balanced drink.  Also, those with a brandy base rather than a neutral base will be slightly sweeter and of a different character, and cannot always be directly substituted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Former psychiatric patients in the 19th Century working to change laws and public policies. For example, beginning in 1868, Elizabeth Packard, founder of the Anti-Insane Asylum Society, published a series of books and pamphlets describing her experiences in the Illinois insane asylum to which her husband had had her committed. A few decades later, another former psychiatric patient, Clifford W. Beers, founded the National Committee on Mental Hygiene, which eventually became the National Mental Health Association. Beers sought to improve the plight of individuals receiving public psychiatric care, particularly those committed to state institutions. His book, A Mind that Found Itself (1908), described his experience with mental illness and the treatment he encountered in mental hospitals. Beers' work stimulated public interest in more responsible care and treatment of people with mental illness.

In the 1940s, a group of former psychiatric patients founded We Are Not Alone (WANA). Their goal was to help others make the difficult transition from hospital to community. Their efforts led to the establishment of Fountain House, a psychosocial rehabilitation service for people leaving state mental institutions.


The 1950s saw the advent and widespread use of lobotomy and shock therapy. These were associated with grave concerns and much opposition on grounds of basic morality, harmful effects, or misuse. Towards the 1960s, psychiatric medications came in to widespread use and also caused controversy relating to adverse effects and misuse. There were also associated moves away from large psychiatric institutions to community-based services, which sometimes empowered service users, although community-based services were often deficient. Coming to the fore in the 1960s, an anti-psychiatry movement vocally challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry.

The beginning of a formal movement is often attributed to Howard Gelding, or Howie the Harp, and the formation of the Insane Liberation Front in Portland, Oregon, in 1969. Many other local initiatives followed, many of them with Howie's direct participation, and most owing to his articulation of peer alternatives to traditional treatment methods, and demonstrated success in funding and operating peer-operated service centers. A coalition of such programs meets annually.

MindFreedom International and the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry have also played important roles in the psychiatric survivors movement.

By the 1970s, the women's movement, gay rights movement, and disabilities rights movement had emerged. It was in this context that former mental patients began to organize groups with the common goals of fighting for patient's rights and against forced treatment, stigma and discrimination, and often to promote peer-run services as an alternative to the traditional mental health system. Unlike professional mental health services, which were usually based on the medical model, peer-run services were based on the principle that individuals who have shared similar experiences can help themselves and each other through self-help and mutual support. Many of the individuals who organized these early groups identified themselves as psychiatric survivors. Their groups had names such as Insane Liberation Front and the Network Against Psychiatric Assault. They saw the mental health system as destructive and disempowering.

By the 1980s, individuals who considered themselves consumers of mental health services had begun to organize self-help/advocacy groups and peer-run services. While sharing some of the goals of the earlier movement, consumer groups did not seek to abolish the traditional mental health system, which they believed was necessary. Instead, they wanted to reform it. Consumer groups encouraged their members to learn as much as possible about the mental health system so that they could gain access to the best services and treatments available.

Recipients of mental health services demanded control over their own treatment and began to have an influence on the public mental health system. They often promoted a recovery model. Whether they considered themselves consumers or survivors, activists demanded a voice and a choice.

Psychiatric survivors are persons who are disenchanted with psychiatry and mental health to some degree.  They are individuals who have survived a psychiatric treatment.

A consumer is a person who uses the mental health system.

|-

I'm a 17 year old student from Nottingham, United Kingdom. You can see a picture of me to your left! I hope to attend Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry to study medicine; however, as of yet i'm still a layperson studying at Bilborough College. I'm a Christian. Quite frankly, I love music and I play the guitar (acoustic, bass and electric) pretty much every day. I'm also pretty interested in parkour, photography and drama.

As should be expected from a prospective doctor, i'm trained in first aid and also in deaf and blind communication. I volunteer regularly at my local Oxfam shop and always try my best to give advice to anyone who needs it. I'm aware this is starting to read like a personal statement for a university application, so i'll end it here!
&lt;/div&gt;

My main interest on Wikipedia is editing, specifically those relating to WikiProject Medicine and other related WikiProjects. Secondly, I enjoy participating in areas including but not limited to requests for adminship, articles for deletion and criteria for speedy deletion. Finally, i'm always up for helping to review an article or editor so just get in touch (see box below) if you want me to have a look at you or your article!

I enjoy vandal fighting using the Twinkle and Vandal Fighter applications. I use AutoWikiBrowser to repair several articles at a time, too. Given the chance, I also patrol the new users section to give them a nice, friendly welcome. On that note, i'm also up for adoption too! I'm also the creator and maintainer of WikiProject Neurology. I've got a unified account which can be used on any of the Wikimedia sites. Direct links to my pages on other accounts can be found in the Contact section below.

      <comment>/* Classification of Gurmukhi sounds */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We will devote this Appendix to some very preliminary notions and terms about phonetics with the avowed objective of making the reader understand some of the unfamiliar sounds which we encountered in the course of learning Gurmukhi script. 

== Speech organs ==

;Larynx : Also called the ''voice box'' is the part of throat containing ''glottis'' and ''vocal fold''.
;Glottis : An organ of speech, located in the larynx containing the ''vocal folds'' and the opening between them.
;Vocal folds : Also called ''vocal chords'' produce voice by resonating i.e. vibrating due to the air coming out of lungs passing through them.
;Tongue : A moving organ in the mouth. Body of the tongue, the toe of the tongue and the back part of the tongue called ''dorsum'' interact with other organs to articulate speech sounds.
;Lips : Lips move and are responsible for some speech sounds. 
;Teeth : Another important organ set used to produce speech sounds.
;Alveolar ridge : The hard raised part of the roof of the mouth immediately behind the teeth.
;Hard Palate : The roof of the mouth immediately behind the alveolar ridge.
;Velum : The part of the roof of the mouth from the ''hard palate'' extending up to above the dorsum.
;Oral cavity : The mouth hollow that breath passes through. It connects with the wind pipe.
;Nasal cavity : The hollow through the nose connecting to the windpipe above the larynx.
;Vocal tract : The cavity consisting of the laryngeal cavity, the pharynx, the oral cavity, and the nasal cavity where sound that is produced in larynx is filtered.

== How are speech sounds produced? ==

Speech sounds are produced by passing breath through the oral cavity or additionally through the nasal cavity and modulating the air flow by moving some speech organ ([[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|vocal folds]], the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|tongue]] or the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|lips]] called ''active articulator''s) against some other moving or non-moving speech organ ([[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|teeth]], [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|alveolar ridge]], [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|hard palate]] or [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|velum]] called ''passive articulator''s).

*'''Vowels and Consonants''' : When the air coming out of lungs passes '''unobstructed''' through the vocal folds and the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|oral/nasal cavity]] the sound produced is called ''vowel''. If however an '''obstruction''' (e.g. by closing of lips or placing tongue against one of the passive articulators) is caused to the air flow between the vocal folds and before it escapes through [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|oral cavity]] a ''consonant'' sound is produced.

*'''Place of articulation''' : When a consonant sound is produced one of the speech organs namely the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|glottis]], the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|velum]], the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|palate]], the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|alveolar ridge]], the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|teeth]], [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|lips]] is acted upon by another moving speech organ e.g. [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|vocal folds]], [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|tongue]] or [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|lips]]. Such a speech organ or a location thereon is the place of articulation of the speech sound and speech sound articulated at such a place is called a[[Image:Places_of_articulation.png|right|300px]]
*#'''Glottal''' : articulated with i.e. by moving [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|glottis]] (see A in figure), /ਹ/ is the only glottal sound in Punjabi.
*#'''Velar''' : produced by placing back part of tongue called [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|dorsum]] against [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|velum]] (see D in figure). /ਕ, ਖ, ਗ, ਘ, ਙ/ are Punjabi velars.
*#'''Palatal''' : produced by touching the hard [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|palate]] (see E in figure) with the tongue. /ਚ, ਛ, ਜ, ਝ, ਞ, ਸ਼/ are Punjabi palatals.
*#'''Retroflex''' : produced with tongue curling and touching the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|palate]] near [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|alveloar ridge]] (see F in figure). /ਟ, ਠ, ਡ, ਢ, ਣ, ੜ, ਲ਼/ are Punjabi retroflexes.
*#'''Dental''' : produced by placing the tongue against the upper teeth(see G in figure). /ਤ, ਥ, ਦ, ਨ, ਸ, ਲ, ਰ, ਜ਼/ are Punjabi dentals
*#'''Labial''' : produced by closing the lips (see H in figure) to stop the air flow. /ਪ, ਫ, ਬ, ਮ/ are Punjabi labials.

*'''Manner of articulation''' : As noted above a consonant sound is produced by obstructing the flow of air. This is done a number of different ways called manner of articulation of the speech sound. 
*#'''Plosive''' : Also called a stop. Plosive speech sounds are produced when a speech articulator interacts with another to completely stop the air flow for a while and the resultant air pressure is released suddenly causing an explosion. /ਕ, ਖ, ਗ, ਚ, ਛ, ਜ, ਟ, ਠ, ਡ, ਤ, ਥ, ਦ, ਪ, ਫ, ਬ/ are all plosives or stops.
*#'''Nasal''' : When air flows out of the nasal cavity it resonates and a nasal speech sound is produced by passing air through [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|oral cavity]] with part of the air passing through the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|nasal cavity]]. /ਙ, ਞ, ਣ, ਨ, ਮ/ are Punjabi nasals.
*#'''Fricative''' : When a sound articulator is placed in such a manner that the air flow does not stop completely and passes through a side or the sides of the articulator causing an air friction with the speech articulator, the resultant speech sound is called a fricative. /ਸ, ਸ਼, ਜ਼, ਹ, ਫ਼/ are Punjabi fricatives.
*#'''Lateral''' : Lateral sounds are articulated along the axis of the tongue, while air from the lungs escapes at one side or both sides of the tongue. /ਲ, ਲ਼/ are the two Punjabi laterals.
*#'''Trill''' : A trill (ਰ in Punajbi) is a consonantal sound produced by vibrations between the articulator and the place of articulation. 
*#'''Flap''' : A flap is a type of consonantal sound (ੜ in Punjabi), which is produced with a single contraction of the muscles so that the tongue is thrown against [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|palate]].
*#'''Approximants''' : Approximants or Semi-vowels are speech sounds that could be regarded as intermediate between vowels and typical consonants. /ਯ, ਵ/ are the two Punjabi Approximants.

*'''Voiced sounds''' : Sounds produced while the [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|''vocal folds'']] vibrate are called voiced sounds otherwise they are called unvoiced. The voiced sounds are characterized by a buzzing of the sound. /ਗ, ਜ, ਡ, ਦ, ਜ਼/ are voiced sounds of Punjabi.

*'''Aspirated sounds''' : Sounds are produced with the breath coming out of the lungs. Aspirated sounds are produced when the amount of air flowing out of [[Punjabi/Phonetics#Speech organs|vocal tract]] is abnormally high. /ਖ, ਛ, ਠ, ਥ, ਫ/ are the aspirated sounds of Punjabi.

== Classification of Gurmukhi sounds ==

The following table of Gurmukhi/Punjabi letters/sounds has been arranged in accordance with the sound articulation characteristics. The sounds are normally classified by describing the ''place of articulation'', ''manner of articulation'' and ''voicing''. Thus the rows of this table describe the place of articulation and the columns both the manner of articulation and voicing. There is a debate going on amongst Punjabi linguists as to whether /ਘ, ਝ, ਢ, ਧ, ਭ/ are independent sounds or they are pronounced as /ਕ, ਚ, ਟ, ਤ, ਪ/ respectively followed by a low tone when occurring word initially and as /ਗ, ਜ, ਡ, ਦ, ਬ/ respectively preceded by a high tone when occurring elsewhere. We have included these letters of the Gurmukhi in this table so that the reader is familiarized with these letters even as we subscribe to the later view. This is made necessary because of the fact their use is quite wide spread.

We are not touching on the vowels here, because there is no confusion regarding the use of Punjabi vowels.

== Tone ==

Punjabi is a tonal language. This implies that tone is spoken in Punjabi and its use is lexically meaningful, that is the use of tone changes the meaning of the word. 

Tone is a high or low aspirated sound, especially of consonant ਹ. (This is not an attempt to precisely define the tone but to just familiarize the reader with the concept. A precise definition is beyond the scope of this Wikibook.)

Though tone is not written using any symbol or letter it is still spoken in Punjabi. There are many ways in which tone is spoken in Punjabi. The letter ਹ has a special significance in this context. When ਹ comes at the beginning of a word or a syllable it is spoken with its normal aspirated glottal sound. However when it comes in a word at a different place it is spoken as a high tone. See the examples below.
:• ਰਹਿ /reh/ = live
:• ਬਹਿ /beh/ = sit
:• ਸ਼ਹਿਰ /shehar/ = city
:• ਕਹਿਰ /kehar/ = atrocity
:• ਜਾਹ /jah/ = go
:• ਉਹ /uh/ = he
Besides ਹ the letters ਘ, ਝ, ਢ, ਧ and ਭ are also of special significance in the context of tone. These consonants are high tone consonants. They are spoken as their normal sounds when they occur at the beginning of a word. See for example:
:• ਘਰ /ghar/ = house
:• ਝੰਡਾ /jhandaa/ = flag
:• ਢੱਕ /&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;akk/ = cover
:• ਧੱਕਾ /dhakka/ = push
:• ਭਾਰ /bhaar/ = weight
However when they occur elsewhere in a word their sounds are replaced with the low tone ਗ੍ਹ, ਜ੍ਹ, ਡ੍ਹ, ਦ੍ਹ and ਬ੍ਹ. Since these conjugates are occurring at the end of the word the half haha is actually spoken as high tone. See these examples:
:• ਸਿੰਘ /singh/ = lion
:• ਬੋਝਾ /bojhaa/ = pocket
:• ਕੱਢ /kadhdh/ = take out
:• ਕੰਧ /kan&lt;u&gt;dh&lt;/u&gt;/ = wall
:• ਖੰਭ /khambh/ = feather
Here are some examples of low tone:
:• ਕਿੰਨ੍ਹਾ /kinaah/ = who
:• ਜਿੰਨ੍ਹਾ /jinaah/ = those who
:• ਨ੍ਹਾਤਾ /nhaa&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;aa/ =bathed
:• ਪੜ੍ਹਾਈ /parhaaii/ = education
:• ਚੜ੍ਹ /charhh/ = climb

      <comment>[[:commons:COM:FR|File renamed]]: [[File:Bottleneck.png]] → [[File:Diagram of highway bottleneck.png]] this is not a diagram of a population bottleneck</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Queueing and Traffic Flow''' is the study of traffic flow behaviors surrounding queueing events.  It combines elements from the previous two sections, [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing | Queueing]] and [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Traffic Flow | Traffic Flow]].  

== Queueing and Traffic Flow ==

[[Image:Diagram of highway bottleneck.png‎|right|thumb|300px|An illustrative plan of a highway bottleneck]]
[[Image:QueueingIOPhases.png|thumb|right|300px|Traffic phases in the queueing cumulative input-output (Newell) diagram]]
[[Image:TrafficPhases.png|thumb|right|300px|Traffic phases in a the microscopic fundamental diagram (truncated triangular)]] 

The first side figure illustrates a traffic bottleneck that drops the roadway from two lanes to one. It allows us to illustrate the changes in capacity, the changes in lane flow, and the stability in the total section flow. Over an extended period of time, by laws of conservation, flow through the bottleneck (q) must equal flow through the upstream section (Q). 

(1) &lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_t q  = \sum\limits_t Q 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

A bottleneck causes lane flow (Ql) to drop, but not section flow (Q), where:  

(2) &lt;math&gt;
Q = \sum\limits_t {Q_l } 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 

When researchers observe a “backward-bending” flow-travel time curve, (which we will tackle later in the section) this is occasionally what they are seeing.  

(3) &lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_t q  = \sum\limits_t Q  \ge \sum\limits_t {Q_l } 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The lane flow drops upstream of a bottleneck when demand for a bottleneck exceeds the capacity of the bottleneck. Thus, the same level of flow can be observed at two different speeds on an upstream lane.  The first is at freeflow speed in uncongested conditions and the second is at a lower speed when the downstream bottleneck is at capacity.  In other words, congestion (a queue) forms when Q &gt; &lt;math&gt;q_{max}&lt;/math&gt; for any period of time. Ultimately, what enters the queue must eventually exit; otherwise the queue will grow to infinity. This is illustrated with the queueing input-output (IO) diagram shown in the second side figure.
We can identify four distinct phases in traffic.
*	Phase 1 is the uncongested phase when there is no influence of the increasing density on the speeds of the vehicles. The speed does not drop with the introduction of newer vehicles onto the freeway. 
*	Phase 2 finds the freeway cannot sustain the speed with injection of newer vehicles into the traffic stream. The density increases while speed falls, maintaining the flow.  
*	Phase 3 shows decreased speed and decreased flows. This is caused by very low speeds cause the queue discharge to drop (slightly) at an active bottleneck, or a queue from a downstream bottleneck may be constraining the flow. As reported by many researchers (Banks, 1991; Hall and Agyemang-Duah, 1991; Persaud and Hurdle, 1991; Cassidy and Bertini, 1999), the reduced bottleneck capacity after breakdown ranges from 0% to 8%. A majority of papers conclude that the section capacity reduction a queue presents is negligible.  (As noted above, lane flow upstream of a bottleneck does drop, but this is due to the downstream bottleneck). This is a second source of the “backward-bending” phenomenon.
*	Phase 4 is the recovery phase. During this phase, the density of traffic starts decreasing and speed starts increasing.

The circled region, ‘A’ (in the third side figure) is typically where we start observing ‘freeway breakdown’. In other words, this region occurs when upstream flow exceeds some critical downstream capacity at a specific point and there is a drop in speed. In the circled region, ‘B’, flow drops are associated with very low speeds. The phenomenon is particularly evidenced by the formation of queues upstream of where the breakdown occurs and a low discharge rate of vehicles due to sustained low speeds. 

Traditional queues have “servers”.  For example, the check-out line at the grocery store can serve one customer every 5 minutes, or one item every 10 seconds, etc.  A conveyor belt can serve so many packages per hour. Capacity is often referred to as belonging to the road.  However when we talk about road capacity, it is really a misnomer, as capacity is located in the driver, more precisely in the driver’s willingness and ability to drive behind the driver ahead.  If drivers were willing and able to drive behind the vehicle ahead with no gap (spacing between vehicles), and that driver was driving behind the driver ahead of him with no gap, and so on, at high speeds, many more vehicles per hour could use the road.  However, while some compression of vehicles occurs in heavy traffic, this situation is unstable because a driver will tap the brakes or even let-up on the accelerator for any number of reasons (to change lanes, to respond to someone else trying to change lanes, because he sees an object in the road, to limit the forces when rounding a corner, etc.).  This by definition lowers his speed, which in turn will lower the flow.  Risk-averse drivers behind him will slow down even more (the driver has established some unpredictability in behavior, it is reasonable for other drivers to establish an even larger gap to accommodate the unpredictable driver’s behavior, especially given there is a reaction time between the lead driver’s actions, and the following driver’s perception (lead vehicle is slowing), decision (must brake), action (tap the brakes), the vehicle’s response to the action (tighten brakes on wheel)).  In this way, maximum flow possible, our capacity (&lt;math&gt;q_{max}&lt;/math&gt;), is a function of the drivers.  The road shapes the driver’s willingness to take risks. Drivers will slow down around curves, vehicles may have difficulty accelerating uphill, or even from a slower speed (and even if they don’t, driver’s may provide insufficient fuel before they realize they are going too slow by not giving the vehicle enough gas), merges take time to avoid collision, etc.

Clearly, different drivers and different vehicles (for instance racecars or taxis) could increase the maximum flow through the bottleneck (&lt;math&gt;q_{max}&lt;/math&gt;). It is better to think of capacity as a maximum sustainable flow (over an extended period of time), given typical drivers’ willingness to follow (subject to highway geometrics and environmental conditions) and their vehicles’ ability to respond to decisions.  A series of aggressive drivers may exceed this ‘capacity’ for a short period of time, but eventually more cautious drivers will even out the function.

The IO diagram lets us understand delay in a way that the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow don’t easily allow. The first point to note about the IO diagram is that delay differs for each driver.  The average delay can be measured easily (the total area in the triangle is the total delay, the average delay is just that triangle divided by the number of vehicles).  The variation (or standard deviation) can also be measured with some more statistics.  As the total number of vehicles increases, the average delay increases.  

The second point to note about the IO diagram is that the total number of queued vehicles (the length of the queue) can also be easily measured.  This also changes continuously; the length of the queue rises and falls with changes in the arrival rate (the tail of the queue edge of the shockwave, where travel speed changes suddenly). Shockwaves indicate a change in state, or speed that suddenly occurs.  One such shockwave is found where vehicles reach the back of queues.  The arrival rate, coupled with the queue clearance rate, will tell you where the back of the queue is.  This is interesting and is where the traveler first suffers delay – but it is not the source of the delay.  

Only if the arrival rate exactly equals the departure rate would we expect to see a fixed length of the queue.  If the queue results from a management practice (such as ramp metering), we can control the departure rate to match the arrival rate, and ensure that the queue remains on the ramp and doesn’t spill over to neighboring arterials. However that observation suggests that congested “steady state” is likely to be a rare phenomenon, since in general the arrival rate does not equal the service rate.

Queueing analysts often make a simplifying assumption that vehicles stack vertically (queues take place at a point).  This is of course wrong, but not too wrong.  The resulting travel time is almost the same as if the queue were measured over space.  The difference is that the time required to cover distance is included when we make the better assumption, even under freeflow conditions it takes time to travel from the point where a vehicle entered the back of the queue to the point where it exits the front.  We can make that correction, but when queueing is taking place, that time is often small compared to the time delayed by the queue. We also assume a first-in, first-out logic, though again this can be relaxed without distracting from the main point.  Another assumption we will make for exposition is that this is a deterministic process; vehicles arrive in a regular fashion and depart in a regular fashion.  However sometimes vehicles bunch up (drivers are not uniform), which leads to stochastic arrivals and departures.  This stochastic queueing can be introduced, and will in general increase the measured delay.

== Hypercongestion ==

[[Image:BackwardBending.png‎|right|thumb|300px]]

It has been observed that the same flow can be achieved on many links at two different speeds.  Some call this the “backward-bending” phenomenon (Hau 1998, Crozet and Marlot 2001). The queueing analysis framework also has implications for “hypercongestion” or “backward-bending” flow-travel time curves, such as shown in the figure to the right.  Recall we identified two sources for “backward-bending” speed-flow relationships. The first has to do with the point of observation.  Observing the lane flow upstream of a bottleneck gives the impression of a backward bending relationship, but this disappears at the bottleneck itself.  Under any given demand pattern, flow and speed are a unique pair. When demand is below the downstream active bottleneck’s capacity, a flow on an upstream link can be achieved at high speed.  When demand is above the downstream active bottleneck’s capacity, the same flow on the upstream link can only be achieved at a low speed because of queueing.  The second has to do with a capacity drop at the bottleneck itself under congested conditions.  However, much research reports that this drop is slight to non-existent.

As in the bottleneck, we define lowercase q to be flow (vehicles per hour) departing the front of the bottleneck and uppercase Q to be flow arriving at the back of the bottleneck.  We also define k to be density (vehicles per kilometer), v to be speed (kilometers per hour), and s to be service rate (seconds per vehicle).  The fundamental diagrams of traffic flow (q-k-v curves) represent a model of traffic flow as stylized in the traditional textbook representation of the fundamental diagram of traffic flow.  The reasons why q should drop as k increases beyond a certain point at an isolated bottleneck are unclear.  In other words, why should flow past a point drop just because the number of vehicles behind that point increases?  Why should leading traffic be influenced by the behavior of following traffic?  

If traffic behaves as a queue through a bottleneck (illustrated above), we should consider reasons why traffic flow departing the queue would not stay at its maximum.  

One reason is if the vehicles in the queue could not travel fast enough so that the front of the following car could not reach the point of the front of the leading car in the time allotted the service rate.  If a lane serves 1800 vehicles per hour, it serves 1 vehicle every 2 seconds, we say there is a 2 second service rate.  If there were a 10 meter spacing between the vehicles (including the vehicle length plus a physical gap), this implies that the service rate would be worse than 1 vehicle every 2 seconds only if it took longer than 2 seconds to travel 10 meters (i.e. speed &lt; 18 km /hour).   This is very slow traffic and may properly be called hypercongestion.  Why would traffic get that slow if freeflow speed is 120 km / hour?  In general traffic departing the front of the queue won’t be traveling that slowly, as the shockwave that reduces speed (the wave of red brake lights) has moved to the back of the queue.  

A second reason the bottleneck flow might drop is if the departure flow is affected by external sources, namely a bottleneck further downstream spilling backwards.  If the queue at a downstream bottleneck becomes sufficiently long, it will reduce the number of vehicles that can depart the upstream bottleneck.  This is because the first bottleneck is no longer controlling, the downstream bottleneck is.

A third reason that bottleneck flow might drop is if the bottleneck is not being fully served (slots for cars are going unfilled).  If vehicles are separated by large time headways, then the bottleneck might lose capacity. Thus, if vehicles choose large gaps, the bottleneck flow might drop.  However, in congested situations, vehicles tend to follow more closely, not less closely.

For an isolated bottleneck, the departure flow remains (essentially) a constant and arrival flow varies.  As more vehicles arrive at the back of the queue, the expected wait at the queue increases.  All vehicles will eventually be served.  In general, there is no practical constraint on the number of vehicles arriving at the back of the queue, but there is a maximum output flow in vehicles per unit time.  Examining traffic upstream of the bottleneck is interesting, but does not get to the root of the problem – the bottleneck itself.  This view of hypercongestion is thus not inconsistent with the conclusion drawn by Small and Chu (1997) that the hypercongested region is unsuitable for use as a supply curve in congestion pricing analyses.

== Thought Question ==

'''Problem'''

Bottlenecks are shown here to be the main cause of traffic flow congestion and queueing.  The examples given are of lane drops, which are not very common (some drivers think they're more common than they actually are).  Is this the only way a bottleneck can form?

'''Solution'''

Absolutely not.  A bottleneck is defined as a constriction of traffic flow, where demand exceeds available capacity.  Infrastructure-wise, a bottleneck would be where a lane drop is present, where lane widths decrease, or a sight obstruction lowers the natural free-flow speed.  However, bottlenecks can also form because of traffic.  Chaotic traffic, primarily where lane changing is occurring, is a prime source of a bottleneck.  On-ramps, off-ramps, and weaving areas are the most common examples, but there are many more.  Think about how often you have been stuck in standstill traffic where a lane drop is not present.

'''Mystery with the name (GNUger) :'''

I am a GNU/Linux enthusiastic and a budding Programmer.. also a die hard lover of tigers .. So a hybrid of GNU + tiger has made me GNUger....  There is one more reason behind the name, acronym GNU : GNU is not Unix which is recursive and  forms a infinite series, furthermore word Anant means Infinity ... 


'''Present Status :'''

I am a engineering student majoring Information Technology, from NIT Bhopal  and now in 2nd Year. I work on OSS and have a special proficiency in GNU/Linux systems. I am trying my hands on Bash and Mono. I am also a guitarist, Hawaiian though but will learn Spanish by any means in nearby future.
 

'''Interests and Activities:'''

I love programming in C/C++ and developing new algorithms, you can visit my blog for recent updates. I also love photography and soon I will upload some of my works. In my off time  I do give a try to multimedia like working in GIMP/Photoshop and also love playing FPS (though I don't have any games on my PC). I am quite active at forums particularly ThinkDigit and love Troubleshooting. Entered into the world of blogging recently.
 

'''Education:'''

I have got my elementary education till STD. IV from a school nearby my house named RKK Shikhsha Sadan, Raniganj and was later admitted to RLJDMC DAV Public School, Raniganj where I studied till STD VIII and moved to a new school 26+KMs from my house at Durgapur, where I spent my last 4 years of schooling, D.A.V. Model School, Durgapur. I don't have a special affection with my school but still I recall my Farewell day and friends there. Now finally I am in NIT Bhopal popularly known as MANIT (Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology), opting for a B.Tech course for 4 years majoring Information Technology and hopefully will leave this place by June,2011.

This used to be the main line, mostly out of Fischer's theoretical work. Today it is considered the sharpest line, with sacrifices on d5, b2, g7, and f7, and other such things. Mostly it is because of the large mass of variations that stem from this position. Today, however, the variation has rather fallen out of favor due to the increasing popularity of the Poisoned Pawn Variation after 7...Qb6.

==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Learning Objectives Of Reader&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

:::*Be able to comprehend the important role that journals have in the classroom.
:::*Understand how journals can be used as an assessment method.  
:::*Comprehend examples of using journals for language, math and science.





==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Who ever said assessment wasn't fun?  That is old news as journals are invading the classrooms!  Journals have become a wonderful non-traditional assessment tool that falls under the category of personal communication.  Teachers are understanding the role that journals have in the classroom and the benefits they provide for students.  Journals aren't just for writing your deepest and darkest secrets while being kept hidden under your mattress!  Throughout this article you will understand that the purpose of a journal is to allow students to have a voice.  A voice that reflects their understanding and knowledge on a subject instead of just reiterating another person's ideas that they have memorized word-for-word.  It is an informal style of writing that results in a student thinking for themselves.  



==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream For Journals!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

All the interest in journals is due to the fact that this type of personal communication encourages students to look at subjects and facts that they may have been intimidated by so the student feels more adventurous and willing to explore their ideas in writing (White, 2008).  Journals aren't just for writing either; they can also involve drawing, painting and role-playing (Miami Museum of Science, 2008).  If journaling is done correctly it can provide the following information:

:::::*&quot;Help students pinpoint what they know and don't know.
:::::*Connect previous knowledge with what the student is currently studying.
:::::*Summarize what the student understands and their knowledge on a topic.
:::::*Help students understand important questions to ask.
:::::*Help student keep his or her thoughts more organized.
:::::*Support an interdisciplinay approach to education.
:::::*Help student see in a more visual approach to learning.
:::::*Allow student to take a tentative idea and make it more permanent&quot; (Burchfield, 2005).


Students with a journal generally have clearer thoughts and an increased ability to explain a concept while the teacher can truly grasp the type of learner that student really is.

'''Using Journals In Math'''

[http://www.geocities.com/kaferico/writemat.htm?200812]

This is a fantastic website for teachers to use journals in Math class.  You can even click on a PDF of a Math Journal!
'''This is a must see!''' 

(Geocities.com, 2008)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



















==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Journal:  A Teacher's Best Friend&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

The timing of a journal assignment includes different options with before, during, or after a lesson.  There are two general types of journals in a classroom:  1.  A journal that students are given very little direction on and the student writes down their thoughts, feelings and ideas, 2.  A journal where the student is given a prompt or a specific topic to write on that has boundaries and guidelines needed for accuracy (Miami Museum of Science, 2008).  Some teachers assign journal writing without grades.  If this is the case, then the teacher will be more apt to correct grammar and spelling and make comments and appropriate praise.  Journals also can be used for more class discussion and participation.  If a student writes their ideas and understandings down on paper, then greater class discussion results.  According to Hillocks, if a teacher uses journals in the classroom it allows that teacher to not only look through a window into how the student is thinking and learning, but ''how'' they learn.  In other words, a journal shows if a student is struggling with a subject, their strengths and weaknesses, and if there are any misconceptions involved in learning.  

According to Burchfied, Journals also answer specific questions for a teacher:

:::::*Can the student organize information?
:::::*Can the student explain a specific concept?
:::::*Does the student use communication skills correctly to communicate an idea?
:::::*Is the student confident in his or her abilities?
:::::*What is the student feeling?
:::::*Is the student's response coherent and well-structured (Burchfield, et al, 200


To give credit to journals for an assessment method is an understatement.  It is obvious that journals provide a deeper depth and understanding into a student, which can only benefit teachers.  Journals can be as simple as loose leaf papers in a folder, a spiral notebook labeled Journal, or store bought journals.




==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;To Grade Or Not To Grade...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Grades are not necessary in journaling, but it is suggested to follow a specific rubric if assigning a grade.   If grades are not given on a specific assignment, here are some great ideas on assessing a student's journal (Burchfield, et al., 2005):

:::::*Because some of the writing is informal it is best to focus on content rather than mechanics.
:::::*Be positive, encouraging and accepting of the student's writing.
:::::*Single out one or two things to comment on and don't undertake the entire journal.
:::::*Be specific when you comment on a specific problem.
:::::*When appropriate, have students edit one another's journal.
:::::*Ask students to read aloud, when appropriate, so the classroom becomes more conducive to sharing and confidence levels increase.
:::::*After students have completed three journal entries, ask them to choose their best entry, revise it and have other students begin peer 
::::::editing.
:::::*Allow for more revisions after peer editing and grading then post it on a classroom blog or website.


Again, grading isn't always a definite with journals and should be left up to the discretion of the teacher.



==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Examples of Journal Assignments:  Don't Enter The Classroom Without Them!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Different Types of Journals&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''


&lt;big&gt;'''Daily Journals'''&lt;/big&gt;         

::::*My most embarrassing moment...
::::*What I would like to change about school...
::::*My best friend is...
::::*The best thing that ever happened to me...
::::*The saddest thing that ever happened to me...
::::*What I want to be when I grow up...
::::*If I could change the world I would...


&lt;big&gt;'''Specific Subject Prompts'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Math'''&lt;/big&gt;

::::*Does math scare you?
::::*Design two mathematical bumper stickers--one funny and one serious.
::::*If I were better at math, I would...
::::*If math could be a color (shape or sound) it would be...because...
::::*My best kept secret about math is...
::::*What kind of math figure are you?  (Circle, square, triangle, parallelogram, etc.)  Why? 

(Geocities.com, 2008)


&lt;big&gt;'''Language'''&lt;/big&gt;

::::*Record in journal your personal thoughts and feelings after reading &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot; (or any book the student has read)
::::*What does Anne's diary tell us about her? (or any main character of a book)
::::*If you could talk to Anne, what would you ask her? (or any author)
::::*Give a different ending to the book you just finished.
::::*What if you were the main character?
::::*Explain how you feel the character was like in the book.
::::*Draw a picture of a scene from the book and write a sentence underneath.
::::*Across the top of your journal write WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHY and WHEN...answer all these questions.
::::*Pick a President and write a letter to them about what you wish would be different and why?
::::*If you could have dinner with any past or present famous person who would it be and why?
::::*Student writes a paragraph using three vocabulary words written on the board.
::::*Write four Jeopardy style questions based on the lesson you were just taught.

(Teachervision.com, 2007)


&lt;big&gt;'''Science'''&lt;/big&gt;

::::*Have students record any science experiment results over a period of time.
::::*Record the amount of snowfall over a 2 week period, along with the temperature outside at time of snowfall and the amount of snow.
::::*Record in journal the stages of a classroom bean seedling during growth stages.
::::*Record which cup of water (1 hot, 1 cold and 1 room temp)freezes first and how long it took.

(Teachervision.com, 2007)
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;





==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

Journals are like a telescope into a student's mind. This type of personal communication allows students to express what they are feeling about specific topics.  It is taking learning beyond the basics to see things as they really are and not just skimming the surface.  Teachers are in the classroom for a reason, which is to impact the student academically, socially and emotionally.  A journal is simply a collection of a student's feelings, ideas and thoughts put down in black and white.  Incorporating journals into the classroom takes commitment and organization, but the payoff is an exciting and motivating way for students to learn.




==&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8E35EF&quot; face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt;Get Out Your Pencils Please:  Quiz Time&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;==

1.  Journals are an assessment method that fall under the category:

:::a.  Selected response
:::b.  Extended written response
:::c.  Performance assessment
:::d.  Personal communication


2.  If a journal is used correctly in the classroom, it can:

:::a.  Connect the student's previous knowledge to what they are currently learning.
:::b.  Tell a teacher the student deserves an A or F.
:::c.  Inform the teacher if the student needs a different seating arrangement.
:::d.  Allow the student to ignore the teacher's lesson.


3.  The benefit of a journal for a teacher is:

:::a.  One less thing to grade in an overwhelming job.
:::b.  Tells the teacher if the student can explain a specific topic.
:::c.  It helps the classroom seem less cluttered.
:::d.  Allows the teacher to learn more about the student '''except''' for how he or she is feeling.


4.  Stella has just completed an informal journal assignment for language in Mrs. Williams's classroom.  Mrs. Williams is now ready to assess
Stella's journal.  What is the best method to consider?
:::a.  It is best to focus on Stella's content rather than the mechanics of her journal.
:::b.  Because it is an informal journal assignment, Stella should receive a specific grade.
:::c.  Not even grade Stella's journal because it would focus on her character and not her capability.
:::d.  Never asses a journal because it is to be used as a &quot;filler&quot; assignment when there is free time.


5.  Mrs. Williams has just assigned a journal assignment after all the students read &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot;  She wants to compare and assess what the students predicted the diary meant to Anne Frank before they read the book and what they feel it meant to her after they finished the book.  Why would Mrs. Williams be assessing this?

:::a.  She can't think of another prompt for a journal topic.
:::b.  The students seem like they are losing interest and this is a great way to motivate them.
:::c.  She wants to assess if the students have fully grasped the concept of the diary and how it become a source of support for Anne Frank.
:::d.  She knows Anne Frank is covered on the VA SOL and she feels this would be a good way to teach the students.

&lt;big&gt;The Negative Aspects of Standardized Testing&lt;/big&gt;

By: Kathryn Morris

=='''Learning Targets'''==
By reading this article, the reader should gain an understanding about the negative problems that standardized testing creates.  They should learn about how students do not gain the in depth educational value from the multiple choice questions on these tests that they would from other types of assessments.  The reader will also learn about the limitations that standardized tests place on the curriculum taught to students by the teachers, as well as the biases that these tests can have.  Finally, the reader will learn about the anxiety created by these tests for students and teachers due to the adequate yearly progress that is mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act.

=='''Introduction'''==
Standardized testing has become a prevalent normality in the public schools in the United States due to the standards put into place by the No Child Left Behind Act.  Public schools all over the country are reliant on the scores from these tests given to their children.  Because of No Child Left Behind, every student in third grade to twelfth grade must be tested by state standardized tests.  While these tests can be used by the state and national government to determine whether or not schools are meeting their specified adequate yearly progress or not, there are also many negative aspects of these tests.

 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

 

=='''Memorization vs. Evaluation'''==
By making students take standardized tests, they are not required to apply their knowledge of the information that has been taught to them by their teachers.  To save time and money, most of these tests that are given to students consist of only multiple choice questions (Winerip, 2006).  With this type of test they simply have to recall information and memorize facts that they know will appear on the tests. Multiple choice questions do not require them to apply or evaluate the information they learned (Winerip, 2006).  While multiple choice standardized tests may be good for the states because they save time and money, they may not be the most beneficial to the students taking them for their educational future.

=='''Limited Curriculum'''==
Standardized tests can also be detrimental to the teachers who are educating the children.  The curriculum that they are required to teach is severely limited to the material that they are told will be on the test.  This practice of teaching is referred to as “teaching to the test” due to the fact that the teachers do not get much of a chance to teacher other pertinent information (National Center for Fair and Open Testing, 2007).  Because of the pressure placed onto the teachers for their children to do well on these tests, they are forced to allow ample time for the children to learn this specified material.  This does not allow much time, if any, for the teachers to expand the curriculum to teach things that may be more interesting or fun for the children.  Creative and interesting teaching methods are halted in order to teach children what is required for the standardized tests (National Center for Fair and Open Testing, 2007). Some teachers are now quitting their jobs due to the unhappiness that they are experiencing caused by testing (Solley, 2007).  

=='''Test Anxiety'''==
It is no secret that taking tests can severely increase student’s anxiety.  Now, students have severe pressure placed onto them to perform well on these standardized tests, so their anxiety increases (Solley, 2007).  Beginning in third grade, students know that they are required to do well on these tests and therefore may have great anxiety before the tests (Phillips, 2006).  According to the Washington Post, researchers have found that test anxiety affects about 25% of American students today to various degrees (Can Exam Anxiety Be Overcome?, 2004).  They have said that the majority of these children are in 3rd to 5th grade.  These children may be fearful that they will not meet the requirements to pass the test, which would in turn be detrimental to their educational careers.  

=='''Biased Tests'''==
These tests given to students could also be very biased.  For the most part, questions on standardized tests are written on the norms of white, middle class Americans (Phillips, 2006).  Students falling into other categories than these, such as African-Americans, Asians, and those living in poverty, could be at a disadvantage when it comes to answering certain questions.  Students who are English language learners, or ELL’s could also be at a disadvantage because of the fact that English is not their first language, so language proficiency becomes an issue with them successfully completing the test (Phillips, 2006)

=='''Standardized Testing Example'''==
The sites listed above in the box provide examples of the state of Virginia's standardized test given to all students beginning in third grade.  While each state has its own name for their test, Virginia's is called the Standards of Learning.  Each year, the state department of education releases tests for students and teachers to use as a guide in preparing for future tests.  The first link is to the actual released test for third grade reading from the spring of 2007. 

The second link is to the Virginia Department of Education's SOL website.  Here, you will find all of the standards that are listed by the state that could possibly be covered on the tests.  These lists are what the teachers go by in order to teach the correct curriculum to their students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Queenside pawn majority==
This is the odd-one-out of the various strategic elements. Why did Steinitz pick a queenside pawn majority as one of the most important strategic concepts? Why isn't the kingside majority, or the central majority, more important?

To clarify, the central majority is more important for the majority of the game. However, as the game nears the endgame, a queenside pawn majority becomes more and more important. The reason lies in that of creating passed pawns. As we know, it is easiest to create a passed pawn if you have a pawn majority. However, since in the majority of games the king castles short, both kings are farther away from the queenside. And without kings, a pawn breakthrough becomes easier, since there is no enemy king to hamper the creation of a passed pawn. ''That'' is why kingside majorities are less valuable in the endgame--the king can stop pawns on its own.

==The queenside majority in the endgame==
With pieces on the board, the task is slightly more complicated, but the priority remains the same: ''Try to create a breakthrough before the enemy king arrives.'' Let's look at a game from the German master Rudolf Teschner, who shows us how to convert the majority into account.

''Position after Black's 21st move''
|}

White has a slight edge in this endgame because of his queenside pawn majority. However, both kings are located near the queenside, and if White simply tries to break through on that side of the board, it will likely be a draw. Thus, White needs to create a second front. He did so with '''22.g4!''' White takes aim at the Black kingside, with an unusual minority attack. '''22...Ne8 23.g5 hxg5 24.hxg5 Bd6 25.Nf3 g6 26.b4!''' Now that Black's kingside majority has been crippled (the f-pawn cannot advance and the entire majority of three is held back by White's minority of two), White can continue going about his business on the queenside. '''26...Be7 27.Kb2 Nd6 28.c5 Nf5 29.Qe4 Ke8 30.Qe5! Qxe5 31.Bxe5''' The trade of queens does not relieve the pressure on Black's position. All it did was deny Black any counterplay against White's king. '''31...a5 32.a3 axb4 33.axb4 Bd8 34.Kb3 Ne7 35.Nd2 Nd5 36.Ne4 Be7''' White has made significant progress. He has advanced his majority and crippled Black's. His &quot;bad&quot; bishop confines the activity of Black's &quot;good&quot; bishop. The majority is not actually doing anything, but it is holding Black's king down with the threat of b4-b5 and c5-c6. That threat became real after White's subsequent '''37.Bf6!''' Now the exchanges on f6 would lead to a hopeless king-and-pawn endgame, so Black retreats even further back: '''37...Bf8 38.Kc4 Kd7 39.b5 Kc8 40.Nd2 Kd7 41.Nf3 Be7 42.Ne5+ Ke8 43.Bxe7 Kxe7 44.Ng4''' This ending is winning for White. Black's pieces are still tied down to the defense of the queenside. '''44...Nf4 45.Nf6 Kd8 46.b6''' Now the threat is 47.c6, creating a decisive breakthrough. '''46...e5 47.Ne4 Kd7 48.Nd6 Nh3 49.Nxb7 Nxg5 50.Kd5''' and Black resigns. The threat of creating a passed pawn from the queenside majority proved to be decisive in the last half of the game.

Note that often the case is that the stronger side has threats, but cannot find a meaningful way to break through. In this case, another weakness must be created elsewhere, and through the stronger side's superior mobility, switch attacks from one wing to another, so that the defender cannot parry all of the threats. Also, the pawn majority was nearly motionless until the end: however, it played a crucial role in the preceding battle.

==Pawn majorities in the middlegame==
Much of the time in the middlegame, pawn majorities can be a precondition for attack. This next game was played by seventh World Champion Vassily Smyslov. Although not #1 yet, his skillful mastery in this game shows how to milk the advantages of a queenside majority.

| '''Gereban--Smyslov, Moscow 1949''' 
''Position after White's 21st move''
|}

Black has a majority of pawns on the queenside. White must use his pieces to blockade them, lest they become a serious threat. Because he needs to maintain this blockade, White cannot seek active play. Considering this, Smyslov decides to start a pawn attack on the kingside, opening lines and weakening the White king. '''21...f5 22.Nc2 Nf7 23.Be7 Bf6 24.Bxf6 Nxf6 25.Nb4''' Because Black is attacking, White needs to find counterplay, and finds some in pressure on the d5-pawn. '''25...Bb7 26.Bf3 Qd8 27.g3''' Weakening the White king position. However, there is little else to do. The idea is good--transfer the bishop to g2 and apply more pressure to d5. However, Black refutes this maneuver quite simply. '''27...Ng5 28.Bg2 Nge4 29.Nxe4 Nxe4 30.Nc2''' Of course capturing on e4 would leave the kingside bare. '''30...g5 31.Ne1 Qf6!''' Instead of trying to win the Exchange, Black instead continues building up for the attack. '''32.Nf3 f4 33.exf4 gxf4 34.g4''' White has temporarily kept the lines closed. Remember that he must leave forces on the queenside to blockade the pawns. '''34...Rad8 35.Rfe1 h5 36.Ne5 hxg4 37.hxg4''' Now Black opens a different file, and swings his heavy pieces to the h-file to attack. '''37...Qh4 38.Qf3 Rd6 39.Rad1 Rf8 40.Bf1 Rh6 41.Bg2 b4!''' The power of the queenside pawn majority finally shows itself. White still struggled on: '''42.Kf1 Ng5 43.Qe2 f3''' Winning a piece. The game is won for Black here. '''44.Nxf3 Nxf3 45.Bxf3 Rhf6 46.Kg2 Rxf3 47.Qxf3 Rxf3 48.Kxf3 Bc6 49.Re5 c3!''' White could hold were it not for this move. The attack has died out, but the queenside majority lives! '''50.bxc3 bxc3 51.Rc1 Qh3+ 52.Kf4 Bd7 53.Re3 Qxg4+''' Actually, the attack still continues, so it appears that my last comment was bogus! '''54.Ke5 Qe6+ 55.Kf4 Qf5+ 56.Kg3 c2''' The majority makes its final blow., so '''White resigns'''.

==Majority vs. minority--The minority attack==
After the moves '''1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Nbd7 5.cxd5 exd5 6.Nf3 Be7 7.e3 O-O 8.Bd3 Re8 9.O-O c6 10.Qc2 Nf8''', we reach a topical position of the Queen's Gambit Declined. It features a spine of pawns that is not easily broken, because pawn breaks by either side would lead to a weak d-pawn. So, both players must work on the wings.

Here White's best plan is regarded as being the '''Minority Attack''', which features a minority attacking a majority of pawns. Here White usually plays '''11.Rab1''' to prepare b2-b4-b5, and exchanging on c6. The point of this maneuver is to create a weak c-pawn that will last the entire game. If Black ever tries to exchange it off with ...c6-c5, then after dxc5 he will receive a weak d-pawn. And without this, White still has a clear endgame advantage. Simple, and winning, right? 

The answer is no. Black also gets good play on the side of the board where he has space, the kingside. Usually this involves sacrifices on h3 and g2 to weaken the kingside light squares. The outpost on e4 is also extensively used. '''11...Ne6 12.Bxf6 Bxf6 13.b4 a6 14.a4 Be7 15.b5''' White is considered to have an edge here, because Black's kingside attack usually is just a little too slow to develop.

Yes, journalism can take up a large amount of mental space, but it's quite fulfilling. I'm looking forward to getting my students involved in reading something every day - hopefully a news Web site at least.

Im not gonna lie, I got a nice little laugh out of reading your about me! It's funny to me because you said that you can relate to kids better than adults. I think that I have that same capability too! I think it is important for every teacher to be able to commuicate to their kids; and the fact that you can get down on their level with them is awesome!

[[User:Epopl001|Epopl001]] ([[User talk:Epopl001|talk]]) 19:24, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

I too have a passion for writing.  I'm not that good at it, but I plan on working hard on getting better.  I also decided to teach as my job and then write as a hobby.  Even though I like English, I have decided to become a high school math teacher.  People have said that I have a knack for math, and I guess it is true. 
I wish you luck in your writing!

I've added a note to inform users and enable any willing to push for a resolution of the problem (it seems an extension can be used or some setting changed).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:09, 5 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Delete this page ==
The template include size is exceeded on this page and therefore not everything shows up, not to mention it takes five minutes to load.  The book is too large to use a combined print version.  Chapter print versions should be linked to and someone wanting a copy can print all of them.  This page is not operational or manageable.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:25, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:Until a workable alternative is found, I wave added a warning noting that a the by chapter versions will have to do for now. Deletion would be premature as this is a technical limitation that seems to have a technical solution, and there are some advantages on the used setup.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:15, 5 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cquote|It took thousands, nay, millions of years for humankind to evolve to the point where its opposable thumbs allowed the species to finally achieve success in its tumultuous struggle to twist open a beer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;''--The Official Harvard Student Agencies Bartending Course, 3rd Edition''&lt;/small&gt;}}

Welcome to the '''Wikibooks Bartending Guide'''. This is a work-in-progress, written and edited by ordinary people, both with extensive and limited knowledge about bartending. Upon completion, this book could serve as a textbook giving a person new to bartending a good overview of bartending as a career. It will also contain a guide to bar layout, equipment, drinkware, utensils, and other tools of the trade. What book would be complete without comprehensive information about the various types of alcohol, mixers, and garnishes used to make cocktails and other mixed drinks? Our drink recipe library also is quite extensive, with both historical and very modern cocktails included.

Although the terms &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bartender&quot;, and &quot;bartending&quot; are used throughout the book, that is just for simplicity. A '''bar''' in this book includes a public house, pub, nightclub, tavern, meeting place, fraternal organization, hotel, restaurant, private home, or any other place that serves alcoholic beverages. A '''bartender''' is a person in the bar preparing drinks for people, which is not necessarily the same person who serves the drinks. '''Bartending''' refers to the many tasks a bartender performs and the duties expected of the bartender; it also refers to the industry in which bartenders work.

At present, the book strongly reflects the bartending industry of the United States, and to lesser degrees, the United Kingdom and Canada. Wherever possible, we have attempted to include a worldwide view of the industry, but since most of the current contributors are from the U.S., U.K., and Canada, we need the help of people to add relevant local information about the industry in their own countries to the book.

Please refer to Appendix C for suggestions on how you can help improve this textbook. If you plan to edit occasionally or more often, please join the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending|WikiProject Bartending]] so we can work together in a coordinated manner to complete this book. Thanks!

We hope you enjoy this book and find it useful!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending|WikiProject]] uses the following structure and hierarchy of [[WB:MODULE|modules]] within the [[Bartending]] Wikibook. It is our intention to keep the book wide, rather than deep. In other words, pages should rarely be more than three levels away from the root of the book ([[Bartending|Bartending/]]), and should never be deeper than five levels (Bartending/2/3/4/5). Module and page names should be as short as possible while still clearly communicating the topic. In many cases, the full name of the topic can be deduced easily from the full name (&quot;Bartending/Drinkware/Beer&quot; is preferred to &quot;Bartending/Drinkware/Beer glasses, mugs, and steins&quot;). The shorter names help both when typing names manually, and when locating articles from within categories.

==Hierarchy of [[Bartending]] modules==
* &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending|Bartending/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; All other sections are underneath this root module. Pages that are [[w:Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]] into the main page of the Bartending Guide may also appear here.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Alcohol|Bartending/Alcohol/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Information about specific types (and brands if necessary) of alcohol appear in this module. Page names should always be singular ([[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirit]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Brandy]], etc.).
*** This module is also the preferred place to include information concerning alcohol poisoning, intoxication, and other effects of alcohol on the body.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Beverages|Bartending/Beverages/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; We use ''Beverages'' to distinguish non-alcoholic beverages (like coffee, iced tea, or milkshakes) from alcoholic ones (see ''Bartending/Cocktails'' below). If a drink is commonly served either way, include the drink in both modules, and use a redirect (see below) to point to the appropriate section.
*** ''Example:'' Eggnog is served commonly with brandy and without. The main article could be found at [[Bartending/Cocktails/Eggnog]] and [[Bartending/Beverages/Eggnog]] could be a redirect to [[Bartending/Cocktails/Eggnog#Non-alcoholic variations]]. If the non-alcoholic version is more common, reverse the modules.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Books|Bartending/Books/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Complete books, chapters of books, magazine articles, or lengthy excerpts from these should be added to this module. Create an explanatory page that gives the full source, copyright and licensing information (remember that is must be [[wikibooks:Copyrights|compatibly licensed]] or in the [[Wikibooks:Public domain|public domain]] to be included in Wikibooks!), as well as a synopsis of the book and how it relates to bartending (if it's not obvious by the title).
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/CA|Bartending/CA/]]''', '''[[Bartending/UK|Bartending/UK/]]''', '''[[Bartending/US|Bartending/US/]]''', etc.:&lt;/big&gt; Country-specific information should always be placed in a module named with the country's 2-letter [[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|country code]] in all-capital letters. This helps readers clearly identify information that is country-specific as opposed to global in nature. Information within the main book that is very country-specific should be split into a similarly named article within the country-specific module. Examples: [[Bartending/Work/Understanding tips and taxation]], [[Bartending/EU/European tips and taxation]], [[Bartending/US/U.S. tips and taxation]], etc.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Cocktails|Bartending/Cocktails/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Drink recipes, classes of cocktails, and other cocktail-specific information goes in this module. &quot;Cocktail&quot; is a very broad term in this case. It basically means any ''alcoholic'' beverage served to a patron, even if served [[Bartending/Cocktails/Neat|neat]].
*** '''[[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary|Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]]''': This is a single-page module that currently holds a very long list of drink recipes and links to longer articles. It needs to be completely reorganized soon.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Drinkware|Bartending/Drinkware/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; From stemware to coffee mugs, anything used as a drinking vessel to serve drinks should be included in this module. For words that can be written as a single word or as two words (wineglass or [[Bartending/Drinkware/Wine|wine glass]]), at this time, we prefer using two words to clearly distinguish the purpose from the form (this is same way [[Bartending/Books/Thomas: How To Mix Drinks|Jerry Thomas]] did it). When naming pages, we omit the &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;mug&quot;, or other designation from the name, avoiding the whole issue: [[Bartending/Drinkware/Wine]], [[Bartending/Drinkware/Coffee]], [[Bartending/Drinkware/Water]], etc.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Equipment|Bartending/Equipment/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; All types of appliances, utensils, and other tools a bartender uses, except [Bartending/Drinkware|drinkware]], should be in this module. Page names should usually be singular ([[Bartending/Equipment/Shaker]], [[Bartending/Equipment/Bottle opener]], etc.), unless the equipment would normally never be used singly or is a plural word ([[Bartending/Equipment/Scissors]]), or if the page discusses a broad grouping of equipment ([[Bartending/Equipment/Appliances]]).
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Garnishes|Bartending/Garnishes/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Non-liquid drink ingredients (except [[Bartending/Mixers/Ice|ice]]; see ''Bartending/Mixers/'' below) and adornments to the glass, whether edible or not, usually belong in this module. Page names should usually be singular ([[Bartending/Garnishes/Olive]], [[Bartending/Garnishes/Inedible garnish]], etc.), unless the garnish would normally never be served singly or is a plural word ([[Bartending/Garnishes/Beads]]).
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Intro|Bartending/Intro/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Basic information that gives an overview of the bartending industry should appear in this module.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Mixers|Bartending/Mixers/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Any liquid ingredient that goes into the drink probably belongs in this module, including [[Bartending/Mixers/Ice|ice]] (which becomes a liquid as it melts). Page names should usually be singular ([[Bartending/Mixers/Simple syrup]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Hot sauce]], etc.), unless the mixer would normally never be served singly or is a plural word ([[Bartending/Mixers/Angostura bitters]])
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Project|Bartending/Project/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Project pages are concerned with developing the Wikibook itself. These should generally be avoided. The goal of a Wikibook is to create a stand-alone textbook that someone could print and use in an educational setting. It makes no sense for such a book to include length commentary about how the project is organized and maintained. Instead, that information belongs in the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending]] space, since the WikiProject exists solely to organize, expand, and maintain the [[Bartending|Bartending Guide]]. For historical reasons, that information has not (yet) been moved, but as the book matures, the information will be migrated into the WikiProject. The credits, however, may remain behind, since that might be of interest to the reader and may even be required by the [[Wikibooks:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]].
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Quotations|Bartending/Quotations/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Quotations should be added to the main [[Bartending/Quotations|quotations]] page, unless there are a lot (10 or more) of quotations from a single source, in which case a sub-page should be added.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Reference|Bartending/Reference/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; Reference material, such as tables, charts, and glossaries should be filed here. If a reference item has multiple pages of information, subpages should be created under the first page to keep related material together.
** &lt;big&gt;'''[[Bartending/Work|Bartending/Work/]]''':&lt;/big&gt; This module includes articles about the working life of a bartender, including:
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Age verification|Bartending/Work/Age verification/]]''': Information about why bars verify age and how to go about doing so should be included in this module. Country-specific requirements belong under the specific country's module (see ''Bartending/CA/'' above).
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Cleaning|Bartending/Work/Cleaning/]]''': Both general information about cleaning and best practices go in this module.
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Employees|Bartending/Work/Employees/]]''': Information about bar employees belong in this module.
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Servicing patrons|Bartending/Work/Servicing patrons/]]''': Suggestions for how to serve patrons belong in this module.
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Stock maintenance and rotation|Bartending/Work/Stock maintenance and rotation/]]''': Suggestions for how to keep your stock fresh go here.
*** '''[[Bartending/Work/Training|Bartending/Work/Training/]]''': Information about training to become a bartender. Country-specific requirements belong under the specific country's module (see ''Bartending/CA/'' above).

==Redirecting to a different page==
At present, we have many more links than we have articles. There are links within the book for nearly every type of alcohol, garnish, or mixer on the market, yet we do not have articles for each of them. In many cases, there is a single page that discusses many different related topics.

We would like to eventually have enough information added to the book so that each page can stand on its own. Until then, we need to [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirect]] the specific topic's page to the section within the larger page where the desired information is.

For example, [[Bartending/Alcohol/Orange liqueur#Grand_Marnier|Bartending/Alcohol/Grand Marnier]] redirects to the &quot;Grand Marnier&quot; section of the [[Bartending/Alcohol/Orange liqueur]] article (the full link is [[Bartending/Alcohol/Orange liqueur#Grand Marnier]]).

Here is how to do that:

:1. Follow the [[Help:Glossary#red link|red link]] (if there is one) to the page that needs a redirect or else type the full page name in the Search box, select &quot;Go&quot;, and then select the link to edit a new article.
:2. Add one of the following lines of text into the new page. Be sure to insert the correct article name where &quot;''ARTICLE''&quot; appears below, and the heading name where &quot;''HEADING''&quot; appears. Include all punctuation included in both the article name and heading, or else the redirect will not work.

::''When linking to a specific section within a larger article use:''
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''''ARTICLE'''''#'''''HEADING'''''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

::''When linking to a specific entry within a list of related information use:''
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''''ARTICLE'''''#'''''HEADING'''''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

::''When linking to a general topic that is not as specific as the given topic and that does not contain a specific section abut the topic use:''
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;#REDIRECT [[&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''''ARTICLE'''''#'''''HEADING'''''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

:3. Test the redirect to make sure that you end up where you wanted the reader to be redirected.
:4. Select the link at the top of the page that says &quot;Redirected from ARTICLE&quot; to return to the actual redirect page.
:5. Select the &quot;What links here&quot; link in the Toolbox for the page (if you are using the default Monobook skin, it appears just below the Search box on the left of the page).
:6. Check for any [[w:Wikipedia:Double redirects|double redirects]]. These sometimes happen when an article was moved or renamed, and there was already a page pointing to the old name, and then when you add the new redirect, it becomes a double redirect. Readers are stopped after the first redirect and must manually click-through to the final page, which interferes with the reader's use of the book.
:7. If double redirects were found, go to the original article and update the original link to point to the new redirect you created instead of the older redirect causing the double redirect.
::''Example:'' If [[Bartending/Cocktail/Boilermaker]] has an old link to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer|Bartending/Ingredients/Fermented beverages/Beer]], and that old link redirects to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer]] (the first redirect), and the Beer article had not been split out of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Fermented beverage]] yet, then [[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer]] might redirect to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Fermented beverage#Beer]] (the second redirect). In this case, we would want to edit the [[Bartending/Cocktail/Boilermaker]] article and update it to link directly to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer]]. Why not to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Fermented beverage#Beer]]? Because we eventually want to have a separate Beer page, so it is best to point directly to the desired page instead of section of a page. This also makes it easier to update links in the future if an article is moved, split, or merged.

If all of that sounds too complicated, please do as much as you feel comfortable doing, and then add a request to the [[wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/To do|to-do list]], and someone else will finish making the changes for you. Be sure to tell exactly what the next step is that needs to be done, and what pages are involved. Thanks!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Disease Defence=

Our front line defence consists of a few things, and our overall defence has physical, chemical and cellular elements. The front line defence could be considered our skin, which provides an effective blocking mechanism for disease, combined with blood clotting that prevents pathogens entering through wounds. If pathogens reach the airway, the epithelial layer that covers the airways should prevent their entry, as should the mucus stop them, hydrochloric acid in the stomach kills the bacteria we ingest with our food. 

Our immune response is helped massively by lymphocytes, which produce a special type of protein known as an antibody which acts against a certain antigen (foreign molecule), and is specific to this antigen. These antibodies are only secreted when the appropriate antigen is encountered and this may take several weeks to build up enough first time this happens (which is why you feel ill the first time you get chickenpox for example), but if the pathogen is spotted again there is a very rapid response that prevents even symptoms appearing.

==Cells of the immune system==

Bone marrow provides the cells of our immune system, and they are separated into two groups; 

*Phagocytes (including neutrophils and macrophages)
*Lymphocytes


See this light micrograph for a blood smear showing a monocyte (develops into a macrophage), a neutrophil and a lymphocyte. : [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/hematology/HessImages/Monocyte--lymphocyte--neutrophil-50x-website-arrow.jpg]

===Phagocytes===

Phagocytes are constantly produced throughout a humans lifespan by the bone marrow and are stored there before being distributed in the blood. Their function is to remove any dead cells or invasive micro-organisms. 

Macrophages are a type of phagocyte that are more often found in organs - they leave the bone marrow and travel as monocytes, developing into macrophages once they settle into organs. They are long-lived cells and are vital in initiating the immune response since they do not destroy pathogens but cut them up to display antigens for lymphocytes to recognise.

Neutrophils are also type of phagocyte, smaller than macrophages and are around 60% of the bodies white blood cells - they patrol the body looking for invasion and can leave the blood by going through the capillaries into the tissues. During infection they are released en masse by have a short-lived cells.

===Phagocytosis===

When under attack large mobile cells ('''mast cells''') release histamine, and also the chemicals released by the pathogens attract passing neutrophils to the site - these neutrophils then destroy the pathogens via phagocytosis. Neutrophils recognise antigen molecules on the surface of the pathogens and attach to them, and the neutrophils plasma membrane then engulfs the pathogen and traps it in a vesicle (known as a '''phagosome'''). Lysosomes within the phagocyte release digestive enzymes (lytic enzymes) into the phagosome. This breaks down the pathogen and the products are absorbed by the phagocyte. This results in inflammation of the site of infection where the swollen area contains the dead pathogens and phagocytes (also known as pus).

===Lymphocytes===

Lymphocytes are smaller than phagocytes, but have a large nucleus that fills most of the cell (see the picture above). The two types are B and T lymphocyte cells. Only mature lymphocytes partake in the immune response, and many different types will develop - each type is specialised to respond to one antigen. The immune response depends on B and T cells interacting with each other to provide an effective defence. T cells are the coordinators, and they stimulate B cells to divide and secrete antibodies into the blood - these antibodies destroy on the antigenic pathogens and the T cells then seek out and kill any of the body's own cells.

*B lymphocyte cells (sometimes known as B-Cells) remain in the bone marrow until they are mature and then spread throughout the body, concentrating in the spleen and lymph nodes.

*T lymphocyte cells (sometimes known as T-Cells) leave the bone marrow and collect in the thymus gland until they mature.

====B Cells====

One B cell can make an antibody for only one type of pathogen - it is thought up to 8 million B cells can develop in each of us. Each immature B cell in the bone marrow divides to give a small number of cells able to make the same antibodies, called, appropriately, clones. They go to the plasma membrane of the bone marrow and form protein receptors, which combine specifically with one type of antigen. If this antigen enters the body, there will be mature B cells that can recognise it.

On the first invasion by the pathogens, i.e. the first time they are seen by the body, the primary response occurs -some are taken by macrophages to lymph nodes, with the macrophages exposing the pathogens antigens to the B cells in the lymph nodes. The B cells with the matching receptor respond by dividing repeatedly by mitosis, producing huge numbers over a few weeks. 

Many of these become plasma cells, producing antibodies at a rate of several thousand a second, destroying the pathogens. The other B cells become memory cells, remaining in the body for a long time, providing a rapid immune response (the secondary response) by developing plasma cells much quicker than before, destroying the pathogen before it can affect the host. This is known as the immunological memory - these memory cells often last a lifetime, explaining why we get disease such as chickenpox once and never again - however diseases such as the common cold and influenza constantly mutate, meaning that our bodies defences constantly have to be ready to deal with a new disease.

====T Cells====

T cells have specific receptors much like B cells that have a structure similar to antibodies and are again specific to one antigen. T cells are activated when their antigen is found in contact with a host cell - sometimes a macrophage exposing the antigens or an invaded body cell.

T helper cells release cytokines that stimulate the appropriate B cells to divide, and they also stimulate macrophages to carry out phagocytosis more vigorously.
Killer T cells (cytotoxic cells) search the body for invaded cells (it recognises them because they display the invaded molecules antigens on its plasma membrane's surface). Killer cells attach themselves to infected cells and secrete toxic substances to kill them and the pathogens inside.
Memory T cells are produced which remain in the body and are used in the secondary immune response.

===Antibodies===
[[Image:Antibody-labelled.svg|200px|right]]

Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) are globular glycoproteins that are found in blood and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses. An antibody always consists of four polypeptide chains, two heavy, two light - disulphide bonds hold these chains together. Each molecule has two identical antigen binding sites, formed by two types of chains, and the sequences of amino acids in these regions are known as the variables, since they determine the antigen specificity.

The hinge section (see picture) provides flexibility for the antibody molecule to bind around the antigen. Some antibodies are known as antitoxins whose job it is to block the toxins released by bacteria. 


Functions:

*Combine with viruses/toxins to prevent them from invading cells
*Attach to flagella of bacterium, restricting their movement
*Multi-binding to many bacteria at once, causing them to accumulate and prevent movement around the body
*Bursting bacteria cell walls
*Attach to bacteria making it easier for phagocytes to ingest them.


The black section of the picture is 'disulphide bonds, hinge area'. For some reason, it has not rendered correctly.

=Immunity=

Immunity as thus far described occurs during an infection, and is known as active immunity since lymphocytes are activated by antigens that have invaded the body.

==Active and Passive==

Active immunity can be natural or artificial. Natural active immunity is as described - when an organism invades the body and lymphocytes are activated by antigens to deal with it - artificial active immunity (in other words, vaccination) is the same except we are injected with active antigens (possibly weakened to ensure we are not infected) so that we do not get the disease in the future.

Passive immunity can also be natural or artificial. Artificial passive immunity is injecting human antibodies designed to deal with a specific disease, and is usually given to someone infected to said disease, so that they can fight it off and survive. This is a temporary protection, as they are foreign and will be removed by macrophages themselves, hopefully after they have destroyed the infection, for example, tetanus.

Natural passive immunity is designed to protect newborns, since their immune system is not fully developed - it is antibodies passed across the placenta, immunising (for a time), the baby against everything the mother is immunised against. Colostrum, produced by the mothers breasts is rich in antibodies and some will remain in the infants gut to prevent bacteria and viruses.

==Vaccination==

A vaccine is antigenic material, which could be a live, dead or harmless micro-organism, or perhaps a harmless form of a toxic or simply surface antigens. This allows our immune system to produce the requisite B and T cells without actually suffering the disease, mimicking natural immunity.

===Problems===

Viruses are constantly mutating and changing - the reason we cannot create a vaccine against the common cold or influenza- by the time we have, it'll have mutated and the vaccine will not be effective. These mutations are known as antigenic shift or drift. Also, diseases like malaria are eukaroytic in nature and have far more genes and thus antigens on their cell surfaces.

Also, people sometimes do not respond well to vaccinations, maybe because their immune system cannot handle it, or they do not have enough protein to make antibodies - and thus the vaccination attempt may infect them. Also, people infected with a live virus may pass it out in their faeces during the primary response, potentially infecting others. This is why we vaccinate everyone at the same time, known as herd immunity.

Some viruses evade attack by the immune system by living inside cells - plasmodium (causes malaria) enters the liver and red blood cells, protected against antibodies in the plasma. Some parasites cover their bodies in host proteins, so that the immune system cannot see them. Vaccines cannot be easily produced against these because there is a very short period of time for the immune response to occur before the pathogen hides.

==Smallpox==

Smallpox was eradicated from the world in 1980 due to an incredibly successful program from the World Health Organisation (WHO
). Smallpox is characterised by red spots containing fluid appearing all over the body, swelling the victims eyelids and sometimes 'glueing' them together - it very often scarred and blinded people. It killed 12-30% of those infected.

The eradication program had two main aspects - vaccination and surveillance. Surveillance included watching for smallpox reports, and the vaccination section meant vaccinating everyone in the household and 30 surrounding households, as well as all relatives and contacts in the area. This is known as ring vaccination, containing the transmission of the disease, destroying it at the source.

The program worked so well for a number of reasons:
*The program was particularly aggressive, and was helped by 16-17 year old 'enthusiastic vaccinators'.
*It was only a human disease, meaning it was easier to control
*One disease, one vaccine - cheap to produce.
*Easy to administer and very effective. It was a live virus, which is a very effective vaccination type.

==Measles==

Measles is a disease that causes a rash and fever, with potentially fatal complications. Measles is no longer common in the UK or most developed countries since most children are vaccinated. It and most commonly affects developing countries in places where conditions are overcrowded and insanitary. It can cause childhood blindness and severe brain damage, and is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide. 

Unlike smallpox, measles requires several booster shots to develop full immunity, and in large cities with high birth rates, it can be difficult to give boosters or even follow up cases of measles. Refugees from these areas can spread the disease around, which makes it much more difficult to treat than smallpox. Measles is highly infectious.

=Allergies=

Allergies are caused by the immune system responding inappropriately to harmless substances which can lead to severe illness. Asthma and hay fever are examples of allergic reactions - reacting to allergens that are antigenic but shouldn't cause harm. When these allergens are inhaled, B cells produce antibodies and these coat the mast cells that are found in the lining of the airways, sensitising the body to these allergens. 

Now, every time this allergen enters the body, the antibodies are stimulated to release histamine, causing the blood vessels to widen and become leaky - fluid and white blood cells leave capillaries. The area where histamines are released become hot, red and inflamed. Hay fever causes the nose and throat to become inflamed and irritated.

Asthmatics have a more serious problem - their airways are nearly always inflamed, but during an asthmatic attack this inflammation worsens. Fluid leaks from the blood into the airways and the goblet cells secrete large amounts of mucus, blocking the smaller airways with fluid. This forces the muscles to contract, narrowing the airways and increasing air flow resistance. This makes breathing very difficult and can have fatal consequences. Asthma is a condition that is currently getting worse, 1/7 children in the UK have asthma. It has been linked to increased air pollution and passive smoking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Projection-screen-home2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|HDTV on a projector screen in a home theater]]
'''Digital television''' (DTV) is a set of new technologies and transmission standards that offer several advances over the [[w:analog television|analog television]] technology that has been used for more than a half-century of television transmission.  

Through the use of [[w:data compression|data compression]], approximately ten times as much audiovisual information can be sent over a single channel, allowing for either much higher-quality video ([[w:high-definition television|high-definition television]], aka HDTV), or multiple standard-quality video programs transmitted via a single channel.

Digital television can be received via digital [[w:satellite television|satellite television]] services, [[w:digital cable|digital cable]], or digital [[w:terrestrial digital television|broadcast television]].  Availability of each of these services varies by country and region.

== Broadcast television ==

[[Image:Rovinj-7.JPG|thumb|right|Rooftop TV antennas]][[Image:Old television set.png|thumb|right|A TV set with &quot;rabbit ears&quot; antenna]]
Broadcast television, also called over-the-air or terrestrial television, is television received through an antenna such as the ones pictured at right.  Several European nations have already completely switched over their terrestrial TV service to an all-digital format, and many others throughout the world are well into the transition or have near-term plans to switch to digital service.  See [[w:List of digital television deployments by country|Wikipedia:List of digital television deployments by country]] for detailed information about each country's plans.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the [[w:digital switchover|digital switchover]] is planned to occur on February 17, 2009; after that date, all major broadcasters will stop transmitting analog signals altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, &quot;low-power&quot; analog TV broadcasts will be permitted to continue after 2009; these stations are only available in limited areas and often carry only religious, ethnic, or other speciality programming.&lt;/ref&gt;  These broadcasters have already been broadcasting digital versions of their programming alongside the analog signals for several years.  These digital signals can be only received via a digital tuner; such tuners are included in any new television set and some DVD recorders.  

Older (analog-only) televisions can use a [[w:digital converter box|digital converter box]] to receive digital programming.  The US government has established a coupon program offering up to two $40 coupons per household good toward the purchase of such boxes (see [[w:CECB|Wikipedia:Coupon-Eligible Converter Boxes]] and [http://www.ntia.doc.gov/dtvcoupon/faq.html the US government's FAQ on the program]).  Most converter boxes are being offered for about $60, and only one coupon can be applied toward the purchase of one box, so each box will cost about $20, plus taxes and shipping costs, if any.  The coupons can be applied for online at https://www.dtv2009.gov/ or by calling 1-888-DTV-2009.  The coupon cards must be redeemed within three months, and are processed by retailers exactly like a credit card (although it is nonrefundable), providing an instant $40 credit.

According to a study performed in 2004, approximately 19% of US households receive television through broadcast signals only;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nab.org/Content/ContentGroups/Legal/Filings/2004/OTAAtt81104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to continue receiving television signals after February 19, 2009, these households must purchase a converter box, a new TV with a digital tuner, or subscribe to a for-pay cable or satellite TV service.

==== Purchasing a converter box ====

Several dozen models of converter boxes are available that are eligible for the coupon program; a list of them, including a breakdown of their basic features, is available at [[Wikipedia:Comparison of CECB units]].  Most major retailers are only stock one or two models (provided they have any units in stock at all).  The following table lists what units are listed for sale on each company's website:

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot;
!Retailer !! Model(s)
|-
| '''Best Buy''' || Insignia NS-DXA1
|-
| '''Circuit City''' || Zenith DTT900
|-
| '''RadioShack''' || Zenith DTT900 &amp; DTT901, Digital Stream 9900 &amp; 9950 &lt;br /&gt;(Also GE 22730, which they claim on their website is not coupon-eligible although the model is on the government's &quot;eligible&quot; list)
|-
| '''Target''' || Venturer, GE (they do not list specific model numbers for these units on their website)
|-
| '''Wal-Mart''' || TB100MW9, RCA DT800 (they do not specify if it is a 800A, 800B, or 800B1)
|}

These units may or may not be available in your local store, or even online.  You might want to call your local retailer before setting out to see what they actually have in stock.  

Kmart and Sears do not list any boxes on their respective websites, although supposedly they both have the Magnavox/Philco TB100 available in some stores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1008310&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other online, telephone, and local retailers are also participants in the government's coupon program and may have different boxes available than those listed above.  See https://www.dtv2009.gov/VendorSearch.aspx for a listing of vendors (fill in the &quot;Locate Retailers Near You&quot; form for additional local listings).

Coupon-eligible boxes are limited in what features they can offer (only very basic video and audio connectors, for instance).  Units with more features, such as DVD recorders, or units that can be hooked up to PC monitors, HDTVs, or other non-analog equipment are available, but you cannot use a coupon to purchase them.

===== Advice about specific models =====

*Units using LG's sixth-generation DTV chipset (the LGDT1111 family), including the Digital Stream, Insignia, and Zenith models listed above, will supposedly get better reception of signals, especially in areas with a lot of obstructions (buildings, trees, etc.) between the receiver's antenna and the broadcast antennas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvtechnology.com/dlrf/one.php?id=1515&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Insignia NS-DXA1 and Zenith DTT900 models are both manufactured by LG Electronics, and are essentially identical products.  The Magnavox TB100MW9 and Philco TB100HH9, both manufactured by Funai, are also believed to be identical models.

*Users have reported audio artifacts (sibilance) in the high treble range on Zenith DTT900 and Insignia NS-DXA1 models.  This problem supposedly has been fixed in units marked April 2008 and later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=13892772#post13892772&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Digital Stream DTX9900 may have issues with unwanted picture cropping in both &quot;zoom&quot; and letterboxed mode.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=13448384#post13448384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thomaskraemer.blogspot.com/2008/03/tv-converter-box-by-digital-stream.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*A small of models offer &quot;analog pass-through&quot;: this feature allows you to receive both digital TV signals and analog signals through the same video setup (and antenna).  This feature is important if there are stations in your area that you wish to receive that have a good analog signal but a weak or nonexistent digital signal.  Digital Stream DTX9950, Zenith DTT901, and Insignia NS-DXA1-APT models which incorporate this feature are due to be released in mid-2008, or may already be available.

=== Advantages and disadvantages of broadcast digital television ===

Digital television incorporates new functionality not previously available in analog broadcasts.  The new features include:

*High-resolution video (HDTV), including widescreen formats
*Surround sound audio
*Multiple programs per channel (through the use of subchannels)
*Built-in electronic programming guide (program description and broadcast schedule)
*Near-perfect picture quality (provided the signal is strong and steady)

==== SDTV and HDTV ====

Standard-definition digital video (SDTV) is equivalent to the resolution available on a good analog TV set.  HDTV is broadcast in two forms: 1080i and 720p.  Both are widescreen formats, with an aspect ratio of 16:9 -- this means the picture is 78% wider than it is tall.  (Contrast this with the 4:3 aspect ratio of older TV sets and SDTV broadcasts, where the picture is 33% wider than it is tall.)  1080i has five to six times the resolution of standard-definition pictures and 720p has more than twice the resolution.  However, 720p is also broadcast at twice the [[w:frame rate|frame rate]]: the picture is refreshed 50 or 60 times a second instead of 25 or 30 times a second.  As a result, both 1080i and 720p convey about the same amount of visual information, with 720p being better-suited to high-motion programming such as sports.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, both 1080i and 720p are refreshed at 50 or 60 frames per second; however, in 1080i, only half of the screen is updated each frame.  The refresh pattern is in the form of ''interlaced'' lines; odd-numbered lines are updated in one frame, then even-numbered lines in the next frame (hence, 1080''i'').  In 720p, all lines of the screen are updated every frame, providing smoother motion; this is known as ''progressive'' scan (thus, 720''p'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Although digital cable providers may provide local stations (including local affiliates of national networks), to save bandwidth, many provide a reduced-quality HDTV signal compared to the one that is available over the air.

==== Surround sound ====

Some digital programming may be broadcast with [[w:Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital AC-3]] surround sound.  To experience the full benefit of this, your TV or receiver must include a Dolby Digital decoder and be hooked up to a 5.1 speaker system (five speakers placed in specific positions plus a [[w:subwoofer|subwoofer]]).

==== Multicasting ====

Many broadcasters provide one or more subchannels in addition to their regular content; for instance, in the United states, ABC and NBC both provide 24-hour national and local weather coverage, similar to [[w:The Weather Channel|The Weather Channel]]; [[w:ION Television|ION]] provides [[w:qubo|qubo]] (kids' programming), [[w:ION Life|ION Life]], and [[w:The Worship Network|The Worship Network]]; PBS stations may offer [[w:PBS Kids|PBS Kids]], [[w:Create (television network)|Create]], [[w:PBS World|PBS World]], or other supplemental content; and many local stations offer supplemental content as well.

These subchannels are numbered in the form of x.1, x.2, etc., where ''x'' is the ''virtual channel'' number assigned to the broadcaster.  If you ABC on Channel 7 in your market, for instance, its main programming will appear on 7.1, and additional content may be found on channel 7.2, 7.3, etc.  (Not all subchannels will be contiguously numbered: the subchannels might be numbered 7.1, 7.2 and 7.4, with 7.3 nonexistent.)

The virtual channel of a station will not always be the same as its broadcast channel: Channel 7.1, above, might be broadcast on UHF channel 45.  The virtual channel will only be displayed by your TV if it is able to receive the broadcast channel in the first place (at which point, it will automatically renumber the channel to its virtual number).  When trying to locate a weak signal on a given channel, your TV must be tuned to the broadcast channel, ''not'' the virtual channel.  When in doubt as to which is which, note that virtual channels are always in the x.x format and broadcast channels have no trailing number: ''7.1'' is a virtual channel, but ''7'' is a broadcast channel corresponding to the actual VHF channel 7.

==== Electronic programming guide ====

The digital format also allows broadcasters to provide program information and schedules along with their programming; most provide several hours' or days' worth of listings, usually including program titles, planned broadcast times, and often a short description of the content.  This information is accessible through your receiver, in the form of a menu overlaid on the screen; how much information is displayed is dependent on what the broadcaster provides and how your receiver's program information menu is designed.  Some receivers only display information about the program currently being viewed, or &quot;now/next&quot; information; others offer multi-hour, multi-day, or even 14-day grids.

==== Reception issues ====

The biggest disadvantage of broadcast digital television is the digital &quot;[[w:cliff effect|cliff effect]]&quot;: weak or variable signals which would provide a poor but still watchable picture in analog may be totally unwatchable in digital format.  If the signal is strong enough, the digital picture will be perfect, but weaker signals will not produce any picture at all, and marginal or variable signals will produce intermittent loss of audio and/or video (and pixellation).  These dropouts can be caused by something as simple as someone walking in front of the antenna or strong winds causing trees in your vicinity to move.

The best defense against these signal dropouts is to use the best-quality antenna setup possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Open lines==
Open lines are incredibly important in chess. In fact, a game is automatically drawn if there are no open lines. Why? Because the opposing armies have no way to get in to the other side's position without substantial losses of material! There have been several instances of this. For example, A. Petrosian--Hazai, Schilde 1970, at right.

''Position after White's 45th move''

This position may look composed, but the pawn chains are typical of the King's Indian Defense. Were White to play in this position, he would have no trouble at all in winning with 46.b6!, breaking through. However, it is Black to play, and he is hard-pressed to find a way to stop this advance! If, for example, 45...Kb7, then 46.b6! still wins, because 46...cxb6 47.Qb5 wins due to Black's light-squared weaknesses, also typical of the King's Indian Defense (this should make sense now because we have already discussed weak color-complexes). So, Black must resort to drastic measures. '''45...Qb6!''' Shocking! Black gives up his queen for the knight! However, when you think about it, this makes perfect sense, because the knight is the only piece that could break through the dark-squared bind. And now the queen cannot get in after the game moves: '''46.Nxb6+ cxb6 47.h4 gxh4 48.Qd2 h3!''' Blockading the position completely. After '''49.gxh3 h4''', the game was clearly drawn and was agreed drawn in six moves. Of course, you can try telling your computer that White isn't better, but it's simply too stubborn!

Note that the lack of open lines in the endgame gave Black the draw. This is one of those rare positions in chess literature, where Black has assumed a full defensive perimeter around his position. Without open lines, although White had a material advantage, there was simply no way to get in and make his extra material felt.

==Open and half-open files==
These are very important in chess strategy. Half-open files will give your rooks pressure on enemy pawns (if they're your half-open files). For example, in the Open Sicilian, two open files have been created by move 3. '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4''' Now Black has an open c-file and White has an open d-file. Black usually gets some kind of pressure on the queenside, while White gets pressure down the d-file. It's part of both players' respective plans.

===Pressure down a half-open file===
Pressure down a half-open file can be enormous. Take the following position, from Smyslov--Denker in the USSR vs. USA match:

{| style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em;&quot;

|}

Black is obviously worse here. Although he has the advantage of the two bishops, in this case it is hardly an advantage, because the dark-squared bishop is totally passive on g7, being blocked out by its pawn chain on d6 and e5. This means that White has light-squared central outposts to work with if the other bishop is exchanged. White has space, but most importantly, a big hole on d5 and a weak pawn on d6 to work with. However, there is no effective way to use these squares right now because Black still has a light-squared bishop defending his holes. Therefore, White played the sensible '''25.Bd5!''' Exchanging off Black's main trump, the bishop pair, and also eliminating the defender of the light squares. As a rule you can deal with a bishop pair by exchanging one of the bishops and creating a more manageable bishop-vs. knight situation, or bishop vs. bishop situation. '''25...Kh7 26.Bxe6 Qxe6 27.Rd3''' White starts laying siege to Black's d-pawn. '''27...Rc7 28.Rcd1 Rf7 29.Ne4 Bf8 30.Rd5! Qg4 31.R1d3!''' After the immediate 31.Nxd6?, then 31...Bxd6 32.Rxd6 Qxd1+ 33.Rxd1 Rxd1+ holds the endgame. '''31...Be7 32.Nxd6''' The pawn falls at last. White won on move 52.

===Pressure down an open file===
Although no pawns lie on an open file, rooks and queens can still exert enormous pressure down it, especially when there are enemy pieces on it. One of the most effective ways to do this is known as '''Alekhine's Gun''', after the following famous game, Alekhine--Nimzowitsch, San Remo 1930. '''1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.Bd2 Ne7 6.Nb5 Bxd2+ 7.Qxd2 O-O 8.c3''' First White secures his long pawn chain. '''8...b6 9.f4 Ba6 10.Nf3 Qd7 11.a4 Nbc6''' All these moves have been played before, and are still played today. Now Alekhine introduced a novelty (at the time). '''12.b4!''' Breaking open a file that will be used later. '''12...cxb4 13.cxb4 Bb7''' Black was afraid of some tactics that might of popped up based on b4-b5. '''14.Nd6''' The knight is now a tower of strength and is actually pretty hard to exchange. It also ensures the domination of the c-file because c8 has been controlled. This is a useful thing to know: ''The best way to control a file is to control its back rank.'' '''14...f5 15.a5 Nc8 16.Nxb7 Qxb7 17.a6 Qf7 18.Bb5 N8e7 19.O-O h6 20.Rfc1 Rfc8''' Not exactly what Black wanted to do, but allowing White domination of the c-file with 19...Nd8 20.Rc7 didn't exactly look appealing either. '''21.Rc2! Qe8 22.Rac1''' Slightly more accurate was 22.Ra3 followed by 23.Rac3 and 24.Qc1. '''22...Rab8 23.Qe3''' Again, more accurate was 23.Rc3, 24.R1c2 and 25.Qc1. '''23...Rc7 24.Rc3!''' White finally sees the light and invents Alekhine's Gun. The formation rook-rook-queen suddenly pops into his mind. '''24...Qd7 25.R1c2 Kf8''' Rushing the king over to help in the defense. '''26.Qc1''' White has established iron control over the c-file and soon wins, accordingly. '''26...Rbc8 27.Ba4! b5''' Sacrificing a pawn in desperation. The threat was 28.b5, winning a piece. '''28.Bxb5 Ke8 29.Ba4 Kd8''' It seems for a moment that Black has everything covered. However, the resourceful Alekhine realizes that this is only momentary, that Black is in Zugzwang, and thus cannot move at all! He therefore plays the quiet, but brilliant: '''30.h4!''' A waiting move that demonstrates the strength of White's position. However, the more straightforward 30.Nd2, 31.Nb3, and 32.Na5 would have won easily enough. Nevertheless, Alekhine's move made a greater impression on the spectators. Black struggled on for a few more moves, and then realized the nature of his position and resigned.

So in this game, White realized that pawns were not the only things that can be pressured by rooks. Sometimes, you can look for bigger gains and win on the spot.

===Penetration on an open file===
Penetration is one of the simplest goals of possession of an open file. If you can penetrate down into the enemy position and dominate there, you will have a clear advantage because he will be unable to dislodge you (most of the time) and meanwhile, you can cause chaos in the king's position and the pawns there. Here's a simple endgame example:

{| style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 1em;&quot;
| {{Chess position|=

   |rd|  |  |  |  |  |kd|  |=
   |pd|pd|  |  |  |  |pd|  |=
   |  |  |  |pd|  |pd|pl|pd|=
   |  |  |  |pl|pd|pl|  |  |=
   |  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |pl|=
   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
   |pl|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |=
   |  |  |rl|  |  |  |kl|  |=

   |30}}
|- style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| '''Instructive example'''
|}

Material is level. However, White can assume an immediate advantage with '''1.Rc7''', dominating the seventh rank and penetrating into the enemy position. Note also, that Black's pawns and king are very weak when the rook is on such a powerful square. Also, Black's rook is driven to passivity after '''1...Rb8 2.Kf2''' Now the king follows the rook. He will penetrate as well, and the game will be decided by a march of queenside pawns.

==Ranks==
If files are the means to an end, then the ranks are the end itself. A file is best used when there is a rank down which to penetrate. Most often, this rank is on the first, second, or third (for the opponent). Here is a nice game Vasiliev--Zilberstein, Ukraine 1993.

{| style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em;&quot;
| {{Chess position|=

   |rd|  |  |  |  |rd|kd|  |=

''Position after White's 16th move''
|}

Black is clearly better because of his outposted knight on e4 and his queenside space advantage. In addition, White has weak light squares. However, all of this is meaningless if Black cannot arrange a breakthrough. So, knowing this, Black plays '''16...a5!''' Creating tension on the a-file. '''17.a3 Ra6! 18.Ne2 Rfa8!''' First Black builds up on the a-file before opening it. Now White is forced to abandon the file. '''19.Rab1 axb4 20.axb4 Ra3 21.Ng3 R8a4!''' Now the rooks make way for the queen. Black is planning to move on to the 2nd rank. '''22.Nxe4 dxe4''' Now Black also has the d-file cemented under his control. '''23.Rf2 Qd3 24.Qc1 Ra2 25.Qe1 Rc2 26.Rd1 Raa2''' The &quot;blind pigs&quot; dominate the second rank! White is losing. '''27.g3 Bd8 28.Bc1 Rxf2!''' An elegant queen sacrifice. '''29.Rxd3 Rg2+ 30.Kf1 exd3''' White resigns, because the rooks dominate the position, especially the second rank. Let's review Black's winning plan:

::1. Creating tension on the a-file. (16...a5!)
::2. Doubling rooks on the a-file. (17...Ra6 and 18...Rfa8)
::3. Opening the a-file and dominating it. (19...axb4 and 20...Ra3)
::4. Moving the queen to the new outpost on d3. (23...Qd3)
::5. Penetrating on the 2nd rank. (24...Ra2, 25...Rc2, and 26...Raa2)

This plan is typical of such positions, and is a good one to bear in mind.

==Diagonals==
Diagonals are crucial operating lines for the bishops. Because bishops can only operate diagonally, they need active diagonals in order to be effective. One example should suffice to show the need of bishops for diagonals. A line in the Danish Gambit goes: '''1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2''' For two pawns, White has a capital development and two bishops placed optimally on their best diagonals. '''5...Bb4+ 6.Nc3 Nf6 7.Nge2 Nxe4?!''' This move is bad. Although Black is up three pawns now, White's two bishops decide the game in his favor. Black has a horrible development and now exchanges off the only two pieces he has developed. '''8.O-O! Nxc3 9.Nxc3 Bxc3? 10.Bxc3 O-O''' Black undoubtedly thought he would be safe here, because after 11.Qd4 Qf6 there is no mate, and Black is three pawns up. However, White mates after '''11.Qg4! g6 12.Qd4''' and now the power of the bishops shows itself on the open diagonals. The f-pawn is pinned, and otherwise there is no way to prevent mate on g7.


==Open lines in the attack on the king==
An easy way to create an attack is to first create a weakness. Another easy way to create an attack is to open some lines. However, when you create a weakness, wouldn't it be better to open some attacking lines to the enemy king while you're at it? It would, logically, double the strength of the attack, with weaknesses and lines everywhere, all leading to the enemy king. The following game masterfully shows all of these ideas in action, with a lesson from the sixth World Champion, Mikhail Botvinnik. 


{| style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 1em;&quot;
| {{Chess position|=

   |qd|  |  |  |rd|bd|kd|  |=
   |pd|bd|  |  |  |pd|pd|  |=
   |  |pd|nd|  |pd|  |  |pd|=
   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |=
   |  |  |  |  |nl|  |  |  |=

   |30}}
|- style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
| '''Botvinnik--Larsen, Palma de Mallorca 1967'''
'''''
''Position after Black's 20th move''
|}


Here White played 21.Rd7, which logically penetrates into Black's position on the seventh rank. He eventually went on to win a long, hard endgame. However, he had very little time on his clock. With enough time, everyone was sure that Botvinnik would find the best move, '''21.Nf6+!''' This creates a weakness (on f6), opens a file (the g-file) and opens a diagonal (the long, dark one). In addition, the seventh rank is cleared for the rook's use. Considering that no price is too high for the king, it's a worthwhile sacrifice! '''21...gxf6 22.Qg4+ Kh7 23.Rd7!''' White uses all types of open lines in his attack against the enemy king. '''23...Re7''' Or ''23...Be7 24.Be4+ Kh8 25.Rxe7'', with mate to follow. '''24.Be4+ f5 25.Bxf5+''' Opening more lines for mate. '''25...exf5 26.Qxf5+ Kg8 27.Qf6 Ne5 28.Bxe5 Rxe5 29.Qxf7+ Kh8 30.Qh7#'''. This was an example of a strong attack, preceded by a line-opening sacrifice that created a weakness in Black's king position. It turned out to be enough to win.

Unfortunately, White did not find this incredible winning resource, a winning combination. However, this does not mean that the idea was wrong. The knight sacrifice on f6 is common. It opens lines, specifically the a1-h8 diagonal and the g-file for White's use. It also weakened the seventh rank for the rook to come in and penetrate. Also, the long, light diagonal from b1 to h7 was weakened, and e4 was cleared for the bishop to use that diagonal. After the king was checked about a little, the rook came down and used the all-too common idea of the seventh rank. The rook on the seventh rank played a major role in the attack by delivering the winning blow. In many cases, the rook on the seventh increase the power of such an attack. Then the bishop was sacrificed to open even more lines. Then, using the weak dark squares in Black's position, White was able to mate.

Your best bet is to start a discussion on the project page (not here on the talk page). Nobody is forcing anybody to put imperial or metric measurements anywhere. If the author wishes to use imperial, that's their decision and if someone else (you, say) want to come along later and change them to metric or add additional metric commentary then go right ahead. By the way, imperial measures are still pretty widespread in the UK too possibly because people who actually cook tend to be the older generation. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

::While the original comments could have been worded better I agree with the points entirely.  I know that ''nobody is forcing anybody to put imperial or metric measurements anywhere'' but that's the point - we should!  Wikimedia projects are targeted towards an international audience and metric measurements should always be used with imperial measurements in parenthesis if necessary.  A scientific, geographic or cookbook page which only uses imperial units is a waste of space in my opinion.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:20, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

That reconfigure Wikbooks section is getting too long. The whole page will be too big so maybe some threads should be archived first.

== My Introduction... ==

This  is Dr. Marco Bitetto, I got my doctoral degree in Robotics (machines that learn by example)  from Union Institute in 1994.  Before that I studied Computer Systems Engineering and minored in Mathematics, in particular &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;, receiving a Bachelor's of Science Degree from the State University of New York, 1991. I've built and programmed computers since I was thirteen.  I've designed and built robots for numerous functions.

My interests: robotics, control systems, artificial intelligence, chaos theory, fractal geometry, game theory and electronically based disability aids.
I can also offer technical assistance to anyone writing a text book on the above subjects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Kendall! Have you considered teaching Physical Education or are you leaning more toward academic areas? It sounds like you would be a great asset in either capacity. We certainly need more teachers like you who are accepting of students with multiple disabilities &amp;/or special needs in their classrooms. Having worked with students having multiple disabilities for the past year and a half, I have noticed an increasing number of these students. I have also noticed an increased number of children who are &quot;labeled&quot; very early in their elementary education and that &quot;label&quot; seems to stay with them into middle and high school, often putting them in classes for students needed &quot;extra help&quot; which might could have been avoided if teachers were not forced to follow the guidelines of the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; law. I also STRONGLY AGREE with you that each student is different and has their own unique abilities and that &quot;their confidence level parallels their learning capabilities&quot;. Sometimes I wish certain teachers could have a mirror and/or tape recorder placed in front of them so they could see or hear how they actually sound when speaking to some students. I think many of them would be surprised themselves. [[User:Cmorrell|Cmorrell]] ([[User talk:Cmorrell|talk]]) 18:17, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

It seems that you are a high energy individual who does not take themselves too seriously; which is what a lot of teachers do. Every now and then you come across a teacher who is creative and does not follow the frivilous and mundane structered class enviroment. You sound like you would be in that few. Good luck with everything! [[User:Cojames|Cojames]] ([[User talk:Cojames|talk]]) 22:38, 1 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Why do we have transport systems?=

Organisms do not always require transport systems, and most have much simpler ones than us - so why the complexity in the mammalian transport system? The reason is our size. Because mammals are so large (increased distance from the nutrients and the cells requiring them), have a high metabolic rate and a high level of activity, we have high oxygen and nutrient requirements. We also produce a relatively large amount of waste that has to be removed - all this is achieved by our complex transport system with pump.

As you can see from the above table, some organisms do not have transport systems, and rely on diffusion alone since they are such simple creatures that diffusion is adequate. Relative to their volume, they have a large surface area for diffusion to occur. Jellyfish and sea anemones survive for the same two reasons and that they do not move around much (which requires oxygen).

=Cardiovascular System=

The cardiovascular system or simply the blood system has a pump and a series of tubes, the heart and blood vessels respectively. The blood, coming from the left ventricle of the heart travels twice through the heart to make a complete circuit. Starting at the left ventricle, into the aorta, all around the body except for the lungs, back into the right side of the heart into the vena cava and then pumped out of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, carrying it to the lungs to be reoxygenated, then returning along the pulmonary vein to the left side of the heart. This combination makes it a double circulatory, and since the blood never leaves it is known as a double circulatory system
.

See this picture for an extended look at the human blood vessel system: [http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/biog105/pages/demos/105/unit7/media/circdiagram.jpg]

This picture helps to describe the double circulatory system: [http://www.arrowvale.worcs.sch.uk/sportscollege/images/sport/body/circulation.gif]

==Arteries==
[[File:Illu_artery.jpg|right|framed|An artery diagram. You may be asked to look at a diagram drawn as if you were looking into the artery, such as [http://academics.antoniomagni.org/lenya/cwru/ebme202/artery.gif]]]

The function of the arteries is to transport blood swiftly and at high blood pressure to the tissues. Look at the diagram on the right. It is of a artery and shows three things - the tunica intima, the tunica media and the tunica externa. The tunica intima is made from endothelium, resting on a thin layer of elastic fibres as this is in contact with the blood this is vital. Next up is the middle layer called the tunica media, containing smooth muscle, collagen and elastic fibres. Finally, the outside, the tunica externa, containing elastic and collagen fibres. The space in the middle where the blood flows through is called the lumen.

Arteries have the thickest walls of any blood vessel, this, along with the smooth muscle and elastic fibres allow the wall to stretch as pulses of blood from the heart come through at high pressure. The fact that they are elastic (i.e., that they recoil after being stretched) is vital to ensure they 'snap back' after the pulse of blood has been through, raising the pressure and giving the blood a push.

As they get further from the heart, and closer to the tissue to which they are giving blood to, they branch into smaller vessels known as arterioles - similar to arteries but smaller and with more muscle to push the blood along if required, also to enhance or restrict blood flow, such as restricting blood flow to gut during exercise.

==Veins==
[[File:Illu_vein.jpg|right|400px|framed|An vein diagram. You may be asked to look at a diagram drawn as if you were looking into the vein, such as [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/images/vessel.gif]]]

Veins have a relatively large lumen, a thin tunica intima and an even thinner tunica media. Their tunica externa is mostly collagen fibres, as opposed to the artery that has a lot more elasticised fibres.

Blood flows from the arterioles into capillaries, and when it leaves there it enters the veins, whose function it is to return blood to the heart. Veins have to deal with very low pressure blood, typically less than 5 mm hg - this helpfully negates the need for thick walls but how can blood be returned to the heart under such low pressure?

The answer is semi-lunar valves. See this picture: [http://content.answers.com/main/content/img/oxford/Oxford_Sports/0199210896.valve.1.jpg]. As you can see from the picture, the semi-lunar valve only allows blood to go one way, trying to go the other simply closes the valve. Muscles in your legs also help to raise the pressure within your veins.

==Capillaries==

The arterioles continue to branch from the artery, eventually forming the smallest of all blood vessels, capillaries. The capillaries function is to take blood as close as possible to cells, allowing rapid transport of substances between cells and blood - they form a network in every tissue known as a capillary. 

Capillary walls are extremely thin, with walls of just a single layer of endothelial cells and each capillary is about the same size as a red blood cell, 7μm. This structure allows blood get to as close as 1μm from individual cells. Most capillary beds will have gaps in between the individual cells to allow some components of the blood to seep into the space between the cells of the body, forming tissue fluid. The blood pressure in a capillary is around 10mm Hg.

==Blood and tissue fluid==

Blood is simply cells floating in a pale yellow liquid called blood plasma. Blood plasma is mostly water with solutes such as nutrients and waste products. Protein molecules that remain in the blood all the time are known as plasma proteins. As said in the previous section, plasma leaks out between the capillaries and seeps into the spaces between the cells of the tissues, and becomes known as tissue fluid. 

Tissue fluid is blood plasma, without a few things that couldn't fit through - red blood cells and protein molecules. It forms the immediate environment of each individual body cell, and exchange the materials between cells - many processes in our body are designed to maintain the composition of tissue fluid, to ensure cells have an optimum environment. This is known as homeostasis, and involves the regulation of glucose concentration, water, pH, waste products and temperature.

=Lymphatic system=

Of the tissue fluid discussed in the previous section, around 90% seeps back into the capillaries, and the remaining 10% becomes lymph fluid in the lymph vessels (lymphatics). These vessels are tiny 'blind-ending' vessels, and tissue fluid can flow into them but not out - and these valves are wide enough to allow large protein molecules to pass through - important since this protein cannot get into the capillaries and can't be taken away by the blood, which would cause a fatal build-up if the tissue fluid does not take it away.

The lymph vessels join up to form larger lymph vessels, which gradually transport the lymph fluid back to the large veins which run beneath the collarbone, known as the subclavian veins. At intervals along lymph vessels, lymph nodes lie - bacteria and other unwanted particles are removed from lymph by some white blood cells as the lymph passes through the nodes, and white blood cells within the nodes secrete.

=Blood=

Blood is a specialized bodily fluid composed of blood cells suspended in a liquid called blood plasma.

==Blood cells==

A blood cell (also called blood corpuscle) is any cell of any type normally found in blood. In mammals, these fall into two general categories:

* Red blood cells
* White blood cells

===Red===

Red blood cells are red because of the pigment haemoglobin, a globular protein, the main function of which is to transport oxygen from lungs to respiring tissues. Red blood cells are relatively short-lived, they become more fragile as time goes on and rupture within the circulatory system but are replaced by the bone marrow. A list of their structures and functions are below.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+''''Red blood cells'''
|-
! Structure 
! Function 
|-
| Small size (7μm)
| To allow the red blood cell to get near to the cells to exchange oxygen with them - to fit into capillaries.
|-
| No nucleus, mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum.
| Red blood cells are highly specialized cells, and they provide as much space for haemoglobin as possible.
|-
| Biconcave disk shape
| Large surface area for oxygen diffusion. Flexibility.
|}

===White===

White blood cells (leucocytes) are also made in the bone marrow, but differ from red blood cells in the following ways.

* They always have a nucleus
* Larger than red blood
* Not bi-concave, usually spherical or just irregular.

There are two main groups of white blood cells - phagocytes and lymphocytes.

Phagocytes
* Destroy invading cells by phagocytosis
* Recognised by their lobed [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/hematology/HessImages/Monocyte--lymphocyte--neutrophil-50x-website-arrow.jpg](see neutrophil) nuclei and granular cytoplasm.

Lymphocytes
* Destroy microorganisms but not by phagocytosis
* Secrete antibodies
* Smaller than phagocytes
* Large nucleus [http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/hematology/HessImages/Monocyte--lymphocyte--neutrophil-50x-website-arrow.jpg]
* Small cytoplasm

=Haemoglobin=
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|framed‎|right|300px]]

The main role of the transport system is to transport oxygen from the alveoli to where it is needed - cells around the body, and this is achieved in the protein haemoglobin. Each haemoglobin molecule can hold four oxygen molecules. 

===Dissociation curve===
Haemoglobin must not only pickup oxygen at the lungs (as we have seen so far) but to drop it off at the appropriate tissues. This is known as dissociation, and it is possible to measure haemoglobins dissociation and produce a graph, known as a dissociation curve.

The graph (seen here on the right), shows that at low partial pressures of oxygen, the oxygen-saturation of haemoglobin is very low. At high partial pressures of oxygen, the oxygen-saturation of haemoglobin is very high.

===S-Shaped===

The S-Curve can be explained by the behaviour of a haemoglobin molecule as it loses and gains oxygen molecules.

A haemoglobin molecule has four haem groups, and when an oxygen molecule combines with a haem group, the haemoglobin molecule becomes slightly distorted, and this distortion increases the haemoglobins affinity for oxygen, that is, it makes it easier for the second molecule of oxygen to bind. The second oxygen molecule joins, in turn making it easier for a third oxygen molecule to bind, but this molecule makes it harder for the fourth to bind. 

All this explains why the initial rise is slow, (first is hard to bind but the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile(2nd and 3rd are easy) is a steep graph, and the last quarter of the graph is slow (fourth is hard) again.

===The Bohr effect===

The Bohr effect is the influence of carbon dioxide on the S-shaped graph - when carbon dioxide is released into the red blood cells, it is converted by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which produces excess hydrogen ions as a result. Haemoglobin readily combines with these ions, forming haemoglobinic acid, and in doing so releases the oxygen which it is carrying.

This results in two things - haemoglobin mopping up the hydrogen ions which are formed when carbon dioxide dissolves and dissociates - keeping the pH (concentration of hydrogen ions) neutral (acting as a buffer).

The fact that a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide causes haemoglobin to release oxygen - this is the Bohr effect. It is very useful in that high concentrations of carbon dioxide are found in actively respiring tissues - the ones that need oxygen the most, and cause haemoglobin to release oxygen even more readily that it would otherwise do. The Bohr Effect shifts the S curve (this time for dissociation) slightly to the right, simply meaning that haemoglobin is less saturated than it would be at a low partial pressure of carbon dioxide.

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport===

There are two ways CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be transported in the blood.

* One of the products of carbon dioxide dissociation is hydrogencarbonate ions, which mostly diffuse into the blood plasma.
* Others hydrogen ions diffuse into the red blood cells, and instead of being reacting upon by carbonic anhydrase, they combine with one of the terminal amine groups of haemoglobin, forming carbamino-haemoglobin.


When the blood reaches the lungs, the above two reactions are reversed and this leaves carbon dioxide to leave the body, and haemoglobin is free ready for oxygen.

==Foetal haemoglobin==

A developing foetus receives its oxygen across the placenta from its mother's haemoglobin. Obviously, the mother's blood has to supply her whole body as well as the foetus' needs, and thus by the time the blood reaches the placenta, the partial pressure of oxygen is relatively low.

This requires foetal haemoglobin to have a higher affinity for oxygen, and bind more readily at lower partial pressures of oxygen. The curve for foetal haemoglobin on the s-shaped curve graph is slightly to the left of the adult haemoglobin curve.

Once the foetus is born, he/she loses their foetal haemoglobin within 6 months, so that in the future a female can have a foetus inside her and that foetus will be able to use its foetal haemoglobin to attain oxygen. Also, it is necessary that the foetal haemoglobin changes to adult haemoglobin, so that the oxygen affinity is lowered sufficiently enough for the right amount of oxygen to be given up to cells and tissues. This is especially important as the child becomes more active, because its tissues will require more oxygen.

=Myoglobin=

Myoglobin is a reddish pigment which combines with oxygen, just like haemoglobin. However it is mostly found in muscle tissue. It has only one polypeptide chain, one haem group and can only bind with one oxygen molecule. However, myoglobin has a very high oxygen affinity and will not release its oxygen unless the partial pressure of oxygen around it is very low.

This is useful because during the initial minutes of exercise, the heart and lungs require time to catch up with the muscles demand, and during this time the oxygen saturation drops low in the muscles as they quickly use it, and myoglobin releases its oxygen. So, myoglobin acts as an oxygen store.

=Oxygen transport difficulties=

As you probably have deduced, oxygen transport in our bodies is incredibly efficient, but it can be affected by a few things.

==Carbon monoxide==

Haemoglobin, for all its efficiency has a flaw—it combines, irreversibly, with carbon monoxide with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide is inhaled from fumes from many sources, and combines with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin.

Thus excessive concentrations of carbon monoxide, like from poorly-ventilated gas heaters, severely impact the bodies’ oxygen carrying capacity, and carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to death from asphyxiation.

==Altitude sickness==

Since haemoglobin partially relies atmospheric pressure to bind readily with oxygen, humans sometimes encounter problems above heights of 6500 feet, as the air pressure becomes such that haemoglobin will at most become 70% saturated instead of the usual 92-95% saturated, causing less oxygen to be carried around the body.

This can make people feel ill, but worse it causes the arterioles in their brain to dilate, and increase the amount of blood flowing into capillaries. This causes fluid to leak from the capillaries into the brain tissues causing disorientation, and can even leak to the lungs making it difficult to breathe. This condition can be fatal.

However, given time, the body can acclimatise to the lower pressure by increasing the number of red blood cells—however this takes at least two or three weeks at a high altitude. Other changes that occur to people who live at high altitudes include broad chests (high lung capacity), larger hearts and more haemoglobin in the blood than usual.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey there.

When I started to look for ways to learn MySQL, I found that most of them were for advanced system admins and programmers or the articles were structured like wikipedia articles.
(btw, all power to wikipedia for the amount and detail of information available. But I always preferred howstuffworks.com because it presented its information in an easy way to understand.)

After all this is WikiBooks, not Wikipedia. Ideally it should be easy for people to come here knowing nothing about MySQL for example and being able to learn easily and progressively towards advanced tasks.

Thats the best way to educate and bring knowledge to all.
(sorry for the preach ^^ )

Like I said, I would love for this article to be merged and mixed into other articles on the MySQL book so that it achieves the goals I would ideally want.

Anyway thats it for now.
See ya'll later.

Thanks, this page really helped me. July 28th</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bartenders use a wide variety of '''ingredients''' when preparing drinks for their customers. [[Bartending/Cocktails|Mixed drinks]] can be quite complicated to prepare and may use many different components in a single drink.

Most bar drinks contain some type of [[Bartending/Alcohol|alcohol]]. [[Bartending/Alcohol/Fermented beverages|Fermented beverages]], such as [[Bartending/Alcohol/Beer|beer]] or [[Bartending/Alcohol/Wine|wine]], are served at a wide variety of bars. In the United States, beer and wine only alcoholic beverage permits are much easier to obtain than permits allowing distilled beverages like [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirit|spirits]] and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Liqueur|liqueurs]].

In addition to beer and wine, other common '''fermented beverages''' include [[Bartending/Alcohol/Cider|cider]] (called ''hard cider'' in the U.S.), [[Bartending/Alcohol/Malt beverage|malt beverages]] (usually referring to clear malt-based beverages with fruity or other &quot;fun&quot; flavors that appeal to younger drinkers), [[Bartending/Alcohol/Mead|mead]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Sake|sake]] (commonly served in Asia and places that serve Asian food), and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Vermouth|vermouth]] (a type of wine used in many [[Bartending/Cocktails|cocktails]]).

Common '''spirits''' include [[Bartending/Alcohol/Absinthe|absinthe]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Brandy|brandy]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Gin|gin]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Rum|rum]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Tequila|tequila]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Vodka|vodka]], and a variety of [[Bartending/Alcohol/Whisky|whiskies]]. [[Bartending/Alcohol/Less common and regional spirits|Less common]] and regional spirits are available, too. '''Liqueurs''' are sweetened alcohols with flavors like [[Bartending/Alcohol/Chocolate liqueur|chocolate]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Coffee liqueur|coffee]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Melon liqueur|melons]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Orange liqueur|oranges]], [[Bartending/Alcohol/Fruit liqueur|other fruit]] and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Berry liqueur|berries]]. [[Bartending/Alcohol/Nut-flavored liqueur|Nuts]] and [[Bartending/Alcohol/Herbal liqueur|herbs]] are other popular flavors.

Of course, some people prefer '''[[Bartending/Beverages/Non-alcoholic beverage|non-alcoholic beverages]]''', and most [[Bartending/Beverages/Mixed drink|mixed drinks]] can be made without alcohol (so called &quot;virgin&quot; drinks). Most bars offer drink staples like [[Bartending/Beverages/Soda|sodas]] and [[Bartending/Beverages/Coffee|coffee]], and larger bars may offer iced or hot [[Bartending/Beverages/Tea|tea]] and [[Bartending/Beverages/Bottled water|bottled water]]. Many will provide [[Bartending/Beverages/Juice|juice]] or [[Bartending/Beverages/Milk|milk]] upon request. Bars serving younger crowds also may serve [[Bartending/Beverages/Energy drink|energy drinks]] upon request or mix them into other drinks for a caffeine &quot;kick&quot;.

'''[[Bartending/Mixers|Mixers]]''' are an important part of most mixed drinks, whether alcoholic or not. As mentioned, [[Bartending/Mixers/Caffeine|caffeinated beverages]] like [[Bartending/Mixers/Coffee|coffee]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Tea|tea]], and [[Bartending/Mixers/Energy drink|energy drinks]] are sometimes added to drinks to counteract the suppressant effect of alcohol. 

[[Bartending/Mixers/Syrup|Syrups]], like [[Bartending/Mixers/Simple syrup|simple syrup]], add sweetness, and some, like [[Bartending/Mixers/Grenadine|grenadine]], also add pleasant color to the drinks. Other syrups, like [[Bartending/Mixers/Sour mix|sour mix]] and [[Bartending/Mixers/Sweetened lime juice|sweetened lime juice]] add both a sweet and a sour taste to drinks. [[Bartending/Mixers/Bitters|Bitters]] impart a bitter taste to drinks. Bitters are an important flavor in many cocktails, and are a required ingredient in true cocktails according to purists.

[[Bartending/Mixers/Other|Other mixers]] include a variety of [[Bartending/Mixers/Carbonation|carbonated mixers]] (including [[Bartending/Mixers/Carbonated water|carbonated]] and [[Bartending/Mixers/Tonic water|tonic]] waters, and also [[Bartending/Mixers/Citrus-flavored soda|citrus]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Cola-flavored soda|cola]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Ginger ale|ginger]], or [[Bartending/Mixers/Root beer|sarsaparilla]] flavored sodas), [[Bartending/Mixers/Juice|juices]] (including [[Bartending/Mixers/Vegetable juice|tomato and vegetable juices]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Tropical juice|tropical-flavored juices]], and other [[Bartending/Mixers/Fruit juice|fruit and berry juices]]), [[Bartending/Mixers/Dairy product|dairy products]] (like [[Bartending/Mixers/Milk|milk]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Half and half|half and half]], [[Bartending/Mixers/Heavy cream|heavy cream]], or [[Bartending/Mixers/Ice cream|ice cream]]), and even [[Bartending/Mixers/Hot sauce|hot]] or [[Bartending/Mixers/Savory sauce|savory]] [[Bartending/Mixers/Sauce|sauces]].

'''[[Bartending/Mixers/Ice|Ice]]''' is an important part of many drinks, whether [[Bartending/Cocktails/Blended cocktails|blended]] or [[Bartending/Cocktails/On the rocks|on the rocks]].

The final ingredient is the '''[[Bartending/Garnishes|garnish]]'''. Many drinks include [[Bartending/Garnishes/Inedible garnish|inedible garnishes]] like [[Bartending/Garnishes/Straw|straws]] or little [[Bartending/Garnishes/Umbrella|paper umbrellas]] or [[Bartending/Garnishes/Plastic animal|plastic animals]]. Other garnishes, like [[Bartending/Garnishes/Citrus|citrus peel]] [[Bartending/Garnishes/Citrus twist|twists]], are not really edible, but the same fruit can be  [[Bartending/Garnishes/Citrus quarter|quartered]] or [[Bartending/Garnishes/Citrus slice|sliced]], and then it becomes an edible part of the drink experience. Other [[Bartending/Garnishes/Edible garnish|edible garnishes]] include [[Bartending/Garnishes/Tropical|tropical fruits]] like [[Bartending/Garnishes/Pineapple|pineapple]] and [[Bartending/Garnishes/Coconut|coconut]], [[Bartending/Garnishes/Cherry|cherries]], and vegetables like [[Bartending/Garnishes/Carrot|carrot]] or [[Bartending/Garnishes/Celery|celery]] sticks, [[Bartending/Garnishes/Olive|green olives]], or [[Bartending/Garnishes/Onion|cocktail onions]]. Even [[Bartending/Garnishes/Spices and seasonings|spices and seasonings]] like  [[Bartending/Garnishes/Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Bartending/Garnishes/Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]], [[Bartending/Garnishes/Mint|mint sprigs and leaves]], [[Bartending/Garnishes/Salt|salt]], and [[Bartending/Garnishes/Sugar|sugar]] can be used to enhance a drink.
 
All of these ingredients are served to the customer in some type of [[Bartending/Drinkware|drinkware]].


[[Bartending/Mixers/Preprepared mix|Preprepared mixes]] are now available so that consumers can make [[Bartending/Mixers/Margarita mix|margaritas]] or [[Bartending/Mixers/Mudslide mix|mudslides]] at home. Chain restaurants may use a mix, also, for consistent taste from one restaurant to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Differences between the minor pieces==

Understanding the relationships between minor pieces is crucial to chess. It's more important than most other things, including space, pawn structure, and sometimes even material. It's also one of the most misunderstood. For example, for many years the position in [[Elements of chess strategy/Pawn structure#Passed pawns|Spassky--Fischer, Reykjavík 1972]] would have been classified as &quot;great advantage for White&quot;. After all, he had the two bishops. No one questioned the authority of two bishops until the modern players like Botvinnik, Tal, Smyslov, and Bronstein realized that chess is too dynamic to say things like &quot;the bishop pair is always good&quot;.

==Rules of the minor pieces==
First, here are some rules of thumb regarding the minor pieces. They will not work in ''all'' situations, as discussed above, but they will provide a good general guide.

===Rules of knights===
:1. '''Knights need advanced support points to be effective.''' A support point, or outpost, is a square supported by a pawn that no enemy pawn can attack, or if it can, it cannot attack it without incurring some weakness. Remember that the knight must affect the area of the board where the play is happening, otherwise it's useless! Here are some rules governing a knight's activity depending on the rank it sits on.
::A. Knights on the first or second rank are purely defensive and are usually on their way to a better square.
::B. Knights on the third rank are useful defenders and are ready to jump to the fifth.
::C. A knight on the fourth rank is equal to a bishop and can withdraw for defense or venture even further for attack.
::D. A knight on the fifth is a superb piece, constituting a powerful attacker and is often better than a bishop.
::E. A knight on the sixth is often cause for the opponent's resignation. It creates disharmony in the enemy camp and the Exchange is often sacrificed to get rid of it. (See [[Elements of chess strategy/Weak and strong squares#Weak squares|Botvinnik--Flohr, Moscow 1936]] for an example of such a knight)
::F. A knight on the seventh or eighth often diminishes in value, because it controls fewer squares than a knight on the sixth.
:2. '''Knights thrive in closed positions.''' This is for two reasons: one, because there are many support points provided by central pawns, and two, their ability to police squares of both colors and jump over other pawns means they are relatively unaffected by the pawns.
:3. '''The best blockader of a passed pawn is a knight.''' This is because knights can remain active while blocking pawns, due to their ability to jump over other pieces and pawns.
:4. '''Knights are usually superior to bishops in endings with pawns on one side of the board.''' This is because pawns on one side of the board make light of a bishop's long-range powers, while a knight does not need these long-range powers and can use its ability to jump on squares of both colors.
:5. '''The way to play against knights is to take away their advanced support points.''' This means that, by taking away central squares from knights, you can turn them into useless slabs of meat.

===Rules of bishops===
The ''bad bishop'' is one that is blocked by its own pawns. The ''good bishop'' is one that is not blocked by its own pawns. These names are too static, however, either piece can be an ''active bishop'', depending on the situation. Here are the laws governing bishops:
:1. If you have a bad bishop you should correct it in one of the following ways:
::A. '''Trade it for an enemy piece of equal or greater value.''' This makes sense. If your bad bishop is doing nothing good for your army, you want to trade it off for a good piece of your opponent's. This means that you have not lost much, but your opponent has lost a lot!
::B. '''Make it good by moving the central pawns off its color square.''' Your bishop will no longer be bad if the pawns are no longer there.
::C. '''Make it active by getting it outside of the pawn chain.''' The bishop can still be bad but active, if it is outside of the pawn chain's cramping effect, it will become active.
:2. '''Bishops are strongest in open positions.''' The long-range power of a bishop shows itself best when no pawns block its diagonals. In this way a bishop can sweep from one end to the board to another quite easily.
:3. '''Bishops are better than knights in endings with pawns on both sides of the board.''' Again, the bishop shows its long-range powers best by supporting its own pawns to queen while stopping the enemy pawns at long distance.
:4. '''Endings of bishops of opposite color are very easily drawn.''' This is because of the bishops inability to patrol squares of both colors. The defending side can be three pawns down and still hope to draw by arranging a blockade on his strong squares!
:5. '''When your opponent has a bishop, you should place your pawns on the same color squares as the bishop. However, if you have a bishop yourself, then you should try to keep the pawns on different colored squares than your bishop, no matter if your opponent has a bishop or not.''' This rule was formulated by the third World Champion, Jose Capablanca. It makes sense--you should try to give your bishop activity and restrict your opponent's bishop using your pawns.


==Good bishops vs. bad bishops==
As said earlier, &quot;bad&quot; bishops cannot be pinned down to inactivity, and &quot;good&quot; bishops cannot be pinned down to activity. Of course, these are pretty good general rules. Alatortsev--Levenfish, Leningrad 1937 was a good example of this.

| '''Alatortsev--Levenfish, Leningrad 1937''' 
''Position after White's 24th move''
|}

White has a bad bishop. It is blocked by a long string of pawns from b3 to f3. However, this means that all of his diagonally-attacking pieces are on light squares, leaving his dark squares weak. By contrast, Black's pawns perfectly complement his bishop--they cover the dark squares while the bishop covers the light squares. '''24...Kf7 25.Ke2 Rh5! 26.Rh1 Ke5 27.Kd3''' It would be very embarrassing to allow the Black king to penetrate on the weak dark squares. This is a direct consequence of White's bad bishop--neither the bishop nor the pawns can cover his dark squares. '''27...h6 28.h3?''' Weakening g3. The king now looks to the kingside to penetrate. '''28...Rg5 29.Rh2 Rg3''' Or the rook. '''30.h4 Rg8 31.Ke2 g5!''' Black breaks through. Now the g-file is opened, and White loses material. '''32.hxg5 hxg5 33.Kf2 g4 34.Rh5+ Kd4''' The Black king invades. However, White accelerates the disintegration of his own position, but there is really nothing left to do. '''35.Rd1+? Kc3 36.Rh7 gxf3 37.Bf1''' 37.Bxf3? walks into 37...Rxf3+ 38.Kxf3 Bg4+ and 39...Bxd1. '''37...Kc2! 38.Rd3 Bh3! 39.Rxf3  Rxf3+ 40.Kxf3 Bxf1 41.Rxf7 Rf8''' Up a piece, with a passed pawn on f4 and an active king, Black is winning easily. He won on move 49. Black's dominance of the dark squares allowed the king to penetrate into White's position decisively.

However, despite what this game shows, bad bishops are not always bad. Bad bishops protect their pawns. Or, as in the following game, Botvinnik--Kan, Leningrad 1939, they can be excellent outposts.

| '''Botvinnik--Kan, Leningrad 1939''' 
''Position after Black's 25th move''
|}

White apparently had a bad bishop after '''26.e4'''. However, the bad bishop on d5 exerts power in both directions. By contrast, the Black bishop on a6 is &quot;much better&quot;, but it is much less active. White has a plan now of putting pressure on b6, followed by the exchange of the base on b6. Black's forces are not well-placed enough to combat this, and thus cannot regroup in time to protect the c-pawn. '''26...Bc8 27.Qa4 Bd7 28.Qa7 Be8 29.Rb1 Rd6''' Black has covered the b-pawn. However, once it's exchanged, Black cannot defend the c-pawn and will lose a pawn. '''30.a4 Kh7 31.a5 bxa5 32.Qxa5''' Notice that White did not play to ''win'' the b-pawn, just to ''exchange'' it. Why? The result is that the rest of the chain, on c5, becomes weak. '''32...Ra6 33.Qxc5 Ra2 34.Qe3!''' White returns the queen in time to prevent Black's threats from materializing. Black was aiming at 34...Qg5 35.g4 Qd2, when nothing can prevent mate. '''34...Qa6 35.Rb8 Qa4 36.Kh2 Ra3 37.Qc5 Ra2 38.Ra8''' Now Black is forced to give up even more material to prolong the game. '''38...Qxa8 39.Bxa8 Rxa8 40.Qxe5 Bc6 41.Qc7''' Black resigned. 

Botvinnik used his mastery of bishops and chains to first win a pawn, and then a game. It turns out that the bad bishop on d5 was not so bad after all!

==The bishop pair==
The bishop, by itself, is still a powerful piece. However, its value is more than doubled when another bishop is added to it. Think about it this way: The main drawback of a bishop is that it can only move on half of the squares on the board. However, when two bishops are sweeping the board, nothing is safe from their malevolent eyes. The two bishops can usually outweigh other positional considerations, such as pawn structure. The following game is Botvinnik--Smyslov, Moscow 1948. '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bg5''' The ever-popular Richter-Rauzer Variation. '''6...e6 7.Be2 Be7 8.O-O O-O 9.N4b5 a6 10.Bxf6 gxf6''' Starting here, White has a plan of wrecking Black's pawn structure. This gives him a static advantage: it will last into the endgame. However, later he becomes so lost in this plan that he forgets about dynamic considerations. '''11.Nd4 Kh8 12.Kh1 Rg8''' A good open file for the rook. Black has good kingside chances because of his two bishop and open g-file. '''13.f4 Bd7 14.Bf3 Rc8''' So here Black has two bishops, but unfortunately they are not very active at the moment (this is characteristic of the Richter-Rauzer). However, Black's position is very solid. White's typical plan here would be to gain a support point on d5 with the moves f4-f5, pressuring e6. If the pawn moves, the d5 square is suddenly available to White's knights, while the bishops remain inactive. However, White begins to play for a superior pawn structure and forgets the effect this will have on the minor pieces. '''15.Nxc6? bxc6!''' Black takes away d5 from the knight and begins to play for a central break. '''16.Ne2''' White intends to play 17.c4, putting the permanent kibbutz on ...d5. However, there came '''16...d5!'''. White tried to get a better pawn structure with '''17.f5?!''' This allows Black to open up the position even further for his bishops. '''17...Qc7 18.c4 dxc4 19.Qd4 c5 20.Qxc4 Bd6 21.g3 Bb5''' Now both bishops begin to activate. Soon they will dominate the entire board. '''22.Qc2 exf5!''' Finishing the self-destruction of his own pawn formation. However, the e-file and long diagonal have opened up, and White now feels the full brunt of the bishop pair. '''23.exf5 Rce8 24.Rf2 Re3''' Penetrating down to the third rank. '''25.Bg2 Qe7 26.Ng1 Bd3''' The bishops, especially the one on d3 (remember, this is the one that was &quot;blocked&quot; by the c-pawn) slice into White's kingside. Two rooks, on the e-file and g-file, bear down at their targets. '''27.Qd2 c4 28.Rf3 Re8 29.Rd1 Bc5''' White's pieces are being eaten alive. Note that his pieces are too passive to be making use of the weak pawns on a6 and f6. '''30.b3 Re1 31.bxc4 Bxc4 32.Bf1 Rxd1 33.Qxd1 Rd8 34.Qc2 Bd5''' White can resign here. He is about to lose a lot of material. '''35.Qc3 Bd4!''' Taking time to guard his pawn. '''36.Qd3 Qe3! 37.Qxe3 Bxe3 38.Bg2 Bxf3 39.Bxf3 Rd2 40.Ne2 Rxa2''', and White resigned.
 
So here, although White had a clear structural advantage, he forgot to take into account the destructive power of two bishops. In fact, the activity of these two pieces was so great, it forced White to take up a passive, defensive position. With White tied up, Black could force the exchange of queens, win material, and then win the endgame.
  
===Play against the bishop pair===
When do the bishop pair suffer? In many cases. Closed positions, for example, block the activity of the bishops. Sometimes, if the knights are simply better-placed than the bishops, the knights will do better. Here's an early example.

| '''Brinkman--Nimzowitsch, Denmark 1922'''
''Position after White's 20th move''
|}



This is the game Brinkman--Nimzowitsch, Denmark 1922. White has the bishop pair. However, since the position is closed, this is not an important factor. In fact, Black has all of the play in this position. He will play to create pawn blockades and conquer support points for the knights. With this in mind, Nimzowitsch played '''20...b5!''' &quot;Sacrifice for the blockade,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Black gives up a pawn in order to create the possibility of exchanging the opponent's light-squared bishop.&quot; The idea is that after the light-squared bishop is exchanged, White will have no light-squared guardians, and be in danger. '''21.Bxb5 Rab8 22.Be2 Nb6 23.Kd1?''' Better was to accept the sacrifice with 23.Bxh5 Nc4 24.Qc2 Nxa3! 25.Qd2 Nc4!, with a draw by repetition. Instead, White erroneously believes that his bishop pair will win the game for him. '''23...Nc4 24.Bxc4 Rxc4''' Now the strength of his other knight grows. The remaining bishop is very bad. '''25.Rg5 Ng7 26.h5 Nf5 27.hxg6 fxg6 27.Rxf5''' The knight was about equal to the rook, so White does not hesitate to take it off. '''28...exf5 29.Bxa5 Rb3!''' Material is level, but White's light squares are critically weak. '''30.Ke2 Qb7 31.Bb4 Qa6!''' and White resigns. The threat is a discovered check, and it is unstoppable.

So it was Nimzowitsch, one of the greatest chess thinkers, who formulated the plan to beat the bishop pair. Do one of these three things:
:1. Arrange a pawn blockade so as to '''limit the scope of the opponent's bishops.'''
:2. Conquer support squares for the knights so you can '''make your knights at least equal to the bishops.'''
:3. Exchange off one of the bishops (preferably the good one, if there is a bad one) so as to '''diminish the value of the remaining bishop.'''

==Knights vs. bishops==
This is usually one of the most interesting conflicts in chess. Both pieces are worth about three pawns, yet they are completely different from one another. Bishops are long-range artillery, while knights are slow hoppers. Knights can tour the whole board, but half the real estate is off-limits to a bishop. Bishops can &quot;lose&quot; moves in an endgame, but knights can jump over pieces. The list is endless.

| '''O'Kelly--Najdorf, Dubrovnik 1950'''
''Position after White's 16th move''
|}

White has a spatial advantage because of his binding pawns on c4 and e4. The bishop on g2 can always free itself with an e4-e5 advance, and he threatens to fork on c7. This would lead us to the conclusion that White is better. But that would be incorrect! It is Black's move now, and he needs to think of a plan--fast. 

Give up? I'll walk you through it. We realize that at least one of the knights must be eliminated. But which one? Our eyes are drawn to 16...Nxd5 and 16...Bxb5. After 16...Bxb5, the c-file has been opened up, so that factor must be taken into account. Also, it creates an imbalanced position--bishop versus knight. If the c5-knight can be driven away somehow, the pressure on c7 will become quite unbearable. Bearing this in mind, Black played '''16...Nxd5! 17.exd5''' 17.cxd5 hangs the knight, and 17.Rxd5 loses the e-pawn after 17...Bc6. But now the bishop on g2 has been blocked out of the game permanently, because there is no freeing pawn advance. '''17...Bxb5 18.cxd5''' So far, Black has exchanged pieces (good for the cramped side) and given up a bishop for a knight. White has a half-open c-file. True, the knight on c5 plugs it up, but it can be driven away by the b-pawn or captured by the bishop. Black must eliminate both &quot;public enemies&quot;. '''18...a3! 19.Bd4?''' White has no hope for active play now, since he has a bad bishop and Black has a beautiful knight. Better was to sacrifice the Exchange for active play with 19.b4! Bxa1 20.Rxa1. True, Black is up the Exchange, but on the other hand, White has the bishop pair, more space, threats down the c-file, and weak dark squares to play with. So he has adequate compensation. '''19...Bxd4''' Public enemy #1 has been eliminated. '''20.Rxd4 axb2''' And next comes enemy #2. '''21.Qxb2 b6!''' This move cements the knight on c5 (preventing any sacrifices of the Exchange for a pawn), fixes the pawn on b5 (thereby limiting the scope of the White bishop) and prevents White from getting counterplay with a possible b5-b6 break. '''22.Rd2 Qf5''' Black has secured a better minor piece and better pawn structure. He can now think about another plan. One thing to note is that Black does not have to proceed with speed. There is no chance that White's bishop will ever become good, and the White pawns will ''always'' be weak. Black's plan is to take control of the open e-file. '''23.Re2 Nd3 24.Rxe8+ Rxe8 25.Qc2 Qe5!''' Seizing full control of the e-file and getting out of the pin. '''26.Rd1 Nc5 27.h4 Qe2''' Penetrating. '''28.Qd2 Qxb5''' Threatening now to bring his rook down to the second. '''29.Re1 Rxe1 30.Qxe1 Qb2''' Without rooks Black's advantage is highlighted. White has no counterplay, and although he controls the e-file, it is meaningless because there are no penetration points. 31.Qe8+ Kg7 32.Qc8 Qxf2 33.Qxc7 immediately fails to 33...Nxe4, winning. '''31.f4 Kf8''' Preventing the queen from penetrating. '''32.f5 Qe5 33.Qf1 Qxf5 34.Qxf5 gxf5 35.Bf3 Ne4''' The heavy pieces are gone, so there is no longer any need to keep the c-file blocked. '''36.Bxh5 Nc3 37.Bf3 Nxa2''', White resigned.

When looking at this game, the reader should realize that Black's minor piece advantage was permanent and lasting. Black built up a plan based on this, and the rewards were great. Also note that once Black won material, he did not start playing &quot;lazy&quot; moves.

===When the bishop is superior to the knight===
Of course, the opposite can happen. Just as often, the bishop is superior to the knight. The game above made it look as if bishops are easy creatures to contain. Nothing could be further from the truth. Just remember Botvinnik--Smyslov, and you'll correct your mistake.

''Position after White's 22nd move''
|}


Black has many weak points and an extra pawn, but most importantly White has a bishop for a knight. The long-range powers of a bishop manifest themselves most greatly in this type of position. By switching attacks between a7, c5, and e6, White will keep Black moving. Eventually something will crack: because of White's greater mobility, he can move faster than Black. '''22...Nb5 23.Be3 Rc8 24.Ra6 Nd6 25.Qe5 Nf7''' In desperation, Black sacrifices back a pawn to make the transition into some kind of tenable endgame. However, White's pressure does not let up. His bishop is simply too active. '''26.Qxe6 Qxe6 27.Rxe6 a5 28.Bd2''' Black's correct method of thinking is to exchange the pawns so that it's a more manageable two vs. two or two vs. one situation on the kingside. This follows the rule that knights are better in endgame situations with pawns on one side of the board. '''28...Ra8 29.Rc6 a4 30.bxa4 Rxa4 31.Rxc5''' So now White enjoys his positional advantage, plus the advantage of a pawn. '''31...Nd6 32.Rc6 Nc4 33.Bg5''' From g5 the bishop controls many important squares, but due to its long-range power it can still eye the queenside. '''33...Kf7 34.Kf2 Ke8 39.Rc7 Nd6 36.Ke2 Rc4 37.Rxc4 Nxc4 38.Kd3 Ne5+ 39.Kd4 Nc6+ 40.Kc5 Kd7 41.Bf6!''' Limiting the mobility of Black's knight as much as possible. This is a favor that the knight cannot return. '''41...Na7 42.Kd5 Nc8 43.Bg5 Nb6+ 44.Ke5 Nc4+ 45.Kf6 Na3 46.Kg7''' Black resigns, because the kingside pawns will be swallowed up.

So in this game, White was down a pawn--down a pawn, but still managed to win! This was in part due to Black's weak pawns, but mostly because of the activity of the White bishop. Leaping across the board in a single bound, the slow-moving knight was no match for the bishop.





==Knights and their support points==
The last game we will see shows support points in action. In a normal Ruy Lopez, both sides fight to get their own advanced support points. The game is Kavalek--Karpov, Caracas 1970. '''1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.O-O Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.h3 Na5''' The books say that &quot;a knight on the rim is dim&quot;, but it plans to chase the bishop to c2, where it will be even dimmer. '''10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 Qc7''' This is known as the Chigorin Variation of the Ruy Lopez and is the blueprint beginning of tens of thousands of grandmaster games. Black retains a strong-point on e5 while keeping his position flexible. White has a variety of plans, but the one chosen by White in this game will be revealed later. '''12.Nbd2''' Note that this is not the final square for the knight: it is a stopping point. The knight usually goes to f1 and then to either e3 or g3. '''12...Nc6 13.dxc5 dxc5''' This idea was discovered by Fischer. White captures on c5 and leaves Black with two holes, on d5 and f5. White will play to occupy them with knights. '''14.Nf1!''' Steering towards d5 and f5 by going to e3. '''14...Be6 15.Ne3 Rad8 16.Qe2 c4!''' Black's move lays claim to d3. Now he plans to maneuver a knight there. He intends ...Nf6-d7-c5-d3. '''17.Nf5''' Here White has a knight on the fifth rank. Black can do one of three things, two of which are listed below.
:1. '''He can chase it away with g7-g6.''' However, this is a weakening move, and Black's kingside dark squares are weak. Black's king is now a target.
:2. '''He can take it with ...Bxe6.''' But, after 18.exf5 Rfe8 19.Ng5! h6 20.Ne4 Nxe4 21.Bxe4 White has activated his bishop on the long, light diagonal and enjoys a stable plus due to his bishop pair and spatial advantage.
Or, he can choose the move Karpov made, '''17...Rfe8''', which refuses to panic. '''18.N3h4''' Another exception to the &quot;a knight on the rim is dim&quot; rule. White cements his control over f5. '''18...Kh8 19.Nxe7 Qxe7 20.Qf3 Nd7''' At last Black gets to execute his own plan. '''21.Nf5 Qf8 22.Be3''' Black's position is clearly inferior: he has less space. Still, his next move is a blunder, though a natural move. '''22...Nc5? 23.Nxg7!''' A sharp blow. After 23...Kxg7 (23...Qxg7 hangs the knight to 24.Bxc5) 24.Bh6+! Kxh6 25.Qf6+ leads to mate. White eventually won.

This is an example of the efforts both players. Both players tried to create an outpost for their knights. It also went to show how great knights could be once they landed on their dream squares.

===Playing against the knights===
Playing against the knights has been seen in all of the examples on this page. However, there are certain points to keep in mind:
:1. Play to deny the opponent's knights support points. Kick them out of their advanced squares with pawns (pieces if possible), unless the pawn moves weaken your position.
:2. Open the board for your bishop(s). Once this is done, the bishop will evidently be superior due to its long-range abilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Smoke=
Cigarette smoke is composed of over 4000 different chemicals, many of which are toxic. Both smoke that the smoker inhales (through the filter) and the smoke from the burning end is incredibly toxic. There are three main components that are hazardous to health.


*Tar - settles in the lungs and stimulates a series of changes that lead to obstructive lung disease and lung cancer
*Nicotine - is the addictive element of cigarettes, stimulates the nervous system to reduce arteriole diameter and release adrenaline - increasing heart rate and blood pressure. Causes increased stickiness of blood platelets, which increases the risk of blood clotting.
*Carbon monoxide - combines irreversibly with haemoglobin meaning that oxygen cannot bind effectivley. This causes a strain on the heart muscle because it must pump more to provide the same amount of oxygen

=Lung Disease=

Chronic obstructive lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema) are now prevalent because of smoking and vehicle/industrial emissions. Lung diseases can be caused by a variety of things such as potentially harmful gases and particles, being deposited in the alveoli, and this can enhance the risk of viruses such as influenza.   

Allergens that cause large coughing fits, such as those found in asthmatic attacks can cause long term damage to the alveoli.

===Lung Cancer===

Tobacco smoke contains tar, and tar contains several carcinogens. These can make DNA in epithelial cells lining the lungs mutate, which is the first step towards a malignant tumour. This tumour then develops into the lymphatic system after spreading through bronchial epithelium and it is here, in the lymph system where cancerous cells can break away and spread around the organ, causing secondary tumours.



===Emphysema===

Emphysema is the condition in which bronchioles collapse, leaving large spaces where surface area for gaseous exchange used to be. This is because the lungs are constantly infected, causing phagocytes to line the airways, and to reach them they release a protein digesting enzyme known as elastase - this destroys the elastin in the walls of the alveoli allowing the phagocytes to enter and remove bacteria. However, this elastin is vital, without it, the alveoli do not stretch and recoil when breathing in and out, causing bronchioles to collapse. The initial inflammation is caused by infections which in turn is caused by the accumulated mucus as a result of the tar in the lungs.

People with emphysema cannot oxygenate their blood very well, and thus breathe rapidly - blood pressure also increases as blood vessels in the lungs become more resistant to the flow of blood. Lung function will deteriorate and people with severe emphysema may need a supply of oxygen through a face mask to stay alive.

===Chronic Bronchitis===

Tar destroys and weakens cilia, inhibiting the cleaning of the airways. It also stimulates goblet cells to secrete more mucus, making mucus accumulate in the bronchioles, and thus mucus starts to fill up the holes and cannot be moved by the cilia. Thus bacteria and viruses collect and block the bronchioles, causing the smoker to cough in an attempt to move the mucus up the airways. 

The damaged cilliated epithelial cells are replaced by scar tissue, thickening the airways and making it more difficult to move air in and out of the lungs. Infections also easily develop in the accumulated mucus, inflaming the airways. The damage and blocking of the airways is chronic bronchitis.

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease===

Emphysema and chronic bronchitis together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a progressively degenerating disease. Reversal is very rare, the damage to the lungs can sometimes be reversed if smoking is given up when young. COPD is responsible for &gt;300,000 deaths a year in the UK.

==Evidence==

===Epidemiological===
[[Image:Cancer_smoking_lung_cancer_correlation_from_NIH.svg|right]]


Cigarette smoking began en masse in the beginning of the twentieth century, and doctors started noticing a huge increase in cases of lung cancer from 1930 onwards, and by 1950s it was declared an epidemic. For comparison, in 1912 there were 374 lung cancer cases, and now there are over 35,000 deaths a year, an increase of nearly 100 times.

The correlation between lung cancer and cigarette smoking is plain in the chart to the right - it shows the 20 year 'lag' between the rise of cigarettes and the rise of lung cancer. Epidemiological data links smoking and cancer, and up to 50% of smokers may die of smoking-related diseases.

One third of cancer deaths are as a result of cigarette smoking, and a quarter of smokers die of lung cancer. 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is very rare in non smokers, less than 10% of victims are non-smokers, and less than 2% of people with emphysema are non-smokers. One fifth of smokers suffer from emphysema, and as a result deaths from pneumonia and influenza are twice as high amongst smokers.

Epidemiological studies have ruled out other factors, that is to say that they cannot find any other factor with a close correlation with smoking. Smoking has been found to have a direct link with lung cancer, as smoking is the common fact in almost all cases. Smoking also contributes to many other cancers of the mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney and pancreas.

===Experimental===

Epidemiological evidence is sometimes questioned, as it does not 'prove' sufficiently for some that there is a definite link between lung cancer and smoking. However, there is also experimental evidence to prove a direct causative link between smoking and lung cancer.

In the 1960s, an ethically questionable experiment was setup to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke on lungs. One group of 24 dogs were forced to smoke filter-tipped cigarettes and did not develop cancer, whilst 24 other dogs smoke plain cigarettes and developed tumours similar to those found in human lung cancer patients. COPD was also recognised in the plain-cigarette dogs. The healthy group of 24 dogs did not develop tumours, but this is thought to be due to the relativley (to the time a smoker may smoke in their lifetime) short time of the experiment. 

Chemical analysis of cigarette smoke shows that tar contains a wide variety of carcinogens, and when this tar is painted on the skins of mice, cancerous growths are shown to develop.

=Cardiovascular diseases=
[[Image:Endo_dysfunction_Athero.PNG|right|300px]]
All cardiovascular disease are degenerative diseases of the heart and/or circulatory system, and are a major cause of death in developed countries. They are multifactorial, meaning that many factors contribute to the development of these disease, and smoking is a big one.

==Atherosclerosis==


Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, in large part due to the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells. The accumulation of fatty material in artery walls damages the arteries, which produces the invasion of macrophages whose secretions stimulate the growth of muscle cells to aid repair and the accumulation of cholesterol.

Cholesterol is an essential biochemical, but it causes problems if it is to accumulate in tissues. This is due to its insolubility - if it is transported in the blood it is done so in tiny balls of lipid and protein known as a lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are in two groups, LDLs and HDLS (low and high density respectively). These LDLs transport cholesterol to the artery walls and unfortunately deposit their cholesterol at damaged sites, whereas HDLs transport it to the liver to be excreted.

These cholesterol deposits form plaques in the arteries, causing them to be less elastic and providing greater resistance to the flow of blood. These plaques cause the blood to flow roughly, making it likely to clot, forming a thrombus, disrupting blood anymore. See the picture on the right for the stages of atherosclerosis and more detail (click to enlarge).


==Strokes==

Stroke is the rapidly developing loss of brain functions due to either a blood vessel in the brain bursting or a blocking in a brain artery due to atherosclerosis or a thrombus. They can be instantly fatal or severely disabling to the victim - it depends on how much of the brain is affected.

=Coronary Heart Disease=
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is also a cardiovascular disease and is disease of the two coronary arteries (the ones that supply the muscles of the heart). It is as a result of atherosclerosis narrowing the coronary arteries, restricting the blood flow, forcing the heart to work harder to force the blood through, raising the blood pressure. It can cause anything from chest pain to a fatal heart attack.

===Angina===

Angina is the main symptom of CHD, and is characterised by severe chest pain during exercise, caused by a shortage of blood to the heart muscle.

===Heart failure===
A heart failure is the result of CHD that does not end in a heart attack, and the heart simply gives out due to the gradual damage of the heart muscle - eventually it fails to pump efficiently and the victim dies.

===Heart attack===

Also known as a myocardial infarction - this is when a large enough branch of the coronary artery is obstructed by a blood clot, and thus part of the heart is starved of oxygen and dies. Depending on how much of the heart dies, this can be fatal, and brings severe and sudden chest pain.

==Epidemiological evidence==

Coronary heart disease remains a major killer across the world in 2008, and is most prevalent in Russia, and least prevalent in Japan (counting only the developed world). Coronary heart disease death rates differ also within countries, and between socio-economic stratas - in the UK, poor people, certain ethnic groups and men are more at risk. This data tells us that people are not equally at risk of developing CHD.

===Risk Factors===
There are many known CHD risk factors. You can control some risk factors, but not others. Risk factors you can control include:

1. High blood cholesterol and triglyceride (tri-GLIS-er-ide) levels (a type of fat found in the        blood)
2. High blood pressure
3. Diabetes and prediabetesexternal link icon
4. Overweight and obesity
5. Smoking
6. Lack of physical activity
7. Unhealthy diet
8. Stress

==Prevention &amp; cure==

Coronary heart disease is a major killer in the UK and is also one of the biggest examples of avoidable ill health. For this reason governments are encouraging people to take more exercise, give up smoking and reduce the fat in their diet in an effort to reduce coronary heart disease death rates.

Treatment includes drugs to reduce blood clotting, lower blood pressure and decrease the concentration of cholesterol in the blood. If these are not successful, a coronary by-pass may be carried out - this operation takes a blood vessel from else where on the body, and attaching it to the coronary artery, 'by-passing' the clot in the artery blockage. If this does not or cannot work, a complete heart transplant may be given - but this is very difficult to since a donor must be found that matches the recipients tissues etc. Heart transplants are usually refused to people who have not completely given up drink and smoking, in an effort to improve the health of the waiting list and to ensure that the few hearts they do get are not then ruined.

'''Vodka''' is purified by distillation from a fermented substance such as grain or molasses, and it usually has an alcohol content of 35% to 50% by volume (70 - 100º proof). Vodka consists primarily of water and alcohol (ethanol), and sometimes various flavorings.

{{Wikipedia|Vodka}}
The classic Russian and Polish vodka is 40% ABV (USA 80 proof). This can be attributed to the Russian standards for vodka production introduced in 1894 by Alexander III from research undertaken by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. According to the Vodka Museum in Moscow, Mendeleev found the perfect percentage to be 38. However, since spirits in his time were taxed on their strength, the percentage was rounded up to 40 to simplify the tax computation. At strengths less than this, vodka drunk [[Bartending/Cocktails/Neat|neat]] can taste &quot;watery&quot;; above this strength, the taste of vodka can have more &quot;burn&quot;. Some governments set a minimum alcohol content for a spirit to be called &quot;vodka&quot;. For example, the European Union sets a minimum of 37.5% alcohol by volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ginvodka.org/history/vodkaproduction.html Gin and Vodka Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although vodka is generally drunk neat in its Eastern European and Scandinavian homeland, its growth in popularity elsewhere owes much to its usefulness in cocktails and other mixed drinks, such as the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Bloody Mary|bloody Mary]], the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Screwdriver|screwdriver]], the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Vodka tonic|vodka tonic]], and the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Martini|vodka martini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Dietary Reference Values=

Dietary reference values are just that - they are values that can help you plan your diet and ensure you are receiving everything you need in the right proportions. Dietary reference values are calculated for the following dietary components;

*Estimated average requirement (energy/nutrients) - this is an estimate of the average requirements of a population
*Reference nutrient intake - enough or more for nearly all the population
*Low reference nutrient intake - sufficient for those with low needs.

==Uses==

Dietary reference values are used by people cooking for large groups of people - school caterers, hospitals and prisons for example. However, people suffering from disease will require different diets, so it is important to remember that a dietary reference value is an average, and so applies to groups and not individuals.

===Circumstances===

Circumstances affect how much should be consumed in accordance with dietary reference values.

====Pregnancy and lactation====

Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not affect an increase in a woman's intake of energy - she uses her fat stores and utilises micro nutrients more effectively to achieve this. However, pregnant women or those trying to conceive are advised to take folic acid to protect against defects such as neural tubes developing in the fetus. Vitamin D is recommended to be increased in both pregnancy and lactation.

====Age, gender and activity====

All these things can affect how much food you require - for example, men require more energy than women, the young require certain things for growth. Those with a high activity level such as athletes, who will need higher levels than the population average and thus cannot easily utilise dietary reference values.

===Food Labels===

Dietary reference values are also used on food labels to allow customers to make the choice that they want. Manufacturers may publish Recommended daily allowance information, and this must be accurate by law - for a food to be a source of a nutrient it must have at least 17% of the recommended daily allowance for that nutrient, and if it is 'rich in' a nutrient, it must contain over 50% of the recommended daily allowance for that nutrient.

=A balanced diet=

A balanced diet is one which contains adequate amounts of all the necessary energy and nutrients required for healthy growth and activity. This includes both macro nutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) and micro nutrients (vitamins and minerals). Sometimes cells can convert one compound to another, but this is not the case with a few things, and these are known as essential since we must intake them in our food to survive. They include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids and most minerals.

===Additional information===

The tables above does not cover all you need to know about the components of a balanced diet.

====Proteins====

There are 20 different amino acids, and we must take some in our diet as we can not convert others to them - these are known as essential amino acids and there are 8 of them. A balanced diet will include these 8 and a good supply of the non-essential 12. Vegetarians and vegans may have to take protein supplements to ensure they receive their essential amino acids.

====Vitamins====

Only vitamin D and K can be made by the body, so the rest are essential components.

====Fats====

There are only two essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and linolenic acid - again these are fatty acids we cannot synthesise from other molecules. We do not require many of these, especially since well-nourished people will have nearly a year's supply in their fat stores. Fats usually provide energy.

====Fibre====

Plants often provide this in the form of cellulose, large complex compounds that we cannot digest so they simply pass through, providing bulk to the food. This bulk aids in peristalsis and retains water, the latter of which aids in passing faeces.

====Water====

Water is lost in the breath, sweat and faeces. It must be replaced, as death can occur from dehydration after a few days - it is an essential solvent.

=Malnutrition=

Malnutrition is the general term for a medical condition caused by an improper or insufficient diet. It is usually caused by inadequate consumption, but as with obesity can be caused by over-consumption.

==Anorexia==

Anorexia nervosa, a psychological disease with physical consequences, and in extreme cases it can be fatal. Anorexia develops from extreme dieting, causing a weight well below normal, but the anorexic will continue to diet, sometimes until death. Symptoms include muscle wasting, thin sparse hair, low blood pressure, little to none sexual development (periods may stop) and a significant loss of body fat. Anorexics are also particularly susceptible to infection.

==Obesity==

In stark contrast to anorexia, obesity lies at the other end of the spectrum and is caused by eating more energy than used. The energy is stored as fat, and as weight increases, risk of other diseases such as CHD (see [[A-level_Biology/Human_Health_and_Disease/smoking_and_disease|Smoking and Disease]]) and diabetes. The obese usually have high cholesterol and blood pressure, and are also are risk of several cancers, arthritis (from the increased strain on the skeleton), hernias and gallstones.

==Starvation==

This is both a lack of energy and nutrients, and the body can last a rather large amount of time without food (as opposed to without water), since it will drop it's metabolic rate and utilise its reserves of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The body uses glycogen stores in the liver (for less than a day), then fat stores (for 4-6 weeks, depending on the person) and finally protein in muscles and other tissues. However, as long as people are well fed before the starvation, they are usually ok for a while - but this is not true of those with previous deficiency, especially vitamin A deficiency.

===Protein energy deficiencies===

In kwashiorkor, deficiency disease known to cause low weight, oedema, muscle waste, brittle hair, bloated appearance and loss of appetite, the body cannot make the proteins it needs during a period of low food because of the lack of energy and those already in the body are broken down for energy. This includes protein in the muscle and blood plasma, reducing solute concentration in blood plasma, increasing water potential. This causes water to not be absorbed into the blood from tissue fluid, causing tissue to swell (known as oedema).

Those who suffer from kwashiokor are often stunted as a result, and permanently cannot grow to their full potential.

==Vitamin A deficiency==

Vitamin A deficiencies in children cause xerophthalmia, which is a drying or scarring of the cornea, causing night blindness, since vitamin A is converted into the pigment rhodopsin, which is used by rod cells at night. Also, epithelial cells use retionol from vitamin A to make retinoic acid, a chemical that aids cell growth, and without it the epithelia are not maintained properly and the body becomes susceptible to infections in the gut or gaseous exchange system, where epithelia cells protects it. 

Vitamin A is found in some animal foods such as milk, eggs and fish-liver oils, and some fruits.

==Vitamin D deficiency==

Vitamin D is usually synthesised in the skin using the suns energy in combination with cholesterol, and thus people usually receive enough from this source, but dark-skinned people and those whose religion requires them to cover their skin are advised to take vitamin D supplements. A vitamin d deficiency can cause rickets in children, since it regulates the deposition of calcium. In adults, it causes osteomalacia, which is a condition where the bones soften, causing them to be susceptible to fracture.

Blood tests have to be done and d-forte tabs 25000 iu has to be used once weekly for 1 month then every 2 weeks for one month and continue with 1 cap every month 

In individuals where the reading is less than 100, the capsule needs to be taken twice weekly for a month. 25000 I U = 1.25 MG

===5.Bg5===
This super-sharp move is often today a true gambit. White intends to offer the c-pawn as a real sacrifice. Here Black can try the solid 5...Nbd7, which leads into the Queen's Gambit Declined (Cambridge Springs Variation), the sharp '''Botvinnik Variation''' (5...dxc4 6.e4 b5 7.e5 h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5! hxg5 10.Bxg5 with tremendous complications), or the even sharper main line, 5...h6 6.Bh4 dxc4 7.e4 g5 8.Bg3 b5.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Yield to Market''' refers to the following calculation:

&lt;math&gt;Current Yield = \frac{Annual Interest Payment}{Current Price}&lt;/math&gt;

Yield to market is also called '''Current Yield'''.

So, for example, if you had a bond that payed $40 semiannually, and the current price of the bond was $940, the Yield to Market would be 8.51%.

Yield to Maturity is not a very good measure of a bond's value. It does not take into consideration the price paid for the bond, nor the prevailing interest rates, nor the credit rating of the bond.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This document entails issues you might encounter with PulseAudio.


== Verbose error capturing ==
Wanto to figure out what PulseAudio is doing? Try the following.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; $ pulseaudio -v --log-target=stderr &lt;/source&gt;

== Errors and solutions ==

=== Wrong Sample Freq ===

==== Symptom ====

If you have the sample frequence set wrong you might encounter an error like this when you startup PulseAudio
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ pulseaudio
W: alsa-util.c: Device HDMI doesn't support 44800 Hz, changed to 48000 Hz.
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Solution ====
Explicitly set the ''rate'' for the PulseAudio module in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/pulse/default.pa&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
load-module module-alsa-sink device=HDMI rate=48000
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sound Stop Working ===

==== Symptom ====
You suddenly have no sound afer you wake up your computer or when you plug headphones, but alsamixer show that sound is enabled and volume can be hight.

==== Solution ====
Check [[Configuring_Sound_on_Linux/Pulse_Audio/Testing|pacmd]] command if your sound is not mute:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ pacmd
Welcome to PulseAudio! Use &quot;help&quot; for usage information.

&lt;/source&gt;
Second sink is mute so we need to unmute it
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; set-sink-mute 1 false
&lt;/source&gt;
Additionaly restarting pulseaudio may be needed
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ sudo /etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart
&lt;/source&gt;
NOTE: If you play video using flash in Browser (like YouTube) you can enable sound but when you exit from pacmd the sound stop and when you try to enter pacmd again to show that pulseaudio is not running in the session, in this case refreshing the page with the video solve the issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This document will teach you how to find an address and confirm it is working.

== Find the hardware address ==

=== Using aplay ===
The stock ALSA utility '''aplay''' can tell you the hardware addresses of the devices it is ready to utilize. Simply supply to aplay the &lt;tt&gt;--list-devices&lt;/tt&gt; argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ aplay --list-devices
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: HDMI [HDA ATI HDMI], device 3: ATI HDMI [ATI HDMI]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
&lt;/source&gt;

Note, for this card the notation for the physical address would be &lt;tt&gt;hw:0,3&lt;/tt&gt;. While the device name, is &lt;tt&gt;HDMI&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Using /proc ===
Here we will use proc to query our kernel for information.

By viewing the virtual file &lt;tt&gt;/proc/asound/cards&lt;/tt&gt; your kernel will show you the device names for the cards it is has ready for use. If your card isn't listed here then your kernel does not support it. The device names can be found in the brackets.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat /proc/asound/cards
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of the output for device &lt;tt&gt;HDMI&lt;/tt&gt; might be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 0 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI HDMI
                      HDA ATI HDMI at 0xfbee8000 irq 19
&lt;/source&gt;



The kernel should have created a virtual directory for each card in &lt;tt&gt;/proc/asound&lt;/tt&gt;. The directories associated with the card will be prefixed by 'card' and suffixed by the number of the card, ex.,  card0, card1, etc.; i.e., '0' in our example.

Inside of these directories you will find a simple list of files.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ tree /proc/asound/card0/
/proc/asound/card0/
|-- codec#0
|-- id
|-- oss_mixer
`-- pcm3p
    |-- info
    `-- sub0
        |-- hw_params
        |-- info
        |-- prealloc
        |-- prealloc_max
        |-- status
        `-- sw_params

2 directories, 10 files
&lt;/source&gt;

The most important file is the &lt;tt&gt;pcm3p/info&lt;/tt&gt;, by examining this file we can finish our search for the hardware coordinates of the sound devices.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm3p/info
card: 0
device: 3
subdevice: 0
stream: PLAYBACK
id: ATI HDMI
name: ATI HDMI
subname: subdevice #0
class: 0
subclass: 0
subdevices_count: 1
subdevices_avail: 1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Writing the hardware address ==

Now you know the basics about your card! Specifically, you'll need the '''card number''', and the '''device number'''. These two are often seen in ALSA hardware notation as &lt;tt&gt;hw:CARD,DEVICE&lt;/tt&gt;, which is totally dependant on the order the kernel detects them.

== Test the address ==

Firstly, make sure your device in question is un-muted!
You can test the functionality of you default card at any time by using the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | aplay &lt;/source&gt;

This will bombard your card with random and totally irrelevant data. Your card will present this data to you in the form of sound à la modem noise. To stop that noise ^D (hold Control and press D). Alternatively, you can use the dd command to flash-test.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; dd if=/dev/urandom count=5 | aplay &lt;/source&gt;

Presumably, if you're reading this tutorial your sound isn't working. You might want to explicitly test a sound device, or you might be having problems with the default and want to try out another device. Whatever have you, the ''-D'' argument to aplay does just that.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | aplay -D hw:0,3 ## Where 0,3 is your hardware's coordinates&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Errors and Solutions ==

=== Kernel lacks appropriate modules ===

==== Symptom ====
Indicated by:
* The virtual directory &lt;tt&gt;/proc/asound&lt;/tt&gt; is not present
* The command &lt;tt&gt;aplay -l&lt;/tt&gt; returns no sound cards present
* The sound card shows up under some hardware detection mechanism, i.e., lspci

Sometimes the cause of this is selectively pulling out modules suggested by a dist-upgrade, such as the kernel, without the kernel modules.

==== Solution ====
Add the appropriate modules to your kernel. In Ubuntu you can upgrade to the newest kernel and modules by issuing the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; $ sudo apt-get install linux-generic &lt;/source&gt;



=== Invalid card specified ===

==== Symptom ====
If you encounter the following error it simply means you are targeting a non-existent or erroneous device:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ cat /dev/urandom | aplay
ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:1207:(_snd_pcm_hw_open) Invalid value for card
aplay: main:546: audio open error: No such file or directory
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Solution ====
This can often be remedied by simply specifying the device explicitly.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | aplay -D hw:0,3 &lt;/source&gt;

=== Bad sample ===

==== Symptom ====
This is a rather complex option . Essentially, hardware expects a certain datatype for the sound sample, and you're providing the wrong one.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; aplay: set_params:901: Sample format non available &lt;/source&gt;

==== Solution ====
Specify the sample format, or amend the rate in the ALSA conf file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | aplay -f S16_LE ## Where S16_LE is your desired rate &lt;/source&gt;


=== No channel count ===

==== Symptom ====
If you do not provide to ALSA the amount of channels you wish to output to, you'll get the following error:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; aplay: set_params:901: Sample format non available &lt;/source&gt;

==== Solution ====
Specify the amount of channels you wish to output too. Two is considered safe for the purpose of troubleshooting. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | aplay -c 2 ## Two channels is stereo sound &lt;/source&gt;

To test a PulseAudio installation use &lt;tt&gt;pacat&lt;/tt&gt; which is equivalent to ALSA's &lt;tt&gt;aplay&lt;/tt&gt; utility.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt; cat /dev/urandom | pacat &lt;/source&gt;
[[Category:Configuring Sound on Linux|Pulse Audio/Testing]]


== Using pacmd ==

Firstly run &lt;tt&gt;pacmd&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
~$ pacmd
Welcome to PulseAudio! Use &quot;help&quot; for usage information.
&lt;/source&gt;


Next run the command &lt;tt&gt;list-sinks&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list-sinks
1 sink(s) available.
  * index: 0
        name: &lt;alsa_output.pci_8086_27d8_sound_card_0_alsa_playback_0&gt;
        driver: &lt;modules/module-alsa-sink.c&gt;
        flags: HW_VOLUME_CTRL LATENCY HARDWARE 
        state: RUNNING
        volume: &lt;0:  63% 1:  63%&gt;
        mute: &lt;0&gt;
        latency: &lt;78911 usec&gt;
        monitor source: &lt;1&gt;
        sample spec: &lt;s16le 2ch 44100Hz&gt;
        channel map: &lt;front-left,front-right&gt;
        used by: &lt;1&gt;
        linked by: &lt;1&gt;
        module: &lt;1&gt;
        description: &lt;ALSA PCM on front:0 (AD198x Analog) via DMA&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now you know the name of your sink and your index. In this example the name is &lt;tt&gt;alsa_output.pci_8086_27d8_sound_card_0_alsa_playback_0&lt;/tt&gt;, and the index is 0. Now you will want a list of samples, use &lt;tt&gt;list-samples&lt;/tt&gt; to accomplish this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list-samples
3 cache entries available.
    name: &lt;pulse-hotplug&gt;
        index: &lt;0&gt;
        sample spec: &lt;n/a&gt;
        channel map: &lt;n/a&gt;
        length: &lt;0&gt;
        duration: &lt;0.0s&gt;
        volume: &lt;0: 100% 1: 100%&gt;
        lazy: yes
        filename: /usr/share/sounds/startup3.wav
    name: &lt;esound.gnome-2/logout&gt;
        index: &lt;1&gt;
        sample spec: &lt;s16le 2ch 44100Hz&gt;
        channel map: &lt;front-left,front-right&gt;
        length: &lt;317500&gt;
        duration: &lt;1.8s&gt;
        volume: &lt;0: 100% 1: 100%&gt;
        lazy: no
        filename: n/a
    name: &lt;esound.gnome-2/login&gt;
        index: &lt;2&gt;
        sample spec: &lt;s16le 2ch 44100Hz&gt;
        channel map: &lt;front-left,front-right&gt;
        length: &lt;1361924&gt;
        duration: &lt;7.7s&gt;
        volume: &lt;0: 100% 1: 100%&gt;
        lazy: no
        filename: n/a
&lt;/source&gt;

Now you can use the command &lt;tt&gt;play-sample&lt;/tt&gt; followed by the name of the sample, and the index or the sink-name to test your PulseAudio configuration.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; play-sample pulse-hotplug 0
-or-
&gt;&gt;&gt; play-sample pulse-hotplug alsa_output.pci_8086_27d8_sound_card_0_alsa_playback_0
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

All these colour names are adjectives, e.g. ''das rote Buch'' – the red book. If a colour name is used as a noun (e.g. ''das Blau des Himmels'' – the blue of the sky) then it is a neuter noun using the article „das”.  In German, all nouns are written with a capital initial letter.

== 1993jeep cherokee,starting issuesHeadline text ==
i have a 1993 jeep cherokee.recentlyit has had problems while driving it would just shut off.it would always restart.thought problem would be pick up module in distributor.replaced part.it worked for about 200hundred miles and now wont start at all.checked timing,number one cylinder up and on top desd center,which is zero on timing marks according to chiltons book.rotor pointing to number one on distributor.firing order is correct also.replaced the coil and checked wiring.old coil was still showing good ohms.also replaced cam sensor.still not starting.could you give me some advice.

how much do you have to tourque on a new bearing?
Ok well maybe see if there is some &quot;vert de gris&quot; ( i'm french)but of you clean tes capteurs ça pourrais aider

== I have a suggestion for you... ==

I have a 1992 Jeep Cherokee Lorado (XJ). I found this site that may help you find what your looking for.
http://jeep.zerok.ru/index.php?page=XJ1984-1991

It has valid information.

== A huge issue with XJ's is Death Wobble and info here would be valuable. ==

Death Wobble is similar to highway shimmy or speed wobble but on a trail it can start at lower speeds as well when you hit a bump just right and can sometimes be reduced or corrected by lightly applying your brakes. It is due to warn suspension components (ie tierod ends, bushings, steering stabalizer and others) or improper adjustments or adjustments not being secured as well as other causes. There is information on this around the internet but i've never found anything very definitive. There are a number of causes for the XJ Death Wobble and a section here on where to start looking for that cause and how to fix it depending on where you find it would be great. If someone wants a little project they could gather up the info and organize it here in one section of causes (double sorted first by easiest things to check and then by most common cause) and a second section of solution where each solution is linked to from the appropriate place in the causes section.
These XJ's are like Harley's in that the owners seldom leave them at stock configurations. Novice mechanics and even 4x4 enthusiasts who are not mechanics at all love to get their hands dirty on these things. Guidance in this area would be appreciated and might save lives of some XJ owners and/or other drivers anywhere near them on the highway. Thanks. I'll be checking back here for info and linking to it from all over the internet once it is here.


(one tip i've never come by on internet but discoverd at my own expen$e is that you can have death wobble to a degree that would be undetectable and not an issue other than it gets triggered by a bent rim. I imagine this could be the case with alignment and wheel bearings as well. When you've replaced about all of your suspension and drained your wallet you might discover this and wish this aricle had existed)</text>

===Turbidity overview===

Turbidity is a measure of brine/water clarity and reflects the suspended matter, disturbance and/or biomass content (and therefore nutrient level) of the brine or water. Turbidity is measured in the field with a secchi disk or turbidity meter, or in the laboratory using a spectrophotometer.

===Method One - Secchi Disk===

[[FIle:secchiISSLR.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A secchi disk|centre]]

A secchi disk may be used in the field to measure the relative turbidity of brine or water. A secchi disk is a circular plate of metal with a diameter of 30-40 cm. The surface is painted in 4 segments, alternating black and white. The secchi disk is suspended from its centre point by a length of rope. It is helpful if the rope has distance indicators marked on it.
     
The secchi disk is lowered into the lake by the rope until the quadrats can no longer be distinguished.  
The distance between the surface of the secchi disk and the surface of the brine is recorded in centimetres.   

====Challenges with this method:====

If the water surface is chopped by wind action, or if the day is very sunny or conversely, overcast, your readings will vary. Ideally choose a calm day for sampling. Also, reflections can be a problem. Methods of reducing the variation caused by weather include sampling on the shady side of the boat, wearing polarised sunglasses or inserting a glass bottomed bucket into the water to view the disk with. Whatever methods you use to reduce variability, use them every time you sample, and record the methods in your sampling plan.

Secchi disk readings do not really correlate to anything else, although several Australian state agencies have developed 'rules of thumb' that convert secchi depths to NTU (nephelomentric turbidity units). It is probably best to leave your secchi readings as secchi depth. If you want NTU's use a method that measures this.


===Method Two - Spectrophotometer===
[[File:nomogram.jpg|right|350px]]
Turbidity as Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) may be measured, and corrected for the contribution of color, using a spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer is prepared by turning it on. The machine may need calibration by zeroing against a blank. The sample cell is rinsed with sample, then filled with sample, carefully wiped with a tissue, and placed in the spectrophotometer. Readings of Absorbance are taken at 425nm and 580nm.

Record the absorbance of the sample at 425nm and 580nm. As color and turbidity affect each other, correct by plotting the readings on the Nomogram Chart below. The chart is derived from AT Palin (1955) &quot;Photometric determination of the colour and turbidity of water.&quot; ''Water &amp; Water Engineering'', 59:341-345.

To plot the turbidity and color onto the nomogram, mark the long scale on the left side of the nomogram with the reading you obtained when you used a wavelength of 425nm. Mark the long scale on the right hand side with the reading you obtained when you used a wavelength of 580nm. Take a ruler and carefully rule a straight line that connects the two readings. Where this line intersects the color scale and the turbidity scale in the centre of the nomogram, the intersections mark the values to record for each parameter.

Record turbidity as NTU's.

Note: The nomogram is dependent on the path length of the spectrophotometer cell. This chart was developed for a 10mm cell path length. Should you have a different cell path length the chart will need adjusting.  


====Challenges with this method:====

The sample may settle prior to return to laboratory. Address this by gently agitating the entire sample bottle prior to filling the sample cell. 

   
===Method Three - Turbidity Meter===

A calibrated turbidity meter that measures the ratio of transmitted to scattered light using a light emitting diode may be used whether in the field or the laboratory.
     
Turn the meter on and immerse the probe fully in the sample. Record the readings. Inherent uncertainties are present in all methods of turbidity measurement. Only report to the closeness specified in the table below (Eaton ''et al'', 1995).

      <comment>/* HIV */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An infectious disease is a disease resulting from the presence of pathogens including  viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and multicellular parasites. These pathogens are able to cause disease in animals and/or plants.

Infectious pathologies are usually contagious diseases due to their potentiality of transmission from one person or specie to another. Diseases can be transmitted in a variety of ways, from drinking contaminated water to sexual contact.

The four diseases you are required to know are relevant because they are the ones of current concern - they are all in epidemic or pandemic status. Due to international travel, diseases can be spread round the entire world very quickly, as in the SARS incident of 2002/2003. Some bacteria are growing resistant to the use of antibiotics, which used to be an effective way of stopping disease spreading.

=Cholera=

As Cholera is a water-borne disease, it occurs where people do not have access to proper sanitation, a clean water supply or uncontaminated food. The bacteria pass through the stomach (if the contents are sufficiently acidic (less than PH4.5) the bacteria is unlikely to survive) and reach the small intestine. Here they multiply and release a toxin know as choleragen, which disrupts the epithelium functions so that salts and water leave the blood. 

This causes severe diarrhoea which leads to dehydration, and can be fatal within 24 hours. Fortunately, treatment for cholera is relatively simple; the disease can be controlled by giving a solution of salts and glucose intravenously to rehydrate the body. There is a vaccine available for some strains of cholera, but it only provides short term protection.

===Strains===

There are more than 60 different strains of the pathogen that causes cholera, and there have been 8 pandemics of cholera, mostly caused by untreated sewage water.

==Features==

=Tuberculosis=

Tuberculosis is an incredibly invasive disease - it starts with a primary infection in the lungs and quickly spreads to the lymph nodes, bones and gut. It often strikes HIV-positive people when their immune system begins to weaken.

It is spread via airborne droplets and unpasteurised milk and is particularly prevalent in overcrowded areas. People suffering malnutrition are more susceptible. Infections have fallen now because of vaccine introduction in the 1950s. However it is estimated that 30% of the world's population is infected with TB without showing any symptoms of the infection; people with this inactive infection do not spread the disease to others.

==Resistance==

Tuberculosis is unfortunately showing a comeback, and this is thought to be due to a variety of factors. 

These include;

*Breakdown in the tuberculosis vaccination and control program
*Poor housing causing overcrowding
*The AIDs epidemic weakening immune systems and allowing it to be more prevalent
*Some strains are now resistant to anti-biotics

The last bullet point, about resistance, is particularly important. When antibiotics attack bacteria, any that are resistant to them survive, and thus multiply and possibly create a new strain of tuberculosis that is antibiotic resistant.

=Malaria=
[[Image:MalariacycleBig.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]

===Infection stages===
Take a look at the diagram on the right, showing the infection cycle of malaria. 
Malaria is caused by a proctoctist known as ''Plasmodium'', which is transmitted by female ''Anopheles'' . When a female mosquito stings a human (to take a blood meal), either of the following event may occur:

1.In case of an infected person, the mosquito obtains both male and female gametes of ''Plasmodium'' along the blood it sucks up. Then, the gametes fuse in the mosquito’s stomach, forming thousands of immature malarial parasites which invade the mosquito’s salivary glands.

2.The other event that could occur is that an already infected mosquito with immature malarial parasites, injects them into a healthy healthy person. The immature malarial parasites then undergo maturation in the person's liver.

Obviously, the 2nd event then returns to the 1st event and eventually results in a transmission cycle.

==Features==

{| align=&quot;center&quot; class=&quot;toccolours&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; border-collapse:collapse; clear: both;&quot;
|+'''Table 3: Features of Malaria'''
|-
!Pathogen
|Plasmodium
|-
!Transmission method

!Incubation 
|1 week - 1 year
|-
!Symptoms
|Fever, nausea, headaches, sweating, spleen enlargement, muscle pain
|-
!Annual incidence/mortality worldwide
|300 million/1.5-3 million
|-
|}

==Control==

There are 3 main ways of controlling the vector, and thus of controlling malaria;

*Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, either by using insect repellent or mosquito nets.
*Reduce the number of mosquitoes, by destroying their breeding grounds, chemically (using a chemical that kills mosquito larvae) or physically (draining the water areas).
*Use drugs to prevent ''Plasmodium'' affecting people
*Draining Swamps which serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes.
*Spreading oil on the ponds or swamps which prevents the larvae or pupa to breath,and eventually die.
===Eradication program===

Preventative drugs have been partially successful in breaking the transmission cycle - these drugs inhibit the parasite spreading in the body, some by inhibiting protein synthesis and some by stopping the sexual reproduction inside the mosquito.

====Failures====

*Many of the drugs used to treat it are now not working because malaria has built up a resistance
*Mosquitoes also became resistant to the insecticides used to treat it.
*The program was unpopular because due care towards indigenous people was not taken (at one point, teams spraying DDT were killed by villagers angry with them).
*When the disease was temporarily eradicated, people who had immunity lost it and when the disease returned (as the program was not successful) they suffered and some died as a result

=Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome=

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDs, is a syndrome caused by the retrovirus Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 

==HIV==
HIV pathogens infect and destroy the T helper cells of the immune system, and without these the immune system does not respond adequately to infection.

When T-Cell numbers are low, the body is particularly vulnerable to infection by anything from the common cold to tuberculosis. Thus, AIDS is not a disease, HIV is the virus that causes AIDs which is a syndrome.
Affects the CD4 receptor cells.

==Features==

|+'''Table 4: Features of HIV/AIDS'''
|-
!Pathogen

!Transmission method
|Exchange of body fluids (sexual intercourse, intravenous needle sharing, blood transfusions)
|-
!Incubation 
|HIV has a few weeks, but AIDs may not develop for up to ten years
|-
!Symptoms
|HIV - fever and then none AIDs - hugely increased susceptibility to disease, such as pneumonia and TB.
|-
!Annual infected/new incidence/mortality worldwide
|33.4 million/6 million/2.5 million
|-
|}

===Treatment===

HIV and subsequently AIDS cannot be cured, but the spread of AIDs can be slowed down with a variety of drugs, providing an increased life expectancy.  This results in a virus that is difficult control, and is thus best prevented. People can be educated to use condoms and other means of reducing the risk of infection during intercourse.

===Statistics===

*5.9 million children are estimated to have been orphaned by AIDs
*25% of Zimbabwe is infected with HIV
*34 million people are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.

===Transmission and testing===

Transmission is spread by intimate human contact and HIV cannot survive outside the body - transmission is only possible by direct bodily fluid exchange, most commonly during sexual intercourse, across the placenta and intravenous needle sharing. Testing is done via a blood test, but this only becomes available several days after the initial infection. This testing is offered to those who think they might have HIV, and they are often asked to contact sexual partners and inform them that they should get tested, as HIV caught early can be slowed down.

====Pregnant women====

HIV positive women in countries like the UK are advised to not breast feed their children, since HIV can be transmitted this way as well since viral particles have been found in breast milk. However, third world countries have many more risks that breast-feeding negates that the risk of HIV is an acceptable one.

=Antibiotics=

Antibiotics are selective toxins, killing or disabling the pathogen without harming the host. Only a few work on viral infections, and are derived from living organisms. Antibiotics are substances produced by the microbes to kill or retard the growth of other harmful microbes.

==How they work==

Antibiotics work against bacteria and viruses in the following ways;

*Synthesis of bacterial walls
*Plasma membrane function
*Protein synthesis
*Enzyme function

===Resistance===

Pathogens can develop resistance to antibiotics, by developing enzymes for destroying penicillin for example. An example of this is MRSA, which is a bacteria that is resistant to four of the most popular antibiotics due to their inappropriate use and people not finishing their course of antibiotics – leaving antibiotic resistant bacteria to grow and spread.

== Lab 3: Transistor circuits (trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror) ==

''Tuesday, April 08, 2008, 13.45 h'' ''(extracted from the lab records made by a solid-state recorder)'' [[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]] 18:56, 29 May 2008 (UTC)


[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_whiteboard2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Creating a simple transistor current source (on the whiteboard).&lt;/center&gt;]]

The idea of this lab is to transform the [[Circuit Idea/Simplest Transistor Current Source|simplest transistor current source]] (that your colleagues from [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Building the simplest transistor current source|group 65b]] made an hour ago) into a ''current mirror'' circuit. You can see what they have discussed on the whiteboard and what they have made on the prototyping PCB. Well, let's first examine and discuss their creation and then try to metamorphose it to the desired circuit.

Look at the circuit on the whiteboard that is left from your colleagues. What do you see there? What is it? What is the idea of this circuit? What does the transistor do there? What is its behavior? What does the potentiometer do? What are these steady resistors? Why have they connected them in series with the varying ones? What does every component do in this circuit?

Well, let's begin reasoning to reveal the secret of this typical transistor circuit...

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== Understanding the transistor ===

We have to begin from somewhere; we need some idea to start the discussion... So, let's first consider the ubiquitous transistor. It is a three-terminal device... How have they connected it here? How do we connect three-terminal elements? They have connected one of its leads to the ground; so, the three-lead transistor is connected as a four-lead device. Also, in order to understand the more complex three-terminal transistor, we can break down it into simpler two-terminal parts. For example, we can first separate the output collector-emitter part as a two-terminal &quot;element&quot; and the input base-emitter part as another two-terminal &quot;element&quot;; then, to begin reasoning what does the transistor do.

==== Varying the input current ====

The simplest way to drive the transistor is by current. For this purpose, we have to connect only a base resistor Rb between the power supply and the transistor's base; for simplicity let's connect the same load resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Rb. Only, as a result, we get a current amplifier (Ic = βIb) instead the desired current mirror (Ic = Ib). How do we equalize the currents?

==== Varying the input voltage ====

We can connect a second resistor (actually, a potentiometer) in parallel to the base-emitter junction to divert the excessive current from the base to the ground. Where can we drive a transistor from? What is the input? The voltage between the base and the emitter drives the transistor. We can recognize in the left part of the circuit the ubiquitiuos potentiometer and a steady resistor connected in series. So, obviously the idea is to drive the transistor by a voltage. What is the mode of the transistor operation (saturated, active or cut off)? There are also measuring devices connected - two voltmeters and a (milli)ammeter.

[[Image:Simplest_trans_current_source_pcb_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Mounting and investigating the transistor cirrent source on a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB).&lt;/center&gt;]]

What can we do with this circuit? We can vary its attributes one after another and observe its reaction to our intervention. Let's begin varying the input voltage. What happens, if we move the P's slider downwards to the end position? What is the input voltage then? ''Zero''.  Yes, there is no any input voltage. The output collector-emitter part of the transistor is in cut-off condition. The resistance between the collector and the emitter is infinite; no current flows in the output circuit. So, you can think of a transistor just as a varying resistor that has infinite resistance at these conditions (zero input voltage). Why the voltmeter V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; shows maximum voltage (equal to the supply voltage)? It is not so simple to explain why... Well, we have already discussed this phenomenon. We have a resistor whose upper end is connected to the positive rail of the power supply. What is the potential (the voltage regarding to the ground) of its lower end?

One possible viewpoint is to think of this circuit as a voltage divider with R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∞ (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; so, K ≈ 1. Another viewpoint is to see that the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not resist since there is nothing to resist (no current flows). Actually, there is no transistor connected in the circuit; we may erase it from the whiteboard...

===== The transistor is just a varying resistor =====

Now begin moving the potentiometer's slider up. At given moment the output voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; begins lower; stop when it becomes somewhere between the supply rails (0 - 10 V), for instance in the middle (5 V). What is the mode of the transistor (saturated, active or cut off)? It is a &quot;semi-opened&quot;; so, it is in ''active'' mode. How does the transistor do this magic? Does it do something special? No, the transistor does not do anything supernatural in this region, it does the same what a tube, an FET, a rheostat, etc. would do, if they were at its place - ''it just changes its present resistance''. So, the transistor is a varying resistor; only, it is an electrically controlled resistor. Well, if we have set a total load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kΩ and V&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = 5 V, what has the transistor done? It has set its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 kΩ as well. It is just the same resistor as the collector one. Think of this circuit as a voltage divider with two identical resistors; its transfer ratio is K = 0.5. This is the notion about a transistor that we need to understand how transistor circuits operate. All the active elements do the same; they are electrically controlled resistors. So, all the transitor circuits contain both ordinary resistors and electrically controlled resistors (active elements). They form the well-known voltage divider where transistors are put on the place of R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the both.

If you continue moving up the slider, you will probably reach the saturation where V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∞ 0 V and the transistor is opened totally. What is the current now? It has a maximum value according to Ohm's law: I = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Varying the load resistance ====

[[Image:Trans_output_va_2_65b_lab3.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Transistor acting as a current-stable resistor (both RL and RT vary).&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Trans_current-stable_resistor_demo_68b_lab3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Demonstrating how a BJT acts as a current-stable resistor (by [[User:Lkirilova|Lora]]).&lt;/center&gt;]]

How have we arrived at a conclusion that the output part of the transistor behaves as a constant current source? We have somehow to check this specualation. For this purpose, we have to provoke the circuit and to see how it will react to our intervention. Well, what will we see, if we vary the load resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;? The output transistor characteristic can give us the answer. Do you remember the subjest of semiconductor devices? These characteristics are favorite for them. Only, they do not show how to use these transistor behavior. ''A student: the characteristic is horizontal; so, the current will not change, if the load varies''. Yes, it is right. But what does the transistor do, what is its behavior to obtain such a characteristic?

Does the current change, if we vary the load resistance? ''A stident: Yes, it does...'' But how do you explain it? Because the answer is exactly opposite - the current does not vary... Obviously, there are things that contradict our intuition and this is one of them... Well, look at the picture on the right (from [[Circuit Idea/Group 68b|Group 68b]]); it shows graphically how the transistor does this magic. Two IV characteristics are superimposed on a common coordinate system. The first curve is an IV characteristic of a real voltage source having a voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; and an internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (they name it &quot;load line&quot;). The slope of this curve depends on R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. If R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, it is a vertical line; if R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0 it inclines proportionally to the resistance. The second curve represents the present output transistor resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; or shortly, R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;).

The transistor does the following trick: if we try to decrease/increase the load resistance (to set upright the load line), it does the opposite - increases/decreases its present resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; or shortly, R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) so that the crossing  (operating) point moves along the almost horizontal output characteristic of the transistor. As a result, the current stays almost constant. You can see how simple is the idea of this dynamic constant current source. It consists only of two elements: a voltage source and a dynamic resistor connected in series with the resistive load. The resistance of the dynamic resistor supplements the load resistance to a constant value (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = const); so, the current is constant - I = V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;). Shortly, the dynamic resistor keeps up a constant total sum of the resistances.

A conclusion: ''If you connect in series a transistor and a resistor and begin varying the resistance of the resistor, the transistor will also begin changing its present resistance so that the sum of resistances to stay constant; as a result, the current stays constant. The transistor acts as a dynamic resistor that varies, as a '''current-stable resistor''' (an element that has the property to keep up a constant current)''.

And what about the voltage drop across the resistor? Does it vary? Move the slider and look at V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If we lower R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load lowers as well. But the transistor increases its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it increases as well. And vice versa; if we increase R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; across the load increases as well. Now, the transistor lowers its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it lowers as well.

''A conclusion: If we vary the load resistance, the current stays constant but the voltages vary in wide limits.''

However, at given moment the transistor depletes its reserve of resistance; it saturates and the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across it becomes zero. The magic of dynamization ceases and if you continue changing the load resistance, the current will change according to Ohm's law.

==== Varying the supply voltage ====

Besides the load resistance, we can vary the supply voltage as well. Look at the picture on the whiteboard again and answer the question, &quot;Will the current stay constant, if we vary the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot; Well, try it on the lab set up. As we can see, the current varies. Why? What is the problem?

When we vary the supply voltage, the transistor would react to this new &quot;intervention&quot; as before: if we incrase V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;, it would increase its present resistance R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and v.v. The transistor would keep up a constant ratio V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;/(R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). But still the current varies... What is the reason?'' A student: The input voltage varies.'' Yes, this is the reason... The tragedy of this circuit is that they have supplied the input voltage divider by the same power supply. But we have not another power supply. What do we do then so that the current to stay constant when we vary the common supply voltage?

''A student: ...to add another transistor...'' I don't know, tell where you will place this additional transistor. You have to have some idea to place it. What does a tranistor stabilize? Do all colleagues understand that a transistor stabilizes current? A transistor is a current stabilizer while a diode is a voltage stabilizer. The characteristic of such a voltage-stable element is a vertical line. All the voltage-stable elements (diodes, zeners, LEDs, etc.) have such a characteristic; they behave as a voltage source.

=== A true diode sets the input current ===

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student1_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Trying to add a true diode in the current-setting part...&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_diode_student2_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Adding correctly a true diode in the current-setting part.&lt;/center&gt;]]

''Another student:...to place a diode...'' Yes, this is the right answer, to place a diode but now you have to say where. Please, write it on the whiteboard; here are whiteboard markers. Do not are confused that it looks not so pretty because we &quot;invent&quot; the circuit scribbling on the whiteboard. The other alternative is to show &quot;cut-and-dried&quot; pretty circuits on slides or ''Power point'' presentations...

Well, your colleague begins drawing a diode; is she drawing it in the right direction? By the way, I know there is diodes that are usually connected in a reverse direction. What are they? ''Students: ...zener diodes...'' Right but let's use an ordinary diode. Only, let's connect it correctly... Is the circuit written correctly?

''Another student: Let's erase the potentiometer...'' Go and draw what you mean. Maybe, it is better not to remove the potentiometer; instead, draw it higher up and connect it properly, as a rheostat (do not forget to connect the slider). Leave it as an element that allows us to regulate the input current. It is time to make some shots. This room is not so suitable to make photos as a Hollywood studio but your colleagues do something great; so, they deserve to be perpetuated:) 

Don't you think it's time to discover the web for similar solutions? For this purpose, write [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGIH,GGIH:2006-52,GGIH:en&amp;q=%22current+mirror%22 &quot;current mirror&quot;] in the Google window. As usual, the corresponding [[w:Current mirror|Wikipedia page]] (too formal and boring) stays at the first position.

Let's then see Tony Kuphald's page about [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_4/12.html current mirrors]. In the beginning, he reasoning about Ebers-Moll diode equation. We can see the load and the transistor and now we exclaim with surprise - here is the same diode! Tony Kuphaldt has proposed what our colleagues has propsed as well - to improve the circuit by connecting a forward biased diode in parallel to the base-emitter junction. Then, the author begin telling what the profit is in connecting an ordinary diode.

Let's scrutinize the Tony Kuphaldt's circuit since I have the following idea. As he is a very good teacher and an excellent web writer, I intend to write an email to him where to describe our Wikibooks &quot;open student project&quot;. More concretely, I will tell him how you and I, all together, have arrived at his idea; then, we have checked it and have found out that it is right (or not). That is why is so important to judge his circuit.

Tony claims that the output current flowing through the load is equal to the input current flowing through the diode: ''&quot;Current through resistor Rload is therefore a function of current set by the bias resistor, the two being nearly equal.&quot;'' But is it true? Let's try it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

=== A base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot; sets the input current ===

Who can solder? Choose a diode, solder it on the prototyping PCB and measure the currents. As I can remember, your colleague has told that a transistor consists of two diodes. Here we need a diode whoose IV curve is identical to the IV curve of the transistor driving the load. What an idea can arise then? Imagine we have not an ordinary diode; we have only transistors...

==== Replacing the true diode with a base-emitter transistor junction ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_student3_66b.jpg|left|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;Setting the input current by a base-emitter transistor &quot;diode&quot;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_pcb_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;The circuit mounted on the PCB.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Can we use the transistor as a diode? Yes, we can. In this case we can connect the base-emitter junction of an identical transistor (leaving the collector no connected) as a diode. ''A student: Yes, this was the lower circuit of Tony Kuphaldt...''

They frequently use this &quot;trick&quot;... Even the transistor can be &quot;semi-damaged&quot;; we can use only one of its junctions (in this case wee nedd exactly the base-emitter junction). Who will draw the new circuit? Let's the colleague to draw it. Leave the collector non-connected. Try to draw the circuit more symmetrically and turn it with the base to the other base; thus we will arrive easier to the great current mirror circuit. Finally, draw where currents flow by green current loops.

Then look for another but the same transistor and solder it.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

==== A problem appears ====

[[Image:Current_mirror_trans_diode_whiteboard_66b.jpg|right|thumb|380px|&lt;center&gt;But there is something wrong in this solution...&lt;/center&gt;]]

Only, a problem appears - the output transistor is saturated! So, let's begin discovering why...

We can find out the current-setting diode diverts only &quot;one&quot; base current Ib = V/2Rbias and the corresponding collector current of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is β/2 times bigger - Ic = I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = β.V/2Rbias.

We can conclude that the &quot;diode&quot; current mirror acts as a current amplifier (I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;) but not as a true current mirror (I&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;)! So, we should notify Tony Kuphaldt about our find and invite him to join our discussion, in order to defend his speculation:)


Well, this was a copy of [[Circuit Idea/Group 65b#Lab 3: Trying to create a &quot;diode&quot; current mirror|Group 65b's work]]. Let's continue their work by improving the &quot;diode&quot; current mirror.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Exact data representation ===

It is important to realize that '''pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Pack|Pack]] must not be used to specify the exact representation of a data type''', but to help the compiler to improve the efficiency of the generated code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler is free to ignore the pragma, therefore if a specific representation of a type is required, [[Ada Programming/Representation clauses|representation clauses]] should be used instead (record representation clauses, and/or attributes [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Size|'Size]] or [[Ada Programming/Attributes/'Component_Size|'Component_Size]]).

=== Bit-wise operations ===

Although in Ada 83 packed boolean arrays were used for bit-wise operations,&lt;ref&gt;Software Productivity Consortium (October 1995). ''Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide'', &quot;{{Ada/SG3|10|5|7|Packed Boolean Array Shifts}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; since Ada 95 [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] are more adequate for these operations.&lt;ref&gt;Software Productivity Consortium (October 1995). ''Ada 95 Quality and Style Guide'', &quot;{{Ada/SG3|10|6|3|Bit Operations on Modular Types}}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The argument may be weighed against the advantages of named Boolean array indexes such as &lt;tt&gt;Traffic_Lights{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}Red {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} True{{Ada/delimiter|,}} {{Ada/keyword|others}} {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} False{{Ada/delimiter|)}}&lt;/tt&gt;, depending on use case.&lt;noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It '''is almost always incorrect to use [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic|atomic]] or [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile|volatile]] variables for [[Ada Programming/Tasking|tasking]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Volatile: Almost Useless for Multi-Threaded Programming
|author = Arch Robison
|date = 2007-11-30

|url = http://softwareblogs.intel.com/2007/11/30/volatile-almost-useless-for-multi-threaded-programming/
|accessdate = 2008-05-30
|quote = There is a widespread notion that the keyword volatile is good for multi-threaded programming (...) volatile is almost useless for multi-threaded programming.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an object is atomic it just means that it will be read from or written to memory atomically. The compiler ''will not'' generate atomic instructions or memory barriers when accessing to that object, it will just:
* check that the architecture guarantees atomic memory loads and stores, 
* disallow some compiler optimizations, like reordering or suppressing redundant accesses to the object.

For example, the following code, where &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; is an atomic object can be misunderstood:

 A := A + 1;  {{Ada/--|Not an atomic increment!}}

The compiler '''will not''' (and is not allowed by the Standard to) generate an atomic increment instruction to directly increment and update from memory the variable &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|title = Volatile
|author = Ian Lance Taylor
|date = 2008-03-05
|url = http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/154
|accessdate = 2008-05-28
|quote = Using [the C/C++ qualifier] volatile does not mean that the variable is accessed atomically; no locks are used. Using volatile does not mean that other cores in a multi-core system will see the memory accesses; no cache flushes are used. (...) Using volatile does not imply any sort of memory barrier; the processor can and will rearrange volatile memory accesses. (...) You should not use more than one such variable to communicate between any pair of threads, as there is no guarantee that the different threads will see the accesses in the same order.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the code generated by the compiler:

   A := A + 1;
 804969f:	a1 04 95 05 08       	mov    0x8059504,%eax
 80496a4:	40                   	inc    %eax
 80496a5:	a3 04 95 05 08       	mov    %eax,0x8059504

As can be seen, no atomic increment instruction or test-and-set opcode will be generated. Like in other programming languages, if these specific instructions are required in the program they must be written explicitly using machine code insertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = Laurent Guerby 
|title = Ada 95 Rationale

|year = 1995
|chapter = {{Ada/95/R2|C|5|Shared Variable Control|part=3}}
|publisher = Intermetrics
|accessdate = 2008-05-28
|quote = A need to access specific machine instructions arises sometimes (...). Examples include instructions that perform compound operations atomically on shared memory, such as test-and-set and compare-and-swap (...)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above code snippet is equivalent to the following code (both code sequences generates exactly the same object code), where &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; is a (non-atomic) temporary variable:

 T := A;      {{Ada/--|A is copied atomically to local variable T}}
 T := T + 1;  {{Ada/--|local variable T is incremented}}
 A := T;      {{Ada/--|A is stored atomically}}

Thus it is incorrect to modify an atomic variable at the same time from multiple tasks. For example, two tasks incrementing a counter in parallel. Even in an uniprocessor, other Ada tasking features like a protected object should be used instead. In multiprocessors, depending on the [[w:Memory model (programming)|memory consistency model]], using various atomic or volatile variables for task communication can have surprising consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== PDF version ==

This is a good book on chess stratergy. I appreciate your sincere efforts in getting all of these organized. However, the lack of the PDF verison of the book is many times difficult for me. Here, we don't have much Wi-Fi availability. I tried to collect some pages using the collection tool but, it turned out that due to proper print-friendly versions, the texts as well as the images appear garbled.

I have made some efforts on building a PDF version and I'm interested in sharing it. Please let me know about your opinions.

== FEN position says white's move text says black's ==

The FEN position says it is white's move but the text says that the board position is after white's 12th move.  If I have time I will look up the game and figure out which is correct.  I suspect the FEN is wrong...</text>

== Keres--Fine ==

It appears that '''21. d5''' is not as good move as presented in this book, because black can respond with '''21. ... e5''', and then proceed to blockade white's d-pawn. In this case white still has a slight advantage and can try to put a knight at a strong point and reroute the bishop to the kingside maybe (relieving the black's b-pawn blockade, though), but it's not winning white right away. So black's '''21. .. exd5''' should be considered a blunder, and not in any way a forced move or the best move.

==The Five Schools==
Having only ''4'' subchapters here looks strange, perhaps someone could add some information on the last school.

== Notation of Hammie--Silman, San Francisco 1975 ==

I could be wrong, but it seems to me that there might be numerous errors in the notation for the Hammie--Silman game in the &quot;Weak Pawns&quot; section.  I have tried to copy and plug the notation into an analysis program and get numerous errors regarding several moves after '''22.b3 Rb4'''.  I have attempted to find notation for this game in other places, but have been unsuccessful.  Can someone please check the accuracy of this notation?

:No, we use a markup language specific to MediaWiki. You can see the help files at [[m:Help:Editing|Meta]]. The content would need to be [[WB:WIW|suitable]] for Wikibooks too - I can't tell from your description whether that's the case. Perhaps a more detailed description should come before worrying about the technical challenge of getting the content on Wikibooks. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:30, 9 May 2008 (UTC)

== Autoconfirmed user and Modern Greek ==

I am a newcomer to wikibooks. I am interested in studying Modern Greek and other languages. 
I started my lessons and got blocked when I tried to listen to the pronunciation of Greek phrases. By clicking the 
&lt;listen&gt; button I do not seem to get anywhere. In the first attempts I got a message that 
I should be and Autoconfirmed user to be able to make downloads and play the sound file.

I tried to find out how I could become an Autoconfirmed user... By reading a comment somewhere I
got the impression that I should wait for 4 days and all doors would be opened. To no avail.

Now, when I click the &lt;listen&gt; button I am referred to a page that relates to uploading files.

Can someone help me on this, please?

:No, you don't need autoconfirmed to listen to media. You should be able to press the play button and listed to the file without downloading it. I'm not sure why you're being redirected like that - a link to the page would be helpful.

== Unauthorised merge ==

See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Modern_Greek#merging : a user who developed the initial (very raw) version of the book several years ago has suddenly come back and &quot;merged&quot; the ongoing lesson re-write effort as well as some unrelated alphabet lessons into his old pages, resulting in chaos. The other currently active contributor and I are against this merge and would like to keep restructuring the book to comply with current international standards in language teaching. What should we do?  [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 19:25, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

: I would say that the user was [[WB:BOLD|being bold]], but what the user did was not agreed with. I suggestion discussion, as seems to be already taking place, and try to reach a [[Wikibooks:Decision making|compromise that you all can agree with]]. If the user appears to be unwilling to compromise, let us know again and someone may try to step in as a neutral third party to mediate the situation. In the meantime avoid undoing what the user has done and try to [[WB:FAITH|assume good faith]] and keep a cool head. With the user being the initial developer, I think it can be important or can help to try to understand what their intentions for the book are/were. However the fact the user was the initial developer should not be seen as carrying any greater weight in deciding what to do next or taken as final. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:46, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

:Darklama is right, when you have multiple authors on a single book you must discuss changes and seek consensus on important issues. The best thing you can do right now is to start a discussion about the issue. You can talk on the user's talk page, or on the book's talk page, but make sure you invite all interested people to join in. If the changes made are not agreed upon and are highly deleterious, you should revert them until consensus is reached. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:48, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

== New (professional) Book ==

I am a heart surgeon.
My hospital has gone though quite an extensive process to generate &quot;evidence based&quot; guidelines for our junior staff.
To date two other hospitals have taken &quot;copies&quot; to use

My vision ... a wikibook.  Because I want to encourage users to update / suggest content etc.  However for quality reasons I absolutely must  restrict visitors to suggestions, that my editorial team then accept / ditch.

If we begin to post our book, will we have the necessary editorial control ?  If not may I suggest that such a feature would open up the wiki concept to many other professional groups.
:No you'll not get editorial control, wiki's can be edited by anyone. Sounds like you want your own website to put your information. Most likely your own hospital has a website, perhaps you use that? [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 11:58, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, SunCreator is right. There really isn't any way to maintain strict editorial control here. Besides being technically infeasible, it's against our policy. However, I do want to take the time to assure you that the decentralized wiki model can be used to develop high-quality materials despite the lack of editorial control. I know it's a little bit of a leap of faith, and I know that many people are hesitant to make the jump. 
:One thing worth noting is that wikibooks isn't exclusive, books that you write here can be copied and used in other places as well. You can use wikibooks to create the raw material, and then copy it to your personal computer for editing and then publishing and distribution. 
:As a final note, I want to point out that authors tend to stick to their own projects, and you are likely to be the primary, if not the only, author for your book for a good portion of it's development. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:49, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

== Hard to find help pages ==

At present it is difficult for newcomers to find the Editing Wikitext series of pages.

Starting from the home page of WikiBooks they need to find their way to ''Special Groups'' then ''How-to Guides'' then ''WikiBooks Help'' then ''Editing Wikitext'', to get there.

How improbable is that?

We should be making this and similar pages ''easier'' to find if the intention is to encourage new writers.

Any comments from admin?   [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 15:21, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:I think we should consider making space on the main page for these textbooks about Wikibooks (etc.) as well as placing links on the various &quot;getting started&quot; and FAQ pages. I will perhaps do that shortly (or you can do so!) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:28, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
: Its difficult for people to find anything really, as has been discussed before. This lead to discussion to discontinue the bookshelves and was agreed to eventually phase them out in favor of Subject pages. As Wikibooks moves away from bookshelves this issue should resolve itself. For instance [[Subject:Help]] is a top-level subject area which contains Editing Wikitext along with other help books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:33, 31 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

Here I would like to explain why I felt there was a need for a new book about C++ optimization.

I have read many books, articles, and blogs about C++ optimization, but most had one or more of the following shortcomings:
* Too unhelpful. Many advices were like &quot;avoid this feature&quot;, without specifying exactly when such a feature was avoidable, and, mainly, without specifying what could replace such a feature.
* Too low level. Many advices were actually advices for a compiler writer, as they delved into compiler optimization technology, that are of little interest to a typical C++ programmer.
* Too high level. Many advices were about computational complexity, just classifying algorithms according their asymptotic time, with big-O notation.
* Too compiler dependent. Many advices were compiler specific.
* Too operating system dependent. Many advices were operating system specific.
* Too hardware dependent. Many advices were hardware specific.
* Too little distinction between design-time and optimization-time. Few advices specified if they were to applied when the application was designed and coded, or at a specific optimization stage.

--[[User:Carlo.milanesi|Carlo.milanesi]] ([[User talk:Carlo.milanesi|talk]]) 19:34, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

How can an book be too low level and too high level at the same time?

I think the OP's point is that all other books suffer from at least one of those problems, but not necessarily all of them at once. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 22:13, 19 September 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Basics==

Because the rules constrain only rows, columns, and regions, the different plays tend to fit nicely in rows, columns and regions.

===Necessitation===

Some moves are just required.  I bet you can guess how to complete this region:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 2
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 1
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 9
|-
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 8
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 3
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center; background-color: rgba(100,255,100,0.15)&quot; | 
|-
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 6
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 5
| style=&quot;width: 2.125em; height: 2.625em; text-align: center&quot; | 4
|}

Likewise with rows and columms:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse; border: solid thin black;&quot;

===Implication===

Implication is the first ''generative'' move.  That is to say, it requires that you generate an in-between state. You can roughly think of generative moves as following a series of component-moves such that the first (and possibly successive) one requires any of a set of outcomes, but cannot specify those outcomes, while the last move takes these into account and thereby produces a specific outcome.

So, even without being able to pin down a number, if you can place it at a row or column within a region, this can place a number elsewhere:

This move reads something like a recipe.
* Looking at 5 in context of the ABC row
# Region A's 3 and 8 require those numbers for the row to be in B or C
# the row in region B is full
# therefore there is a 3-8 pair in C
# '''so the row's 5 is in A'''
# '''D5 blocks the left column'''
# And we can pin 5 to the right column in G because:
## F5 locks the 5 to the bottom row in I
## so the entire bottom row is blocked for 5
## Leaving only right column spaces for 5 in G
# '''therefore G5 blocks the right column'''
# so A5 is in ''viii''

==Moves==

Outside of easy puzzles, most puzzles cannot be solved without more advanced techniques.  However, between any two of these moves, one should generally ensure that all the basic moves have satisified any uncertainties (as they are the easiest to perform, and commonly as you solve a puzzle, each solution changes the puzzle).



===The Pidgeonhole Principle===

I'm naming this after the [[w:Pigeonhole_principle|Pigeonhole principle]] because it is a nice, near approximate and I dont know any particular name for the technique. It is perhaps a bit different than you might expect: The technique counts each possible position for each number in a region. If a particular cel in the region is left with only one number, then that number must be in that cel.

The basics do not clear any spaces. So now, to apply the pidgeonhole principle, we now mark ''possible'' moves in each region. For this example, we will use region C.

Start at 1 and work up to 9. Any number that is in the region obviously won't get any marks.

Here is a detail of the process, how to find the cels to mark for the 2s of region C:

''* Since we are looking for a square that only has one mark in it, we stop marking the square once it has two. This is only for convenience. It is also convenient to mark these on a scratch grid you draw on the side, if you are working on paper (although it can be done in your head).''

Now we have taken into account all possible moves in all cels in region C.  If we have only one mark in a given cel, there is only one possibility in that cel, and thus a solution is found.  Therefore, the number at ''vii'' is a solution via the pidgeonhole principle:

===Naked Subsets===

Looking across the board at each row and column, scan for clusters of N cels that allow only N rows or columns.  (Thus, in a row or column, any three cels that can only have any of 3 numbers, or fours cels and 4 numbers, etc.)

We will examin the board's middle row and mark cels through exclusion in much the same way as in the pidgeonhole principle:

Here 7,8,9 sit alone in 3 squares.  There are amung the 3 squares only 3 options, and those numbers must fill one of the select squares. The other squares in the row, therefore, cannot contain those numbers.  So we can eliminate those options.  In this case, that even gives us '''D3''':

Even if you don't win a square directly with this method, it is often still useful in the restrictions it places on remaining board possibilities.

''* As an aside, it is much easier to see these when you do not need to use them, because the same effect cak be achieved through other means, than when you do.''

===Hidden Subsets===

Hidden subsets can be thought of as related to naked subsets by their mechanism of exclusion. They are also the Row/Column version of the pidgeonhole principle. Unlike with the naked subsets, you're less likely to gestalt these coincidentally while playing, which makes it especially worthwhile to review.  The following example is derrived from [http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/sudoku/explain.htm Sudoku Assistant - Solving Techniques]

You can see that the only place in the row that 7 and 3 appear are the two highlighted cels. Therefore, those two cels must contain those two numbers.  That's two numbers for two cels, therefore we can remove any '''other''' numbers from those cels.

We will continue working with this puzzle from this point in the next section.

If you consider instead starting in region A (which sets region C), this progresses like the Snake game, setting possibilities along the way — just go from Ai to Ci to Fv.  Contingent Exclusion works on the basis of ''chains'' of pairs, triplets, etc, which lead along in a path to a contradiction.  This contradiction will require that the origin point must be a different option.

The left column has a 1,7-pair, the middle column has a 1,3,7-triplet.  The B region can only have a 7 at ''vii'' or at ''iii'', because E7 must be in the middle column. The bottom of the column pairs is also a 1,7-pair, since I7 is already played.

If we start at A and set the pair value there to 7, then G is 1.  If G is 1, then H is 7. But if H is 7, then Bvii is 3. That sets Biii to 7 and we reach a contradiction:

      <text xml:space="preserve">ممکن است پرسشهای از این دست برای هر کس که مایل به بهبود رتبه سایت اینترنتی خود در موتورهای جستجو باشد پیش بیاید.

آیا موتورهای جستجو نقطه ضعفی هم دارند ؟ اشکال و ایراد آنها چیست ؟
کدام موتور جستجو بهتر است ؟


اکنون به یکایک پرسشها پاسخ می دهیم

آیا نوع فونت نیز در نتیجه جستجو تاثیر دارد ؟ اندازه – یا نوع خط چه تاثیری دارد ؟

بطور کلی نه . مگر آنکه از فونتهای تزیینی(همچون Webding) یا فونتهای بسیار ناشناخته استفاده کنید برای مخفی کردن کلمات. آنچه اهمیت دارد اندازه و حالت فونت است. مثلا تغییر رنگ یا خوابیده(Italic) یا سیاه کردن (Bold) نوشته ها.

آیا تکنولوژی استفاده شده در رتبه بندی اثر دارد ؟ یعنی آیا مهم است که ما صفحه های خود را با PHP یا ASP یا چیز دیگری کار کرده باشیم ؟

در حالت کلی پاسخ منفی است. هیچ ارتباط معنی داری میان تکنولوژی استفاده شده در سمت سرور با موقعیت سایت در موتور جستجو نمی توان یافت. اما بسیاری از برنامه نویسان وب برای خود تکنیکهایی دارند که تحت تاثیر تکنولوژی مورد استفاده قرار دارد. مثلا در محیط ویژوال استودیو دات نت امکانات بی شماری وجود دارد که کاربر را از پرداختن به جزییات بی نیاز می کند و این جزییات همان نکات مهم برای جستجو گر ممکن است باشد. برای رسیدن به یک پاسخ قطعی شما باید متن خروجی HTML سایت خود را مورد تحلیل و بررسی قرار دهید. زیرا صرف نظر از اینکه سایت شما با چه تکنیکی پیاده سازی شده باشد خروجی به زبان HTML و گاهی نیز کدهای Java Script خواهد بود.

آیا نوع نرم افزار سرور (لینوکس یا ویندوز یا غیره) تاثیری بر موقعیت سایت دارد ؟

هم بله و هم خیر !! پاسخ درست مانند سوال قبل است. اگر چه نمیتوان ارتباط معنی داری را مطرح کرد اما تکنولوژی سمت سرور گاهی برنامه نویس را مجبور (یا تشویق) به استفاده از تکنیکهایی می کند که روی رتبه بندی سایت اثر می گذارد.

در واقع پاسخ به این پرسش نمیتواند با یک کلمه باشد. درواقع برای موتور جستجو تنها خروجی صفحه های شما اهمیت دارد. اما اینکه شما از چه سروری استفاده می کنید نشان دهنده نوع تکنولوژی صفحات فعال (پویا Dynamics) شما است. اگر از یک سرور لینوکس استفاده کنید صفحات شما احتمالا با فن آوری PHP طراحی شده اند و بانک اطلاعاتی شما نیز My SQL میتواند باشد. اما اگر از یک سرور ویندوز استفاده کنید احتمالا صفحات شما ASP یا ASP.net هستند و بانک اطلاعاتی شما نیز میتواند SQL Server باشد. البته نوع بانک اطلاعاتی برای موتور جستجو اهمیتی ندارد، اما نکته اینجاست که بسیاری از تکنیکهای طراحی صفحه تحت تاثیر تکنولوژی مورد استفاده سرور قرار دارند.

برای مثال اگر شما از VS.net برای تولید صفحات فعال استفاده کنید کنترل دقیقی بر اسکریپتهای تولید شده در سمت Client نخواهید داشت. البته نه برای شما و نه برای بازدید کنندگان سایت شما اهمیتی ندارد، اما ممکن است برای موتور جستجو اهمیت داشته باشد. به ویژه زمانی که شما صفحاتی با اسکریپتهای فعال (Active Scripts) دارید و یا از فن آوری Ajax بهره میگیرید مساله جزییات طرح صفحه مهم میشود. همچنین زمانی که شما اطلاعاتی را از بانک اطلاعاتی خوانده و بر صفحه وب نقش می کنید ، نحوه لیست کردن و فراخواندن این اطلاعات دارای اهمیت حیاتی در رتبه بندی موتور جستجو خواهد بود.

یک شرکت خوب در زمینه SEO چه ویژگیهایی باید داشته باشد ؟

خیلی ویژگیها ! نخستین ویژگی مهم آن است که مکانیزمها و راهکارهایی را که اجرا خواهند کرد روشن و واضح برای شما توضیح دهد. نه این که ادعا کنند ما راهکارها و تکنیکهای محرمانه و مخصوص داریم. اگر چنین حرفی شنیدید بدانید حقیقت ندارد. البته طبیعی است که برخی فنون کار مخصوص خودشان و محرمانه باشد ولی این نه به معنای پنهان کاری و ادعای روشهای جادویی است.

دوم آنکه صداقت و پاسخگویی داشته باشند. یعنی ادعای کاری را که نمیتوانند انجام دهند نداشته باشند. این حق شماست که بدانید پول شما صرف چه چیزی می شود. ویرایش و بازسازی صفحات شما ، تجدید ساختار صفحه و سایت ، معرفی به موتورها و ... برخی از خدمات اولیه ای هستند که یک SEO ارایه خواهد کرد. پس نخست پکیج ها یا گزینه هایی را برای بهبود رتبه از شرکت بخواهید. شرکتهای تک محصول تنها محصول آنها ، وعده رسیدن به صفحه اول نتایج جستجو است ، چندان قابل اطمینان نیستند.

P4P یعنی چه ؟

P4P کوتاه شده عبارت Pay-For-Placement می باشد. یعنی اینکه شما به موتور جستجو پول می دهید و موتور جستجو سایت شما را در نتایج بالاتر لیست می کند.البته فقط نتایج جستجوهایی که به زمینه کار شما مربوط باشد. معمولا اینگونه است که در ازای پرداخت مبالغ مشخص چند کلمه فروخته می شود و هرگاه کاربری عبارتی نزدیک به آن کلمات را جستجو کند سایت شما به عنوان پشتیبان مالی (sponsored) در صفحه نخست بصورت جداگانه لیست میشود.

دقت کنید ! برخی موتورهای جستجو همچون گوگل لینکهایی که با این روش ارتقا یافته اند را جداگانه لیست میکنند ولی برخی موتورها همچون یاهو پس از نتایج پولی، اقدام به لیست کردن نتایج طبیعی و پولی بصورت درهم می کنند. یعنی نتایج فهرست نتیجه جستجو، هم شامل سایتهای پرداخت کننده و هم سایتهایی که بصورت طبیعی بالاتر هستند.

هدف ما نیز رسیدن به جایگاه سایتهای پرداخت کننده ولی بصورت طبیعی(Organic) است.

کدام موتور جستجو بهتر است ؟

پاسخ : برای خودتان یا کاربران مخاطب شما ؟؟؟
اگر خود شمااینترنت را بدنبال یافتن مطالب مورد نظر خود جستجو می کنید دلیلی مدارد که مخاطبان شما نیز مثل شما فکر کنند و همان رفتار شما را در جستجو داشته باشند. پس خود را بجای گروه مخاطب خود بگذارید و سعی کنید بفهمید چه کلمه ها و کلیدواژه هایی برای آنها مهم است.

اما از میان سه جستجوگر برتر اینترنت که تقریبا 90% جستجو های اینترنت را در اختیار دارند هریک دارای ویژگیهایی است که نمیتوان بسادگی یکی را برتر نامید.

سایتهای گوگل(Google) ، یاهو (Yahoo) و MSN (متعلق به شرکت مایکرو سافت) هرکدام برای اهداف خاصی مناسب تر هستند. ولی شباهت الگوریتم ها در سطوح مقدماتی و اولیه بهبود ، باعث میشود که اگر شما سایت خود را بهبود دهید ، نتیجه آن را در هر سه جستجو گر مشاهده نمایید.

آیا برای بهینه سازی سایت حتما بایستی متخصص طراحی و پیاده سازی سایت باشم ؟

بستگی دارد به هدف شما. اگر تنها برای سرگرمی یا کارهای علمی سایتی را راه اندازی کرده اید خوب است یاد بگیرید آن را به گونه ای طراحي کنید که موقعیت مطلوب در موتورهای جستجو داشته باشد. اما اگر اهداف تجاری دارید و یا مایل هستید که در یک فضای رقابتی قرار بگیرید توصیه می شود از یک متخصص کمک بگیرید.

آیا بهینه سازی تنها برای سایت ها است و یا شامل وبلاگها هم میشود ؟

به طور کلی هر نوع سایت یا وبلاگ و یا صفحه اینترنتی را میتوان با توجه به نکات SEO و استاندارد سازی متن ها بهبود بخشید. و از این جهت محدودیتی وجود ندارد. اما بطور کلی سایتهای مستقل (نه استفاده از سرورهای مجانی) بهتر میتوانند رشد کنند.

آیا بدست آوردن جایگاه خوب در جستجو گر ها به شانس و اقبال هم بستگی دارد ؟

در واقع بله. عوامل موثر بر موقعیت یک سایت چنان متنوع هستند که اگر تصادفا جایی اشتباه کنید ممکن است موقعیت شما افت کند. اما این موضوع بیش از آنکه تصادفی باشد تابع قوانین پیچیده ای است که هر چه بیشتر شناخته شوند از شانسی بودن آن کاسته می شود.

آیا موتورهای جستجو نقطه ضعفی هم دارند ؟ اشکال و ایراد آنها چیست ؟

شعار گوگل این است: ساماندهی اطلاعات جهان!! خوب این یعنی گستردگی تا بی انتها. اصلی ترین نقطه ضعف موتورهای جستجو این است که هوش آنها که بهره گرفته از هوش مصنوعی است گاه دچار خطا می شود. نمیتوان از یک روبات انتظار داشت تمام جستجو گران را دقیقا و بدون خطا به مقصد راهنمایی کند. آسیب پذیری موتورهای جستجو هم در حقیقت آسیب پذیری الگوریتم آنهاست. البته با پیشرفت دانش هوش مصنوعی و توسعه موتورهاي جستجوي اينترنت این مشکل روز بروز کمرنگ تر می شود.</text>

[[Image:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|right|300px]]

An adult human heart is roughly equivalent to two human fists and weighs around 300g, although this varies from person to person. It basically consists in a bag of cardiac muscles, that pulsates blood  across the body as it contracts and relaxes.

===Internal===
The picture to the right shows a vertical section through a human heart, with all labeled blood vessels and sections. The aorta, the large arching vessel is the bodies largest artery, branching upwards towards the brain and the main flow heading toward the rest of your body. The other large vessel leaving the heart is the pulmonary artery, which branches to take blood to both lungs to be re-oxygenated, and the pulmonary veins bring blood back from the lungs to the heart. The ''vena cava'', coming from both the head and the rest of the body are two large veins running vertically on the right side of the heart.

The picture also shows the four chambers of the heart, and the chambers on the left are separated from the right by a wall of muscle known as the septum, forcing blood to leave the heart and be circulated around the lungs and re-oxygenated before returning via the pulmonary vein to the right hand side of the heart. The upper chambers are known as atrium and these receive blood from veins, the right (left on the picture) with the ''vena cava'' and the pulmonary vein into the left (on the right) atrium.

The lower chambers are ventricles and blood flows into the ventricles from the atria and is then squeezed into the arteries. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known as atrio-ventricular valves.

You can follow this flow of blood by following the arrows on the diagram.

===External===
The surface of the heart shows the coronary arteries, which branch from the aorta and supply the heart with oxygenated blood

=Cardiac cycle=
[[Image:Wiggers Diagram.png|right|300px]]
The cardiac cycle is basically what happens during one heart-beat, and since it is continuous, a description could begin anywhere.
When the heart is filled with blood, the muscles in the atrial walls contracts (known as the atrial systole), and this forces the blood from the atria down through the atrio-ventricular valves into the ventricles. About 0.1 seconds after this, the ventricles contract, known as the ventricular systole

*Ventricles relax, atria contract. Atrial systole This forces the atrio-ventricular valves to open and forces blood into the ventricles.

*Ventricles contract, atria relax. Ventricular systole. The resultant pressure closes the atrio-ventricular valves, and so the blood opens the semi-lunar valves to the pulmonary artery and aorta, and blood flows out there.

*Both relax. Cardiac diastole. The pressure that's now in the pulmonary artery and aorta causes the semilunar valves to close, preventing backflow.

==Heart beat control==

The heart muscles are myogenic, meaning they contract and relax on their own. They are stimulated by two nodes, the sino-atrial node and the atri-ventricular node. The sino-atrial node is a modified muscle cell collection situated at right auricle that sends out regular electrical impulses to the atrial walls.

*The electrical impulse from the SAN causes the left and right atria to contract simultaneously.
*Collagen tissue prevent the electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles.
*The atrio-ventricular node picks up the excitation waves as it spreads across the atria, and after a delay of 0.1 seconds it passes it on to conducting fibres, called the Purkyne tissue which runs down the septum between the ventricles where it spreads outwards and upwards through the ventricle walls. This purkyne tissue causes the ventricles to contract simultaneously from the bottom up, squeezing blood upwards and into the arteries.

If the heart loses control, and the excitation wave becomes chaotic, this is known as fibrillation, and it will feed back on itself and re-stimulate areas inappropriately. This can be due to a heart attack or an electric shock. This fibrillation, since the blood is not being pumped properly, is nearly always fatal, but an electric shock can kick the heart back into sequence.

===Electrocardiograms===
[[Image:ECG.png|right]]

The image on the right is a detection of the voltage within the heart against time and is known as an electrocardiogram (ECG).

*P is the excitation of the atrial walls
*Q, R, S are the ventricle wall excitement
*T is the ventricle walls recovery.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who are the Iroquois?==
The Iroquois were a powerful Native American Confederacy that was made up of five, and later six, tribes. They called themselves the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. It is believed they banded together in the 1300s, although oral tradition argues that the federation was formed around August 31, 1142, based on a coinciding solar eclipse. The Confederacy existed until 1779, when it finally split over the American Revolution. The tribes of the confederacy were the Mohawk, the Onedia, the Seneca, the Onodaga, the Cayuga and later the Tuscarora.
[[Image:Iroquois 6 Nations map c1720.png|300px|thumb|Location of the Iroquois.]]
Iroquois Indians

The Iroquois Indians lived in what is now New York State along the St. Lawrence River.
The Iroquois village consisted of two or more longhouses.  
In the early years the longhouses were built near streams.
Later they were built on hilltops for protection from invading tribes.
The longhouse was large enough to hold a family of 30 to 60 people. It could be 25 to 150 feet long.
The Iroquois made most of their clothing from deerskin. The women wore skirts, vests, and moccasins. They decorated their clothes with porcupine quills, shell beads, and dyed hair. The women also made necklaces of shell beads and animal teeth. The women in the northern areas wore leggings and breechcloths. In the winter they wore rabbit fur capes or shawls tied over the left shoulder. The Iroquois men wore deerskin breechcloths during the hot summer. In the cold weather they wore leather leggings and tunics.
They called beans, squash, and corn &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;.
Women held a powerful position in the Iroquois tribe. They owned longhouses, controlled the land, and chose the chief.
Members of a clan are all descendants of the same person.
The Iroquois society has always treated women equally and given them a lot of power and important jobs since their wisdom and skills have always been respected by the Iroquois people.
The Iroquois women could start and stop wars.

==Where did they live?==
The Iroquois lived mostly in what is today north and central New York State. During the 1600s, through conquest, they expanded north into present-day Canada, down as far south as Virgina, and out as far west as the Mississippi River. 

==What kind of buildings did they have?==
The Iroquois lived in Long-houses, which were made of bark and wood. The house was a long and narrow building that could be 50 to 150 feet long and from 18 to 25 feet wide. The roof was arched. The walls, formed from curved poles, were covered with sheets of bark, but had no windows. Over the bark a layer of thatch, or dried grass, was added. A central hallway ran the length of the long-house. Small fires burned at many sites along the open space. Smoke from these fires curled upward and out of the building through smoke holes in the roof. 

==What did they eat?==
Like most Native Americans of the east, the Iroquois depended upon corn as their main source of food. They usually ate one meal a day at mid-morning. Food was always on the fire and people ate when they were hungry. They were skilled hunters. On foot they stalked deer, moose and caribou. They only killed what they needed to survive. The Iroquois also fished.

They moved their encampments from one place to another in search of food, which came from hunting, trapping, fishing and the various plant roots, seeds, wild rice and berries. In the spring women tilled the soil and planted crops. Men hunted when the woman finished their harvest chores. Their most common prey were deer, bear, moose,beaver, and wild duck.

At least during the 17th century the Iroquois, as a religious rite, also ate the skin and meat of their enemies for the purpose of wanting to consume their enemies spirit. They did this with the intention of destroying their enemies spirits.

==What did they wear?==
The Iroquois men in warm weather usually wore leggings and a breechcloth. This was a piece of fabric about 18 inches wide that went inbetween the legs. It was held at the waist by a belt and hung down to the knees in front and back. When the weather was cold, the men wore a tunic like shirt with fringed edges. In all kinds of weather, they wore leggings. The Iroquois men sometimes wore an unusual feather-covered cap. In the center of the hat one or two feathers stood straight up. Many men, especially warriors, cut off most of their hair. They left a lock or tuft in the center and back of the head called a “roach” One or two feathers were added for decoration. Today we call this a Mohawk.
	
The Iroquois women usually wore their hair long and braided. Their clothing was simple deerskin skirts that went below the knees, and leggings similar to the men’s. In cold weather they added a loose cape-like blouse with deep fringes along the edges.

==What did their writing look like?==
==What did they believe?==
The Iroquois belief system centered on a formless Great Spirit or Creator, from which other spirits were formed. They believed spirits animated all of nature and controlled the changing of the seasons. Key festivals took place with the major events of the agricultural calendar, including a harvest festival of thanksgiving. After the arrival of the Europeans, many Iroquois became Christians. Traditional religion was revived in the second half of the 18th century by the teachings of the Iroquois prophet Handsome Lake.

==Are some of them even famous today?==
==What is left of them today?==
Few are left. Tribes are in small areas called reserves.  Some of these tribes can be found in Ontario, while most are found in New York.

==Your Idea==
No problem for the template. As for your idea, well, I'm not 100% sure, but you'd propbably either have to bring it up with an Admin or in here [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines/Vote ]. If neither of those work I'll ask around, and figure out what to do. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 20:23, 2 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">See the [[Cookbook:Chili con carne|chili con carne]] entry for more on the history of chili.  This is a variation on the theme which includes sweet peppers, [[Cookbook:Chipotle|chipotle]]s, leftover grilled hamburgers, and [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]].  Most of the ingredients specify very approximate quantities, as this chili works well even with wide variations.  Feel free to omit from or add to the ingredient list as your pantry allows.

With the suggested amounts of seasoning, you will get a moderately spicy chili.  Cut the chili powder in half for a milder stew.  The chipotles in adobo add a bit of heat (but not as much as raw jalepeños would).

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil
* large sweet onion, coarsely chopped
* small red onion, coarsely chopped
* 3-10 (to taste) garlic cloves, minced
* 3-4 leftover hamburger patties, grilled, chilled
* 4 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4-5 small sweet chiles
* small can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
* 12oz bottle hoppy beer (recipe developed with Lagunitas IPA)
* large can of chopped tomatoes
* small can of tomato paste
* can of black beans, drained and rinsed
* can of dark kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* table side additions such as sour cream, shredded cheese, Fritos, Cheese-its, etc.

== Procedure ==
=== Sauté Onions and Garlic ===
# Heat a stockpot over medium heat and add the oil.
# Swirl the oil in the pan to coat, and turn the heat down to medium-low.
# [[Cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] the onions and garlic while you [[#Grind the Meat|grind the meat]] and [[#Make Chile Paste|make chile paste]], below.
=== Grind the Meat ===
# Using a food processor, grind the leftover hamburger patties into a coarse powder.
# In a bowl, mix the ground hamburgers with the cumin, chili powder, and salt.  Set aside.
=== Make Chile Paste ===
# (Don't bother cleaning the food processor after grinding the meat.)  Add the sweet chiles one by one and grind until they're reduced to small bits.
# Add the chipotles along with the adobo sauce, grinding until the chipotles are thoroughly integrated into the sauce.  You can leave this in the food processor or move it to a bowl.
=== Turn It Into Chili ===
# By now the onions should be pretty well cooked down.  Turn the heat up to medium and stir continuously.
# The onions may start to brown and stick to the bottom of the stockpot.  Add half the beer to [[Cookbook:Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan.
# Add the ground meat and spices, tomato products, beans, chile paste, and remainder of the beer, stirring after each addition to combine.
# When the pot comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and cover.
# Simmer for at least half an hour.
# Serve in bowls, either plain or with accompaniments suggested above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A typical PulseAudio distribution comes with numerous different programs. Refer to the man pages for more information. All official PulseAudio applications are prefixed with &lt;tt&gt;pa&lt;/tt&gt;.

; paplay
: Plays wavs and select other audio files. This is not an mp3 player.

; pacat : Plays and records streams
: PulseAudio alternative to aplay

; pasuspender
: Permits another device to access the sound device directly. Typically this is used for applications that can not plug into pulseaudio.

; pactl
: Controls the running pulseaudio server/daemon.

; padsp
: Creates a dsp and other devices for a transparent abstraction of a non-existant device.

; pacmd
: PulseAudio shell into pactl

==Ideas==
Needs a Preparing to Analyse chapter that discusses understanding your matrix, pqls and dilution, preparatory analyses etc

Added this chapter --[[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 09:45, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

Sampling representativeness and sampling design should be addressed - maybe in a separate chapter  [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 21:52, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

== BSc student ==
I am Bsc Student. i Want some help forEconomics.If is it possible than please help me.

This is a Wikibook about studying salt lakes. It contains methods for analysing salty water. I suggest you try talking to someone who is writing a book on Economics, or else look up your question in Wikipedia --[[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 07:23, 2 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Hello ==

To ask someone else's name in Jumieka, use &quot;name&quot;, then one of the phrases in the table below (''Wey yu name?'' is &quot;What's your name?&quot;). 

In Jumieka, to say your name, you use ''name'', (''Mi name Andre'' is &quot;My name is Andre&quot;).

==Immediate family==
====Pairents ~ Parents====
Just like in English, the Jumieka language has several words for ''mother'' and ''father''. Starting with the words for ''mother'', we see:
*'''Mouma'''
And sometimes:
*'''Mahda'''
The most common word for ''father'' is:
*'''Pupa'''
But occasionally
*'''Fahda'''
is used.

====Siebling ~ Siblings====
The words for ''Siebling'' (siblings) are for ''brother'':
*'''Bror'''
*'''Broda'''
and for ''sister'':
*'''Siesta'''

====Pikni ~ Children====
In Danish, the words for ''son'' and ''daughter'' are close to English. They are '''søn''' and '''dauta''', respectively.

==The rest of the family==

*'''Onkel''' = Uncle
*'''Ante''' = Aunt
*'''Niece''' = Niece
*'''Nevyu''' = Nephew
*'''Kusine''' = Cousin
*'''Grandmahda''' = Grandmother
*'''Grandfahda''' = Grandfather


The Jumieka word for ''grandchild'' is '''grandpikni'''.

====Great-grandparents ~ Great-grandparents====
*'''Great-grandfahda'''/'''Great-grandpupa''' = Great-grandfather
*'''Great-grandmahdar'''/'''Great-grandmouma''' = Great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-grandchild'' is '''Great-grandpikni'''


====Great-great-grandparents ~ Great-great-grandparents====
*'''Great-great-grandfahda'''/'''Great-great-grandpupa''' = Great-great-grandfather
*'''Great-great-grandmahdar'''/'''Great-great-grandmouma''' = Great-great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-great-grandchild'' is '''Great-great-grandpikni'''
* For every generation from this point forward you add another '''great-''' to the title.

'''Template name:Textontop'''

Makes a two celled invisible table with the Table of Contents on the left, (TOC), and the introductory text of the page on the right.

See the example on the top of the page [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes|Adjusting Brakes]], where an image has been included with the text. 

It allows text to be written from the very top line, level with the top of the Table of Contents.   It saves space and looks better than the large expanse of white space which usually exists to the right of the TOC.

Because the TOC text can vary in length and because the TOC has its own internal sizing algorithm, a ''widthleft'' option is provided to adjust the width of the TOC cell, the leftmost cell, if necessary.

The text alignment is set as an option and has a default of ''left''.  The text options include padding.

===Limitations===
----
Note that Wikitext heading code,(===), sometimes causes problems in table cells, so when it happens use the HTML heading style instead. e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.   If after adjustment of text the next page heading looks a bit far down the page, just add a zero padding style to the leading HTML heading tag like this:
{{block|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-top:0px;&quot;&gt;Heading Text Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}   

===Options===
----
;align:   Horizontal alignment for text. Default;left. Options;left,right,center, and justify. 
;background: Background color, default transparent.
;border:  perimeter border, default none. format in sequence &lt;nowiki&gt;border=thickness type color&lt;/nowiki&gt;
;padding:   Text cell padding.  Default 10px.   
;padtoc:   TOC cell padding. Default 10px
;widthleft:   width of the leftmost table cell, with the Table of Contents, (TOC).Default 200px.

'''Template name:Imageontop'''

Makes a three celled table and automatically places the Table of Contents, (TOC), in it.   Allows two separate images with captions to be placed to its right, level with the top of the TOC.   Saves space and looks better than the large expanse of white space which usually exists to the right of the TOC.

Because the TOC text can vary and because the TOC has its own internal sizing algorithm, a ''widthleft'' option is provided to adjust the width of the leftmost cell, if necessary.

Note that the table can be placed ''anywhere'' on the page, so text could exist above it.   To reduce any excessive gap between lead text and the template, consider placing it in-line with the end of the top text. Similarly, a follow-on heading might look spaced too much from the template; in this case use the HTML heading style and style it to remove padding. It could look like this:
{{block|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding-top:0px;&quot;&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
===Limitations===
----
I cannot figure out how to fully manage the mind of the TOC so the ''widthleft'' option was found necessary to ''unwrap'' TOC entries on occasion.

Images vary in size so it is important to select images of about the right shape before scaling.   Scale the images to the same height if possible by specifying the height of each exactly and exaggerating the width to a considerable extent.   In this way the software picks the least size to match the specification, which will be the one you want.   [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/Tiled_Images '''Tiled Images'''] contains further examples of such scaling, but see the code below for a typical example which can be run in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=submit '''sandbox'''].   (You will need to type a few dummy headings there to generate the Table of Contents.)

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{imageontop|[[Image:Narcissus pseudonarcissus (daffodills) - 1.jpg|900x230px]]|Caption 1|[[image:crocus_4.jpg|1000x230px]]|Caption 2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Provision for ''two'' images is made, but '''if captions are not needed, use &lt;nowiki&gt;template:textontop&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' with images scaled and in-line  within the text space.   In this way, a variable number of images could be included. 

===Parameters===
----
There are four parameters; use either the numbers or the names.
*1=Piccode1; the left image code space
*2=Caption1; the caption space for the left image
*3=Piccode2; the right image code space
*4=Caption2; the caption space for the right image
  
===Options===
----
;widthleft:   width of the leftmost table cell, with the Table of Contents, (TOC).Default 200px.

== Description ==

'''Ada.Storage_IO''' is not a general-purpose [[Ada Programming/Input Output|Input/Output]] package. It is designed for [[Programming Languages/Concurrent Languages|concurrent programming]], and can be used to transfer elements from one [[Ada Programming/Tasking|task]] to another.

It allows you to store ''one'' element inside a memory buffer. The element needs to be of a [[Ada Programming/Subtypes#definite_subtype|definite subtype]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Water Transport=

Water enters a plant through the hairs on the root, and moves across the root cells into the xylem, which transports it up and around the plant. That, and solutes are moved around by the xylem and the phloem, using the root, stem and plant.  

==Root==
[[Image:Waterpathwaysthroughrootcells.gif|right|frame|100px|The Apoplast and Symplast Pathways]]
Water enters the root through the root hairs, and then takes one of two paths (apoplast and symplast) to the xylem vessel.

===Soil to root hair===

A root hair is a simple extension of the epidermis of a root cell, and reach into the soil to absorb water. It exists to increase the surface area and therefore the rate at which water can be absorbed. Some plants have fungi which act like fine roots, absorbing nutrients from the soil for the plant. Water moves into the root hair cells because it is moving down a water potential gradient, since a root cell has a relatively low water potential due to its inorganic ions and organic substances. Water will enter through the membrane and into the cytoplasm and vacuole.

===Root hair to xylem===

From the root hair cells, water again moves down a concentration gradient toward the xylem, and can take one of three paths - apoplast and symplast and vacoular.

The apoplast pathway is where water takes a route going from cell wall to cell wall, not entering the cytoplasm at any point. The symplast pathway is where water moves between cytoplasm/vacuoles of adjacent cells. However, the apoplast pathway can only take water a certain way, near the xylem, the Casparian strip forms an impenetrable barrier to water in the cell walls, and it must move into the cytoplasm to continue. This gives the plant control over the ions that enter its xylem vessels, since water must cross a plasma membrane to get there.The vacoular pathway moves molecules through the vacuoles only of the plant.

==Xylem==
The xylem is constructed of three main elements;

*Vessel elements, including tracheids - cells involved in water transport
*Fibres - elongated cells with lignified walls that support the plant
*Parenchyma cells - normal plant cells, except no chloroplasts.

===Xylem vessels===

These vessel elements make up the xylem - and are many elongated cells laid end to end, and are normal plant cells with their walls strengthened by lignin, a hard strong substance that is impermeable to water, and is designed to provide structure and strength to the plant. When these plant cells are strengthened by lignin, the cell inside dies, leaving a space inside. However, in some plasmodesmata, there was no lignin laid down and these appear as gaps in the xylem vessel, know as pits. These have permeable unthickened cellulose cell wall.

Thus, a continuous tube is formed, known as the xylem vessel.  Xylem vessels are huge
They are used to transport the minerals and water and it provides support to the plant.

===Tracheids===

Tracheids are dead cells with lignified walls, but they do not have open ends and thus do not form vessels - their ends are tapered. All plants have them, but primitive plants use them as main conducing tissue.

=Translocation=

The transport of soluble organic substances (sometimes called assimilates) within a plant is known as translocation. The solutes are transported in sieve elements, found in the phloem tissues, along with other  as companion cells, parenchyma and fibres.

==Components==
===Sieve Elements===

Sieve Elements are specialised cells, with few mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum, no nucleus or ribosomes. Where two ends of sieve elements meet, a sieve plate is formed, made from walls of both elements, with large pores allowing free flow of liquids between them.

===Companion Cells===

Companion cells are normal plant cells with high numbers of mitochondria and ribosomes, and have many plasmodesmata pass through to their neighbouring sieve cell walls, making direct contact between the cytoplasms of companion cell and sieve element.

==Mass Flow==

Mass flow is the theory by which we think solute transport occurs in plants. Any area where sucrose is produced in a plant is known as a ''source'', and any area where it is taken out (usually, used in respiration) is known as a ''sink''. 

*Sucrose is actively transported into the sieve tubes of the phloem at the source (i.e. source), lowering the water potential inside the sieve and so water enters the tubes via osmosis, creating a higher pressure inside the sieve tubes at the source.

*At the sink, sugars leave the phloem to be used up, increasing the water potential inside the sieve tubes, so water leaves via osmosis, lowering the pressure inside the sieve tubes.

*The result is a pressure gradient between source to sink, pushing sugars to where they're needed.

===Evidence===

Supporting evidence

*When the phloem is cut, sap oozes out, showing a pressure gradient.
*Suitable water potential gradient between leaves and other plants, in theory.
*Phloem sap has a high pH, which is to be expected since hydrogen ions are actively transported out of the cell.
*ATP is present in phloem sieve elements in high numbers since it is required for active transport of hydrogen ions.

Evidence against

*Sugar travels to many different sinks.
*Sieve plates are a barrier to mass flow.
*Doesn't require living cells, but phloem cells are alive.

=Transpiration=

Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from the leaves of a plant.

==Xylem to leaf==

As water evaporates from the leaf, a constantly occurring process, more water is taken in to replace it. The removal of water  reduces the hydrostatic pressure ( pressure exerted by a liquid). Since this pressure becomes lower at the top of the xylem vessel than at the bottom,this pressure difference causes water to move up the xylem vessels, just as in a straw. 

This process is known as mass flow - as long with the fact that water molecules move together as a body of water - aided by water's property of being cohesive, and attracted to the lignin in the walls of the xylem vessels, known as adhesion.

Once water is in the leaf, it can be lost through the stomata, if there is a concentration gradient that it can go down, which are small pores in direct contract with the air outside. This process is known as transpiration.

===Root pressure===

Plants can also increase the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the vessels, changing the pressure difference. They do this by cells surrounding the xylem vessels to use active transport to pump solutes across their membranes and into the xylem, lowering the water potential of the solution in the xylem, thus drawing in water from the surrounding root cells. The influx of water at the bottom of the xylem increases the pressure.

==Transpiration  rate==
[[Image:Potometer.png|framed|A potometer]]
The rate of transpiration is affected by:

*Humidity, which affects the water potential gradient outside the leaf, by making the gradient more or less steep. Low levels of humidity would cause the gradient to be steep, meaning that transpiration would increase as water molecules would find it easier to escape the leaves. A high humidity level would have the opposite effect, reducing the transpiration rate.

*Wind speed, which affects the water potential gradient outside the leaf. the faster the speed, the less humid the area around the leaf becomes, as a result, the water potential gradient would be come more steep and more evapotranspiration would occur.

*Temperature, which makes it easier for water molecules to escape from the leaves (this happens when it is hot). as temperature increases, the water molecules are able to move more rapidly. The evaporation rate also increases with temperature. Warm air is also able to hold more moisture than cold air, meaning that water can diffuse into warm air more easily, and this contributes to the transpiration rate.

*Light, Light stimulates the stomata to open allowing gas exchange for photosynthesis, and as a side effect this also increases transpiration. This is a problem for some plants as they may lose water during the day and wilt.

The transpiration rate is measured by a potometer, a device that measures the rate at which a plant stem takes up water, since measuring transpiration directly is difficult.

===Xerophytes===

Xerophytes are plants which have various adaptions (below) to reduce transpiration and thus water loss.

*Reduced stomata
*Swollen stem, storing water
*Swollen leaves to store water
*Huge surface area for roots
*Leaves reduced to spines (cactus), reducing surface area for water loss
*Take in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at night so they can close their stomata in the day to reduce water loss
*Thick, waxy water-resistant cuticle on the epidermis to reduce water loss
*Sunken stomata (in pits), where water vapour is sheltered from the wind
*Hairlike projections, called trichomes, on the leaf surface to reduce the effect of high wind speed

'''Serviettenknödel''' (ˌsɛr.vi.ˈɛt.ɛn ˈknø:dɘl) is a type of [[cookbook:Knoedel|Knoedel]] (more specifically a type of ''Semmelknödel''), a bread dumpling which plays an integral role in the culinary traditions of Austria, Bavaria, and the Czech Republic. These bread dumplings are often served alongside roast duck, goose and pork as well as many different kinds of dishes with hearty sauces such as Hungarian goulash and venison or mushroom ragout. The exact ingredients in the knödel vary slightly according to region and to season. In spring many cooks include wild garlic [''Bärlauch''] and in the autumn and winter leeks. The version below is a seasonal standard.



==Ingredients==
* 8.8 oz (250g = one normal-sized loaf) stale French or Italian bread cut into crouton-sized cubes
* 2 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* 1 1/4 cups (300ml) milk (preferably whole milk)
* 4 Tbsp (60g) butter (the amount of butter can also be lessened or substituted for a neutral-tasting oil)
* 1/4 cup (60g) finely chopped onions (one medium-sized onion)
* 2 tsp (a large dash) salt
* 1/2 - 1 bunch chopped broad-leaf parsley
[[image:serviettenknoedel_ingredients_2008-12-12_brite33b.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:serviettenknoedel_ingredients_2008-12-12_brite33b.jpg|actual size]]]]

==Procedure==
[[image:serviettenknoedel_combine.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:serviettenknoedel_combine.jpg|actual size]]]]
[[image:serviettenknoedel_bread-log.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:serviettenknoedel_bread-log.jpg|actual size]]]]


#Mix the milk, eggs and salt together. Combine the mixture with the bread cubes and the parsley in a large mixing bowl, coating as much of the bread as possible with the mixture. Let the mixture rest while you chop and sauté the onions. After the sautéd onions have cooled enough not to cook the egg, add them to the bread and mix thoroughly. 
#Let the mixture rest for an hour, mixing it through once or twice during the hour. (The object here is to coat the cubes with the liquid mixture on all sides to allow them to absorb as much liquid as possible; this is especially necessary if your bread is more than a few days old.)
#Wet a fresh cotton dishcloth (tee towel) or cloth napkin (serviette). Some cooks brush the top side of the cloth with melted butter for more flavor, but this is not necessary. Completely unfold the dishcloth and place the bread mass in the middle of the cloth. 
#Next, form the bread mass to a 3 inch (~6 cm) thick log. Roll bread log up tightly in the cloth and tie off the ends of cloth with a short length of string or twine. Some cooks also tie a string around the middle as the edge of the cloth tends to pucker in the middle.
#Bring a large pot of water to a boil - as you would if you were cooking spaghetti - and then add salt. Slowly lower the serviettenknödel into the water and let cook for 40 minutes.
#Remove the serviettenknödel from the boiling water (with metal tongs or two forks in a pinch) and transfer to a large cutting board preferably wooden, as  the wood will absorb much of the excess water in the cloth. Cut and remove the string; then unroll and remove the cloth. 
#To prepare the knödel for the table, begin at one end cutting 1/2 inch (1 cm) slices, taking only as many as you need in servings so that the knödel does not get cold.

Welcome to the fourth basic lesson of Hebrew! In this lesson we will begin to learn how to conjugate Hebrew verbs and form questions.

==Dialogue==
Sarah and David meet again on the street. This time they are in a hurry so they speak briefly before moving on.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''דוד:''' שלום! אֵיפֹה את גָּרָה?&lt;br&gt;  
'''שרה:''' אני גָּרָה בִּיְרוּשָׁלַיִם.&lt;br&gt;
'''דוד:''' אני גָּר בִּנְיוּ-יוֹרְק. &lt;br&gt;
'''שרה:''' טוב, להתראות!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Question-answer

{{Hebrew|אֵיפֹה אתה גָּר?}} and {{Hebrew|אֵיפֹה את גָּרָה?}} both mean “where do you live?” (lit. “where [do] you reside?”). This question is replied by the preposition {{Hebrew|בְּ...}} + your residence, or the statement {{Hebrew|אני גָּר בְּ...}} + your residence, but the latter also declends with gender.

'''Examples'''
* Someone (to Boy): {{Hebrew|אֵיפֹה '''אתה גָּר'''?}}
* Someone (to Girl): {{Hebrew|אֵיפֹה '''את גָּרָה'''?}}
* Boy: {{Hebrew|אני '''גָּר''' בְּ...}}
* Girl: {{Hebrew|אני '''גָּרָה''' בְּ...}}

==Introduction to Verbs==

In the previous lesson, we learned that roots of radicals fall into “moulds” to form verbs and nouns. There are 7 “moulds” used for verbs, and these are called {{Hebrew|בִּנְיָנִים}}.

In this lesson we will start learning the first and most basic {{Hebrew|בִּנְיָן}}, ''qal''. But before beginning with regular verbs with 3 radicals in their roots, we shall start with 2. This is because the most archaic and basic verbs (“to live”, “to come”, “to reside”, etc.) have just two letters.

In Hebrew, verbs conjugate in gender, number, and, in the past and future tenses, person. Unlike English, which has many progressive and perfect tenses, Hebrew has just 3: past, present, and future, as well as the imperative mood.

The verb {{Hebrew|גָּר}} (to reside), which has two radicals (root: {{Hebrew|ג-ר}}), conjugates in the present tense as follows:

{|  {{Hebrew table|Verbs|?אֵיפֹה אַתָּה גָּר|To reside|לָגוּר|4}}
!
! Singular 
! Plural
|-
| ''m''
| {{Hebrew|גָּר}} 
| {{Hebrew|גָּרִ'''ים'''}}
|-
| ''f''
| °{{Hebrew|גָּרָ'''ה'''}}
| {{Hebrew|גָּר'''וֹת'''}}
|}

'''Notes'''
* The declension of adjectives and the pluralization of nouns is identical. This is because verbs in the present tense can also be nouns and adjectives.

Other verbs that conjugate the same:
{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|?אֵיפֹה אַתָּה גָּר|Verbs|פְּעַלִים|2}}
! English
! עִבְרִית
|-
| Sing
| {{Hebrew|שָׁר}}
|-
| Come 
| {{Hebrew|בָּא}}
|-
| Live
| {{Hebrew|חָי}}
|-
| Sense
| {{Hebrew|חָשׁ}}
|- 
| Put
| {{Hebrew|שָׂם}}
|}

==Grammar: Questions==

In English, when we would like to form a question out of a statement with no auxiliary verbs, we add the verb “to do”:

* You like chocolate.
: '''Do''' you like chocolate?

When we do have a statement with auxiliary verbs, we switch the location of the subject and the verb:

* She can read a book.
: '''Can''' she read a book?

In addition, we can add an interrogative pronoun at the start of the sentence:

* She reads a book.
: '''What does''' she read?

In Hebrew, the auxiliary verb “to do” is nonexistent. Because of this, the verb in question does not change its conjugation:

* She reads a book.
: '''What''' she read'''s'''?

To sum it up, when we want to form a question out of a statement in Hebrew, we need not change the sentence at all, all we have to do is raise the voice at the end of question (higher intonation) and add the interrogative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence if needed. The auxiliary verb retains its location.&lt;ref&gt;In the question {{Hebrew|בֵּן כַּמָּה אתה?}} the interrogative pronoun {{Hebrew|כַּמָּה}} is at the middle of the sentence. This is because it is in construct with word {{Hebrew|בֵּן}}, something we shall learn later.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Memory Management/Page}}

We've already seen how complicated memory management can be, especially if you are allocating and freeing memory manually. Thankfully, there is a class of systems known as '''garbage collectors''' which can help to automate the process of memory reclamation.

== What are Garbage Collectors ==

Garbage Collectors (GC) are systems or sub-systems that are used to manage dynamic memory automatically. Here is how they work:

# Instead of calling &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; directly, these are replaced with a function from the GC called &quot;&lt;code&gt;gc_malloc&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Obviously, this function can be named anything in practice.
#When we call &lt;code&gt;gc_malloc&lt;/code&gt; in our program, the garbage collector calls &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to allocate memory from the system, and find some way to keep track of the memory. There are many ways to track memory, and we will discuss some of them in future chapters
#The program runs like normal, allocating memory from the GC when needed, but never freeing the memory explicitly.
#The GC performs a function called a '''trace''' intermittently. This can be a synchronous or asynchronous occurrence. During the trace, the GC starts with a set of objects that are immediately visible to the system, called the '''root set''' of memory objects. It follows pointers in these memory objects to child-objects. When it reaches an object, it marks it as being '''alive'''. 
#When the GC has finished the trace, and no more pointers can be followed, the reclamation phase begins. All objects which are not marked alive are considered '''dead''', because no pointers from the program point to them, and therefore they cannot be possibly accessed by the program. All dead objects are freed by the GC.

== Types of Collectors ==

There are two primary types of garbage collectors, although often a hybrid approach is found between these to suit particular needs. The first type, the one which might be the most intuitive, is a '''reference counting''' collector. The second one, which is most similar to what we described above, is a '''tracing''' collector.

=== Reference Counting Collector ===

When a new memory object is allocated by the GC, it is given an integer count field. Every time a pointer is made to that object, a reference, the count is increased. So long as the count is a positive non-zero integer, the object is actively being referenced and is still alive. 

When a reference to the object is removed, the count is decremented. When the count reaches zero, the object is dead and can be immediately reclaimed.

There are a number of points to remember about Reference Counting collectors:
# Circular references will never be reclaimed, even if the entire set of objects is dead. 
# Reference counting is pervasive: The entire program must be made aware of the system, and every pointer reference or dereference must be accompanied by an appropriate increment or decrement. Failing to maintain the count, even once in a large program, will create memory problems for your program. 
# Reference counting can be costly, because counts must be manipulated for every pointer operation, and the count must be tested against zero on ever decrement. These operations can, if used often enough, create a performance penalty for your program.

These types of collectors are often called '''cooperative collectors''' because they require cooperation from the rest of the system to maintain the counts.

=== Tracing Collector ===

Tracing collectors are entirely dissimilar from reference counting collectors, and have opposite strengths and weaknesses.

When the Tracing GC allocates a new memory chunk, the GC does not create a counter, but it does create a flag to determine when the item has been marked, and a pointer to the object that the GC keeps. The flags are not manipulated by the program itself, but are only manipulated by the GC when it performs a run.

During a GC run, the program execution typically halts. This can cause intermittent pauses in the program, pauses which can be quite long if there are many memory objects to trace.

The GC selects a set of root objects which are available to the current program scope and parent scopes. Starting from these objects, the GC identifies all pointers within the objects, called children. The object itself is marked as being alive, and then the collector moves to each child and marks it in the same way.        The memory objects form a sort of tree structure, and the GC traverses this tree using recursive or stack-based methods.

At the end of the GC run, when there are no more children to be marked, all unmarked objects are considered unreachable and therefore dead. All dead objects are collected.

A few points to remember about Tracing GCs:
# Tracing GCs can be used to find cycles, memory objects whose pointers form circular structures. Reference Counting schemes cannot do this.
# Tracing GCs cause pauses in the program, and these pauses can become unbearably long in some complex programs that use many small memory objects. 
# Dead objects are not reclaimed immediately. Reclamation only occurs after a GC run. This causes a certain inefficiency in memory usage. 
# Tracing collectors do not require the program to account explicitly for memory counts or memory status updates. All memory tracking logic is stored inside the GC itself. This makes it easier to write extensions for these systems, and also makes it easier to install a Tracing GC in an existing system then to install a Reference Counting one.

Tracing GCs are often called '''uncooperative collectors''' because they do not require cooperation from the rest of the system to function properly.

=== Hybrid Collectors ===

Sometimes, reference counting schemes will utilize Tracing systems to find cyclical garbage. Tracing systems may employ reference counts on very large objects to ensure they are reclaimed quickly. These are just two examples of hybridized garbage collectors that are more common then either of the two &quot;pure&quot; types described above.

In later chapters, we will discuss garbage collectors and their algorithms in more detail.</text>

I didn't understand this.  It would help a lot if complete sentences were used.  Also, I read &quot;He&quot; as a pronoun the first time through instead of as Helium - might be better to spell it out.  2x would be better as &quot;times.&quot; This whole section was just really difficult to read!

What is a &quot;normal&quot; temperature?  I thought that the volume of a gas increased with temperature.  Does the oxygen in a liter of air really outweigh the nitrogen, even though N is more than triple the volume of O?  And Argon outweighs Oxygen?  
: OK - I get that part.  That was the density of the pure gas, not the grams of the gas per liter of air. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:19, 30 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Timing */ corrected space typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fibonacci algorithms ==
Fibonacci is the computer science 'hello world'. A recursive function which follows the definition of the Fibonacci series looks pretty much the same in every language. Here is the XQuery version:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:fib-recur($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer? {
    if ($n &lt;0) then ()
    else if ($n = 0)  then 0 
    else if ($n=1)   then 1 
    else myfn:fib-recur($n - 1)  + myfn:fib-recur($n - 2)
};
&lt;/source&gt;

The empty sequence is used here as a return when the function is undefined so the return type is an optional integer. Top-down, goal-oriented, close to the mathematical definition and but requiring repeated re-evaluations of intermediate values. So how about bottom-up, starting with the knowns and working up to the goal?

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:fib-itr-x($n as xs:integer, $m1 as xs:integer, $m2 as xs:integer) as xs:integer {
    if ($n = 1)
    then $m2
    else myfn:fib-itr-x($n - 1, $m2, $m1 + $m2)
};
&lt;/source&gt;
with a 'front-door' function to get started:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:fib-itr($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer? {
   if ($n &lt; 0) then ()
   else if ($n = 0) then 0
   else  myfn:fib-itr-x($n, 0, 1)
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Iterative solutions in which variables are updated look rather messy by comparison with this tail-recursive formulation, a style essential to many algorithms in XQuery.

== Timing ==
Just how much worse is the recursive formulation? We need to time the calls, and now we really could do with those higher order functions so we can pass either fib function to a timer function to execute. Step in eXists function modules. These raise XQuery from an XML query language to a viable web application platform. The util module provides two functions:

    * util:function(qname,arity) to create a function template which can be passed to
    * util:call (function, params)to evaluate the function

so we can create the recursive function template with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $call-fib-recur := util:function(QName(&quot;http:example.com/myfn&quot;,&quot;myfn:fib-recur&quot;),1)
&lt;/source&gt;

The timer function takes a function, a sequence of the parameters to be passed to the function and a repetition number. The timing is based on system time and the time difference converted to seconds and then to milliseconds:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:time-call($function as function, $params as item()* ,$reps as xs:integer ) as xs:decimal { 
   let $start := util:system-time()
   let $result :=  
        for $i in 1 to $reps
        return util:call($function, $params)
   let $end := util:system-time()
   let $runtimems := (($end - $start) div xs:dayTimeDuration('PT1S'))  * 1000  
   return $runtimems  div $reps
};  
&lt;/source&gt;


and call it as
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 myfn:time-call($call-fib-recur,10,5) 
&lt;/source&gt;

== An intermediate data structure ==

Calling the timer with n ranging from 1 to max will generate the required data. Rather than simply outputing this data, we need an intermediate XML data structure containing the results. This can then be transformed into different representation or analysed later, to fit a curve to the data perhaps or export to a spreadsheet.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $runs := 
&lt;dataset&gt;
  { for $n in  -1  to $max
    return
       &lt;tuple&gt;
          &lt;n&gt;{$n}
          &lt;fib&gt;{ myfn:fib-itr($n) } &lt;/fib&gt;
          &lt;recursive&gt;{ myfn:time-call($call-fib-recur,$n,$reps) }&lt;/recursive&gt;
          &lt;iterative&gt;{ myfn:time-call($call-fib-itr,$n,$reps) } &lt;/iterative&gt;
       &lt;/tuple&gt;     
  }
&lt;/dataset&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Results as a table ==
This data structure can be transformed to a table, iterating over the tuples.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:dataset-as-table($dataset ) as element(table) {
    &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
             {for $data in $dataset/*[1]/*
              return 
                  &lt;th&gt;{name($data)}&lt;/th&gt;
              }
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          {for $tuple in $dataset/*
              return
                &lt;tr&gt;
                   {for $data in $tuple/*
                    return 
                     &lt;td&gt;{string($data)}&lt;/td&gt;
                   }
                 &lt;/tr&gt;
          }
    &lt;/table&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the XPath name() function is used to convert from the tag names to strings. This reflection allows very generic functions to be written and is a key technique for making the transition from problem-specific structures to generic functions. Note that the dataset has not been typed. This is because the function is written with minimal requirements of the structure which would require a permissive schema language to express.

== Results as a graph ==
For graphing, this basic matrix could be imported directly into Excel, or, thanks to the wonderful GoogleCharts, to a simple line graph. Selected columns of the dataset are extracted and joined with commas, then all datasets joined with pipes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function myfn:dataset-as-chart($dataset, $vars as xs:string+) as element(img) {
let $series :=
   for $var in $vars
   return string-join( $dataset/*/*[name(.) = $var],&quot;,&quot;)
let $points := string-join($series ,&quot;|&quot; )
let $chartType := &quot;lc&quot;
let $chartSize := &quot;300x200&quot;
let $uri := concat(&quot;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?&quot;,
&quot;cht=&quot;,$chartType,&quot;&amp;amp;chs=&quot;,$chartSize,&quot;&amp;amp;chd=t:&quot;,$points)
return
   &lt;img src=&quot;{$uri}&quot;/&gt;
};

&lt;/source&gt;

== The final script ==
Finally, adding some intro, some page layout and CSS , the final script looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare namespace myfn = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/myfn&quot;;

declare function myfn:time-call($function as function, $params  ,$reps as xs:integer ) as xs:decimal {

        for $i in 1 to $reps
        return util:call($function ,$params)
   let $end := util:system-time()
   let $runtimems := (($end - $start) div xs:dayTimeDuration('PT1S'))  * 1000  
   return $runtimems  div $reps
};  

declare function myfn:fib-recur($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer? {
    if ($n &lt;0) then ()
    else if ($n = 0)  then 0 
    else if ($n=1)   then 1 
    else myfn:fib-recur($n - 1)  + myfn:fib-recur($n - 2)
};

declare function myfn:fib-itr($n as xs:integer) as xs:integer? {
   if ($n &lt; 0) then ()
   else if ($n = 0) then 0
   else  myfn:fib-itr-x($n, 0, 1)
};

declare function myfn:fib-itr-x($n as xs:integer, $m1 as xs:integer, $m2 as xs:integer) as xs:integer {
    if ($n = 1)
    then $m2
    else myfn:fib-itr-x($n - 1,$m2, $m1 + $m2)
};

              }
         &lt;/tr&gt;
          {for $tuple in $dataset/*
              return

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a couple of problems with this page.

These are shown by the statement in the first paragraph - &quot;China is the oldest civilization in the world, with the famous Peking Man having been found to have lived near 400,000 years ago. The Chinese Neolithic Period is made unique to archaeologists by the sheer number of tools found littered within the cultural borders of its peoples. So one must always keep in mind that when discussing the history of China, you are discussing, without question, the most established civilization that has ever existed.&quot;

1. The articles on Mesoptamia and Egypt (and scholarly sources outside Wikipedia) state that these civilisations started in the fourth millenium BCE. China became unified under the Qin dynasty during the first millenium BCE, which gave its name to 'China', and if 'civilisation' means the presence of towns, manufactured goods like weapons or pots, rudimentary government institutions and standing armies, these did not appear in China more than 1000 years before the Qin.

2. The Neolothic period (i.e. the new stone age) is normally understood to be pre-civilisation, and the evidence of its development is found around the world, probably most richly in Africa. Even earlier there were pre-homosapiens versions of man, including Peking Man, Neandearthal man and so on, which are not part of the study of civilisation or ancient history as these terms are normally understood. 

The really important aspects of Chinese history are its continuity into present times, unlike all others of comparable or greater age, and its scale.</text>

Nominating this for deletion.  It's an old book but doesn't appear to be much of a book.  Books normally have more than a cover page. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:25, 13 May 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' - I don't see a problem with this book. There appears to be room for expansion and I don't think it would be difficult for someone interested to do so. Books are not paper, they can be as short or as long as it takes to cover the subject for the intended audience. Other short books of this form have been brought up in the past only to be kept. Books are not required to have cover pages and if its short enough, splitting a book up into multiple pages doesn't really make sense. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:42, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

[[Image:Safety razor shaving kit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|safety razor, shaving brush and shaving soap]]
This section introduces tools used in shaving and gives tips and usage notes for each.

===Straight razor (cut-throat razor)===

[[Image:Hoffritz Solingen.JPG|thumb|200px|right|straight razor]]

[[w:Straight razor|Straight razor]]s are open steel blades, and were the traditional tool used for shaving before the invention of the [[w:safety razor|safety razor]]. Some [[w:barber|barber]]s and other shaving professionals continue to use them to this day, due to their precision. Picking off a single hair or trimming around a blemish is very easy with a straight razor, especially when compared with safety razors whose plastic casing makes precision difficult.

====Sharpening and using a straight razor====
They are sharpened using a [[w:strop|strop]] before each use. Strops are typically made from fine Russian horsehide, but [[w:cardboard|cardboard]] is just as effective; try the back of a notebook or the inside of a cereal box. Most blades are double-hollowed, meaning that the blade is curved in such a manner that the optimal stropping angle is when both the blade's edge and spine press against the strop.

Although the use of straight razors in violent scenes in movies and TV shows has promoted an image of them being dangerous weapons, straight razors are generally safe when handled properly. The key is to never move the blade in a slicing motion on the skin. If this is done, the blade will leave a perfect, clean cut which will, nonetheless, heal quickly with appropriate care. 

Most recommend that the blade be kept at a [[w:Degree (angle)|thirty degree angle]] to the face while shaving.

====Honing a straight razor====

[[Image:Strop, honing stone and razor.JPG|thumb|200px|right|strop, honing stone and razor]]

If a quality blade is dried and oiled after each use and stropped when needed, a straight razor may stay sharp for many years between honings. But once in a while, the blade may need to be honed.  Traditionally this was done on a speciality oil hone but modern synthetic water stones are an extremely popular option.  A quality water stone can be purchased from a wood work supply store.  Wood working requires frequent honing of the instruments and a speciality store will often carry a large selection of honing devices.  Hone grit convention vary with every brand but usually something labeled as 8000 or higher is fine for a straight razor.

A straight razor must pass the ''hanging hair test'' otherwise it requires honing.  After stropping, a hair is pressed perpendicularly against the blade.  Slowly pulling on the hair, the scales should bite on the blade resulting in the hair being cut in mid air.  A straight razor that is dull is dangerous to use.  The user will want to apply too much pressure to compensate for the lack of cutting power and this can lead to injury.  Some razors are sold fully sharpened, but even brand new razors may require an initial hone.  One does not need to acquire a water stone in order to use a straight razor. Some manufacturers recommend returning the blade to the manufacturer to be honed because users sometimes fail to get the blade as sharp as it could be.  But most barbers will perform the honing for a small fee.

[[Image:Shaving-system-2blade.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A safety razor with two blades.]]

===Safety razor===
If you are just starting out shaving, you will probably find yourself using a safety razor. A safety razor, like a straight razor, is non-electronic (though battery-powered models have lately made an appearance), and typically consists of one to five metal razors aligned within a plastic frame. The frame is an extension of a usually grooved handle. When this frame and its blade are removable, they are together called a blade cartridge. Safety razors with this design are not meant to be disposed of frequently, though their cartridges are. Safety razors without a removable cartridge are meant to be disposed of when the blades dull.

Though they are called safety razors, you yourself must exercise some degree of care in their use. Safety razors are not totally safe. Avoid running the blades laterally (side to side) on your skin, especially if pressure is applied along a blade's edge, as with a finger. With a safety razor, it is still possible to be cut. Always shave with the direction of hair growth initially. To achieve a very clean shave, you can reapply shaving cream and make another pass in the opposite direction, but be very careful, as this may result in cuts, irritated skin, and ingrown hairs.

A safety razor's blades wear out, and you should replace the blades whenever they feel dull. The rate at which they wear out depends heavily on the roughness of the body hair, the shaving cream used, etc. Keep the cutting surfaces clear by rinsing the hair off often. Also remember to keep the blades clean, by, for example, wiping them with something such as a piece of toilet paper after use. Even a cheap safety razor may shave comfortably for months if the blade is dried and oiled after each use, to prevent dulling of the blade by oxidation. Do be careful of your fingers, though.

====Double-edge razor====
While double-edge (frequently abbreviated DE) razors are also safety razors, they differ from most others in that they use a standard double-edge razor blade in place of a cartridge design. This blade must be placed into the head of the razor body. With many double-edge razors, this is done by twisting the base of the handle. The head either opens missile-silo fashion or simply becomes unscrewed from the body, the blade is dropped in, and the head replaced and screwed back down atop the blade. This leaves the blade's cutting surfaces exposed for shaving, while preventing the shaver from pressing the blade too much against the skin and being cut. More aggressive razors expose more of the blade; some razors allow the amount of blade exposure to be adjusted to match the aggressiveness desired by the shaver. A greater degree of skill is called for in using double-edge safety razors than other safety razors, as there is no cartridge assembly to hold the blade at a desirable angle for shaving; as with straight razors, thirty degrees from the surface to be shaved works well.

In addition to this primary distinction, double-edge razors are generally designed to last significantly longer than other safety razors. They are often cast out of metal and cost about as much as an electric razor. A double-edge razor, properly cared for, should last generations; some of the earliest models are still in circulation and use, including models molded out of such anachronisms as Bakelite.

[[Image:Headblade.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Head blade.]]

===Head blade===
A head blade is a razor specially designed for shaving the head.

===Electric razor===

[[Image:Philishave hq5426.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Electric razor]]

Electric razors are safer than safety razors. You usually use an electric razor when you're in a hurry or on a trip and don't have time or means for a proper shave. You do not use shaving cream with an electric razor. It is easy to shave with dry skin. Some special electric razors spread skin softening lotion while shaving, but they are rare because it's usually easier to use a lotion separately afterwards.

Modern electric razors shave almost as closely as most safety razors, are easier to use, aren't as messy, and are becoming the preferred instrument of a lot of people.

Electric razors require a higher initial investment (generally $50 to $150 US dollars) but may make economic sense in the long run: power usage is minimal, few consumables are required, and most electric razors have a lifespan, if maintained, of five or more years. However, the closeness of the shave isn't 100% the same as a wet shave. In addition, the skin feels more refreshed after a wet shave.

===Shaving brush===

[[Image:Rasierpinsel.jpg|thumb|200px|right|shaving brush]]

A shaving brush is commonly used with shaving creams distributed in tubs and tubes and with shaving soaps. It is used to work the cream or soap into a lather and apply the lather to the face. Shaving brushes take the form of a handle in which is fixed a knot of bristles. Brushes are characterized by the type of bristle, the diameter of the bristle knot, the ''loft'' of the bristles (the length of the exposed bristles), the height of the handle, and what the handle is made of. Brushes vary in size from quite small to quite large; larger brushes use more shaving cream but ease applying the lather to the entire face. Bristles are made of badger hair, boar hair, synthetic materials, or sometimes of the bristle plant. Badger hair is typically graded as silvertip, super, best, or unqualified (in approximate descending order from most- to least-valued) and is generally valued for its high degree of water retention and its feel. Boar hair is stiffer than badger, giving a pricklier sensation when the lather is applied to the face than badger. &lt;!-- Can anyone say anything about synthetics or bristle plant? I've never seen the bristle plant used. ---Jay W. --&gt;

===Shaving cream===

[[Image:Burma Shave Tube.jpg|thumb|200px|right|tube with shaving cream]]

If you choose a safety or straight razor, use shaving cream to protect your skin. (For shaving genitals, you may want to use a special shaving cream that does not contain irritating chemicals and deodorants.) A variety of shaving creams are available. Perhaps the most common are gels and creams dispensed from a pressurized spray can. If you use a gel-based solution, keep in mind that the gel will produce a substantial amount of cream as it is applied to the skin, and thus only small amounts are required. Another option is shaving creams distributed in tubs or tubes. Though these may be applied directly to the face with one's hands, proper use of a shaving brush gives a richer, creamier lather, as well as exfoliates the skin. (Many of these creams contain glycerin; some, however, contain lanolin. Note that extensive use of lanolin-based shaving creams with a brush may lead to the brush becoming gummed up.)

====Safety concerns====
*Note that pressurized spray cans are dangerous; as with most aerosol cans, they may explode when exposed to too much heat (especially if put near a fire), and they may crack and later release toxic chemicals if frozen.
*Although this should be obvious, it must be noted that most shaving creams and lotions are toxic. Do not ingest or inhale shaving creams or lotions. The instructions on the label of the container will sometimes indicate what quantity is a dangerous amount, but if you have ingested what seems to you to be a large amount, it would be wise to call a poison control center immediately unless the label says non-toxic.

===Soap===

[[Image:Decorative Soaps.jpg|thumb|200px|right|various soaps]]

Soaps can also be used to produce a lather. While any soap should produce some degree of lather, soaps especially formulated for shaving tend to give better results without drying out the skin. These are regularly used with a brush, and, when properly used, can produce a lather comparable to that of the creams. Soaps are commonly used with a bowl or cup to contain the lather whipped up by the brush.

===Lotions and oils===
Essential oils and lotions may be used both before and after shaving to prepare the skin, protect it, soften it, restore some of its moisture, or simply because it feels good and smells good. Alcohol-based aftershaves are also available; note that these will sting, especially where you have noticeably cut yourself, though they might disinfect.

===Styptic===

[[Image:Rasierstift.jpg|thumb|200px|right|styptic pencil]]

Styptic pencils and blocks, typically made of alum, can be used to staunch blood flow from cuts. While they may sting when applied to a cut, they work rapidly. This method of stopping bleeding is often quicker than alternatives such as applying pieces of cigarette paper or toilet paper to cuts, though whether it is significantly less unsightly is yours to judge.

===Mirror===

[[Image:Mirror.jpg|thumb|200px|right|mirror]]

A mirror is essential for most people. If it fogs up, a tiny amount of soap rubbed on the mirror will give a spot that stays clear for days. Do not rub the mirror with a used towel, because the body oils on the towel just make the fogging worse. Where possible, cracking or even fully opening a door or window to allow cooler air to enter the room will defog the mirror; if you wear glasses, this may be necessary for you to be able to see to shave.

===Nose-hair trimmer===
A nose-hair trimmer is a smaller trimmer meant for trimming nose hair. Electric models have a body that doubles as a handle with a small vibrating blade of sorts at the tip, which is small enough to be partially inserted into the nostril.

==Pulling==
===Adhesive===
====Hot wax====
====Cold wax====
====Sugar====
'''Standard recipe'''
The most common recipe for sugaring wax is as follows (units by volume):&lt;ref&gt;http://hairremoval.about.com/od/sugarwaxing/ss/sugar-hair-removal-recipe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*8 units of sugar
*1 unit of lemon (either fresh or from a bottle, not from concentrate)
*1 unit of water

The ingredients are heated and mixed until they are completely liquid; after this the liquid changes from seemingly white to a light, gold-like color (while being heated). The solution should not be allowed to become too dark. Darkness and hardness are controlled by heating the solution to specific temperatures. For a thick paste, the solution should be heated to 118°C, and to 121°C for a gel.

When completed, the solution is left to cool to room temperature.

Sugaring uses a thick sugar syrup to remove the hair. The syrup must be heated to a stage where it is thin enough to spread but cool enough not to burn the skin. The area to be epilated is typically dusted with powder (commercial or corn starch) prior to application of the sugaring solution, which is spread on with a spatula or tongue depressor.&lt;ref name=Spaindex /&gt; Once a section of skin has been covered a fabric strip is pressed into the syrup and the strip is quickly pulled off in the direction opposite to the hair growth. Any extra sugar left on the skin is easily removed. For sensitive areas the sugar syrup can be spread on the fabric strips first and then pressed onto the site for hair removal, lessening the chance of burning. The advantage to sugaring is that the fabric strips can be rinsed out and reused many times. There are recipes for making your own sugaring syrup available on the Web.

===Epilator===

[[Image:Epileertoestel dichtbij.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Epilator]]

===Tweezers===

[[Image:Tweezers.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tweezers]]

Although painful and time consuming, tweezers offer the most precision of any method of hair removal. Tweezing is less painful when the hair is being plucked from skin that sits right on top of bone, and is therefore used most frequently on the eyebrows. Tweezing presents several advantages to shaving, most importantly the reduced chance of painful and unsightly ingrown hairs. Since tweezing removes the hair completely from the follicle, rather than just cutting it off at the surface of the skin, the new hair that grows out is thinner and less likely to catch on the skin.

====Automatic tweezer====

==Burning==
===Laser===

Laser hair removal is supposed to be permanent but is very expensive and requires multiple sessions over several months to achieve good results.

There are several different types of lasers used for hair removal purposes depending on the machine that is used. But regardless of the method, laser hair removal treatments are not always permanent. However it is generally accepted that for certain skin tones and hair color, there is a noticeable hair reduction.

====Pulsed light (IPL)==== 
Pulsed light does not use a laser light source. Instead, it produces a pulse of high intensity light. There are a few advantages to this method. Owing to the broader range of wavelengths (colors) produced, a broader range of skin tones can be treated. The area covered is also larger, so treatments tend to be faster. With these advantages the treatments cost less.

This section introduces techniques for shaving different body parts. For shaving the beard with a safety razor, see [http://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2006/07/10/a-guide-to-the-gourmet-shaving-experience/ this comprehensive introduction].

===Face===
[[Image:Facial Hair comic.jpg|thumb|''WikiWorld'' comic strip with fun facts about facial hair]]

====Beard====

[[Image:Wheeler.jpg|thumb|right|200px|beard]]

It is generally advised to follow this order when shaving:
#Get face wet with warm water.  Right after a shower is best.  Do not use water that is too hot, as this can hurt your skin. 
#Apply shaving cream or gel.  Rub a liberal amount on your face to prevent it from drying (although too much can cause your razor to become clogged).
#Shave your cheeks and neck first and chin last. The hair on your chin is thicker and leaving the shaving lotion on for longer will soften it.
#Shave down on your face and up on your neck{{fact}} (but see below regarding ingrown hair).  It may take a while for your hair to get used to this, but it reduces razor burn and makes shaving much easier in the long run.
#It is recommended to wash with cold water to close the pores and reduce potential for infection.
#If you have curly facial hair, use a lotion-based aftershave so as to reduce ingrown hairs.

'''An alternative approach is recommended for those with sensitive skin, and those prone to razor burn and ingrown hairs:'''
#'''Wet face with warm water.''' Your goal before the blade touches your face is to soften the beard. Some prefer to place a hot towel to on their beard for 30 seconds prior to applying shaving lotion. Others shave right after a shower.  Use whatever technique works best for you.
#'''Massage gel or cream into your beard.''' Spending a minute or longer doing this will help soften your beard, and give you a more comfortable shave. A bristle brush is a great investment, since it helps lift hairs away from your skin, and exfoliates. Warm the brush with water, and apply gel. Apply to face for a minute or two.
#'''Shave in the direction that your hairs grow.''' Do not shave against the grain - this will hurt your face, and is more likely to give you ingrown hairs.
#'''Rinse with tepid water''' that is not warm and not cold. Rinsing with water that is too cold will close the pores too soon, collapsing on freshly cut hairs. if it's too warm, you'll leave the pores open longer, allowing follicles to move around.
#'''Apply a mild aftershave lotion''' that doesn't have much alcohol content in it.

=====Shaping=====
One method which has been found useful in creating a well-shaped beard:
# Choose a basic shape (see [[wikipedia:beards#Beard_styles|beard styles]]).
# Comb hair against grain - to try and stand it up from the face.
# Outline the boundary with an [[wikipedia:Shaving#Shaving_aids|electric trimmer]] (without spacing attachment)- cutting at right angles to skin.
# Choose a thickness for your beard and set the trimmer to this depth.
# Trim body of beard.
# Shave away any non-beard hair - taking care to keep the basic outline.
# Comb beard to lie it flat against the skin.
# Take off trimmer spacer
# Use electric trimmer to round off (or shape) edges of the beard.

Note:
* it's often useful to lift the chin and define a horizontal line below the chin to help avoid the undercurl of hair when the beard grows out (or to help hide that chubby chin).

====Mustache====

It is important to shave this region with care. The mustache (''International English'': moustache) area has thinner skin, and thus is more sensitive to nicks and cuts. Make sure not to cut your lips - you don't want to risk an infection.

====Sideburns====

[[Image:Sidewhiskers (PSF).png|thumb|200px|right|side whiskers]]

Sideburns are possibly the easiest part of the face to shave; some find it best to shave there first.  Make sure that your face is looking directly at the mirror, so that you can get an even look at how high you are cutting your sideburns. It sometimes helps to line the cut up with a part of your ear.  (Note: Considering that many people’s ears are in fact not lined up on their face, it may be better to measure your sideburns against your nose to attain a truly even cut.)  An old trick used by many barbers is to put the tip of an index finger under the edge of each sideburn, and to point towards your face and lift your elbows.  You might look silly, but the contrast of finger height helps you judge whether your sideburns are even or not...(and you'd rather look a tad silly in private than be publicly embarrassed by uneven facial hair, right?)

====Eyebrows====
One can use a shaving machine and outline it first, after that you can use a straight edge to define it. Waxing may be a better alternative.

====Nose hair====
A nose hair trimmer is highly recommended to trim nose hair. They're usually quite cheap, and they are very effective. It is a lot easier and safer than using scissors!

===Legs===

To shave your legs effectively and safely it is important to have (if using a safety blade) a relatively new, and sharp razor, to prevent the likelihood of nicks, scrapes and infection and to get the legs wet, and reasonably slippery. Recommend using shaving gel/cream, soap or shampoo and sitting down while shaving, on a chair, or in a bath.

#Lather up the legs so that a sheen of soap covers them. 
#Then, starting at the ankle using a small amount of pressure applied with the forefinger shave vertically up to the knee.(This should leave a line of shaved skin, scraping off the soap as well as shaving off the hair. 
#Move to one side of this stripe, and repeat step 2, until the entire calf has been shaved. Be careful around the ankle and the shin, which are bony and more vulnerable to cuts.Also remember to every so often rinse the razor to rid it of excess hair. 
#While shaving the knee be especially cautious and careful, this is a bony area, and make sure to double check that all hair on the knee has been removed.
#Shave the upper leg, from knee to butt, in the same vertical motion and method as before, making sure the back of the thigh is fully shaved.

===Armpits===

[[Image:Armpit by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|right|armpit hair]]

Armpit skin is extra soft and sensitive.

While most body parts have hair that grows in a single direction, the armpit is often covered by multi-directional growth.  For the smoothest shave draw the razor in both horizontal and vertical paths.

===Buttocks===
With a safety razor, squat on floor and shave from inside going out. Use soap as lubricant. Do not shave the area near the anus, as it may cause uncomfortable rashes: waxing is a more appropriate choice for the removal of unsightly anal fuzz. (Avoid hot wax, as it may cause anal burn.)

===Back===
Be gentle on the back. It's surprisingly sensitive to shaving. It may be difficult to shave the area of the upper back by yourself. If you can't get into a reciprocal agreement (shave my back and I'll shave your back, or I'll do the laundry if you shave my back), you may want to consider using the Razorba, essentially a razor on a stick. After some trial and error, you'll find it does get those hard to reach areas.

[[Image:Chest hair growth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|male chest hair growth]]

===Chest===

===Genitals===
Use great care when shaving genital areas. Itching will likely occur once the hair begins growing back, so consider waxing the area as an alternative. Using electric trimmers on a low length setting will yield similar aesthetic and tactile results with greater ease and with less itching.

The shaving should be done slowly and gradually. There is no need to rush it. Move the blade slowly and don't attempt to shave extremely close on the first time. Begin with just a close trim, the next time shave the periphery, continuing to remove more over the course of weeks. As with any other part of the body, shaving along the direction of hair growth gives a shave which is not quite as close but which is exponentially less likely to cause rashes, cuts, or ingrown hair. Generally it is advised to shave along the direction of growth several times before attempting the closer against-the-grain cut.

As with all shaving, the skin will become desensitized with repeated shaving, so perseverance will eventually improve the results.

Contrary to some assumptions, shaving the genitals is not likely to make them cooler during the hotter months. Rather, it can actually itch and be more uncomfortable.

====Male====



Start with a sharp blade that is very unlikely to slip out of your hands. Different parts of the genitals react differently to being shaved. As previously mentioned, it is suggested to shave only with the direction of the hair. Shaving against the grain causes pimples, red spots (burns) and itches when regrowing. To get a closer shave, go across the grain and angled downwards slightly.

Shaving in the shower offers privacy and easy clean-up. Shaving needs to be repeated every 4-7 days depending on comfort and speed of the regrowth. If your shower ever becomes clogged from a build-up of hair call a plumber, or use liquid plumber chemicals to unclog the drain.

If it is the first time attempting pubic shaving or the hair is longer, before beginning with the razor, trim the length of hair with scissors. Doing so avoids clogging the razor and unnecessary pulling of the hair. Standing in the shower with the water not spraying directly on the body (angle it towards the wall), lather the areas to be shaved. Shaving cream provides lather required and holds up better than gel. I have found that using hair conditioner works fabulously and I can achieve a closer shave with it. Don't press as hard or be as aggressive if using conditioner because it makes your skin softer as well which makes it easier to cut if using too much pressure.

Skin in these areas can be rather loose. Where you encounter loose skin, use one hand to pull the skin taut and the other hand to shave. Keep the lather on hand as it will likely wash away during the process. Be careful not to shave without lather as a lubricant. 

As the testicles, penis and abdomen are all quite different in shape, pulling the skin taunt and holding the penis in the right position varies on which area is being shaved. Generally, either the penis must be pulled up towards the belly button when shaving the shaft or the skin must be controlled in some way. How far up the abdomen to shave is a matter of personal preference, with some shaving just from the level of the shaft and below and others shaving the entire area to the umbilicus (&quot;belly button&quot;).

Once shaved it can take several months for the hair to grow back. It does not grow back any thicker than it was before, as some believe. When growing back, it may appear to be growing back more thickly, but this is an illusion because all the hair is growing back at the same length instead of at staggered lengths.

Despite recommendations to use a very sharp blade, some prefer to use a slightly used multi-blade razor. New razors may tend to leave cuts due to the irregular shape of the skin over the genitals. Some shave against the grain when shaving the shaft of the penis as it is easy to pull the penis up in one direction and the razor down in the other.

Alternatives to shaving include using a non-electric nose-hair trimmer, though the process is time consuming and yields a different look than shaving.


[[Image:Poilspubiens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|female pubic hair]]

====Female====
Please be careful.

===Head===
Start by removing long hair using electric hair clippers.  If this is your first time actually seeing your scalp in a while, be sure to use both a hand mirror and your fingers to check for moles, scars and bumps of which you may not be aware- you will need to navigate these areas carefully in the next steps to avoid cuts.

Wet the remaining stubble to soften it, then shave using a safety razor, preferably a double or triple-bladed one.  Use shaving cream or soap for lubricant.  

Shave by starting in the middle at the front, and take a swathe all the way to the bottom at the back. If you have
not shaved before or for several days this may have to be done in stages. Next, move to one side by half the width of the razor and repeat, until the swathe at the side is just above ear-level. Be careful shaving around your ears. At this stage you have shaved your entire head, except for the upper part of your side-burns. Shave those by shaving from your ear in a forward direction. If this is the first time you have shaved your head then stop here for a day to give the skin a rest, and redo this part before continuing the next part. 

With practice you can do all that with barely a look in the mirror. Speaking of mirrors, it's not worth the hassle of trying to see the back of your head. It takes too much time to set the mirrors up and learn to use them, and you'll get more cuts trying than if you do without. It's much easier to place the fingertips of your non-razor-holding-hand on the back of your head (out of the way of the blade of course!) - you will find it far simpler to navigate the razor whilst not being able to see it. The first few times get a friend to check if you've missed any patches. The following procedure will enable you be confident that you have not missed any spots.

Shave your entire head using upward strokes. Start just behind one ear at the hair-line and shave upward until you reach the middle of your head. Move the razor toward the back by half the width of the razor and repeat, until you have shaved right around the back of your head to the back of your other ear. Now, carefully, shave upward from each ear. The best technique is to slide the razor down your head, with the razor head in contact but the blades angled away until you reach the top of your ear, then bring the blades into contact with your scalp. This enables you catch the pesky little hairs right by your ear, without making cuts! Every other technique causes cuts, sooner or later.

Now shave around your head, taking horizontal strokes. Start above your ear (right near your crown) and shave around the back of your head and all the way to the front. Move the razor down by half the width of the razor and repeat, until you have shaved right down to your ears. Continue, half a razor-width at a time, from the back of one ear to the back of the other, until you're at collar level. Now repeat in the other direction, from the other ear.

Now, you're finally finished! You have shaved the back of your head in four directions, half a razor width at a time. There cannot be a single whisker left! With a little practice you can do the whole job without using a mirror, in three minutes or less.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Legs.jpg|thumb|300px|right|shaved legs]]

===Lotions===
Apply lotion after shaving for smoother skin!

===Cleaning up===
====Body====
It's best to use cold water to clean up the skin after shaving, as this closes the pores.

====Equipment====
[[Image:Wasserhahn.jpg|thumb|high pressure water]]
Rinse off your blade in water (unless you're using an electric shaver). Dry and oil the blade. Drying and oiling blades will reduce dulling of the blade from oxidation of the edge. Even a cheap disposable razor may shave comfortably for months if the blade is dried and oiled after each use. Surprisingly, a quality straight razor, dried and oiled after each use and occasionally stropped, can go many years before needing sharpening. A safe oil like food grade mineral oil or Vaseline should be used rather than vegetable oil, which may corrode the blade, or machine lubricating oil, which may be toxic.

If any hairs remain tangled in the blades be very careful about removing them. Do not try to pick out hairs from a safety razor with your fingers, this is unsafe and you can cut your fingertips trying. Try to blast out any hairs with high pressure water. If this doesn't work, you can typically use a small cleaning brush, toothpick, or even tweezers to remove hairs from a safety razor.

====Place====
Wash hair down the drain, or wipe up with a towel. If you shave in the shower, clean the hair out of the drain after every time you shower. Leaving it there can eventually result in a clogged drain.

===Healing===
This chapter is on healing from shaving errors.
====Razor burns====

Most people will experience razor burns at some point for various reasons. There are several ways to reduce your chance of getting a severe inflammation. Start by always using a clean and relatively sharp razor and never use old or rusty razors. This will reduce your chance of getting an infection if you get cut, and make it less likely you will need to go over the same area of skin more than once. When rinsing a blade never use hot water; tepid water, a little cooler than what you would find comfortable for washing your hands is best. Shave the face with the grain and against on the neck, other body parts may be better with one or the other. When you are done rinse off any excess soap cream or hair with tepid water before a final rise with cold water. Dry your face immediately with a clean dry towel. If you have sensitive skin you may want to consider this when purchasing shaving cream or soap as well as using a lotion or lotion based aftershave. Some people have extremely sensitive skin that is irritated merely by the act of shaving, if so you should try to only shave every other day or less if necessary. It is also important to note that if you have not shaved in a while or do not shave often your skin will be more sensitive.

(see [[Wikipedia:Folliculitis|Folliculitis]])

====Cuts====
Even though most razor cuts are small in size, they tend to bleed profusely. They are usually quite easy to treat because most shaving takes place in a bathroom where medical supplies are present.  A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styptic styptic pencil] or block (aluminum sulfate) can be used to stop bleeding from razor cuts.  This inexpensive product is available at any drugstore.

Running cold water or placing ice over the wound usually closes it up quickly as well. An old trick that might look tacky but effective, is using a small piece of cigarette paper (the type that is sold separately and used to roll self-made cigarettes). You can also use a band-aid with a dab of polysporin.

====&quot;Tickling&quot;====
Very mild cuts may be treated by applying pressure for a brief period or lightly blotting (&quot;tickling&quot;) away the blood with (clean) fingers until they clot on their own.

      <comment>/* Cosmology and Black Holes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A Black Hole is a theoretical object in physics in which gravity's pull is so strong that nothing can escape. The idea of a black hole comes from the idea that there is a universal speed limit, the speed of light. This creates an anomaly which we call an event horizon.



== Event Horizon and the Schwarzchild Radius ==
The event horizon is essentially the skin of a black hole. It is the barrier between the inside and the outside of a black hole. When you are outside the black hole you are outside of the event horizon. You still have the ability to communicate with the rest of the universe, although your communications might be severely redshifted due to gravitational effects. Anything that crosses the event horizon may never escape. So you may be asking yourself right now how this event horizon arises and how do we determine where it is? The answer is, we calculate its Schwarzchild Radius.
The Schwarzchild Radius was discovered in 1916 by Karl Schwarzchild. This was based off of the idea of a univeral speed limit and  energy conservation. So lets do a non-relativistic derivation.

First we start with an equation of the total energy of a system. 

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}m_{1} v^2 - G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of some arbitrary object, v is its velocity, G is the gravitational constant. &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the massive object which will be our black hole, and r is the radius from the center of our black hole object. So we will now maximize the kinetic energy of &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; by setting its speed equal to the speed of light. So:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}m_{1} c^2 - G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

As long as the objects total energy is positive it can escape from the black hole and not get caught in its event horizon. So what we can say is that if the energy of an object is less than or equal to zero then it is caught with in the event horizion. In other words:

&lt;math&gt; E \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Which gives: 

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}m_{1} c^2 - G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r_s} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Now solve for r:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}m_{1} c^2 \leq G \frac{m_1 M_2}{r_s} &lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt; m_1&lt;/math&gt;'s cancel.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} c^2 \leq G \frac{M_2}{r_s} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r_s \leq G \frac{2 M_2}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;


So as long as the radius is less than the value on the right then you are with in the limits of the black hole.

== Cosmology and Black Holes ==

One question that physicists like to ask about astronomical discoveries is, what do these discoveries tell us about the nature of the universe? In specific, cosmologist want to know whether the universe is open or closed and growing or shrinking. Well the Schwarzchild radius has a little bit of something to say about this. Keep in mind that although this result is interesting it is not a final answer. It turns out that with some estimates of the mass of the universe and assuming a uniform density throughout the universe and the radius of the universe as determined by the Hubble constant, the universe may meet the Schwarzchild Radius requirements and have the critical density for being a black hole. But as any cosmologist will tell you the data's uncertainty is too large for scientists to decide one way or another what the true answer is.
Black holes are one of the most important thing in the entire history of the univefrse because they have shaped the universe in the way it is.

== Detection of Black Holes ==

The main problem with black holes is that they cannot be detected directly. We cannot see them. As a result Astronomers and Astrophysicists look for their effects. There are a few things that can be looked for. 

First is an object orbiting around nothing very rapidly, as can be determined from relativistic calculations of centripetal forces. These can also be used to give estimates of the size and mass of a black hole.

The second thing scientists look for is accretion disks. These are disks of matter formed when the black hole is sucking mass and particles off of a near by object. The particles gain so much energy and heat that they begin to heat  and radiate light. This can then be used to determine numerous things about the entire system. Often times the accretion disk is formed by the orbiting stars. 

The third, and probably the less prevalent method involves measuring periodic X-Ray emmisions.

== Theoretical problems with Black Holes ==

As popular belief may attest to, it turns out that black holes actually do present some theoretical problems for physics. One of the most major of all problems is energy borrowing. In physics, for some reactions to happen, some energy must be &quot;borrowed&quot; from the universe to create a specific particle. This will generally create 2 particles, the needed particle and its paired partner particle. For example a tau particle and a tau neutrino. Now say that this occurs right at the edge of the event horizon of a black hole and one particle gets sucked in while the other does not. The particles cannot recombine and annihilate back into energy. Now say that this happens indefinitely. What we can get is an infinite energy leak in the universe and an infinite mass increase within the black hole. This is a problem which must be explained by physicists.

== Recent Discoveries about Black Holes ==

Here some recent discoveries will be mentioned but not explained. 

Black Holes may not have smooth surfaces

There may be microscopic black holes all over the place.

== Myths About Black Holes == 

During numerous particle accelerator openings there have been numerous protests, because protesters are afraid that using the particle accelerator will create massive black holes that will swallow the world. These people believe this due to the amount of energy created during these events. Contrary to their belief this will not happen. You must have incredibly massive objects confined to a very small space to create a black hole. Infact to turn the Earth into a black hole you would have to shrink its radius to about 20 mm.

Renting accommodation in the UK can be great, but it can also be a nightmare if you don't do your homework. The aim of this guide is give new and also seasoned renters a comprehensive source of information to help them with everything from the questions to ask a landlord, to ensuring that they keep their deposit money. Many of the problems and pitfalls of renting can be avoided if the correct questions are asked early on in the process. This guide will try to use the wealth of experience built up by many current UK renters, to create a reasonable list of questions to ask, and things to look for when inspecting a potential property.


'''&lt;u&gt;General Note:&lt;/u&gt; Don't think you ''must'' adhere to everything in this guide to have a successful tenancy. It is likely that if you try and go through every single point, you will end up never renting a property! Just use your common sense and pick out the suggestions that are most important to you. If you are well prepared, and ask the right questions at the right time, then you are less likely to have problems along the way.'''


'''&lt;u&gt;Note added June 2008:&lt;/u&gt; In the uncertain financial climate of the &quot;credit crunch&quot;, some regions are affected differently from others. In some locations rental costs are rising due to increased demand, however in certain cites an excess of newly built flats means there are more properties than potential tenants, so renters should bargain hard for good deal. You need to understand what the market is like where you live, and then take this into account when considering some of the suggestions in this guide. For example, if demand for rented properties is high where you live and you make life too hard for your prospective landlord or letting agent, then they may decide to rent the property to someone  who is easier to deal with.'''



== A) Some ideas on what to ask the Landlord or Letting Agent BEFORE parting with any cash ==

'''Questions relevant to both a landlord (LL) or a letting agent (LA)'''

1. Ask what deposit protection scheme your deposit will be held in.

2. It is important to check that your potential LL has the permission of their mortgage lender to let out the property. This is important because if the mortgage lender repossess the property, and they didn't give the LL permission to let, then the tenant can be made homeless immediately. However if the lender did give the LL permission to let, then they will honour the terms of the rental agreement - meaning the tenant will not lose any rent they have paid up front, and they will have time to look for new rental property. If you are not able to ask the LL/LA, then for £3 you can download the property documents from Land Registry Online - this will show the mortgage lender. If the mortgage lender has the landlord down as living in the property then they probably don’t have their lenders permission to let. You can also write to the mortgage lender and ask them directly.

3. Ask the LL/LA if the property is insured for tenants.

4. Find out how long they have been a LL/LA. This will show their level of experience.

5. Ask how many properties they have got. Again this will give an indication of their experience in the rental market.

6. Find out if they are accredited with the local council private sector housing department.

7. If you are applying for a local authority bond in place of a deposit, check that this is acceptable to the LL/LA.

8. Ask how the inventory check will be handled on the first day of your tenancy. Ideally the LL/LA will be able to hand over the keys in person, and then go through the inventory with you. You can then note down discrepancies and get both of your signatures on the completed documents. Then there can be no argument on the state of the property and its furnishings at the start of the tenancy. If in doubt take photos and then get the LL/LA to sign and date them as representative of the condition of an object. (Note: an inventory check is still important for an unfurnished property as the condition of carpets, curtains, white goods, surfaces etc need to be noted down).

9. Ask how the inventory check will be handled at the end of your tenancy. Again ideally this will be a repeat of what is described above, with you and the LL/LA going through the inventory and checking each item against its stated condition at the start of the tenancy - remember you are allowed fair wear and tear. Some LA have a policy of sending in a &quot;professional cleaner&quot; to ensure that the property is in a fit state for the next tenant, and some try and make it hard or impossible for you to attend this check out process.

10. With regard to cleaning, ask if the LL/LA will allow you to clean the property yourself, as some may have a policy of only allowing a professional cleaner to do the job, regardless of if you have cleaned or not.

'''Questions more specific to a potential private landlord (LL)'''

1. Ask if the LL can supply any references from previous tenants (if they are a good LL they should have no problem with this). An alternative would be to try and talk to the current tenants, and ask their views on the landlord. If you are still having trouble finding anything out, or if the property is currently empty, you could try asking the neighbours if the previous tenants made any comments about the landlord.

2. Ask if the LL is a member of a professional body such as the National Landlords Association. If they are then there is more chance that they will do things &quot;by the book&quot;.

3. Ask if the LL will require you to pay any fees for a credit check or similar. Ask (to save money) if they would be satisfied by looking through your recent bank statements.

4. Ask if the LL will want to regularly come round and inspect the property, and how much notice you would like them to give you for this. Legally they have to give you 24 hours notice, and if it is not convenient for you, you can refuse.

'''Questions more specific to a potential letting agency (LA)'''

1. Ask if the LA is a member of a professional body such as ARLA. Again if there are, there is more chance of things being done properly and by the book.

2. Ask what fees you will be expected to pay up front, before you move in. These can consist of some or all of the following: Application fee/holding fee, credit check fee, inventory check fee, tenancy agreement fee, and maybe even a random &quot;admin&quot; fee. Ask for a breakdown of the fees, especially if a credit check is involved. Ask if the remainder of the fees will be refunded if you fail the credit check. Ask if there will be any inventory checking fees when you move out of the property, and whether this is covered by the inventory checking fee when you move in.

3. Ask what the LA policy is on regular inspections, how often they will be coming round to inspect, and what time of day they usually do it (If you are not comfortable with the LA coming into your home when you are out, then a LA that only inspects 9-5 on work days may be a problem for you).

4. If the tenancy is for a fixed term, then ask what the policy is on renewing the tenancy agreement, and if there are any fees associated with this. Ask if the LA would consider allowing your tenancy agreement to become a &quot;periodic agreement&quot;, at the end of your fixed term. This means the terms of your AST remain the same, and you can live in your property for as long as you wish without having to constantly renew your tenancy agreement. From another viewpoint, you do not have the same security of tenure with a periodic tenancy, as you could in theory be given 2 months notice to leave. If you prefer the security of a longer &quot;contracted&quot; period of tenancy then sign a new AST, and you will be safe in your home for the period of the agreement.

'''Before signing anything'''

1. Don't sign a tenancy agreement without reading everything carefully, including all correspondence and the full text of the agreement. If there is something you don’t agree with in the agreement, ask if it can be removed.

2. If you are unsure about anything in the tenancy agreement, then ask for copies and get legal advice or take it to your local CAB (Citizen Advice Bureau).

3. Take care if you are issued with a &quot;Section 21&quot; notice at the very beginning of your tenancy. The S21 is a legal document issued by the LL/LA which gives tenants two months notice that they must vacate the property, and is usually used near the end of a tenancy. However if one is issued at the start of a tenancy, then in theory the landlord does not need to give two months notice to evict tenants at the end of the fixed term rental period.

'''''If you have asked all the questions which are relevant to you, and are happy to go along with the answers, then there is nothing stopping you from renting through your desired LL/LA.'''''

== B) &quot;False deposit fraud&quot; when trying to secure a property from a distance ==

There are many reasons why someone might have to sort out a rental property without being able to physically inspect the location, or meet the landlord beforehand. Obvious examples are international students needing somewhere to stay as soon as they arrive in the country, or people needing to quickly move somewhere a long distance from their current location. Whatever the reason, these tenants need to be aware of the &quot;False deposit&quot; scam.

This scam involves a fraudster taking a deposit or other payments, for a property which is totally fictitious. When the tenant arrives at their new home and realises it does not exist, the fraudster is long gone, along with their money.

To avoid this kind of scam:

1. Check that the price of the rental is realistic for the area to which you are moving. Research rental prices for properties near to the one you are interested in. If there is a huge difference, this could indicate a scam.

2. Try and find out as much information as possible from the potential LL/LA about the house and the local area. Then try and verify this information, for example through contact with your academic institution or place of work.

3. Always try and contact the LL/LA by phone if possible, a UK landline number will give you confidence that they are legitimate.

4. Question why the LL/LA requires a deposit or fee up front. Some will be happy to take a deposit when you arrive at the property and they hand over the keys.

5. If you need to send money, make sure you use a reputable escrow agent. Avoid using Western Union or MoneyGram (the favourite of many fraudsters) as money send via these services is not secure, and not traceable.

== C) Simple things to remember when viewing a property ==

1. Take someone with you. It is amazing how another pair of eyes can see thing differently, or spot things that you missed.

2. If it has a gas supply, ask to see the gas safety certificate for the property, and confirm that it is renewed yearly. Also check carefully for any small red warning stickers stuck on gas appliances, this could mean there have been gas problems in the past.

3. Try and pay attention to the structure of the property rather than just the aesthetics. For example, beware of things like a leaking roof, rotten windows, draughts, damp etc. This will become less important after October if the proposed Energy Performance Certificates come into force for new tenancies. Things like lack of double glazing can also impact on the cost of utilities. (Some) landlords will cover up damp issues with a lick of paint so looking inside cupboards/wardrobes can often reveal the tell tale signs. Also opening kitchen cupboards, opening windows, looking at the boiler to determine it's age and whether it looks like it is on it's last legs (though not always easy to tell) will show the general state of repair of the property.

4. If it is important to you, check that you can get television reception in the property, or if it has cable or a satellite dish. If you can't receive terrestrial television through an aerial, then cable or satellite TV may be your only option.

5. Check that the speed and availability of broadband in the area is adequate for your internet requirements.

6. Ensure that you have reception on your mobile phone in all areas of the property.

7. Simple things like not having enough electrical sockets could become annoying, so it makes sense to check.

8. As of October 2008, every landlord will be required to provide an energy efficiency certificate (EPC) for each property they rent out for any NEW tenancies they grant. The EPC should be made available to the prospective tenant BEFORE any agreement is signed. It should be available for any prospective tenant to view before deciding to move in, so that they can compare similar properties. It will address things like how much it costs to heat the house, loft insulation, double glazing, boiler age, efficiency etc. It will give the house a rating like you get on fridges A, B, C etc. It will be valid for 10 years.

== D) Moving in ==

1. Make sure you and the LL/LA both note down the gas and electricity meter readings, and you find out what companies the previous tenant was using for all their utilities.

2. Go through every item in the inventory and note down its condition. If it’s not on the inventory, then there is no proof of its condition before the tenancy and you could argue that a small inventory is an advantage for the tenant. However in reality, a good inventory can solve many petty disputes that can arise at the end of a tenancy agreement. If you see damage to a fixture or furniture then make sure you note it down and get the LL/LA to sign in agreement.

3. It is a good idea to take pictures of the fixtures and fittings, in the state they were in when you moved in. Although these may not be legally binding, they could certainly help refresh both yours and the LL/LAs memory if there is an argument over deposit deductions when you come to move out of the property.

4. If the property is not being managed by a Letting Agent, then ask the LL for a list of his &quot;handy helpers&quot; that you can call if there is an emergency especially plumbing. Obviously, only to be used if you can't reach the LL because he is away on vacation.

5. Ask the LL/LA for the user manuals for appliances and heating, and learn the correct way to turn on the heating and hot water. There have been instances of tenants being accused of breaking appliances or the heating as they didn't know how to use them properly, and been given a large repair bill. By asking for clear instructions and by sticking to them, you reduce the chance of this happening.

== E) During your tenancy ==

To avoid deposit deduction disputes when you leave:

1. If you break anything in the property or something is broken by someone else (e.g. a repairman) and it can't be easily repaired by yourself, then notify the LL/LA as soon as possible - an email with photo attached will be useful. Try and sort out the repair during your tenancy. If you can't, then having written proof that you contacted the LL/LA, will mean no surprises on either side, when it comes to the final inspection on the day you move out.

2. Particularly if you rent through a LA, if you agree a change to the tenancy agreement - like having pets, wanting to put up pictures or painting a room, make sure you have some record in writing that the LL/LA has agreed for you to do this.

== F) Moving out ==

1. Ensure that you inform all of your utility suppliers (gas/electricity/phone etc) of your intended date of departure, and give them a forwarding address so they can send you a final bill. Take final gas and electricity meter readings on the last day of your tenancy.

2. All good tenants will have cleaned and tidied the property, and returned it to the same state it was in when you moved in (apart from fair wear and tear of course!). However, if despite your best efforts, the LL/LA refuses to allow you to be present during their &quot;check out&quot; (final cleanliness inspection and inventory check) process, then it makes sense to take a few pictures of the clean and tidy house before you leave, just so you have some evidence of how you left the property.

3. If you are renting with a private LL, and they attend the check out process with you, then try and come to an agreement there and then about any deductions from the deposit that the landlord feels are necessary. Hopefully there will be no deductions, but if there are, a quick verbal agreement means you will be able to get your deposit back much faster than if you have a protracted disagreement about deposit deductions via phone or by letter.

4. If you are renting through a LA, and they do not allow you to be present at the check out process, then you will be waiting for them to present you with a final inspection report, including any deposit deductions they think are necessary. It is very hard to argue with this report, especially if it appears weeks or months after you moved out, which is why it is key to try and attend the check out process with the LA.

5. When you return the keys, get the LL/LA to sign for receipt of all the keys. This way there can be no arguments about if/when keys were properly returned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|ErlyWeb|The Erlang Twist on Web Frameworks}}

Erlyweb is an open-source web application framework written in [[Erlang Programming|Erlang]] and released under the [[w:GPL|GPL]]. ErlyWeb was created by Yariv Sadan. It builds upon Yariv's earlier modules that he created for Erlang: Smerl (Simple Metaprogramming for Erlang), ErlyDB (a database abstraction layer for Erlang), and ErlTL (a templating language that compiles to Erlang). 

The code is available at [http://code.google.com/p/erlyweb Google Code].

Currently, several sites have been built using ErlyWeb: 

* [http://beerriot.com BeerRiot] - a community site for reviewing beers.
* [http://vimagi.com Vimagi] - a community site for painting. Uses comet so that people can paint on the same canvas at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before ErlyWeb there were already a lot of web application frameworks. Why do we need another one? Almost every other modern framework is written in a scripting language or compiled language that has drastically different characteristics from Erlang. 

The benefits that come from being implemented in Erlang are what help set ErlyWeb apart from other web application frameworks.

==Characteristics of Erlang==

* a functional language with little shared state
* highly reliable
* distributed
* extremely lightweight processes
* message passing primitives

Erlang was designed to work this way because the problem domain that it was originally designed to work with, phone switches, requires them. The remarkable thing is, 20 years later, we are finding that building scalable websites would be made easier if we used a language with these characteristics.

Facebook - uses mochiweb, a lightweight webserver written in Erlang to allow over 70 million users chat with each other in real-time.

if your only reason for thinking an article is a &quot;mistake&quot; is brevity and stub-status. please refrain from tagging it as it discourages activity. Let it sit for at least a year if the book has/had only one editor or is inactive. I might not get the time to finish this right away, but we're only talking about a few kb.

== Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes ==

I don't think it is correct to say that prokaryotes are &quot;now referred to as bacteria&quot;. 

Both bacteria and archaea have prokaryotic cells. Since archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria, this means that the prokaryotes are not a monophyletic group of organisms. 'Prokaryote' is a descriptive term referring to a certain type of cell (small, no membrane-bound organelles) and not an actual family of organisms.</text>

In Norse mythology there is a story about Loki, the god of mischief and strife: In order to escape punishment by the other gods for trying to trick the blind god Hod into killing Baldur, the god of beauty and light, Loki jumped into a river and transformed himself into a salmon. The other gods tried to catch him in a net. As Loki was trying to escape by leaping over the net, Thor grabbed him by the tail. This is why the salmon's tail is tapered today.

The fish with the tapered tail lives an interesting life. Born in fresh water, it migrates to the ocean and returns to fresh water to reproduce. It is said that later in their lives, salmon return to exactly the same spot where they were born. This could be the reason why the salmon tastes so fancy - this interesting lifestyle may have an effect on the flavor of the fish. And if you want your salmon dish to taste even more intense, use smoked salmon instead of fresh.

Salmon has a very distinctive taste. Consequently, the perfect dish requires the perfect ingredients to accompany it so as not to displace its taste. The perfect herb for a delicious salmon dish is dill. Its soft and delicate flavor balances the rather prominent taste of the salmon. Dill is not simply a herb; it is believed by some to have magic power. Roman gladiators are said to have anointed themselves with dill oil before their fights. Superstitious people believe that a bunch of dill hung above the doorway to one's house wards off evil spirits. In England it is said that dill protects from bedevilment, as is revealed in the saying: ''&quot;Vervain and dill hinder witches from their will.&quot;''

To give the dish an extravagant touch, add horseradish. There are also some tales about horseradish. It is said that a slice of horseradish put into the wallet, prevents the wallet from ever being empty again. Well, I am not so sure about that, but maybe it is worth a try!

But one thing is sure: salmon, dill, and horseradish - these three ingredients are going to work their magic on your guests! And I have noticed that even people who were not enthusiastic about salmon really loved this dish.

'''Salmon spaghetti'''

In case you are wondering how a salmon dish found its way into the Austrian cuisine section, don't worry: Austria has not conquered any of its neighboring countries. It is still in the heart of the European continent and saltwater fish still live far away. The only reason for the &quot;poor&quot; salmon finding itself on this page is me loving its taste! I've tried out various recipes with salmon and here is my favorite one:

==Ingredients==
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 250g salmon, smoked or fresh, chopped
* 1/2 cup (125 ml) white wine	
* 1 cup (250 ml) cream
* 1 tbsp. crème frêche
* 1 tbsp. fresh dill, chopped
* 1 tsp. horseradish, freshly grated 
* a pinch of black pepper, freshly ground
* a pinch of salt
* 9 oz (250g) spaghetti

==Procedure==

# Heat the oil in a large frying pan and gently sauté the onion for about two minutes until glassy.
# Put the salmon into the pan and cook for another three minutes.
# Add the white wine, but be careful! Too much wine causes a distinctly winey taste.
# Wait for about one minute, then add the cream; dissolve the crème frêche and stir in the horseradish.
# Let the sauce simmer until it thickens and absorbs the characteristic taste of the salmon. Add the dill last and season with a pinch of freshly ground black pepper and salt. Be very careful with the salt when using smoked salmon as it already contains a significant amount of salt.
# Put the spaghetti on two serving plates and add the sauce. Garnish the plate with a slice of lemon and some dill leaves. Serve immediately and offer white wine with the dish.

Enjoy your meal!

=='''Holzknechtnocken'''==
'''Lumberjacks’ Dumplings'''

Holzknechtnocken is a traditional dish from Ebensee. Ebensee is located in Upper Austria at the south end of the Traunsee. The town is surrounded by picturesque lakes, namely the Traunsee, the Langbathsee and the Offensee. Ebensee is situated in the heart of the Salzkammergut – one of Austria’s most beautiful regions. In Ebensee the villagers retain a strong attachment to their traditional values, customs and beliefs. There are many customs that are still celebrated every year, for example the Fetzenzug, or the traditional Glöcklerlauf.

Salt was a highly important economic factor in the Salzkammergut in former times. It was mined there and then shipped throughout Europe and made the Salzkammergut a very wealthy area. Since salt mines require an enormous amount of wood, forestry has always played a crucial role in the Salzkammergut. In former times lumberjacks had to stay in the forest for days. What today is often mistakenly regarded as idyllic and romantic was tough work in reality. These hard-working men’s lives were shaped by austerity, a humble lifestyle, and very dangerous labour conditions. Special tools such as saws and axes had to be carried around for hours. Since lumberjacks were working and living in the forest for days, they had to supply themselves with food. Therefore, speck, flour, semolina, lard and other foods to prepare the legendary Holzknechtnocken were stuffed into the lumberjacks’ backpacks . In the evenings the lumberjacks gathered around a wooden table in their huts to have their simple dinner. Everyone had his own ingredients and pan to prepare the food. Hot water was poured over flour and salt to make the dough, which was then kneaded and formed into dumplings. Sometimes semolina was added to the dough to vary the dish. The dumplings were then put into boiling water for about ten minutes. When the dumplings rose to the surface of the water, they were done. Afterwards they were fried in a heavy-bottomed pan with deep sides, which was put directly into the fire of the stove. The special feature of this pan was that it was never ever cleaned with water, but only wiped out with a cloth. Holzknechtnocken was either served with cabbage (sauerkraut), stewed apples or plums. 

'''Holzknechtnocken - plain version'''
* 1 cup (250g) flour
* 1 tbsp salt
* l cup (250ml)boiling water
* Mix flour and salt in a large bowl and add water. Batter until you get a dough. Form dumplings and put them into boiling water. When dumplings rise to the surface of the water, they are done.
* Melt lard in a heavy-bottomed pan with deep sides and fry dumplings until they get a brownish color.
* Serve with sauerkraut or steamed apples.

Today Holzknechtnocken are still very popular at public festivals, and believe it or not, they are even offered in posh restaurants. As you see, you can have Holzknechtnocken as a main dish and also for dessert. I like eating them with fried bacon and sauerkraut, but you could also add fried vegetables. When having Holzknechtnocken for dessert, I serve them with a variety of stewed fruits. In case, the traditional Holzknechtnocken version is too plain for you, here is a very refined version:

'''Scheiterhaufen''' 

==Name==
Why is this dish called '''Scheiterhaufen'''? Translated into English this word would mean something like ''funeral pyre'' or the ''stake'' at which for example witches or heretics were burnt. It seems like a rather strange name for such a delicious sweet. I could not find any official sources for the name, so I came up with two plausible explanations on my own: The name possibly refers to the way the slices of bread and fruit are layered to make this dish, which seems representative of the way in which ancient cultures used to pile up chunks of wood to make a funeral pyre. The name could also refer to the way the dish looks when served, since it tends to fall apart when put on a plate. If you have any other suggestions, feel free to add them!

==History==
'''Scheiterhaufen''' is a traditional sweet dish in Austria and Southern Germany. It was mentioned for the first time in a Roman cookbook in the 1st century AD by Marcus Gravius Apicius. In 1691 it first appeared in a German cookbook under the name ''Gueldene Schnitten'' (golden slices). The term ''Armer Ritter'' (poor knight) was first used in 1787 and had its breakthrough in the 19th century.

==Ingredients==
* 17.5oz (500g) (stale) white bread 
* 2 apples 
* 2 peaches 
* 4 tbsp. (60g) refined sugar 
* 1 pinch ground cinnamon
* 2 cups (1/2l) milk
* 4 eggs
* 4 tsp. (2cl/20ml) rum or a few drops of rum aroma
* 1 tbsp. butter

==Procedure==
# Wash the apples and peaches and peel them if you like, but this is not mandatory. Then cut them into slices approximately a quarter of an inch thick (1 cm, not too thin).
# Next, cut the bread into slices about the same size as the fruit. You can use any kind of white bread that you have on-hand, but for an extra soft '''Scheiterhaufen''', something like the white bread used for toast yields the best result.
# Pour the milk into a bowl and add the eggs. Mix well. Then take the slices of bread and let them soak in the mixture for a few seconds. (This will take longer if you use stale rather than fresh bread.)
# Mix the refined sugar and the cinnamon in a cup or a small bowl.
# As a next step, grease an ovenproof dish. Now layer the slices, bread and fruit alternately. Sprinkle a bit of the sugar-cinnamon mixture on top of every layer. For the best result, start and end with a layer of bread. You can decide whether you want an apple and a peach layer or whether you would like to mix the different kinds of fruit. Last, sprinkle a few flakes of butter on top and put the dish into the oven for 45 min at 180°C/350°F.
# Enjoy!

==Variations==
*As you can see, this recipe is rather a guideline; you can alter it according to your taste and wishes. Generally, there is not only one recipe for '''Scheiterhaufen''' as people in former times were forced to use what they had available.
*You can take any kind of white bread you like, stale or fresh. One variation is to roast the bread in a pan with a bit of butter before layering it. (In this case you would have to pour the milk-egg-rum mixture on top of your layers.) 
*Moreover, you can use other kinds of fruit to suit your taste. However, the traditional Austrian '''Scheiterhaufen''' recipe uses only apples. Plums are also a good choice, but frankly, you can use any fruit of the season. The selection above is a summer variation. 
*Some cooks like to add nuts like almonds or hazelnuts to create a distinctive taste. You can also add raisins; they are often used together with apples in Austrian cuisine.
*In Portugal this dish is eaten on Christmas Eve (''Rabanadas'') and in Spain it is called ''Torrijas'', a traditional sweet dish to celebrate the end of the Lenten season.
*Other names for Austrian and German variations are ''Armer Ritter'', ''Rostiger Ritter'', ''Fotzelschnitten'', ''Semmelschnitten'', ''Kartäuserklöße'', ''Weckschnitten'', ''Gebackener Weck'', ''Pofesen'' or ''Blinder Fisch''.
*There are also international variations and terms. For example this dish is called ''Poor Knights of Windsor'' in England, ''French Toast'' in the USA or ''Grenki'' in Russia. ''Pain Perdu'' is the name of the French version and the Dutch call it ''Wentelteefje''.

==A Typical Austrian Dish==

Guests from abroad always enjoy typical Austrian dishes. One of my favourites to serve are ''Marillenknödel'', which are dumplings filled with apricots. ''Marillenknödel'' are not merely food, but they represent social, cultural, historical and geographical aspects of Austria.

The expression ''Marillenknödel'' is linguistically interesting insofar as the term ''Marille'' is only known in Austria. All other German speaking countries use the expression ''Aprikose'' instead. Having overcome these first comprehension problems, most guests are quite surprised as they would usually expect dumplings to be served as a savoury dish, together with roast pork and Sauerkraut, but not as a dessert.

As to the cultural background of the ''Marillenknödel'', I must briefly refer to Austrian history: In the imperial era Bohemia, which today belongs to the Czech Republic, was part of Austria. Since it was a poor country, many of its inhabitants went to Vienna to find work. Bohemian food was very much appreciated so that women easily found employment as cooks. Sweet dishes such as ''Guglhupf'', ''Germknödel'', ''Topfenstrudel'', ''Powidltascherln'' and, of course, ''Marillenknödel''  belonged to their most famous specialities. Although originally food of the poor, Bohemian dishes very soon became an indispensable part of the Austrian cuisine and even kings are said to have loved them.

Apricots are very delicate fruits which need a mild climate. In Austria the beautiful ''Wachau'', a romantic valley along the river Danube where outstanding wine is cultivated, provides ideal conditions for their growth. In spring, which is the blossoming season of apricot trees, the valley turns white with its flowers and in July there are various festivals throughout the region celebrating the harvest of apricots. One of the most delightful events is the ''Marillenkirtag'' in Spitz, which offers all kinds of apricot products, from ''Mariandl Marillenschnaps'' to ''Marillenmarmelade''. Its undisputed highlight is a ''Marillenknödelautomat'', a small wooden hut where ''Marillenknödel'' are sold. The customer buys a chip, which when thrown into a slot opens a drawer containing a wonderful ''Marillenknödel''. Of course, there are “human cooks” inside the “machine”  who prepare and serve the dumpling.

==How to prepare Marillenknödel==

'''Ingredients''':

* 10 small apricots
* 10 cubes of sugar
* 1 cup of curd cheese
* 1 large egg
* at least 5 tablespoons of flour
* 3 - 4 tablespoons of semolina
* 5 tablespoons of butter (or more if needed)
* salt

* 5 tablespoons of sugar
* 2 cups of breadcrumbs
* cinnamon
* powdered sugar
==Procedure==

#Mix the quark with the egg in a wide bowl and add three or four tablespoons of semolina and a pinch of salt. Wait for about 20 minutes to allow the semolina to soak. Then add as much flour as is necessary to make the dough smooth. In order to form fine dumplings later on, it is very important that the dough is not sticky. Again wait for about 10 minutes.
#In the meantime cut the apricots into two halves. Remove the pips and replace them with a sugar cube. Then put the halves of the apricots together again.
#Pour water and some salt into a big pot and bring it to a boil. 
#Now form the dumplings: divide the dough into ten equal pieces, which you mould into flat, round disks. Flouring your hands will prevent the dough from sticking onto them. #Now wrap each  apricot with one disk of dough. Then roll the dumpling between your hands. Make sure that there are no holes in the dough and that the dough sticks to the apricots. Try to form evenly round dumplings. Don’t worry if this does not work out perfectly the first time you prepare dumplings. The breadcrumbs and the sugar, which the dumplings will be covered with later on, will conceal any irregularities.
#Now, carefully put the dumplings into the boiling water. The water usually ceases to boil for a short while after the dumplings have been placed into the pot. Wait until it boils again and then reduce heat. Let the dumplings boil slowly until they start rising to the surface of the water. Now cover the pot and wait for about another 4 minutes. The dumplings will gain size during this period.
#In the meantime heat butter in a pan, add breadcrumbs with sugar and a bit of ground cinnamon. Fry the breadcrumbs until they turn light brown. Then roll the dumplings in the breadcrumbs until they are covered all over. 
#Serve the Marillenknödel together with the remaining breadcrumbs and coat them with much powdered sugar.

'''Salzburger Nockerl''' is a sweet dish typical of Austrian cuisine that is especially popular in Salzburg, as its name implies.

==My story==

For me, eating is not just a necessary daily routine but a very sensual activity and a feast for the senses. When eating, all senses are activated at once: Your nose is exposed to the delicious smell; your fingers may feel the form and the texture of the food; your eyes cherish the arrangement and the colors of the various ingredients; your ears catch the sound of your biting into the food; and most importantly, your tongue experiences the main part – the taste. But such a culinary delight demands extraordinary recipes, fresh ingredients, and a talented and motivated cook. Unfortunately, I am definitely not a gifted cook, and I never will be, but when it comes to preparing ''Salzburger Nockerl'' I know what I am doing. 

''Salzburger Nockerl'' is a sweet dish typical of Austrian cuisine that is especially popular in Salzburg, as its name implies. I like this dish because of its subtle sweet taste; it is not too sugary but still delights my taste buds whenever I eat it. You can serve it as a main course, as a dessert, or even with coffee and tea. There are hardly any people who do not like it. Until last year I believed that it was not very difficult to prepare and did not call for extraordinary talents in cooking.

I grew up eating ''Salzburger Nockerl''. My mother prepared them almost every Sunday when I was a child. I even think that this dish was my first real dessert after the &quot;joyful&quot; experience of eating pureed food as a baby. As a teenager I was not very interested in cooking and preferred pinching different ingredients from whatever my mother was cooking whenever she turned her back to me. The only dish I was really interested in was ''Salzburger Nockerl''. At the age of about thirteen my mother taught me how to prepare it. Since then I have practiced hundreds of times and I would probably be able to make it blindfolded. So far I have only ever ruined it once - unfortunately, it was probably the most important time.

Known for my extraordinarily delicate ''Salzburger Nockerl'', I wanted to impress my boyfriend’s parents when they visited my family for the first time. I planned everything a week in advance, because after telling them about my talent in great detail (What a mistake!) I wanted everything to be perfect. I bought the best ingredients I could get and I even read up on the most suitable wine to go with this dish. Self-confident as always, I prepared my special dish. My boyfriend’s family was very excited and curious about my cooking. Everything worked out as I had planned. When I took the baking pan out of the oven I was very proud of the result. The dough had risen perfectly and looked like little mountains. I was completely satisfied with my work just, but that was before everything went awry. Without any plausible reason the ''Salzburger Nockerl'' collapsed leaving an ugly mass of dough. Everybody in the dining room was hungry, having waited impatiently for my masterpiece, which was neither delicious nor a treat to the eyes. Full of shame, I presented my disaster. As everybody started laughing, my cheeks turned as red as the cranberry jam I wanted to serve with the dish.

I still have no idea what went wrong and it has never happened to me again. Pride goeth before a fall! But the good thing is that I have never had to cook for anybody since, and whenever I make ''Salzburger Nockerl'' now, I have them all to myself.

==Ingredients==
4 servings:
* 7 egg whites
* 2 egg yolks
* 1/2 cup caster sugar
* 1 tbsp vanilla sugar
* 1 1/2 tbsp flour
* zest of half a lemon
* jam or custard sauce (as base or to serve with)

==Procedure==
# pre-heat oven to 200°C/~400°F
# beat the egg whites, gradually adding the sugar, until they are very stiff
# quickly beat in the two yolks, zest, and vanilla sugar without beating too hard
# fold in the flour carefully
# butter two oven-proof dishes (you may now line the bottom of the dish with jam or custard)
# heap three large dollops of the egg mass into the dish, sitting alongside each other, slightly offset
# &quot;mount&quot; them to resemble three little mountains
# bake in the oven for 10 minutes until your “Nockerl” have become slightly brown on top

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]]

'''Reindling''' is a traditional cake from Carinthia, southern Austria. Originally, it was served on festive days like weddings, baptisms or religious holidays (especially on Easter). It still plays a major role in Carinthian custom, but today there is no need to wait for a special occasion to enjoy a Reindling – it has become a common dish of Carinthian cuisine.

However, a Reindling does not necessarily have to be sweet; in fact, it lies somewhere in between cake and white bread. It tastes delicious with butter and jam, but traditionally it was also  served like bread, especially with the traditional Carinthian Easter meal of ham, smoked saussages and eggs. Admittedly, this may take some time to get used to, but try it, it is worth it! 
Some families even have two Reindlings on Easter Sunday: one simple Reindling, with only a little, not too sweet filling to balance the salty flavours of the ham and the sausages; and another one, full of fat, full of sugar and full of sweet, sticky filling, topped with butter to give the cake a deliciously crunchy surface. 

Personally, I prefer the second variety, since it reminds me of the Reindlings of my childhood. At Easter, my godmother used to bake the most scrumptious Reindlings of all time. Their exquisite smell, the rich golden brown colour of the surface, and the luscious texture of the cakes were like a foretaste, which the actual taste of the Reindling always kept.  Her Reindlings were always of the sweet variety, never anything as mundane as the no-nonsense, low sugar, no nuts cakes my mother habitually baked for Easter lunch. When I was a child, the Reindling for me, was the most important thing about Easter – more important than the bonfires, more important than the egg and spoon races my cousins and I would have, and even more important than the loads of sweets my grandparents would give me. The Reindling was what it was all about, and even today I am still delighted whenever I am offererd a piece of this very special cake, be it simple or elaborate. 

Of course, there are lots of variations to the 'classic' Reindling recipe, and many families have their own 'secret ingredients' to make their Reindling special. Some people add rum to the filling or use cocoa powder instead of cinnamon. Even though these are no longer traditional varieties of the cake, most of them still taste very good. So if you now want to try this cake, you just have to master the basic recipe and can then try experimenting with different variations. I am sure you will find your personal favourite.

Finally, something has to be said on the cake pan that is usually used for the Reindling. Traditionally, this cake is baked in a so-called 'Reindl' (this is also where its name comes from). The 'Reindl' is a flat round or square cake pan, often with a Christian symbol engraved at the bottom. However, if you cannot get hold of an authentic 'Reindl', a Bundt cake pan will also do the job.

==Ingredients==

For the dough:
* 1 1/2 cup of milk
* 2 1/4 cups (500g) of flour
* 5 tsp (40g) of yeast 
* 2 eggs
* 1/3cup - 1/2cup (70g - 90g) of sugar (depending on taste)
* A generous pinch of salt
* 8 tbsp ( 120g) of butter

For the filling:

* 5 tbsp (50g) of butter
* 1/2 cup (100g) of raisins
* 1/2 cup (100g) of sugar
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1/2 cup (100g) of finely ground nuts (optional)

For the topping:

* 4 tbsp (60g) of butter for topping

==Procedure==

#First, mix the flour with the yeast and add a bit of milk and sugar until you get a smooth mixture. 
#Cover it with a piece of cloth and let it rest in a warm place for half an hour. Then add the rest of the milk and the sugar, the eggs, the butter and a pinch of salt, and work it into a smooth dough. 
#Again, let it rest, this time for ten minutes. Then roll out the dough so that it is roughly as thick as your thumb. 
#For the filling, melt the butter and spread it on the dough. 
#Mix the sugar with the cinnamon and sprinkle the dough. Then add the raisins (and, if you like, the nuts). 
#After that, roll the dough up tightly and put it into the greased cake pan. Again, let it rest for 20 minutes. 
#Finally, sprinkle little bits of butter on the cake. Then put it in the oven for 50 – 60 minutes at about 180 degrees.
#When it is done, take it out of the oven and let it cool. Only when it is completely cold turn the cake out of the pan, otherwise it will break.

== Kaiserschmarrn (or Kaiserschmarren) ==
{{recipesummary |Austrian recipes| approx. 2-3 |15 min.|2|}}
''Kaiserschmarrn'' (Kaiser = German, meaning emperor; Schmarrn = Austrian German, meaning mess or nonsense), which can be translated as &quot;the emperor’s mess&quot;, is a traditional Austrian dish, which is renowned far across the Austrian borders.

There are numerous stories about the recipe's origin, most of  which center on Emperor Franz Josef I, who was Emperor of Austria from 1848 to 1916.

One story says that the dish was first cooked by a farmer’s wife who was visited by the emperor as he was in need of shelter because of bad weather. The farmer’s wife made a common &quot;Holzfällerschmarrn&quot; (Holzfäller = German, meaning woodchopper; Holzfällerschmarrn = a sweet dish made from a dough of flour and fat), which she refined with eggs, milk, and fruits. 

Another of the numerous stories about the origin of ''Kaiserschmarrn'' says that it was invented by the Emperor’s personal cook. The cook's pancakes did not turn out the way they were supposed to, and that is why he just scrambled his pancakes, added cherries and raisins, put icing sugar on top and served the dish to the Emperor as a new creation.

Some people also say that the Emperor liked pancakes for dessert. Whenever the pancakes did not turn out the way the cook wanted them to be, because they were too thick or because they ripped, they were served to the Emperor's servants as ''Kaiserschmarren'' (a mess that was not good enough for being served to the Emperor).

Today we do not care which is the true story, because one thing is for sure: no matter what,  Kaiserschmarrn is always delicious! 
And with the following recipe everybody will be able to make his own ''Kaiserschmarrn''.

According to my mom and grandma (who, of course, make the best ''Kaiserschmarrn'') you need the following ingredients for 2 to 3 servings.


==Ingredients==

* 3 eggs
* 2 cups (500 ml) milk
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 pinch salt
* 1 1/2 cups (350 grams) flour
* 1 tbsp raisins
* 2 tbsp (30 grams) butter or margarine
* icing sugar to put on top before serving


==Procedure==
# Separate the whites from the yolks.
# Put yolks, milk, sugar and salt in a bowl and whip with an eggbeater. 
# Fold in the flour while stirring thoroughly until the mass is pasty. 
# Now add the raisins to the mixture. 
# Whisk the whites until they are stiff and then fold them in. 
# Melt the butter or margarine in a pan and add the dough.
# Wait until the pancake gets solid at the bottom.
# Then divide the mass into quarters with a wooden spoon or spatula and turn them over. 
# After a little while start scrambling the quarters.
# Now keep turning the Kaiserschmarrn until it is done.

Serve with icing sugar on top.

Traditionally ''Kaiserschmarrn'' is served with stewed plums.
But it is also possible to serve it with other compotes or jams like apple compote or cowberry jam.

'''ENJOY!!!'''

{{recipesummary|Dessert recipes|4 (12 dumplings)|30 minutes|2|Image=[[Image:DSC00220.JPG|thumb|right|250px]]}}

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]]

'''Strawberry dumplings''' ('''Erbeerknödel''')

==Ingredients==
* 12 ripe strawberries, medium-sized
* 2 cups (500g) of curd cheese
* 1/2 cup (125g) of flour
* 1 egg
* a pinch of salt
* 1/5 cup (50g) of butter
* 1/5 cup (50g) of sugar
* 4/5 cups (200g) of breadcrumbs
* icing sugar

==Procedure==
# Wash the strawberries and cut off the leaves.

===For The Dough===
# Put the egg and the curd cheese into a large bowl.
# Add a pinch of salt.
# Stir until the mixture is smooth; the egg and the cheese should be blended well.
# Now slowly add the flour and stir until the dough sticks to one side of the bowl.
# Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes. If the dough is too moist, which sometimes happens due to the salt, add some more flour. 

===How To Form The Dumplings===
# Cover your hands with flour, so that the dough won't stick to your fingers when forming the dumplings.
# Take a large tablespoon of dough and put it onto your palm.
# Add some flour and roll the dough slightly between your hands until you receive a small ball.
# Then press the ball flat and put a strawberry into the middle
# Now cover the strawberry with dough.
# Sprinkle the dumpling and your hands with some more flour.
# Now carefully roll the dumpling until you get a smooth, round ball.
# Put the dumplings on a floured plate. Leave enough space between them, as they will otherwise stick to one another.


===How To Cook The Dumplings===
# Fill a large pot with about 3 liters of water and bring it to a boil.
# Put the dumplings into the boiling water.
# Let them boil in the open pot for about 10 minutes.
# The dumplings are done, when they float as if they &quot;danced&quot;.


===How To Roast The Crumbs===
# Melt the butter in a frying pan.
# Add the breadcrumbs and the sugar and roast them until they gain a brown colour. Stir well, as the sugar makes the crumbs burn faster.

===How To Get The Crumbs Onto The Dumplings===
# Take the dumplings out of the boiling water and roll them in the breadcrumbs until they are covered evenly. Since the crumbs are supposed to stick, the dumplings should still be moist on the surface.
# Serve the dumplings together with a little of the roasted crumbs. Sprinkle them with icing sugar.
# ENJOY!

 
==Variations==
* The breadcrumbs could also be roasted without sugar, but in this case you will miss on the caramel flavor. For the calorie conscious people among us there is the possibility of roasting the breadcrumbs without butter.
* This recipe also works well with other fillings like apricots, plums or chocolate. In Austria we also fill dumplings with &quot;Mozartkugeln&quot;, which are little balls of chocolate, nougat and almond paste. It is reasonable to use the fruits of the respective season, since they are fresh and cheap. If you use apricots or plums as a filling, you can add a pinch of cinnamon to the sugar before mixing it with the breadcrumbs. If you serve dumplings with a chocolate filling, garnish them with chocolate sauce and ground walnuts.
* It is a good idea to serve the dumplings with ice cream (preferably vanilla flavor), garnished with fresh berries and a mint leaf.
* Enjoying a glass of cold milk together with the dumplings is especially refreshing in the summer months. In Austria it is also common to serve sweet dishes with a cup of coffee.
* Curd cheese dough only tastes well with sweet fillings. For savory dumplings, which are very popular in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, use potato dough and no breadcrumbs.


==About the Recipe==
* Strawberry dumplings are a typically Austrian dish usually served as a main course, rather than as a dessert. Sweet dishes as main courses are very common in Austria and especially popular with children and vegetarians, since the Austrian cuisine is heavy on meat dishes like &quot;Schweinsbraten&quot; (roast pork), &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot; or &quot;Speckknödel&quot; (dumplings filled with bacon), and has only little to offer for people who don’t like meat. There are many variations of sweet and savory dumplings, especially when it comes to the fillings. A specialty of Salzburg, for example, are the &quot;Mozartknödel&quot;: cream cheese dumplings with a &quot;Mozartkugel&quot; as filling. Savory dumplings can be filled with minced meat, greaves or bacon and are usually served with sauerkraut and gravy.
* For an amateur cook, the above recipe is recommendable if he needs a tasteful, quick, and easy to prepare dish for, say, an evening with his parents-in-law; they will certainly be impressed by his cooking skills. Cooking strawberry dumplings is relatively easy, but of course it can only be perfected by practice. If you have grown tired of strawberry dumplings, just vary the filling and use other fruits of your choice.
* Always use fresh, ripe strawberries, as they taste much sweeter than the ones you can buy in the supermarket. Also consider picking strawberries yourself; this way you can choose the ripe and fresh ones and get the size you need for the dumplings. Moreover, you can try a few while picking. In Austria you can do this in June on several privately owned strawberry fields. Use the spare strawberries for cooking jam. Since they go bad within a few days, remember to use strawberries immediately after picking

== The Story ==

To be honest with you, I cannot cook. I am not just being modest, but I really mean it. Once I accidentally exploded eggs when all I meant to do was boil them. This recipe is just right for the people who are amateurs in the kitchen. The great thing about this recipe is that everyone can cook it because it is really easy. Give it a try!

You might wonder why I cooked a three course menu if I do not know how to cook. The truth is that I was forced to. My friends and I decided to have a little contest. We called it &quot;The Perfect Dinner&quot;. Since I did not want my friends to set a high standard, I went first.


== The Menu ==
I welcomed my guests with an aperitif of their choice: a Bellini or an Aperol Spritzz. With the aperitif I served mouth-watering appetizers: '''Greek feta cheese wrapped in raw ham of beef served with home-made white bread and extra virgin olive oil'''. It tastes fabulous and at the same time it is easy to prepare. The only thing you have to do yourself, besides wrapping the ham around the cheese, is to bake the home-made bread:

[[File:Amuse Gueule.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Amuse Gueule'']]





* 1 kg or 8 cups strong white bread flour
* 625 ml or 3 cups lukewarm water
* 2 x 7 g sachets or 1 ½ tbsp of dried yeast
* 30 g or 2 tbsp salt
* 30 g or 2 tbsp sugar

&lt;br&gt;The recipe is from Jamie Oliver.







Put the flour in a heap on a clean work surface and form a hole in the middle of the heap. Pour half of the water into this hole and add the yeast, sugar and salt. Take a fork and start stirring, gradually bringing in the flour from the sides and swirling it into the liquid. Keep stirring and add the water little by little. Be careful not to pour too much water into the flour hole at a time, otherwise you might get your clothes stained. As soon as all the ingredients are mixed together, knead the dough, which becomes really sticky by then. People used to make glue from flour and water and you will certainly find out why. When you have a smooth ball of dough, put it into a bowl, let it rise in a warm place and wait until it has doubled in size. That will take about half an hour. Next you shape it to a loaf, wait until it has doubled in size again and put it into the oven at 200°C or 390°F, for about 15-20 min. Your bread is ready if it sounds hollow when you knock on it. 

[[File:Carpaccio on Chicory and Parmesan.JPEG|thumb|right|200px|''Carpaccio on Chicory and Parmesan'']]


&lt;br&gt;'''The first course''' 


'''Carpaccio of beef on chicory leaves and olive oil topped with Parmesan cheese and Provençal herbs decorated with grissini (breadsticks) and served with white bread'''

Again, a teeny tiny effort with a tremendous effect. Make sure you buy good quality carpaccio. You need about two or three slices of it per person. Put the carpaccio on the chicory leaves. You can use any other kind of lettuce if you find chicory too bitter.
Grate Parmesan over it and sprinkle some olive oil on top. Now sprinkle the herbs over the top and decorate the plate with two grissini.
While you are busy preparing the food, do not forget to keep the drinks coming. Red wine goes very well with the first course.







'''The main course''' 


'''Salmon fillet on green ribbon noodles with lemon-chives-sauce and florets of broccoli'''


At this point, I have to admit, it gets busy in the kitchen; but do not worry, as this is a foolproof recipe, just do what I tell you and nobody will get hurt. First of all you need to get the ingredients ready.


[[File:Salmon1.JPEG|thumb|left|250px|''Salmon fillet'']]






* 4 salmon fillets of about 125g
* 300 g or 10.5 oz green ribbon noodles 
* half a broccoli 
* 3 egg yolks
* 2 lemons
* 125g or 9 tbsp melted butter
* a bundle of chives






Since the most difficult part is making the sauce, I advise you to begin with it. 
Mix the egg yolks with the lemon juice in a glass bowl. Then boil some water in a pot and put the glass bowl over the pot. Now add the melted butter little by little and heat the mixture carefully, while constantly stirring until the sauce thickens.
Next chop the chives finely. Add the chives to the sauce and season it with salt and pepper. That’s it.
Cooking noodles is not that difficult. Just take the noodles out as soon as they are al dente, which means firm to the bite. It will take about 8 min.
Boil the broccoli florets for about 10 min. Make sure you take them out when they are still firm to the bite and do not cook them too early because they get cold very quickly.

Believe it or not, cooking the salmon fillets is quite simple. All you have to do is put some flour on the skin of the fish , pour some olive oil into a pan and put in the fillets flour side down. Drizzle some lemon juice over the fillets and season with salt and pepper. Then fry the fillets until they are crispy. Do not be intimidated by the sizzling and spluttering of the fish, just beware of the splattering fat. It will take about 12 min until the fish is ready.



'''Last but not least: the dessert''' 


'''Mousse au Chocolat'''


Often Mousse au Chocolat is considered to be extremely difficult to prepare, which is wrong because if it were so, I would not have made it!

[[File:Mousse au Chocolat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mousse au Chocolat'']]



&lt;br&gt;Ingredients:

* 3 eggs
* 200 ml ¾ cupwhipped cream
* 40 g or 3 ½ tbsp sugar
* 100 g or 3.5 oz dark chocolate
* 100 g or 3.5 oz milk chocolate



Separate the eggs and whip the egg whites. Melt the chocolate in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water. Then let it cool down until it is lukewarm. Now whip egg yolks with 2 tbsp of hot water. Gradually add the sugar and whip the mixture until it is creamy. Then quickly add the melted chocolate and mix in the whipped cream and the egg whites. Finally, put it in the fridge for at least 3 hours. Done!






That is how the perfect foolproof three course menu is prepared by all the non-Martha-Stewarts out there. So, have fun and most important: enjoy your dinner!

PS.: I won.

==My story==


People visiting Spain will sooner or later come face to face with a typical Spanish delicacy called the ''tortilla''. You can find this dish in every bar, pub or restaurant in the country. The tortilla can be ordered as a main dish or as a side dish, for example the ''bocadillo de tortilla'' (a bread roll with tortilla inside). In bars people are often served a piece of tortilla for free with their drinks. It is therefore almost impossible for visitors not to get to know this Spanish specialty.


When you order a tortilla in Spain you have to know that it is not the same as the tortilla in Mexico or in France, but a completely different dish. There are various kinds of Spanish tortillas as well. For example, the ''tortilla de patata'' is prepared with potatoes and the ''tortilla de pepino'' is prepared with cucumber. So make sure you know what you are ordering.


In Spain the tortilla plays an important role in society. Mothers often oblige their daughters to learn how to prepare tortillas, which is often referred to as the ''artwork of good cooking''. The preparation of a preparation of a good tortilla is the litmus test for the Spanish. If you succeed, you are considered to be a good cook and consequently ''a good catch''.


The Spaniards often use the word ''tortilla'' in everyday language, for example in expressions like ''a falta de pan buenas son las tortillas/tortas'', which means ''beggars can’t be choosers'', ''se le volteó la tortilla'', which means ''his plans changed unpredictably'', or ''quedó como tortilla'', which means ''it was crushed like a tortilla''. These examples show the cultural significance of the tortilla in Spain.


One last thing that needs to be mentioned before I get to the most important part, namely the recipe for this Spanish national dish: Be careful not to mix up the words ''tortilla'' and ''tortillera'' because that can lead to some undesired confusion. I can confirm this through my own experience. After my first language course in Spain I was asked what I liked best about my time there. As you can probably guess right now, I mixed up the two words and consequently was mistaken for a lesbian. As a farewell present from my Spanish friends I received a tortilla with the word ''tortillera'' written across it in sour cream lettering. The word and the dish ''tortilla'' will always bring back great memories of my stay in Spain.



== Recipe ==

==Ingredients==

*1 lb (1/2 kg) potatoes, washed
*10 eggs
*salt and pepper
*17 fl oz (500 ml) olive oil
*2 onions, peeled, quartered and sliced into 1/8-1/4&quot; slices
*cucumber (optional)

==Preparation==

{{recipesummary|side dishes|4|prep: 50 min|3}}

1. Cut the potatoes into thin slices and dab them dry with a dish towel. Heat the olive oil in a pan. Add the potatoes and onions; turn down the heat and stir-fry them for approximately 20 minutes.  

2. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper and whisk them. As soon as the potatoes and the onions are cooked, drain them off, collecting the oil. Then add the whisked eggs to the potato-onion mix. 

3. Clean the pan and heat two tablespoons of the collected oil in it. Put in the egg-potato-onion mix, reduce the heat and fry the mass for approximately 4 minutes. Make sure that the egg mass covers the potatoes and be careful not to burn the ''tortilla''.  

4. As soon as the bottom of the mass has solidified, and the top jiggles but is not runny, cover the pan with a big plate and turn it over. Then carefully slide the nearly finished tortilla back into the pan (upside down) and cook it for about 4 minutes. Then let it rest for 15 minutes and the dish is ready to serve.

==Knoedel==

Although Knoedel (Engl. &quot;dumplings&quot;) are part of menus all over the world, they still remain a typical example of the Austrian, Bavarian, and Czech cuisine, especially in their characteristically round form. They are served as a sweet or as a savory dish (e.g. scrambled with eggs) or as a side dish with meat.

Actually, I have never met anyone who despises dumplings on principle. In all their different ways of preparation, dumplings are willingly eaten by children and adults alike. Just as there are no age restrictions for eating dumplings, in these days of health consciousness there are no dietary restrictions either. There are also no social barriers to eating dumplings. One may find dumplings both on the table of a rural inn and on the menu of an ''haute cuisine'' restaurant. It seems that dumplings are a dish for everyone.


'''Personal expieriences'''

I first noticed the popularity of dumplings during my studies in the United States. Once in a month we had a so-called “International Evening”. Students from abroad were enlisted to prepare typical dishes from their home countries. I fixed plum dumplings for our first meeting and everybody was so keen on them that I was forced to make them over and over again. Two years later, pretty much the same thing happened to me in Switzerland, where I was working during the summer. Thinking that Switzerland had many things in common with its Alpine neighbor, I was surprised to learn that dumplings as we prepare them in Austria were unknown to the Swiss I worked with.


'''History'''

The history of the Knoedel is a very old one. Archaeological findings of food that were identified as some kind of dumplings have been dated back to the year 3600 BC. These findings were lumps of bruised grain, water, and flour, probably formed and compressed by hand, though they could have also been some kind of bread. Scientists assume that these balls were dried and kept as non-perishable provisions for longer journeys.

The etymology of the word “Knoedel” starts in the Czech language with the word “knedlik”. The English word “dumpling” first emerged around 1600.


'''Methods of preparation'''

Knoedel serve as main or side dishes, as desserts and also as accompaniments to soups. The methods of preparation are much more varied than those of other dishes. There are sweet or savoury, filled or unfilled dumplings - dumplings can also be prepared as casseroles. What all dumplings have in common though is that they are balls of dough and must be boiled in water.
 
The most popular and also most traditional Knoedel dish in Austria is probably a sweet dumpling such as Zwetschgenknoedel (plum dumplings) or [[cookbook:Marillenknödel|Marillenknödel]] (apricot dumplings). It is made of curd cheese dough and filled with either plums or apricots. Some people have experimented with fillings for dumplings and come up with delicious creations such as the Erdbeerknoedel ([[cookbook:Strawberry dumplings|Strawberry dumplings]]) and Nougatknoedel (filled with nougat). In most cases, people prepare curd cheese dumplings with fruit or any kind of sauce made from fruit or chocolate.

The Semmelknoedel is one of Austria's most favourite side dishes. It goes well with meat, especially with pork roast. A variation is the [[cookbook:Serviettenknödel|Serviettenknödel]], which is made using the same ingredients but has a different form. The Grießknoedel, made of semolina, is usually served in soups (like noodles would be).

Wurstknoedel and Grammelknoedel are dumplings served as main dishes. They are made of potato dough and filled with chopped sausage (mixed with onions and herbs) and greaves respectively. This dish is often served with sauerkraut. 

Rather than being filled with meat, the dough for Fleischknoedel (meat dumplings) is made using meat (e.g. liver in Leberknoedel). Like the Grießknoedel, Fleishknoedel are most often served in a broth of some kind.

==Basic recipe: Semmelknoedel==

{{recipesummary|Side dishes|4|prep: 20 min, cooking: 20 min|2}}

===Ingredients===
* 10 white bread rolls
* 2 onions
* about 3 cups milk
* 4 eggs
* about 7 tbsp flour 
* 1 tbsp salt
* a pinch of white pepper 
* 1 bunch of parsley


===Procedure===
# cut the rolls into small cubes 
# chop the onions 
# heat 5 tablespoons of oil in a pan and sauté the onions until they are glassy
# mix the bread cubes with the onions
# mix the eggs with the milk and pour it over the bread and the onions
# wash and chop the parsley
# mix the parsley and the flour with the dough
# form balls of the dough (in the size of tennis balls) 
# Boil the Knoedel in salted water. After about two minutes turn the temperature down to a lower setting and let them boil for another 10 to 15 minutes.

[[File:Bowl of Ukrainian Borscht.jpg|thumb|250px|right]]

'''Ukrainian Borscht''' is a vegetable soup with beetroots as its characteristic ingredient. 

==It is just a soup for mankind; a matter of principle for the Slavs==  
Borshch is the everyday and ritual dish. It is known from early Kyiv Rus times but it was prepared by Slavic people much more time ago. 

If you want to find out about the reason for the conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, do not waste your time reading articles on political issues or language-related arguments. The truth is as plain as the nose on your face: all the conflicts started with the discussion about the origin of Borscht. Ukrainians swear to high heaven that it is a traditional soup of their beloved mother country, but Russians also claim that it is their national dish. They lure customers into their restaurants in New York or Berlin and offer Borscht as a traditional Russian dish.

==The Origin of the Name 'Borscht'==

Let us first have a look at the name itself. Borscht derives from the Slavic “borshchevik”, which means hogweed. Hogweed was used by the ancestors to add a greenish brown colour to their soup. Even though hogweed is no longer used for preparing Borscht, its name still reminds us of the long history of the soup. Borscht is also known as borsch, bortsch, borstch, borsh, borshch; Ukrainian: борщ. 

==Then and Now ==

Borscht, like a bird, does not know political boundaries. Despite mud-slinging between the countries of the former Soviet Union, cooking Borscht is getting increasingly popular owing to the internet discussions on its variations.  It is not just a bowl of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock; it carries a little fragment of former life in a union with a population of almost 300 million people.

==When to Eat Borscht==
Borscht is very nourishing, especially if you cook it with meat. That is the reason why it is normally eaten for dinner. Ukrainians are known for eating this hearty vegetable soup with pork as a morning pick-me-up and then again three times throughout the day!

Usually Borshch is eaten for dinner like any other vegetable soup.

==Variations== 

There are different types of Borscht. The choice of ingredients depends on the region or simply on what your fridge offers. Originally there were up to 40 ingredients used for a good plate of Borscht. No matter which ingredients you use in the end, beetroot is the ingredient you need to get the typical red colour. It is often said that there are as many different kinds of Borscht as there are cooks in the Ukraine. Not even my own and my mother's Borscht taste the same. You can vary your recipe according to your taste. For example, leave out meat if you are a vegetarian and avoid garlic if you have an appointment after dinner. A plate of hot Borscht in winter will warm you up and in summer it will be very refreshing if you eat it cold. Especially vegetarian Borscht tastes great when cold. And do not forget to add some sour cream to it!

There are three main types of Borshch. The first is the real Ukrainian Borshch that is the most popular.It is usually cooked on broth with red beets and served hot with sour cream (smetana).  The second is Green Borshch that is made on Spring and Summer when there are new plants. And the last is Cold Borshch also known like Holodnyk that is made usually during hot summer and it is served cold.

Everyday Borshch is simpler and consists of less number of ingredients. It could be prepared on meat broth or fish broth or just vegetable broth. Ukrainian people added stewed onion with some fat and meshed garlic to everyday Borshch. On holidays and Sundays the sour cream was added.

There are a lot of different ingredients added to Borshch but the most common were broth, red beets, cabbage, carrot, mushrooms, beans, onion, garlic and Beet Kvass. People got used to add potato to Borshch from XIX century because there was no potato in Ukraine before this time. Also in ancient times no tomatoes or acids were added. In Borshch was added homemade Beet Kvass that is very healthy and tasty beverage.

== How to Start and What to Prepare==

When you plan to prepare Borscht start early and write “feeding the pot” in your Filofax for that day. It will take you some time to put all the ingredients into the soup.
I always make sure that I have true “Borscht beets” with whitish stripes inside. Unfortunately, you will not find out until you come home and start cooking. Do not be afraid of putting too much cabbage into the pot. Beside the beetroot it is the main ingredient of Borscht and it makes the soup thick, which, according to my grandmother, is characteristic of good Borscht. Even if you are used to cooking in spinster-sized pots, you can make an exception when cooking Borscht. Use a large pot for your Borscht. If you have leftovers, simply eat them the next day. Your soup will even taste better than the day before. If you are short of time, buy tinned beans instead of soaking the dried ones overnight. Tinned beans do not need to be cooked, just add them when your Borscht is ready.

== Recipe tips and pieces of advice ==

# For Borshch take clean filtered or natural water
# Cook all vegetables in low heat in pot with closed lid
# Beets can be stewed separately with a little amount of Beet Kvass and vegetable oil before adding the broth. Then put them to all other ingredients in 10 minutes before the end of cooking
# The best meat for Borshch is fat beef with bones
# Usually in Borshch dried white mushrooms are added but You can take any other dried mushrooms
# The whole red pepper not cut can be put in broth at the beginning of cooking and removed  at the end before serving
# Garlic can also be meshed with a slice of fat bacon and added to the prepared Borshch

Microfluidics is the science of fluid flows at the microscopic scale.

Microfluidics mainly  deals with artificial systems, but is present in numerous natural systems:
* Trees: ascent of sap in xylem conduits in the trunk (conduit diameter around 30 micrometers), and in leaves (diameter around 50 nanometers).  
* Inside us: capillary blood vessels transport liquid (diameter 8 micrometer), lungs pump air in small alveola.

== Why do we care?==

[[Image:InkjetHead.svg|frame|50px|right|Head of an ink jet printer]]

Microfluidic is involved in present applications:
* Top one: ink-jet printer


Starting applications with a promising market are:
* medical implants (injection of drugs from an embedded pump)
* Lab-on-a-chip: miniature lab to perform biological test such as proteomics, or chemical analysis/synthesis of very exothermic reactions

For research purposes, it provides miniature  devices to study small objects.

== Examples in Nature of the hierarchy of forces ==

=== Insects can walk on water ===
[[Image:WaterstriderEnWiki.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[w:water strider|Water strider]] uses surface tension to walk]]
[[Image:PatteInsecte.svg|thumb|200px|right|Surface tension acts on the perimeter of legs]]
A contact line occurs on the legs of these insects. The leg surface is hydrophobic, and therefore the surface is curved downwards, which creates an upward tension force. 

The typical leg diameter  is l, and we can estimate the intensity of the forces:

* Capillary force scales like &lt;math&gt; \sigma \pi l&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the surface tension, a force per unit length whose value is &lt;math&gt;\sigma=70.10^{-3} \mathrm{N/m}&lt;/math&gt;
* Weight scales like &lt;math&gt; \rho g l^3&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore weight is comparable to the capillary force at the characteristic leghtscale:

:&lt;math&gt;l^*=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}}\simeq 3 \, \mathrm{mm}&lt;/math&gt;
Below this length capillary forces are preponderant.
\\

=== Smaller but stronger ===
How many times can you lift people of your size?

The structure of muscles is universal in the animal kingdom, with similar fibers of diameter &lt;math&gt;l_0&lt;/math&gt;. 
Each fiber can exert a maximum force &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of fibers is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle l^2/l_0^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Muscular force exerted by a muscle therefore scales like 
:&lt;math&gt;F\sim P l^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P=f/l_0^2&lt;/math&gt; the maximum stress exerted by a fiber. It is a &quot;Natural&quot; constant, independent of the size. It can be evaluated for human beings as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P\sim F/l^2=100\; \mathrm{N}/10\;\mathrm{cm}^2\simeq 10^4 \;\mathrm{N.m^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;, where we computed the typical force exerted by a muscle divided by its typical section area.
* The weight scales like 
:&lt;math&gt;W \sim \rho g l^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

The number of people you can lift is therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{F}{W}=\frac{P}{\rho g l}=\frac{H}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;H\simeq 1 \; \mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; a constant independent of size.

Humans (l~1m) can lift 1 people
Small ants (l~1mm) can lift 1000 people!

Note, that this force is used by a particular species of ants to jump.  These ants  strike their mandibles on the ground with a force that is 300 times its own weight, and propel themselves up to 10cm in height

      <comment>/* Navier-Stokes equation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The motion of fluid is described by applying the fundamental law of mechanics, known as Newton's second law, not on a point particle but on a fluid.

== Fluid particle ==
[[Image:FluidParticle.svg|thumb|200px|right|Range of applicability of the fluid particle]]

A fluid particle is a volume, large enough to contain smooth molecular variations, but small compared to the system size.
It has a mesoscopic character, intermediate between a microscopic (molecular) and macroscopic description.
A continuum approach is possible.



In '''liquids''' the fluid particle size can be larger than molecules and smaller than micrometric channels. 

In '''gases''' the mean free path &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be not smaller than the microsystem size, a specific approach is necessary.

The continuum approach allows to define, as a function of the position in space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; and the time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;\rho (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the mass density (unit kg/m^3)
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity (unit m/s)

== Mass conservation ==
It writes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
For  incompressible fluids (which is almost the case with liquids, and gases at velocities small in front of the speed of sound), &lt;math&gt;\rho=\mathrm{cst}&lt;/math&gt;, and mass conservation implies a specific flow field that is divergence free,  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle div(\mathbf{u})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Forces within a fluid ==
[[Image:VolumeElement.svg|thumb|200px|left|Volume element with outward normal on a surface]]

Two kind of forces are present in a fluid:
* Isotropic  normal force: the '''pressure'''. They provide a component 
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{f}=-p\, \mathbf{n}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;on a small element of surface &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; being the outward normal to volume element.
* Shear forces: due to internal friction they provide a component 
:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{f}=\mathbf{\tau}\, .\, \mathbf{n}\, dS&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; the shear stress tensor. 

For a [[w:Newtonian fluid|Newtonian fluid]] the shear stress tensor components are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}=\mu\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the viscosity.

== Navier-Stokes equation ==
For a Newtonian fluid the Navier-stokes equation writes
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}\right) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

The second term on the left hand side comes from the inertia of the fluid. It is a non-linear term that produces history dependent effect very present at the human scale or larger scale:
* swirls, tornados
* turbulence
* propulsive forces

However at small scales inertia is damped by viscous effects (second term on the right) that are preponderant.
The [[w:Reynolds number|Reynolds number]] provides an estimation of the ratio inertial forces/viscous forces:
if the typical velocity of the fluid is &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and the typical size &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R\!e=\frac{\rho u l}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.

At small scales &lt;math&gt;R\!e\ll1&lt;/math&gt;, and the second term &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; can be neglected, the Navier-Stokes equation becomes the Stokes equation. This equation is linear and easier to solve.
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}  = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity field solution of these equations is linear in applied stresses meaning:
* the solution is unique (whereas the full Navier-Stokes equation gives rise to turbulence and instabilities)
* the solution is reversed when the forces are reversed: it is impossible to create a fluid &quot;diode&quot; at small scales

It can also be shown that  the solution minimizes the total dissipated power.

== Boundary conditions ==
The equations of motions can be solved when boundary conditions are given at the surface of the fluid.
===For usual liquids===
there is a no-slip boundary condition, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;at the surface
===For gases, and for some non-wetting liquids ===
For gases, the [[w:Knudsen number|Knudsen number]] compares the mean free path to the typical lengthscale of the flow.
:&lt;math&gt;Kn=\frac{\lambda}{l}&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;Kn&lt;0.003&lt;/math&gt; the continuum approach still holds with no slip at the interface.
For &lt;math&gt;Kn&gt;0.01&lt;/math&gt; a molecular approach is necessary.
For intermediate numbers &lt;math&gt;0.003&lt;Kn&lt;0.01&lt;/math&gt;, Navier-Stokes still holds but 
there is a slip at the solid surface, defined by the Navier length &lt;math&gt;L_s&lt;/math&gt;, such that the slip velocity of the fluid is 
:&lt;math&gt;u_s=L_s\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; the distance to the surface.
Usually &lt;math&gt;L_s\simeq \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

For liquids, the debate is still open...

      <comment>/* Hydrodynamic resistance */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We present here simple tools to compute the flow in complex network of channels, just knowing the applied pressure.

== Hydrodynamic resistance ==
since there is no link to prev chap, please add definitur for &quot;u&quot; in the eqn &quot;expression for the hydraulic resistance is:&quot;
We have seen in the previous chapter that flow rate &lt;math&gt; Q&lt;/math&gt; in a channel is proportional to the applied pressure drop &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be summarized in 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=R_h Q,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_h&lt;/math&gt; the '''hydrodynamic resistance'''.
This expression is formally the analog of the electrokinetic law between voltage difference and current, &lt;math&gt;U=R I&lt;/math&gt;.

The expression for the hydraulic resistance is:
* channel of circular cross-section (total length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;R_h=\frac{8\mu L}{\pi R^4}&lt;/math&gt;

* rectangular cross-section (width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, expression valid when &lt;math&gt;h&lt;w&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;R_h\approx \frac{12 \mu L}{w h^3(1-0.630 h/w)}&lt;/math&gt;

In a network of channels, equivalent resistances can be computed (as in electrokinetics):
* two channels ''in series'' have a resistance &lt;math&gt;R_h=R_{h1}+R_{h2}&lt;/math&gt;,
* two channels i''n parallel'' have a resistance &lt;math&gt;1/R_h=1/R_{h1}+1/R_{h2}.&lt;/math&gt;

These laws provide useful tools for the design of complex networks. Actually Kirchhoff's laws for electric circuits apply, being modified in:
* the sum of flow rates on a node of the circuit is zero
* the sum of pressure differences on a loop is zero

== Hydrodynamic capacitance ==
The volume of fluid in a channel can change just because of a change in pressure: this is  either due to fluid compressibility or channel elasticity.
This behavior can be summarized with 
:&lt;math&gt;Q=C_h \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;C_h&lt;/math&gt; the hydrodynamic capacitance. It is the microfluidic analog of the electrokinetic law &lt;math&gt;I=C\,dU/dt&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Compressible fluid in a container ===
A pressure increase can compress the fluid in a container. The compressibility is measured by 
:&lt;math&gt;K_{fluid}=-\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}.&lt;/math&gt;
For water its value is &lt;math&gt;K=4.6\times 10^{-5}/bar&lt;/math&gt; which is usually negligible since pressure are usually less than a bar.
For air it is &lt;math&gt;K=1/P=1/bar&lt;/math&gt; which considerable if pressure attain a bar.

The flow rate entering a tube of volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, because of fluid compression &lt;math&gt;d\Delta P/dt&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{dV}{dt}=V\left(-\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right) \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}=K_{fluid} V \frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The hydrodynamic capacitance is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;C_h=K_{fluid} V&lt;/math&gt;

=== Elastic tubes ===

We define the tube dilatability as 
:&lt;math&gt;K_{tube}=\frac{1}{V_{tube}}\frac{\partial V_{tube}}{\partial P}&lt;/math&gt;
It has a positive sign, since the tube volume increases with pressure.

The tube dilatability is approximately the inverse of the Young modulus &lt;math&gt;K\simeq 1/E.&lt;/math&gt;
The following table gives  order of magnitude of this dilatability for different materials
{| border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
|-
|-
| 
| &lt;math&gt;K_{tube}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| steel
| &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0.5\times 10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|-
| plastic
| &lt;math&gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|-
| rubber
| &lt;math&gt;0.1&lt;/math&gt;/bar
|}
This value can be interpreted in the following way: if the pressure is increased by 1 bar the relative volume increase is &lt;math&gt;K_{tube}&lt;/math&gt;

''Assuming a uniform pressure in the tube'' (which is not true in long tube where pressure decreases subtantially) ,
we find a flow rate entering the tube to inflate to be
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{dV_{tube}}{dt}=K_{tube}V\frac{\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The hydrodynamic capacitance is therefore 
:&lt;math&gt;C_{h}=K_{tube}V.&lt;/math&gt;

== Modelling of an elastic long tube with a substantial pressure drop ==

We consider a tube of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on which a pressure difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; is applied.
In the tube, the pressure decreases along the tube coordinate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(x)=P_0+(1-x/L)\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;.
The dilatation is therefore not homogeneous: larger near the entrance.
The volume increase of the tube (compared to the rest situation at pressure &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V=\int_0^L \left(1-\frac{x}{L}\right)\Delta P \; K_{tube} \frac{dx}{L} V_{tube}=\frac{\Delta P}{2}K_{tube} V.&lt;/math&gt;
We have integrated the inflation of small volumes &lt;math&gt;dx/L\times V_{tube}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:ElasticTubeModelisation.svg|thumb|200px|left|Equivalent circuit to a long elastic tube]]
We obtain that the flow due to dilatation is 
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{d\Delta V}{dt}=C_{tube}\frac{d\Delta P/2}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that only half the pressure difference loads the volume ''capacitor''. The capacitor is placed in the middle of the channel, where the overpressure is half, see figure.


== Application: syringe injection in a microchannel ==

The syringe may be considered as a tube of diameter &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, while the cylindrical microchannel has a diameter &lt;math&gt;r\ll R&lt;/math&gt; , a volume &lt;math&gt;v\ll V&lt;/math&gt;, and a length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.
The resistance of the microchannel &lt;math&gt;R_v=8\mu l/\pi r^4&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than that of the syringe: &lt;math&gt;R_v \gg R_V&lt;/math&gt;.
However the capacitance of the syringe is usually much larger: &lt;math&gt;C_V \gg C_v&lt;/math&gt;, due to a large surface area of walls (if the walls are elastic) and due to much larger volume of the syringe (if the liquid is compressible).

The equivalent circuit is shown in the picture. 
[[Image:SyringeMicrochannelModelisation.svg|thumb|200px|left|Equivalent circuit to a long elastic tube]]
The total flow is distributed in the microchannel branch and the capacitor branch:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{piston}=\frac{1}{R_v}\Delta P+C_V\frac{d\Delta P}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
If the piston is suddenly started, initially water or tube elasticity will absorb the flow, and the flow approaches its stationary state assymptotically, with the characteristic time given as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=R_v \,C_V=\frac{8\mu l}{\pi r^4} V K,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the effective compressibility (both from the compressibility of liquid and from the elasticity of the container).

As an example, we take a microchannel of radius 10 micrometers, length 1 cm and a syringe of volume 1cc: the characteristic time is 10 seconds, if the syringe is rigid (glass) and &lt;math&gt;K=K_{water}&lt;/math&gt;, while it takes up to 1000 seconds if the syringe is made from plastic &lt;math&gt;K=K_{plastic}&lt;/math&gt; !

As a conclusion, for practical realization of microfluidic networks:
* avoid elastic tubes and prefer metallic tubes for a faster equilibration
* avoid elastic glues in contact with the liquid: they will compress
* avoid bubbles in the system, the compressibility of any gas is extremely high compared to plastic!
* impose pressure with a valve, instead of piston velocity: the pressure equilibrates at the speed of sound in the liquid and changes in pressure are very rapidly applied to the whole system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Capillary effects are very important at small scales (see previous chapter [Physics_at_smaller_scales]).

They appear at interfaces between a liquid and another material liquid, gas, or solid.

The interfaces give rise to a '''surface tension''' that rules the dynamics of this interface.



Creating a new interface costs a work
:&lt;math&gt;E=\sigma \, A,&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the surface tension (in N/m) and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the area of the interface. For water/air interface the value of surface tension at 20°C is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma=73\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;N/m.

This surface tension gives rise to a common phenomenon: liquid droplets tend to become spheres in order to minimize their surface.

== Origin: internal adhesion energies ==
[[Image:CreatingNewInterface.svg|thumb|300px|left|Creating a new interface in two steps]]
Because of '''Van der Waals forces''', liquid molecules are attracted by their neighbours, which gives rise to an adhesion energy of the liquid to itself.

The value of surface tension in between two immiscible liquids (labeled 1 &amp; 2) can be understood by dividing the creation of a new interface in steps
* Step 1:  separation of free surfaces within each liquids
It costs 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E=\gamma_{11}\frac{A}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in fluid 1, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{11}&lt;/math&gt; the adhesion energy of the fluid to itself. 
The origin of this adhesion in a liquid is Van der Waals attraction. We cut here only half of the final surface.
Cutting the same surface in the other liquid costs: 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E =\gamma_{22}\frac{A}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in fluid 2. 
* Step 2:  assemble free surfaces
Flattening the free surfaces produces a new surface &lt;math&gt;2 \times A/2=A&lt;/math&gt;. Their assembly generates a work
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta E =-\gamma_{12}A,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the adhesion energy of liquid 1 on liquid 2.

In total we obtain a total work &lt;math&gt;\Delta E=\gamma_{11}\frac{A}{2}+\gamma_{22}\frac{A}{2}-\gamma_{12}A.&lt;/math&gt; 

The value of surface tension is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{11}+\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{22}-\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

== Young-Laplace law: how surface tension creates pressures ==
[[Image:Young-LaplacePressure.svg|thumb|100px|left|Sphere]]
At mechanical equilibrium a small change in sphere radius &lt;math&gt;dR&lt;/math&gt; does not create any work (forces are balanced):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W=-\Delta P dV+\sigma dA=0&lt;/math&gt;
From this equation we obtain that pressure is higher in a sphere by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=\frac{2\sigma}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

As a numerical example, we compute the capillary pressure in a bubble of radius 1 micrometer in water: it is 1.4 atm!

This formula can be generalized for arbitrary curved surfaces:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=\sigma (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}),&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; the radii of curvature in the principal planes.

== Surface tension can break cylindrical jets ==
 Write a section about the capillary instability ??

== Wetting on solid surfaces ==
[[Image:DropletOnSurface.svg|thumb|400px|left|Droplet on a surface]]

Near the '''contact line''', three interfaces meet:
* the liquid-gas interface, which has a surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{liquid-gas}&lt;/math&gt;, which was noted &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; previously
* the solid-liquid interface, of surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}&lt;/math&gt;
* the solid-gas interface, of surface tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}&lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium of forces, is vectorial sum of forces that vanishes.
Along the horizontal axis it provides the '''Young-Dupré relation''' at the contact line:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}+\sigma \cos \theta=\sigma_{solid-gas},&lt;/math&gt;
where we have introduced the '''contact angle''' &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
Along the vertical axis we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \sin \theta= N,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; being the reaction from the solid. This shows clearly that the droplet is pulling the surface. This effect can be seen if a droplet is deposited on fresh paint: the contact line will pull a rim that will remain.

The contact line exists only if 
:&lt;math&gt;-1&lt;\cos \theta =\frac{\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid}}{\sigma}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; 

There are therefore three cases:
[[Image:Wetting.svg|thumb|400px|left|Different wetting states of a droplet]]
=== Total wetting ===
The liquid spreads, and form a film coating the surface.
It happens when  &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}+\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,  it costs a lot of energy to have a bare solid.   

=== Partial wetting ===
The contact line existence condition is satisfied, &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. 
Two cases can be distinguished:
* hydrophilic surface: &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\theta &lt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
* hydrophobic surface: &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;\theta &lt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

=== No wetting ===
The liquid droplet pearls, and assumes a perfectly spherical shape. It occurs on surfaces such that &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{solid-gas}-\sigma_{solid-liquid})/{\sigma}&lt;-1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{solid-liquid}&gt;\sigma_{solid-gas}+\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the solid does not like to be covered.

These surfaces can be found in nature: observe what happens to a water droplet falling on a lotus leaf. Microscopically these surfaces are covered with little pillars.

== Driving droplet on surfaces with surface tension gradient ==


External modifications of the solid-liquid surface energy will provide forces to move small droplets.
A droplet direction can be imprinted using gradients in surface energy.

=== Thermowetting ===

The solid-liquid surface energy increases with temperature.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_{solid-liquid}}{dT}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
If the heating is very local, the hotter side of droplet will become more expensive in terms of surface energy. The drop will tend to minimize its surface energy by going to the cooler side.

=== Electrowetting ===

A voltage can be applied on a droplet, if the surface is an electrode and an other electrode is in contact with the liquid droplet. 
A voltage difference &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; changes the surface energy by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{EW}_{solid-liquid}=\sigma_{solid-liquid}-c\frac{V^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the surface capacitance.

If only one side of the droplet is sitting on an electrode, the droplet will move towards the electrode, since surface energy is lower there.

Note that electrodes can be insulated to prevent electrolysis of liquids: the technique is called electrowetting on a dielectric (EWOD).

== Driving droplets or bubbles in channels acting on surface tension ==


It is possible to move droplet or bubbles squeezed in microchannels, 
even if there liquid is totally wetting the solid.
The method is to modify the liquid-gas surface tension (instead of the solid-liquid surface tension).

===  Thermocapillary forcing ===
[[Image:Thermocapillaryforcing.svg|thumb|400px|left|Thermocapillary forcing by heating the channel on one side]]

Heating a liquid decreases its surface tension (it is the reverse with the solid-liquid surface tension). 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_{liquid-gas}}{dT}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
A long drop or bubble  with a side hotter than the other will move towards the hotter places to reduce the total energy.

=== Electrocapillary forcing ===
[[Image:Electrocapillaryforcing.svg|thumb|400px|left|Attraction of a charged droplet in a microchannel filled with another fluid]]

If the droplet/bubble is charged on its surface after having been in contact with an electrode, it can be moved afterwards if it is submitted to a voltage gradient. 
The electric potential of the droplet decreases when charges are closer to the electrode carrying the opposite charge.

== Surfactants ==

=== Molecules ===

'''Surfactants''' are molecules that have an affinity with surfaces. They change the surface tension, and are therefore named '''tensio-active''' molecules. 
Usually they are amphiphilic molecules. Amphi- is a Greek prefix, also found in the word amphitheater, meaning dual. Indeed they have both an hydrophilic part and an hydrophobic  part. For instance soap molecules have a carboxylic (hydrophilic head) and a long lipidic (hydrophobic chain). At low concentration they all go at the interface, while at high concentration they tend to form micelles.

 Draw a cartoon with surfactants at surface and in a micelle ??


=== Effect on surface tension ===

They lower the surface tension compared to that of water. A free surface has a tension &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;=73 mN/m. Surface tension decreases down to a plateau, when the surface is fully covered with surfactant molecules, presenting their lipidic tail to the gas. At this point surface tension is close to that of a lipid surface, around 30 mN/m. The saturation occurs at the critical micellar concentration (CMC), when  surface is full and addition of molecules creates new micelles in the liquid.

=== Detergent ===

Surfactants have a detergent effect: they cover the surface of lipid droplets, which helps the detachment by favoring formation of a water film in between the droplet and substrate (cloth!).

 Draw a cartoon with around a droplet partially wetting a substrate ??

=== Stabilizer ===

 Draw  a cartoon showing a liquid film in between two droplets/bubbles ??
Surfactants prevent the break-up of thin liquid films separating droplets in an emulsion or bubbles in a foam. They stabilize the thin liquid films of a soap bubble!

== Droplet and bubble formation in microfluidic circuits ==

The inkjet printer involves the formation of tiny droplets of inks. Tiny droplet or bubbles are promising nanoliter containers: they do not have real walls, contain a very small amount of liquid. It is possible to create them, transport them and finally coalesce them with other. 

A first basic operation is droplet formation.

=== Human scale ===
 [[Image:PendantDroplet.svg|thumb|100px|left|Droplet pending from a tap.]]

We all have seen the formation of a liquid drop at the exit of a tap. If you slowly open the tap, the droplet volumes increases until its weight is larger than the capillary force. The droplets then detaches and falls. 
The forces in presence are:
* the capillary force of magnitude &lt;math&gt;2\pi R_{tap} \sigma,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;R_{tap}&lt;/math&gt; the tap exit radius
* the gravity force of magnitude &lt;math&gt;4\pi r_{droplet}^3/3,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the droplet size.
The droplet detaches when the radius &lt;math&gt;r_{droplet}&lt;/math&gt; is such that gravity force is at least equal to capillary force. We obtain that:
:&lt;math&gt;r_{droplet}\sim \left( \frac{R_{tap} \sigma}{\rho g}\right)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;
reducing the tap radius does not decrease quickly the drop radius, and droplets are getting very large in front of the tap radius at small scales.
We see again that gravity forces become ineffective in front of capillary forces at small scales.

Another strategy, that does not involve gravity, should be considered.

=== Assisted formation in a T junction ===
  (Drawing)

Formation can be actively achieved by using hydrodynamic forces, i.e. viscous forces.

When a fluid A arrives from a perpendicular branch in a main channel, 
droplets of this fluid can be detached if a fluid B is flowing. 
The size is given by a balance between: 
* capillary pressure necessary to form a droplet of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, of magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma/R&lt;/math&gt;
* viscous stresses from the fluid B flowing in a channel of width &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, of magnitude &lt;math&gt;\mu  \nabla v\sim \mu U/h&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding droplet radius is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;R\sim \frac{\sigma}{\mu U_0}h&lt;/math&gt;

=== Assisted formation by hydrodynamic flow focusing ===

 (Drawing)

Another geometry is helpful, to produce very calibrated droplet sizes:
the fluid A  to break is focused by  a stream of fluid B through a tiny orifice of size &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
Both fluids do not flow simultaneously through the orifice (it is the case only a very large velocities).
Break-up involves two steps, when flow rates of fluids are imposed
* blocking: when fluid A is in the orifice it makes a plug to fluid B
* squeezing: a pressure builds up in fluid B and pinches fluid A until rupture, releasing a droplet
This last step takes a characteristic time &lt;math&gt;\tau \sim d^3/Q_B&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;Q_B&lt;/math&gt; the flow rate of fluid B.
The resulting volume of fluid A inflated during this time gives the droplet volume
:&lt;math&gt;V\sim \tau Q_A \sim \frac{Q_A}{Q_B}d^3&lt;/math&gt;

Since the flow is laminar (small Reynolds number) it is very reproducible and a clock-like mechanism produces very accurate sizes.

=== Assisted by capillary instability ===

This method consists in the formation of a cylindrical jet. It is not really possible in flat microchannel whose height is small, but can be used in ink-jet printers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Rudbeckia triloba''''', the '''Brown-eyed Susan''', is a native wildflower in the Mid-Atlantic, but can also become quite weedy in the garden or field. It is a short-lived perennial, producing flowers in summer and fall. Germination occurs any time during the growing season.

Plants are usually best controlled by pulling. Prevent reseeding by removing spent flowers. 

The plant is sometimes cultivated, so consult the garden planner before eradicating. Spent flowers are sometimes left on the plant to attract birds such as the goldfinch or house finch.

Cold-pile composting is safe if flowers or seeds are not present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Zhōng wén or zhōng guó huà ? ==
* ''many English-speaking students learn to pronounce Chinese (or '''&quot;Zhong-wen&quot;''') using a Romanization system called Pinyin.''

Isn't there a mistake ?
I've learned a bit of chinese and my teacher told me that &quot;zhōng wén&quot; is for the written chinese and &quot;zhōng guó huà&quot; for the spoken chinese.
--[[Special:Contributions/83.134.222.69|83.134.222.69]] ([[User talk:83.134.222.69|talk]]) 15:25, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

Zhong wen is for written Chinese in general (i.e. both trad. and simp.). Pu tong hua, or guo yu in taiwan, or hua yu in Singapore, is the spoken mandarin. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 14:20, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

== zhōngwén or zhōngguó huà ==

There are at least six terms I can think of off the top of my head that have the same essential meaning,that is, (Mandarin) Chinese. 

(1)zhōng guó huà (Chinese) this is a colloquialism or conversational word and inaccurate, implying that all of China speaks Mandarin when in fact there are over fifty ethnic minorities and thousands of dialects.  Considerable populations (tens of millions)on the mainland speak the Shanghai dialect or Cantonese(although Mandarin is the 'standard' national language).

(2)pǔ tōng huà, (lit. &quot;common&quot;) this term was adopted perhaps for the reason above and refers to the same language.

(3)hàn yǔ, (literally &quot;the language of the ''Han''&quot;(ethnicity)) Over 90% of the population in China is considered to be of the ''Han'' ethnicity. 

(4)guó yǔ, (lit. (the)national language). The usefulness of this term is limited at best, Japan uses the identical term with confusing results(i.e. ''which'' nation).

(5)huá yǔ,here &quot;huá&quot; is an extremely formal word for &quot;China&quot; and so &quot;Chinese&quot;. However, I've never seen this term used outside of a dictionary, perhaps because &quot;huá&quot; has ethnic connotations. For example, one could change one's nationality and become a Chinese citizen (theoretically) but would have to have a father who is ethnically Chinese before they could be considered &quot;Chinese&quot; in the sense of &quot;huá&quot; or &quot;huá rén&quot;.

(6)zhōng wén, strictly refers to written Mandarin.  In conversation however this distinction is optional, a quick search over the internet reveals native speakers using this term to indicate the spoken language and even the titles of some textbooks include the term &quot;shuō zhōng wén&quot;(speak Chinese).

The standardized international Chinese proficiency test is known as the HSK or hànyǔ shuǐpíng kǎoshì and uses the term &quot;hànyǔ&quot; the major of Chinese language study in Chinese Universities and Colleges is known as &quot;hànyǔ&quot; (Chinese)or &quot;hànyǔyán&quot;(Chinese Language).

The point may be moot however, in the article, the author is in fact referring to the written language (and the romanisation thereof).

[[User:Weiming2|Weiming2]] ([[User talk:Weiming2|talk]]) 03:51, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

:I suggest 汉语 ''hànyǔ'' with a side note stating other ways of saying it (i.e.: Weiming2's suggestions) ––[[User:MathieuGPL|MathieuGPL]] ([[User talk:MathieuGPL|talk]]) 07:20, 13 February 2010 (UTC) 

== How many people speak Chinese (Mandarin) ==

&quot;Mandarin Chinese is the most common language in the world. In fact, over 800 million people speak this dialect of Chinese. That's more than one out of every seven people!&quot;

This answer is misleading.  The language is spoken by the largest ''number'' of people, but the language is not necessarily as widespread as other languages. English is the official language in 55 countries, French:29, Arabic:24, Spanish:20 and Chinese:2. The Chinese mainland has a population of over 1.3 billion a great number of them speak Mandarin along with a local dialect, which accounts for the vast majority of the mammoth figure of 800 million. While immigration trends and the emergence of China as a world power may soon change this fact, it should be noted that although over 800 million speak the language, perhaps more than 90% of that 800 million are Chinese citizens conversing with each other in China and Taiwan.

I believe this statement needs to be changed or updated to reflect the above facts.

==Cantonese==
Cantonese is NOT Mandarin. It is a lot more complicated than Mandarin. People speak and write in completely different ways. There are nine intonations. It doesn't have the R sound. It has LOTS of glottal stops...[[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 14:18, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

==Formatting &amp; corrections==
&quot;the character for sun (rì -which sounds like &quot;rurr&quot;) was originally a circle with a dot in the center, an attempt to draw a sun.&quot;
* remove &quot;an attempt to draw a sun&quot; it isn't necessary
* perhaps you can replace the text describing the pictograph with the actual pictograph itself [[http://www.internationalscientific.org/CharacterImages/Lst/L20000/l25700/L25728.gif here it is]]

&quot;The modern character is a vertical rectangle divided in half by a horizontal line. It is a 4 stroke character.&quot; 
*same theme..make the text more concise and easier to read  ' That same character is now written as  日  it has 4 strokes.' ––[[User:MathieuGPL|MathieuGPL]] ([[User talk:MathieuGPL|talk]]) 07:20, 13 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

greetings, user 66 53 211 10.
Allow me to introduce myself. I am chazzJr, one of the contributors Around here, however, i work only in the magic sector, and sometimes it gets lonely over here and it gets to be a bit tough to do work in the magic sector, so coud you see if you coud help me?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mixing molecules in a solute is a crucial operation for biological analysis or chemical reactions.
We will see in this chapter a specificity of microfluidics: mixing is long.

== Origin of diffusion in a liquid: brownian motion ==

In a liquid all molecules are agitated due to their temperature. A big molecule embedded in a liquid is thus subject to continuous water impacts by neighbour molecules. This impacts are random and produces step motion in random directions.

To understand the effect of this random motion, we consider a 1D model (along one axis) 
with random steps of finite size &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, that are occurring periodically in time with period &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.

The i-th random step is &lt;math&gt;\ell_i=\pm \ell&lt;/math&gt;, with equal probability for the positive and negative sign, so that the average over time of the step is &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The position after N steps is
:&lt;math&gt; X= \sum_i^N \ell_i&lt;/math&gt;
with an average
:&lt;math&gt;\langle X \rangle=\sum_i^N  \langle \ell_i \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that on average the particle is around the same position.
However the variance is 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle X^2 \rangle=\langle (\sum_i^N  \ell_i )^2 \rangle=\langle \sum_i^N  (\ell_i)^2 + 2\sum_{i&lt;j} \ell_i \ell_j \rangle=N \ell^2&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i^2 \rangle=\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i \ell_j \rangle=\langle \ell_i \rangle\langle \ell_j \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; for uncorrelated events.

Recalling that the number of step is linked to the total elapsed time by &lt;math&gt;N=t/\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\langle X^2 \rangle=D t&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; a diffusion coefficient whose value is here &lt;math&gt;D=\ell^2/\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.

As a consequence a molecules explores a distance of standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\langle X^2 \rangle^{1/2} \sim (D t)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly an assembly of molecules (in a spot of dye for instance) spreads like &lt;math&gt;\sigma \sim (D t)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Diffusion coefficient ==

In a liquid the value of the diffusion coefficient of a particule of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; given by the Stokes-Einstein formula. 
:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{kT}{6\pi \mu R}&lt;/math&gt;
The demonstration of this formula comes the solution for the motion of a particle with two main physical ingredients: a fluctuation velocity given by &lt;math&gt;m\langle u^2 \rangle/2=kT/2&lt;/math&gt;, and a friction forces of value &lt;math&gt;F=6\pi \mu R u&lt;/math&gt;.  

Small molecules therefore diffuse faster 

 Table with values??

Many molecules are characterised by a concentration &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; which is a number per unit volume.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipesummary|Sandwich recipes|1|10 minutes|1|Image=[[Image:Quornpitta.JPG|250px|VDP QE Quorn pitta]]}}
This recipe is my own (still under improvement) version on how to make a QE (quick and easy) alternative pitta. Dubbed the &quot;VDP QE Quornpitta&quot;, this pitta is prepared with Quorn; its suitable to vegetarians. I first came up to the idea of the pitta as I found that the chopped-up Quorn pieces available from supermarkets taste (after microwaving without additives) quite bad. After adding ketchup, it tasted way better, so I started thinking and experimenting and finally came up with blending tomato paste, vinegar, garlic and some red peppers (similar to a regular taco-mix). This sauce I made is however not made with sugar and not greasy (unlike ketchup). I added the whole in a pitta, as this is widely available (you may use other oven-baked breads too). As certain nutritionist organisations have their own version of pitta too to include in their diets, and as the ingredients used here are even better in quality; this is a &quot;very healthy&quot; snack (if you stick to your diet guidelines; e.g., on calories per day, ...)

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Quornpitta_requirements.jpg|right|thumb|150px|VDP QE Quorn pitta required materials]]
For the sauce:
* 1-1 1/2 teaspoons of dried red (jalapeno) peppers
* 1 (240 gm) can tomato paste (double concentrate)
* 2 fresh minced echalottes or 1 large onion
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 4 tablespoons white vinegar
* 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano or several stalks of fresh oregano (or to taste)
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin (or to taste)
* 1 teaspoon of ground black cardamom

For pitta and Quorn:
Pitta and Quorn are to be bought as is (look for good quality; that is low-sugar/fat/calorie pittas)

==Procedure==
#Combine the ingredients for the sauce and make sure its smooth (crush/brooze onions, fresh leaves with utensils). Microwave the sauce (make sure its in a tupperwave pot so it doesn't make a mess) for 2 minutes. Stir the sauce, make sure its not dried out (add some vinegar if too dry) and put in for 2 minutes more. The sauce can be then set aside.
#Now put the Quorn inside the microwave for some 1-2 minutes. Mix sauce and Quorn and make sure its smooth (so that the whole looks like a paste rather than meat); put this again inside the microwave for 2 minutes. 
#Prepare the pitta as indicated or use the pitta as is.Now put the sauce with the Quorn stirred into it inside the pitta.

== Introduction ==
'''This page introduces a few ''existing'' templates''', and others can be found:
*'''To ''make'' a template or ''modify'' one''', refer to [[Editing_Wikitext/Templates_A101|Templates A101]].
*'''To search for templates ''alphabetically''''' within Wikibooks, (not Wikipedia), follow the link to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AllPages&amp;namespace=10 '''All Templates Namespace'''].
*'''To search for templates organised by ''category''''', follow the link to [[:Category:Templates]].
*'''To search for a template by name''', for example ''dropimage'', then enter the following in the search box on the left of any Wiki page and select ''go'':
{{block|background=transparent|template:dropimage}}

Writers are encouraged to add links for useful Wikibooks templates, perhaps in tabular form within these or other sections.   


==Page Top Sections==
{{Textontop|border=3px dashed brown|1=
{{hiddenh3|Help with the Top Section; template [[template:textontop|Textontop]]}}
The writing of Wikibooks pages gives a rapid education on the need for effort-saving methods.  This becomes all the more obvious when something a little different is needed.

The format used for this top-section is made with the template, [[Template:Textontop|Textontop]].   A border has been applied to show the template's boundary, but it is optional, and would not normally be used for the usual Wikibooks colors. This  layout removes the white-space that usually exists to the right of a page's table of contents.   Notice that ''this'' text starts right at the top.

The template adds the table of contents automatically.  Options are available, and a background color can be added for other layout plans.

An example of this template's use can be seen as the top section of the page [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes|Adjusting Brakes]]. 

On a passing note; it is clear that the need to express image dimensions in only pixels limits the ability to make top sections that adapt to different screen widths.   That is to say, if relative units of measure could be applied to images, there would be great improvement.     

}}
In the event that the top section is to hold images, or images ''and'' text, there are two other templates for that purpose.   Because only ''one'' table of contents can exist on a page, these other templates cannot be demonstrated on the same page as ''Textontop''.   They are:
*[[Template:Image2ontop|Image2ontop]] allows a table of contents and two images or text in place of any of the images.
*[[Template:Image3ontop|Image3ontop]] allows a table of contents and three images or text in place of any of the images.

== Page Building Blocks ==
{{Thetop|w1=34%|br=3px dashed brown|w2=33%|w3=33%|ha2=center|leader={{hiddenh3|Layout Options; template [[template:thetop|Thetop]]}}
Pages each have certain similarities.   Most of the time the text extends across the page and the colorings match the default set.   Sometimes a more complicated layout is needed, and the setting of styles every time becomes laborious.  This becomes especially tedious when there are lots of spaced elements such as tables, lists, images, and text.   This template, within the perimeter border, has both page-wide sections and panels across the page.   There are many options for each of its five parameters and configuring it is straightforward. This text is written in the leader section of the template [[Template:Thetop|Thetop]], and the other sections below include three boxes across the page and a trailer section, similar to the leader.|1=&lt;pre&gt;&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;[[image:crocus_4.jpg|75px]]&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;|2=&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;[[image:crocus_4.jpg|75px]]&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;|3=The sections are adjustable
*Widths can be changed to remove a section or extend another.
*Padding can be changed, and colors too.
*Font details can be changed also.
*To make an empty section, enter a non-breaking space.
|trailer=The width of this building block matches the top section template exactly.   In fact, if it is preferred, ''this'' template could be used for a top section.   By the use of such a building block, greater consistency is afforded, and the addition of background colors allows a more interesting panelled page.

Note that a template is not needed to simply apply a more interesting color to a page.   Writers and editors with this in mind need only place all of their page text within styled HTML &lt;nowiki&gt;''div''&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.   The styling of tags is covered in [[Editing_Wikitext/Class_and_Style_Notes#Figure_5:_Typical_'in-line'_block formats|Typical 'in-line' block formats]], and if necessary, an example can be found near the top of the mark-up text for this page.   

An example of the template's use can be seen throughout the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Tables|Tables]].

}}


== Hidden Contents ==
Sometimes a page gets a bit cluttered.  Much ''detailed'' information is best tucked away where it can be accessed when needed, but where it does not detract from what is being said.

For this purpose there are templates such as [[template:dropimage|Dropimage]]. The quoted example presents a neat box with a heading and a link. The link toggles; left-clicking it the first time drops the box to show the contents.  Clicking the link again closes the box.   The amount of content can be considerable.

Despite their names, both boxes also can contain text or other elements, including other templates. For Dropimage, HTML tables are preferred to Wiki ones. They are useful for making writers tools, where they can sit in the closed state in the sandbox until needed for reference.

Examples of the use of Dropimage are shown below for an image, for text and for an HTML table.   Further examples of its use can be seen throughout the [[Editing_Wikitext|Editing Wikitext]] series.
{{-}}
{{dropimage|align=center|1=Image Example|2=[[image:Crocus_4.jpg|center|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;''A Purple Crocus''}}        
{{tablestyles}}
{{lightcolors}}
{{-}}

== Image Templates==
{{noframeleft|margin=10px|1=[[image:crocus_4.jpg|200px]]|2=Note this frame-less caption.}}
{{hiddenh3|Frameless Image Captions}}
Images cannot include captions unless the image syntax makes use of a ''frame'' or a ''thumbnail''. Borders tend also to be of a standard format and cannot ordinarily be customised. 

These limitations are overcome by using the set of templates [[Template:Noframeleft|Noframeleft]], [[Template:Noframeright|Noframeright]], [[Template:Noframecenter|Noframecenter]],  and [[Template:Noframenone|Noframenone]].  A brief inspection of their names shows that there one for each of the standard image positions.   These templates also have a number of options.

An example of the captioning is given with the image on the left, and can also be seen on the page [[Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/The_Quick_Course|The Quick Course]].
{{-}}
{{hiddenh3|Mouse-over Images}}
Users of Internet Explorer will find that the mouseover functions do not work for them. 
{{HoverImage|Big yellow.jpg|Red chrysanthemum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gerbera:''hover for more&lt;br /&gt;HoverImage as a thumbnail.'' |Chrysanthemum: ''the alternative&lt;br /&gt;HoverImage as a thumbnail.''}}
{{noframeleft|margin=10px|cwidth=200px|{{HoverImage|Big yellow.jpg|Red chrysanthemum.jpg|200px}}|Gerbera:''Hover for the  Chrysanthemum. HoverImage used within Noframeleft.''}}
Images are usually fixed on the page but there is a technique that allows ''two'' images to occupy the same space.   An example is shown on the right. When the mouse moves over the image, a different image is shown instead.   It is designed by persons more clever than me as a template. The whole thing allows the use of the standard image options, and the template is called  [[Template:HoverImage|HoverImage]].

HoverImage's first two parameters are the ''file names'' of the two images to use; the first is the default image and the second is the alternative.   There are separate caption options too; they are written in the same sequence as the image names.   The other options like ''position'',  ''size'', and ''type of border'' can be added and apply to both images at once.   The template can be used in places where a normal image syntax line is used. The code to make the hover-image on the right is just:
{{-}}
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{HoverImage|Big yellow.jpg|Red chrysanthemum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Gerbera:''hover for more&lt;br /&gt;HoverImage alone as thumbnail.'' |Chrysanthemum: ''the alternative&lt;br /&gt;HoverImage alone as thumbnail.''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}
If the template is used for images with different shapes, some improvement is achieved by setting the height exactly and by setting the base dimension as some impossibly high value; in this way both images will be set to the intended height.   Note also that the entire template can become the ''content'' of the [[Template:Dropimage|Dropimage]] template, and still works well; in this event set the image option to ''center''.

The unwanted white border in the image example is not a fault in the template but is a consequence of using images with frames on a colored page background; it is a bug. To avoid this, simply use a frame-less image.   If a caption is needed as well then use the HoverImage template as the image parameter of e.g., ''Noframeleft'', to make a frame-less image ''with'' a single caption.  The image on the ''left'' was made in this way.   The coding for mouse-hover frameless images with a single caption is just:
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{noframeleft|margin=10px|cwidth=200px|{{HoverImage|Big yellow.jpg|Red chrysanthemum.jpg|200px}}|Gerbera:''Hover for the  Chrysanthemum. HoverImage used within Noframeleft.''}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

== Information Boxes ==
{{technote|content=This box is made with the template [[template:technote|Technote]] and is intended for use at certain points within a technical page, possibly for excessively terse points that most choose to ignore.   Since the heading can be changed also, it can take on any useful form for which the green tick-mark image is suitable.}}
{{-}}
{{caution|content=This box is made with the template [[template:caution|Caution]] and could be used in pages to focus attention on possible hazards or difficulties needing more careful attention.   It is similar in that the heading can be rephrased; thus it could also be used to indicate an error, or any form for which the red cross is appropriate.}}
{{-}}
There are many information boxes available within Wikibooks.   The majority of them find use for  administrative comments and reminders.   The background color and the text alignment are options.   As is clear from the above examples, the text can also contain hyperlinks.       
{{-}}

== Highlight Blocks ==
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style = &quot;background:lightyellow; color:navyblue;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}
The above example shows another box, this time made with the template [[template:block|Block]] to emphasise the code lines that need to be learned for some context or another.

It uses a Courier font for programming and mark-up code descriptions.   It is intended for single lines though it will expand, and background color, font, alignment, and other elements are options.

At a more general level, the template can be used for page-building.   When one instance of the template immediately follows another, color banding becomes possible.   Since it is based on the ''div tag'' it has very few differences from the main page.

A version called [[template:blockwrap|Blockwrap]] also exists to be contained in sections of text that wrap left or right.  This was needed to overcome a bug, where ''divs'' insist on using the  full width of a page.

The template ''Block'' stacks neatly top to bottom for page-building like this:
{{block|background=beige|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;|background=Beige|ta=left|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;|background=Ivory|ta=left|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
{{block|background=mistyrose|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;|background=mistyrose|ta=left|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
{{-}}

===Banded Bullet Points===
{{container|align=center|width=80%|1=
{{dul|The usual bullets make use of the page formats as its defaults.}}
{{lul|'''''These''''' bullet points are banded and although the coloring normally extends across the entire available width, both the width and position of the container are options. }}
{{dul|They are clumsy by template standards since they need the use of the three separate templates [[template:Container|Container]], and within it a stack of [[template:Dul|Dul]], and [[template:Lul|Lul]] to make it work.}}
}}
Although this set of templates lacks elegance it has been found to save time over the more laborious method that involves a custom table.   The template call for the above example uses a custom width and position and looks like this:
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{container|align=center|width=80%|1=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dul|first point}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{lul|second point}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{dul|third point}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;etc...&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;}}

== Hidden Headings ==
As will no doubt be known, every heading in a Wiki is listed as a link in the table of contents.  

Sometimes, there is no need for a table of contents entry, but a heading is still needed.   This is one way to avoid too many levels within the contents box.  For this purpose, the set of six templates [[Template:hiddenh1|Hiddenh1]] through [[Template:hiddenh6|Hiddenh6]] has been made to imitate the heading styles.

For example, the use of   ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Hiddenh3&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' corresponds to a ''level three'' heading in Wiki, and an ''h3'' heading in HTML. Use them, for example, within drop-boxes, where otherwise closed boxes might cause listing confusion.   Because they are not taken formally as listings, it will not be possible to link to such headings as would otherwise be the case.   
{{-}}


== Drop Capitals ==
{{drop|A}}drop capital is this big letter at the start of the paragraph.   It is sometimes used in art work or to start stanzas in prose, though at the most general level, it finds use where there is no formal heading style.  It is a form of text emphasis, in that it directs attention to the start of a section.

The example uses the template [[template:drop|Drop]].   It is only the first letter that is contained in the template call, and in every case, the next text character, (ignore any space), is typed hard left against the template's closing brackets.

For those who need a more complicated format of their own, it will be necessary to make one, since as far as is known, this is the only one on file.   A point worth noting is that drop capitals are unlikely to line up vertically, unless a mono-spaced font is found for the purpose.  For this reason they tend to be used far enough apart to avoid the discrepancy.    
{{-}}

==Writers' Data Lists==
While working on a page there is often some CSS code or color format that needs reference. To avoid the need for page-searching a number of templates containing such information can be placed adjacent to the work, on the page or sandbox, ready for use.   The lists are compact since they are hidden in drop-boxes until they are needed. The list so far includes these:
*[[template:Tablestyles|Tablestyles]]; ''a list of CSS styles and HTML attributes of particular use for making tables. The text also contains notes on code spacing and priorities.''
*[[template:Lightcolors|Lightcolors]]; ''a list of selected pastels and light color names, with their RGB and HEX values.''
*[[template:Mediumcolors|Mediumcolors]]; ''a list of medium density color names and their codes.''
*[[template:Darkcolors|Darkcolors]];''a list of dark colors and their codes.''
*[[template:Greycolors|Greycolors]];''a density spaced list of greys with their RGB values.''   
*[[template:flowers|Flowers]];''a gallery of high quality flower thumbnails for quick image-finding.''

&lt;/div&gt;

For information on what problems FlaggedRevs Extension addresses you can look into [http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/134584 this text from wiki/foundation].

*This looks fine to me currently. I suggest we double-check with [[mw:User:Voice of All|Aaron Schulz]] what this means for our current [[WB:NPP|patrolling]] scheme &amp; depending on the answers tweak this or simply enable with these settings. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:08, 17 June 2008 (UTC)
::{{support}} I agree with mike, I like these settings. They make a good starting point and if we find that they need tweaking later we can always do that. Getting something in place now will help us to understand the benefits and drawbacks of this extension and will help us to make more informed decisions later, if such decisions need to be made. If we do get these installed, I say we attempt to revisit the decision in about 6 months to make sure the software is meeting our needs. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:48, 17 June 2008 (UTC)
::[[Image:Emblem-fun.svg|15px]] '''I agree because&amp;nbsp;''' this may help improve book quality and these settings are reasonable.

::{{support}} This is a long time coming.  I've heard about this being in the works for some time in one form or another, and Wikibooks is a good place to try something like this out on a slightly larger scale than a test server.  I agree with Whiteknight's suggestion that we come back and review this in six months to see how it is working out.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 05:13, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]

      <comment>clarify that this is about DOS and Windows &amp; not other environments.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This manual explains how to install and setup CS Command Line Tools, so you can run any of these commands from any point in the command line. This manual is focused on DOS and Windows command line environments. Other OS environments may have equivalent or near equivalent commands but the command line tools for those will be different and the design philosophy of those tools may be different. Care should be taken to find out the differences between near equivalent command line tools if you are in a multi-OS environment. 

First, you should download all the files you need from the sourceforge.net project named &quot;CS Command Line Tools&quot;: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cs-cmdtools/. If you wish to install CS Command Line Tools you have to download the installer (cscltYYYY[MM]_ins.exe). Alternately you can download the companion compressed packages (cscltYYYY[MM]_pak.zip or cscltYYYY[MM]_pak.7z), which contains the same files as the installer. You should pay attention to the launch date of both the installer and the packages; you may need to download more tools or newer versions of some tools, as these packages only contain software made until that date.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The installer is little more than a self-extracting archive, since it does not perform any kind of setup for you. You still have to refer to section 3 and make the required system modifications. In order to extract all tools contained in the installer, take the steps below:

#Execute the installer by left-clicking on its icon.
#Click the &quot;Next&quot; button after the welcome window appears.
#In the new window, check the checkbox left to &quot;I accept the terms in the License Agreement&quot;. Then click the &quot;Next&quot; button again.
#Check the components you want to install (all components are checked by default) and click the &quot;Next&quot; button.
#The installer showing the component selection windowThe installer showing the component selection window
#Choose the directory where you want CS Command Line Tools to be installed (default is C:\WINDOWS\Command or C:\WINNT\Command). After checking, click the &quot;Next&quot; button once more.
#Choose the Start menu directory for CS Command Line Tools. Click the &quot;Install&quot; button to proceed to installation.
#Check the actions you wish to do after the installation process and click the &quot;Finish&quot; button to close the installer.
Note: If you check the option &quot;Run CS Command Line Tools YYYY[-MM]&quot;, you will run &quot;CmdLine.bat&quot;. You can call any of the installed commands from that console. However, they may not run from another console.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==3.1 · Under Windows 95/98==
If you extracted the executables to the directory &quot;C:\WINDOWS\Command&quot;, then you are done with the setup. Otherwise take the following steps (we refer to the directory &quot;C:\Command&quot; as an example):
#Extend the Start menu and choose &quot;Run...&quot;.
#Type &quot;sysedit&quot; in the edit box of the new window and click the &quot;OK&quot; button below.
#In the System Configuration Editor, select the child window titled &quot;C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT&quot; to see the contents of that file.
#Add the path &quot;;C:\Command&quot; to the entry starting with &quot;SET Path&quot;, as shown in the image below (do not forget the semicolon). If that entry does not exist, type &quot;SET Path=C:\Command&quot; in a new paragraph .
#Save changes before you exit the editor and reboot the computer so the changes take effect.

==3.2 · Under Windows NT/2000/XP==
Assuming that you have administrator privileges, take the steps below:
#Extend the Start menu, choose &quot;Settings&quot; and then &quot;Control Panel&quot;.
#In the new window, double-click the &quot;System&quot; icon.
#In the &quot;System Properties&quot; window, select the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab and then click the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button.
#4. In the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; window, highlight the &quot;Path&quot; system variable (located in the box at the bottom) and click the &quot;Edit&quot; button, as shown in the image below.
#Add &quot;;C:\WINDOWS\Command&quot; to the contents of the edit box located at the bottom of the new window (do not forget the semicolon) and click the &quot;OK&quot; button.
Note: If you extracted the executables to other directory, then you must add the path for that directory instead.

If you do not have administrator privileges, then you have to take the following steps:
#Take the necessary steps (indicated above) to open the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; window.
#Click the &quot;New&quot; button located at the middle of that window, as shown in the image below.
#3. In the new window, type &quot;Path&quot; in the first edit box and type &quot;C:\WINDOWS\Command&quot; in the edit box below that one, as shown. Then, click the &quot;OK&quot; button.
Note: If you moved the executables to other directory, then you must type the path for that directory instead. Also, if the &quot;Path&quot; user variable exists, you only have to add the path to that directory (do not forget to use a semi-colon to separate the fields).

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can verify if the setup was done correctly by taking these simple steps:
#Open the command prompt. You can open it by extending the Start menu and choosing &quot;Programs&quot;, then &quot;Accessories&quot; and finally &quot;Command Prompt&quot;.
#In the new window type the name of a command that you have downloaded, for example &quot;typehex&quot; (if you have it), and press ENTER.

You should see something similar to the output represented in the image below (actually, the output can vary depending on the command that you just typed and also on the version of that command). If you see a message like &quot;'typehex' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file.&quot;, then it is most likely that you did not set the &quot;Path&quot; environment variable correctly.

What would be useful: length, reviews, study questions. Maybe a link to each video - [[discuss this video]], creating a disussion page for each were we could discuss how we use it in class, and so on? --[[User:Piotrus|Piotrus]] ([[User talk:Piotrus|talk]]) 14:14, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Further sources:
* FRONTLINE seems to have a good selection of free, full lenght online documentaries [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/us/]
* Media Education Fundation has a good list of documentaries. They videos themselves are not free, but there are sometimes additional resources (study guides, trailers, etc.): [http://www.mediaed.org/videos]

Another thought: I've learned about existence of expensive sociological videos (often between $100-$300). I don't know who has funds to buy them - and I don't think they are useful to be listed here, if the only way to obtain them is to pay such a horrendous price... --[[User:Piotrus|Piotrus]] ([[User talk:Piotrus|talk]]) 18:56, 8 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>substituting Template:Unsigned</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==My thoughts ==

Here's my two cents on these proposals:

- Is it really necessary to flag templates? I think this would be a ''bad'' idea if it is necessary to re-link all of the references to the template to the stable version...though I confess I don't know how this flaggedrevs thing will work.

- I think instead of 4 flags we can just make sure that the flagging page has an (easy to see) link to the requirements (if we have any) for something to be considered &quot;stable&quot;, and to [[WB:FB]] to show what the featured book requirements are.

- What is the fourth level? I assume that it is &quot;unstable&quot; and doesn't count under $wgFlaggedRevValues?

- What is meant by editcomments? Why is this a requirement?

- Agree about the email. 

- I don't think it should be necessary for them to have a user page, since this is about content in the main spaces anyways...

What do you all think? Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 01:03, 5 June 2008 (UTC)
:The idea with requiring a userpage is that they need some level of dedication to the project. If you have a userpage, that reflects some (small) level of dedication.
:editcomments means using the [[m:edit summary|edit summary]] - this is some indication the user is a serious contributor
:There are no longer 4 levels.

I was looking at the current default settings and comments for this extension and noticed that there seemed to be some assumptions wrong based on how some things were set. Whether this is due to some confusion that we might need to have clarified from the developers or changes made by the developer since Mike first prepared a general proposal for the settings, I don't know. I've updated the proposal, but I doubt its what Wikibooks would want to use. From what I understand after reading the comments for the default settings, each flag has an associated level between 1 and X, with a corresponding system message we'll need to set. Do we want just one flag than? Like a quality flag between 1 and 3 with 0 being unset, or something different? There is also a minimum level for each flag for a revision to be considered a quality revision and a minimum level that all flags must be set to for a revision to be considered &quot;featured&quot; --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:36, 7 June 2008 (UTC)

== Bot approval for inital sighting of authoritative pages ==
''moved from [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance#Bot approval for inital sighting of authoritative pages]]''

I am [[meta:User:Melancholie|User:Melancholie]], [http://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Benutzer/bureaucrat?uselang=en bureaucrat and sighter] on the [[w:als:Houptsyte|Alemannic Wikipedia]], [http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Spezial:Benutzer/sysop?uselang=en SysOp and sighter] on the [[wikt:de:Wiktionary:Hauptseite|German Wiktionary]] and operator of MelancholieBot for example. I want to apply for the &quot;editor&quot; right (= &lt;u&gt;sighter&lt;/u&gt;) also on this wiki:

The reason for this request is that I do have a ''bot script'' available that can help you with the initial sighting process (&quot;&lt;u&gt;FlaggedRevs&lt;/u&gt;&quot;) for foolproof pages! Why? Not-yet-flagged pages will appear with a red exclamation mark, even if a sighter edited it. A sighter will have to sight it afterwards, even if the page has only been edited by absolutely trustworthy users in past! That's much much unneeded work!

My script will &lt;u&gt;minimize and fasten up your extra work&lt;/u&gt; on this by sighting (flagging, marking) the latest revision of all reliable and clean pages (templates, images, articles; redirects) automatically, based on a &lt;u&gt;user whitelist&lt;/u&gt;!
# Step #1:
#* Currently, only all [[Special:UserList/sysop|SysOps]] of your wiki are on this list.
#* If you could confirm that your [[Special:UserList/bot|flagged bots]] did and still are working well ''(in respect of hidden spam/vandalism)'' I will add them too, what would be very important for the efficiency within the article namespace!
# Step #2:
#* Furthermore, please confirm that the content contributions of your [[Special:UserList/editor|sighters]] have been - respectivaly &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; (the latest revision gets flagged only) - free of spam and vandalism. With adding also all sighters to the whitelist&lt;!--(maybe [[Special:EmailUser/Melancholie|e-mail]] me names of users you may like to be excluded from the list)--&gt;, you could have the biggest benefit in respect of &lt;u&gt;unnecessary work&lt;/u&gt; you will ''not'' have to do ''manually'' on your own!
#* Are there any reliable users, that are not yet allowed to sight?

You will be able to have an eye on that process all the time at [[Special:Log/review]], by the way! But first I have to have the right to flag (sight) on this wiki. --- Best regards, [[User:Melancholie|Melancholie]] ([[User talk:Melancholie|talk]]) 05:51, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

:By the way: If you should have any general problems (layout etc.) with the FlaggedRevs extension, please let me know. --- Best regards, [[User:Melancholie|Melancholie]] ([[User talk:Melancholie|talk]]) 06:07, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

:The new set of tools are on a trail phase yet, until we figure out if the advantages and existing limitations (some that are particularly problematic to the Wikibooks setup were we have almost self contained multiple sub-projects) are worth all the &quot;trouble&quot;.
:After the test and if the decission is to keep the new system, further deliberation and reshuffling work is needed to make things clear to the community until we can use something like a sighters whitelist. I would also like to know if your script can be examined (source)?
:In any case all this makes your request a bit premature...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:33, 27 November 2008 (UTC)
:See the newly approved [[Wikibooks:Bots]] policy and place the request in the [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] when you feel it is right. (You will probably have to replicate most of what you already stated here.)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:40, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

::Do you have some good links to discussions about that &quot;some that are particularly problematic to the Wikibooks setup were we have almost self contained multiple sub-projects&quot; issues? --- Best regards, [[User:Melancholie|Melancholie]] ([[User talk:Melancholie|talk]]) 22:18, 27 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Most of what has been said has been done on the IRC channel but you may find some useful comments on some of the problem on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]], I could repeat them here for you but it will all need to be well argued later, on the future discussion to keep/or not the toolset, consider the implications regarding our particular setup (the differences from Wikipedia or Wikitionary), even that dictates how the community interacts differently within the project, this has impact on several issues from content quality to licenses.
:::Personally I'm not enthusiastic about the new setup, the issues it addresses aren't as relevant to us (Wikibooks), and most can be resumed to cosmetic (all improvements) and procedural alteration with no particular benefit to us (I do see some as useful to other Wikimedia projects), some of the features would be great if the toolset were directed more to our particular needs.

:I like this idea very much, in some ways. However, I am not sure it makes good sense for us here right now. We're naturally drifting towards using this extension to judge page quality, not just to verify that it doesn't contain spam or vandalism. A bot just can't use the same kind of judgement that a human can when judging a page for quality. Marking a page as being &quot;trusted&quot; to not contain vandalism is interesting, and maybe other editors will be supportive of that (I might support it too, after some consideration), but I'm not sure that is something that's helpful to us. I would definitely like to hear some more opinions on this matter. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:19, 28 November 2008 (UTC)
:: I think being able to trust the accuracy of a page is much more important to readers than whether a page is free of vandalism and spam. At least if I was going to read a book from Wikibooks, accuracy would be more important to me anyways. I think vandalism and spam would often be obvious to most readers. However I also think a page that has correct spelling and grammar, good structure, consistent style, is verifiable and has good or great coverage is going to be both free of vandalism and spam, and be what readers are going to be looking for. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:02, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

::: I disagree that using the lowest values for this purpose makes sense. Doing so could lead to associating poor quality with vandalism when poor quality is not always due to vandalism. Associating all forms of poor quality with vandalism would be to fail to assume good faith. For example poor quality could be the result of a non native speaker who is doing their best to try to help improve a page. I think calling a person a vandal or their contribution vandalism due to only being non native wouldn't be good and would only diminish the friendly and open atmosphere of Wikibooks. Even a native speaker who knows a lot about a subject might not be that great at expressing concepts, but can still help improve books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:46, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

== Autopromotion requirements ==

I would like to recommend that we drastically lower and simplify the requirements for people to be autopromoted to +Editor. I don't know what the current requirements are, but I do know that it's a complicated list. We have had requests for promotion from several people who definitely should have been flagged for autopromotion, but had not been for unknown reasons. I suggest that users be autopromoted to +Editor at the same time and under almost the same conditions as the software currently uses for +Autoconfirmed status. Here are the requirements I propose:
# Have an account for at least 4 days. This is the current requirement for +Autoconfirmed.
# Have at least 10 edits of any size in any namespace.
We need more good people to be automatically flagged and promoted by the system. This is the only way that we are going to be able to get pages reviewed and keep them up-to-date with reviews. Also, it will help to reduce several problems I've been seeing. One example of a problem is the case of class projects, where students are making edits that are not visible by default. This happens when one prolific editor (like a teacher) makes an edit to a page, which automatically marks the page as sighted. Then, when the non-editor students edit the page, their contributions are not visible without review. This is obviously terrible for class projects, and can be very difficult to work around for very large books or for very large class sizes. Thoughts? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:57, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: I think the spacing and benchmarking settings are the two that are seriously delaying auto promotion for people who should be able to review pages. I think we need to understand better what those two settings do exactly before messing with them. I don't think changing any other settings will make much difference without first trying to improve those two settings. I think possibly those two settings are causing a delay of 45 days or more for auto promotion. I think if those two settings were lowered there should be less delays.
: I also think some people are overestimating the problem. About 87% of pages are reviewed if I'm reading the statistics correctly. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:55, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: Personally I think 10 edits and 4 days just isn't enough. In that time the user won't have even begun to learn the basics of the manual of style, the appropriateness of content here and so on.

::Although I do still think there needs to be better clarity around what the requirements are as this would reduce the number of requests for the permission and more likely to stick around contributing until it was met. To use me as an example of why I think this is a problem, based on the latest stated criteria:

::*Account is 30 days old - '''First edit was 2 October 2007 - pass'''
::*100 edits (excluding deleted edits)  - '''about 1,500 - pass'''
::*15 edits spaced at least 3 days apart are needed (which takes at least 42 days) - '''since 23 December, which was 45 days ago I have 1,500 edits - pass'''
::*10 recent content edits (50 content edits total) on 10 unique pages. ''' As above, pass'''
::*at least 50 edit summaries used. '''Every edit has a summary - pass'''
::*Must have an email confirmed and enabled in Special:Preferences  - '''Yes. Pass'''
::*Must have a userpage (min size 1 byte) - '''Yes - pass'''
::*Must not share an IP with other users (at the moment when promotion occurs)  - '''Pass'''
::*Never been blocked or demoted from Editor or Reviewer (such users may make a request, since they will never be autopromoted) . '''Pass'''

::So, obviously I've read something wrong because the software hasn't autopromoted me yet... but it sure isn't clear what that &quot;something&quot; is.

:: The delay ''could'' still be the &quot;15 edits spaced at least 3 days part&quot; criterion.  It seems we don't know exactly how the system judges &quot;at least 3 days apart&quot;, nor how it chooses benchmark edits.  If I start with your most recent edit as a benchmark, then go to the next one that's at least 72 hours before that, and so on, I count 17 benchmarks (the 17th is your first edit, back in October); but if, say, the system rounds down to the day based on dates, so that each pair of edits have to have dates that differ by at least 4, then you've only got 14.  If that were the case, then you'd be autopromoted sometime in the next few days.  If that were the case ''and'' they really meant 15 intervals rather than 15 benchmark edits (or if they define benchmark edits in a way that has the same net effect), then you'd be autopromoted sometime within the next week.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:23, 7 February 2009 (UTC)

:I think 10 edits and a period of 4 days is not enough to stop vandalism by Editors. The vandalism warning on the wikijunior main page currently says that reviewed pages are &quot;guaranteed&quot; to be free of vandalism. Even now I find this statement quite risky. If we lower the requirements to 10 edits and a period of 4 days, I would think that reviewed pages have only a slightly higher chance to be free of vandalism than non-reviewed pages. The whole idea of reviewing would make very little sense to me. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:13, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

::I agree.  The criterion for autopromotion should be strong enough to make vandalism by Editors unlikely.  I believe the only criterion that's probably too stiff right now is the 15 benchmarks spaced 3 days apart &amp;mdash; and I'm waiting to see just when QuiteUnusual gets autopromoted before deciding how I think those numbers should be adjusted.  I do think a large number of benchmarks is desirable, because it's an excellent measure of commitment to the project (and, on the flip side, gives the user an opportunity to ''develop'' commitment to the project).  The biggest question in my mind is what &quot;''n'' days apart&quot; actually means, and therefore what number of days between we ought to be asking for.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 16:01, 8 February 2009 (UTC)

: My first reaction is to not do anything drastically. I agree with darklama that this isn't necessarily such a big issue.
: Still, all we really need is to set the criteria high enough so that we can catch &quot;bad&quot; contributors before they get editor status (as opposed to identify the &quot;good&quot; ones so we can &quot;promote&quot; them). I think the spacing criteria is unnecessarily complex and unless it's really useful ''and'' can be easily epxplained to users (it seems that we don't have a good idea of how it works ourselves) we should just drop it. I looked at the extension and help page on MW, but couldn't find details on what constitutes a &quot;recent edit&quot;. Does anyone know?
: The others are mostly fine. A hundred edits is reasonable, but we could safely bring the account age down to a couple of weeks (hardly too long for committed contributors). I'd be weary about changing too many of these at once. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:54, 9 February 2009 (UTC)


=== Account is 30 days old ===

This doesn't make any sense, especially since we have the requirement below which is 42 days. Why does it need to be this long? A person is autoconfirmed in 4 days, can upload images and move pages in that time. Being an +Editor doesn't mean that the person has a great grasp of our editorial standards (that's what +Reviewer is for), it just means that the person can recognize what is and is not vandalism. +Autoconfirmed is what we already use to weed out vandals (since image and page-move vandalism is the worst, and this is what +Autoconfirmed prevents), so that should be enough to separate the good from the bad contributors. This should be 4 days, there's no need for it to be any longer. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:26, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

:I disagree. +Editor is intended for people who have a grasp of Wikibooks' editorial standards. +Reviewer is almost completely pointless here. The only thing a +Reviewer can do that an +Editor cannot do is mark a page as feature quality. With that in mind, 30 says is about how long it takes to become familiar with Wikibooks' editorial standards. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:05, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

::I favor keeping the 30 days.  As for the function of +Editors, it seems to me the truth is a bit of each of the two views mentioned.  An +Editor is someone who is trusted to judge whether an edit should be allowed in to the default revision, visible to the general public by default.  ''Part'' of that has to do with vandalism; the +Editor should know what is and isn't vandalism, and there should be exceedingly high confidence that the person did not get the account for the purpose of vandalism (autoconfirmation may cut out the vast majority of vandals, but even I (who don't go looking for such things) have seen vandals create an account and wait four days; and my vandal-exclusion threshold has been formed with Wikijunior in mind).  There is also a degree of editorial screening involved, since even beyond subtle vandalism there are things that should be filtered out, things that should be let through in modified form, and, yes, even things that are flawed but ought to be allowed through anyway.  I'm comfortable, so far anyway, with the current dividing line between +Editor and +Reviewer.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:21, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

::If +Editor means that the user requires a working knowledge of all our best practices, then we should change it so that this is no longer the case. FlaggedRevs wasn't really designed to be used as a comprehensive and sustainable grading system, it was designed as a system to mark pages as being vandalism-free and preventing certain users from seeing page vandalism. This design philosophy is evident, and we are seeing a lot of problems because we are trying to make this tool do something that it's not well suited for. +Editor's should be able to view the page in regards to vandalism and mark it yes/no. If this is all they can do, then there is no reason to place stringent requirements on their autopromotion. If the requirements for autopromotion are too high, then '''autopromotion isn't a useful tool at all'''. We will simply manually promote people when they demonstrate a need for the tool instead of waiting for an autopromotion that is too slow. Autopromotion either helps us distribute the tools to the people who need it, or it doesn't help. In either case, the people who need it ''will get the tools'', but without an agressive autopromotion Myself and others like me will have to waste our time doing it manually. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:28, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I think we're not getting anywhere fast with these seperate views on the purpose of +editors. I think we can all agree that it should be easy for people to get sighting tools to verify pages as free of vandalism, while reviewing tools can require higher criteria.

=== 100 edits (excluding deleted edits) ===

Too many, why 100? A person should be able to become +Editor in 4 days, which is the length of time I recommend. If a person can't reasonably meet the time requirement and the edit requirement at once, they are mutually redundant and not helpful. This should be no more then 40 (10 edits per day). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:26, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: 100 edits in 30 days is a very low edit count in my opinion, that is about 3 edits per day, lower than what you are suggesting. I think the defaults for FlaggedRevs is 300+ edits in 60 days which is about 5 edits per day. I don't think 10 edits per day is very reasonable to expect of volunteers. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:05, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

::100 edits is not lower then I recommend. I recommend ''no more'' then 50 edits, and I'd prefer 10-30. +Editor is currently a tool to grade the quality of a page, which means the ideal +Editor is an active ''reader'', not an active ''contributor''. Again, as I mentioned above, if autopromotion doesn't give people the tools when they need it, then it's broken and useless. I will manually promote people long before they reach all the arbitrarily-high standards that we're setting here. +Editor isn't some big deal, it only gives people the ability to make a review and a recommendation about a particular page. We don't need +Editors to demonstrate themselves to be great wikibookians (+Admin requires those kinds of hoops), we only need to require that people be demonstrably not a vandal. 10 edits proves that a person is not a vandal. 100 doesn't prove anything extra. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:33, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

:::I wasn't talking about the total number of edits but the average per day that it comes out to. A vandal can easily make 10 or even 100 edits. Alone this criteria doesn't mean a thing, but combined with other criteria its useful. So far people have shown a strong desire for editors to prove themselves, so promoting people who don't get autopromoted might be a bad practice on your part if consensus is that editors need to prove themselves some. Maybe Wikibooks isn't using FlaggedRevs as intended or maybe it is. I don't think the intended use of FlaggedRevs really matter if people want to use it a different way. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:10, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I've been looking at the edit histories of several people recently autopromoted, and in practice it's likely to take significantly longer than 42 days.  (BTW, at 7 days between, 28 days would require '''5''' benchmark edits.)  I think a largish number of benchmarks on this criterion is an excellent way of assuring serious commitment to the project (as I've remarked earlier in the general thread), but missing a couple of days &amp;mdash; if it happens to be just before a 3-day interval would end &amp;mdash; can set the whole autopromotion process back two days, which is excessively stringent.  I suggest '''10''' edits spaced at least '''2''' days apart.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:37, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I looked at the source code yesterday for FlaggedRevs. From what I could can tell if my first edit was '''Feb 11 2009 @ 12pm''' that would be my first benchmark. My second benchmark wouldn't be until at lest '''Feb 14 2009 @ 12pm'''. If say I didn't edit again until Feb 25 @ 1pm rather than Feb 14, '''Feb 25 2009 @ 1pm''' would be my second benchmark. My third benchmark would due to the second delay not be until at least '''Feb 28 2009 @ 1pm'''. So I think how often someone edits effects how quickly they will be auto promoted using benchmarking and spacing criteria. I guess 10 edits spaced 2 days apart (or 11 benchmarks) wouldn't be too bad either and could reduce the problem of not editing that often, while still showing interest in contributing to the project over time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:19, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

Meanwhile, here's why the benchmarks criterion is quite different from time since registration plus recent edits.  Suppose the settings asked for 5 edits spaced 6 days apart &amp;mdash; not the settings I favor (as I've said above), but simple to explain.  Now suppose someone creates an account, makes a slew of edits that day, walks away for a year, and then makes ten more.  They've met the criteria for total edit count (what I mean by &quot;a slew of edits&quot;), time since registration, and recent edit count.  However, the initial slew of edits only provide one benchmark because they're all within 6 days of each other, and the edits a year later only provide one benchmark because they're all within 6 days of each other.  On the other hand, the user could satisfy the benchmarks requirement by making a few edits every tuesday for 5 weeks.

=== 10 recent content edits (50 content edits total) on 10 unique pages ===

Why edit more then 10 pages? If a person is creating a new book, they create the TOC, and start working through the book from start to finish. If the person is particularly diligent, it may take a long time before he creates that tenth page. What's the difference really between making 10 edits to 1 page (and making it a very good page) or one edit each to create 10 stub pages? Kill this requirement. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:26, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: I think the current defaults make sense.

::Again, the ability to review a page is indicative of an active ''reader'', not a prolific contributor. If people who made many contributions were automatically good judges of quality, we wouldn't have so many pages of such low quality. There are lots of user accounts around here who have edited more then 10 pages and edited them all ''poorly''. Having any number of edits, or having edited any number of pages doesn't mean the person is a good judge of quality. The only thing an edit count or a page count can help demonstrate is that the person is ''not a vandal'', which is really the purpose of this extension in the first place. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:38, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

::: Alone this criteria is meaningless, but I think combined with other criteria it helps. I think weeding out editors is a good thing. Wikibooks should want high quality edits to stick out above low quality edits, and in order to do that editors need to have some experience telling the difference to be able to grade revisions correctly. Personally I would like it if there was another criteria that could be used to limit promotion: Must have X number of revisions that have been graded above a certain threshold. That would be a bit better than this, but since this is all we got, this combined with other criteria I think is good enough to make some difference. I don't think requiring people to edit at least 10 pages is asking for much. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:23, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

::::I just can't understand what you are talking about. What benefit is there to having fewer Editors then having more of them? It's not just every page that needs to be reviewed (and we have thousands of pages), but it's ''every revision'' of every page going forward that needs it. A page that is reviewed is out of date and needs to be re-reviewed again after a non-Editor edits it. Given our current activity levels, we just don't have the mass of Editors available to keep up with all the good content edits that people are making.
::::Trying to sequester this tool, and trying to keep it out of more hands does no good and does seem to be causing substantial harm. I have received no less then '''three separate requests from authors to disable FlaggedRevs from their books''', because it is disrupting the ability of contributors to even see the edits that they are making. Now I know that we can't really disable the extensio on a per-book basis, and I've had to send out several appologetic emails in response to tell people this. FlaggedRevs is having the opposite net effect from what we wanted when we first installed it. Instead of improving Wikibooks by increasing page quality and stabilizing books for classes, it's hindering Wikibooks by hiding improvements from readers and preventing class projects from using our site. In an ideal setting, all these different requirements for autopromotion make good sense. I agreed with them all when they were first put onto the table. However, we're seeing the real-world effects of these things now and the system ''is not working the way we had intended it to work''. We have to look at this issue with an eye not towards what we would like ideally, but instead with an understanding of what the real effects are. FlaggedRevs is causing problems, and if we refuse to fix it reasonably, then I'm going to strongly suggest we uninstall it completely. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:23, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: I don't think ''every revision'' needs to be reviewed at once.

I doubt people will support uninstalling the extension if they want to keep most of the configuration as is. If you want more people to see things from your point of view I suggest you begin by agreeing to decreasing the rate for benchmarks and spacing first as people seem to agree with that, than if that is not enough people are more likely to consider other changes. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:23, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

(unindent) Well, this is a bit away from where this tread has gone, but I think 10 pages is too much.  I have worked very hard for a bit more then a month and my editing has been confined to two pages.  I suspect that that this criterion is what has kept me from getting editor privileges automatically (maybe not, I have no idea what recent means in this context.)  So taking myself experience guide, requiring two distinct modules?  If you really take the time to make them them good, that is a lot of work.  I have to agree with  [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]], we have a lot of room to choose from, but I do think the current system is not welcoming to new editors.  As a comment on salesmanship, we auto change the term &quot;editor&quot; to &quot;publisher&quot;.  Anyone who edits a page is an editor.  I was an IP editor for a while before I opened an account and even then I was an editor, editing that should not be discouraged. Implying someone is less then an editor even though they actively make changes to modules is discouraging. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|contribs]]) 21:22, 15 February 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I agree with Darklama that someone working on less than ten modules is well enough aware of the standards to be able to validate pages. For sighting, however, I think it doesn't matter how many pages a user edits. This is one of the reasons I proposed we limit +editors to sighting.
: On the recent edits front, I think it is useful to require a certain number of recent edits. Can anyone confirm how recent &quot;recent&quot; is?

=== At least 50 edit summaries used ===

I rarely use edit summaries because I feel that many edits I make are self-explanatory and non-controversial. This might not be one of our &quot;best-practices&quot;, but I won't support a requirement on new users that's more steep then we require of our older users. Kill this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:26, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: I think using edit summaries is a good practice. With the current settings half of a contributor's edits need an edit summary. I think this is ok, maybe a bit high. I wouldn't object to having this set to 25 so that 1/4 of a contributor's edits need to have an edit summary. I don't think anything lower than that would be helpful. Edits aren't self-explanatory. You would actually have to view a diff to know what was changed. Good edit summaries can help reduce that need. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:05, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Edit summaries are a good practice.  Also, considering that the section name automatically generated when editing a section counts as an edit summary, to get past the other criteria with fewer than 50 edit summaries you'd probably have to habitually not write summaries ''and'' habitually use the page edit tab for everything.  I have no problem asking +Editors to at least have learned how to follow better practices than that, even if they do consciously choose not to follow those practices later on.  I'd be tempted to suggest increasing this number, but I don't feel strongly enough about it to justify going against the headwind it looks like I'd encounter.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 01:48, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

: I think edit summaries are a very good practice. It is the nature of misunderstandings that you don't expect them and a short notes are an enormous help in tracking down versions in edit histories. There is little or no benefit in omitting these and I'd wholeheartedly support the suggestion to increase the ratio (that should give it a bit of a gust from the stern &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt;). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:13, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

::There's a difference between saying that it's a good practice and saying it should be a requirement. Keep in mind that +Editors don't have any special &quot;power&quot; over a page, they can only mark a page as being of a particular quality. If somebody can explain to me how writing edit summaries is in any way related to a person's ability to judge the quality of a page, I would love to hear that. Keep in mind that this is just an automated tally, it doesn't say anything about the quality of those edit summaries. A person who wanted to bypass this requirement could simply [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk%3AFlaggedRevs_Extension&amp;diff=1408526&amp;oldid=1408520 put random gibberish into the summary box] and it would count. If a person needs +Editor and aren't using edit summaries, they are going to get manually promoted anyway. So in those cases, the autopromotion requirement really isn't a help, it's a hinderance. A system that produces too many false negatives is a huge waste of time and resources, because good editors are going to have to manually promote all the people that the system forgot. Putting in all sorts of unrelated and unhelpful requirements into the system just increases the number of false negatives and therefore increases the workload at [[WB:RFP]].

: I don't think this matters much either way. For those who think userpages are useful, I think the red-links in the signature is motivation enough to set something up. I've seen plenty of userpages for users who never contributed much. My userpage isn't very descriptive and I just use it as a scratch-pad for what I'm up to.

:: I find the &quot;It's just one byte.&quot; argument for keeping this requirement rather weak.  Certainly if we require only one byte then we are not specifically asking people to list any useful information.   It also has the following effect, an editor may be excellent, but may not bother looking up the details of how auto promotion works.  It is my opinion the requirements would be set up in such a way that such people should be auto promoted anyways.  This requirement may prevent this from happening.

:::: A possible middle ground occurs to me (though one mightn't have guessed there would be a middle ground on a yes-or-no setting).  The problem appears to me to be internet-cultural:  As I remarked earlier, in principle it seems to me like a good practice to provide potentially useful, project-relevant information to other editors (small 'e') about one's capabilities and, sometimes, interests; for example, when I first created my own user page on wikipedia, nearly the only information on it was {{tl|User en}}.  However, in internet culture, when a website asks for a user page, it's usually about socializing &amp;mdash; e.g., &quot;I'm a left-handed transsexual who likes cats and mexican food.&quot;  So when we say &quot;Thou shalt have a user page&quot;, and we ''don't'' say anything about why, people think, &quot;Why are you requiring me to talk about cats and mexican food?&quot;  Perhaps providing a small hint when listing this requirement, like a reference to [[Wikibooks:Babel]], would remediate this problem? --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:35, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

=== Summary ===

There hasn't been much activity here lately (about a month now). In the interest of moving this long, here's a summary of the discussion above:

;[[#Account is 30 days old]]
: Stays for now. No agreement.
;[[#100 edits (excluding deleted edits)]]
: Stays for now. No agreement.
;[[#15 edits spaced at least 3 days apart (takes at least 42 days)]]
: '''Lower''' this to ''10 edits, spaced 2 days apart'' as a first step. This has been identified as one of the major mysteries and potentially the cause why people aren't getting flagged for +editor. Some favour dropping it while others reducing it.
;[[#10 recent content edits (50 content edits total) on 10 unique pages]]
: Stays for now. No agreement as one side wants to get more people sighting while the other wants to ensure the reviewing tools are in proper hands. This impass may be solved by restricting the +editor flag tools to sighting.
;[[#At least 50 edit summaries used]]
: Stays for now. No consensus, general agreement or overly strong arguments either way.
;[[#Must have an email confirmed and enabled]]
: Stays as it is. Consensus that this is useful.
;[[#Must have a userpage]]
: '''Drop''' this. Some dislike this requirement and no-one feels strongly about keeping it.
;[[#Must not share an IP with other users at the moment when promotion occurs]]
: '''Drop''' this. No-one defends this.
;[[#Never been blocked or demoted from Editor or Reviewer]]
: Stays as it is. No-one objects.

There are a number of changes for which there seems to be consensus. Let's implement the agreed on changes and see what effect they have. Who has access to the extension settings? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:54, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

I think we've had it active for long enough now that we can start to evaluate what changes, if any, we would like to try to make to it. My personal recommendation is to use only a single metric to grade the quality of the page not three separate ones for composition, accuracy, and coverage like we have now. We could have a single &quot;Quality&quot; metric with values like: Unreviewed (default), vandalism-free (pages get autopromoted to this when a +Editor edits the page, so no manual review is required), Good, and Featured Quality. Less effort to review and grade a page means it's more likely that pages are going to be reviewed. It also means more pages are going to be reviewed in less time. Thoughts? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 19:57, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: I like the three metrics. I think its helpful to know what people think of the page's composition, accuracy and coverage. I think they fit really well with the main things people need to pay attention to to make books better for readers. I think the only downside is that reviews aren't accumulative which means you only get an idea of what the last version who happened to review a revision thought, and not what the average person thinks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:02, 6 February 2009 (UTC)
::I would disagree with you completely. If we want a holistic review of the page, we should ask a person for an over-all review of the page. By asking for an arbitrary set of reviews, we're asking the user to focus on a small handful of things and miss the big picture. A page can get good marks in composition, accuracy, and coverage, and still not be a good page overall. I don't want to say it's going to be a common occurance, but we're asking our Editors to ignore the forrest so they can see the trees. If we want to know if a page is good quality, we ask our Editors if the page is good quality. We don't ask them a handful of related questions and try to interpret those three answers to get an idea about page quality. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:40, 11 February 2009 (UTC)
::: I disagree. An overall review isn't going to help editors know what to focus on improving. That is the only benefit I see in having flagged revision. An overview would still leave editors having to guess what other editors consider wrong with a revision, the same sort of guess work that would happen without flaggedrevs, so if we do that, we might as well not have flaggedrevs at all. Editors need to see both the forest and the trees. Editors need to know what needs to be improved in order to improve the quality of pages. I think having feedback from users would also be helpful. Wikibooks needs to turn on the feedback configuration option for that. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:18, 11 February 2009 (UTC)
::: I'm going to have to agree with Darklama here. Assuming that people who are reviewing pages would put in the effort to develop an opinion on what needs to be changed, it is potentially very useful information for those who seek to make improvements. Of course, talk pages could be used for the same purpose, maybe we should encourage this instead? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 00:09, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
:::: I think encouraging both would be good. I think the more ways Wikibooks has for providing feedback the better. Some people will prefer some methods of providing feedback over others, so the more options people have, the more likely feedback will be provided. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:26, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
::: I agree with darklama and Mattb. I think the details give contributors, readers and future reviewers useful information. Should we feel that not enough modules are getting reviewed, we can consider simplifying these to lower the threshold, but I think it's fine for now. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:52, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== Reducing editor tools to sighting ==

The recent discussion seems to draw two main viewpoints. One contends that established editors (who would benefit from begin able to sight their own work) aren't being granted editor status early enough. The other that they need more time to get accustomed to editorial standards before getting the tools that allow them to grade the quality of modules.

It seems that a reasonable solution is to limit editors' reviewing tools to mere sighting (which is really all that normal book editors need or, from what I gather, want) but reduce the criteria for auto-flagging to a moderate period that allows us to catch unhelpful contributors, mend their ways or ban them. Reviewers would be the only ones with the tools to actually review and grade content, and could be held to whatever standards we feel necessary. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:36, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think that change might be necessary. I think changing $wgFlaggedRevTabs to true might give even anonymous editors the option to see the latest revision when editing, and adding &quot;$wgGroupPermissions['autoconfirmed']['autoreview'] = true;&quot; should let any user after 4 days to have there edits sighted automatically even if they cannot review pages until they become an editor. I think these two changes would be less intrusive, but at the same time this means that vandalism can be seen again by readers, unless an editor reviews a page as being of good quality rather being marked as sighted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:50, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Well, if I understood your proposal correcly, they seem somewhat similar. Your's has +autoconfirmeds doing sighting, +editors doing general reviewing, and +reviewers doing reviewing up to featured. Mine would then be largely the same, but without a special tier for featured, general review has to be manually granted, and we have a bit more control on who gets sighting (auotoconfirmed is just 4 days, right?).
:: I don't think we should let every four day old contributor editor sight pages as that seems a little easy for small-time vandals to pass. An edit count threshold would help.
:: Setting $wgFlaggedRevTabs to true might be a good idea whatever way we go.
:: I think there is a good argument for manually flagging those who wish to validate pages. The criteria needn't be high, people would simply provide a few links to content that they'd edited and unless someone had editorial comments (poor spelling, structure, etc.) they'd get the tools.
:: The benefits would be two-fold. First off, this simple process would bring interested Wikibookians closer to the community, make them better aware of the standars (how many month-old editors do you reckon will have read [[Help:Revision review]]) and uses (as well as pitfalls) of validating pages, and even encourage them to make that part of their Wikibooks activity.
:: The second is that while passing the current +editor criteria should have given users the time to learn the syntax and get a footing with the Mediawiki software, it in no way qualifies anyone to write good prose. New contributors should nominally be concentrating on writing content, rather than marking books in active development as good quality without realising that this is going to block autoreviewed edits by other +editors. All that most Wikibookians really need (and I count myself in that) are sighting tools. As Whiteknight pointed out, the revision quality is a seperate feature.
:: Finally, as [[User:Thenub314]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;curid=112405&amp;diff=1408469&amp;oldid=1407172 noted] in the general reading room, the terminology of +editor being somewhat exclusive is a bit odd. It would be better to make that the most inclusive tier. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:16, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

::: Yes I think you understand how my proposed changes would work. I don't think you completely understand the effects of your proposal though. &quot;Featured&quot; is a built-in tier too which is met when the maximum rating has been given regardless of what it is called. If we got rid of &quot;featured&quot; as a rating level, revisions that have great composition, great accuracy and great coverage would be considered featured quality instead. I don't like the idea of placing the burden of reviewing edits on reviewers because edits either won't get reviewed above sighted or administrators will get overburden with requests for the review flag.
::: Honestly I think editors shouldn't be validating or reviewing there own edits at all. I think limiting validation or reviews to reviewers would actually discourage people from contributing to the project and create a bigger divide among community participants, rather than encourage people to understand standards and encourage community involvement. Contributors would have to rely on the judgment of reviewers and hope there is a reviewer interested in reviewing their work, rather than rely on the judgment of their fellow editors or there own judgment.
::: I think your proposed changes would actually make the editor flag less inclusion. I think the editor flag is more inclusive now because editors can review pages not just sight them. I think allowing autoconfirmed users to sight pages would be a bit more inclusive.
::: Some other options include disabling autoreview altogether so the latest revision is shown unless sighted or otherwise reviewed, allowing contributors with the editor flag to give and take the reviewer flag from themselves, or dropping FlaggedRevs altogether because Wikibooks could use a more flexible extension more targeted/aimed at grading book quality. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:33, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: I wasn't actually suggesting we get rid of featured. I'm only suggesting modifying the +editor tools, not reviewer.
:::: The only way to prevent Wikibookinas from reviewing their own edits is to have them go through a manual process. I don't see us getting over-burdoned with +reviewer flag requests. We normally don't hear much from the vast majority of the [[Special:Statistics|over 900 users]] who contributed to Wikibooks over the last month. I'd call us lucky if we got one percent of these a month. Most people just seem to work on their own corner.
:::: The existance of a reviewer community might actually draw more people into the general community. We could set up a list of books whose authors have requested be reviewed. As Wikibookians cannot review their own work, it is in their interest to review other people's books to reduce the backlog.
:::: My proposal would allow us to make the +editor flag more inclusive: By restricting the tools, we can all agree to lower the criteria and thus let more people get the flag sooner. (Here I understand ''inclusive'' to mean number of people that pass the criteria, not the extent of the tools).
:::: Your last option, dropping FlaggedRevs, hasn't been discussed much. I guess it warrants a seperate section. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:24, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

I'm afraid I haven't got enough time to read this in-depth, but from skimming it, I agree with Swift here. We should make editor a lightweight permission suitable for just reviewing vandalism. Reviewer should be the more comprehensive permission requiring a better working knowledge of how Wikibooks works. If FlaggedRevs is going to be successful for us, we need people to use it - currently the requirements for autopromotion are preventing that. This is a wiki &amp; openness is a strength. I think we were too concerned with keeping vandals out when we first discussed this - and that includes myself. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:51, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

: The current autopromotion settings are clearly unreasonable; there seems to be pretty wide agreement on that.  So, doesn't that mean that we don't have any real experience on which to base judgments about how well the rest of the current arrangement ''would'' work ''if'' the autopromotion settings weren't out of whack?  (I'll stipulate that $wgFlaggedRevTabs is orthogonal to how many or few +Editors there are, so I see no difficulty in judging it now.)  It's not at all clear to me that sighting should be merely certifying non-vandalism &amp;mdash; for pages in the earliest stages of development, sure, &quot;not vandalism&quot; is probably close to the right criterion for sighting a revision; but as the quality of the page goes up, oughtn't one exercise at least a little more editorial attention in sighting?  The arguments against this seem to be that (1)&amp;nbsp;the demand for sighting cannot be kept up with by the available pool of registered users with editorial savvy, and (2)&amp;nbsp;community coherence is ill served by having a small elite group of users who are allowed to sight.  Both of these arguments assume, though, that the shortage of +Editors is due to a lack of users with editorial savvy, when we ''know'' that the shortage of +Editors is to some (perhaps quite large) degree an artifact of the maladjusted autopromotion settings.

: Could we change the benchmarks/spacing to 10 benchmarks 2 days apart, and let the consequences of that play out while we debate these other issues?  It seems a bit unnecessary to not do that much just because more might ultimately be needed.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 05:17, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree we should change the benchmarking/spacing now and see how it plays out. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:11, 16 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Yes, let's change the criteria we currently agree on (I've just added a [[#Summary]] to the criteria discussion).
:: One can, indeed, say that we don't really know how things would work if editors were flagged with +editor properly. However, that's not all. We have different opinions of what proper flagging should be. One side wants to give more ready access to sighting tools, while on the other want's to uphold some standars to the reviewing process. What I'm proposing is that these aren't mutully exclusive views &amp;mdash; as long as we split the +editor flag up along these lines.
:: I suggest that for now we split this up to allow lowering the criteria for sighting tools even further while being conservative in whom we grant reviewing tools (as there are downsides to reviewed pages which those wielding the tools must be aware of). Once we get a better experience with this, we can reconsider granting those with the +editor flag the current reviewing tools. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:14, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
::: I agree these aren't necessarily mutually exclusive views. What I disagree with is that the +editor flag has to be split up in order to achieve your proposal. I think FlaggedRevs can be setup to auto sight any revision edited by an emailconfirmed user for instance. This would allow revisions to be sighted without needing to have the editor flag and would allow editors to continue to review pages without having to be manually given that capability. I think that approach would satisfy people who want minimum requirements for being able to sight pages, while also satisfying people who want editors to be able to review pages and be able to do so using an auto promotion process. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:34, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

:::: Actually, I believe there should be a degree of editorial wisdom applied ''to sighting'', a position that is rather fundamentally inconsistent with making sighting trivially easy.  I've never been sold on the idea that the FlaggedRevs page review stuff is at all useful here ''except'' as part of sighting; I always figured I'd wait and see how it worked out, but it never has worked, nor even failed to work, because the still-unexplained sluggishness of autopromotion has kept editors too few and far between for a realistic test of the review-beyond-sighting concept (which has also interfered with the sighting facet, of course).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:41, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Writing a C Addon for Io =
This example will show you how to create a new Addon written in C that can be included in and built along with the Io source package. The example addon shown here is a very minimal object with one method that returns self. We will call it ''TrivialObject''.

For an introduction to creating C++ bindings, see [[Io Programming/Binding Io to C++ | Binding Io to C++]].

This skeleton was based on Steve Dekorte's Zlib addon sources.

== Addon Structure ==
An Io addon is comprised of a few parts:
* ''build.io'', which defines the addon by cloning AddonBuilder and specifying system dependencies and/or performing other pre-build operations.
* ''depends'', a text file containing a one-line list of other Io addons that this addon depends on, if any.
* &quot;protos&quot;, a text file containing a one-line list of the proto names offered by this addon.
* ''io/'', a directory containing your Io script to include with the addon (named ''YourAddon.io''). If all your code is in C and you have no additional Io methods to define, as in this example, you may not need anything here.
* ''source/'', a directory of C and/or C++ sources and headers to build into the addon library. As above, if all your code for this addon is written in Io, you may not need anything here.
* ''tests/'', a directory containing a battery of tests to be run to validate this addon.

== Creating the Addon ==
=== Addon Structure ===
Create these files and folders using this structure under the Io source tree:
* io/
** addons/
*** TrivialObject/
**** build.io
**** depends
**** io/
**** source/
***** IoTrivialObject.h
***** IoTrivialObject.c
**** tests/

=== Files ===
Now write the file contents:

==== build.io ====
 AddonBuilder clone do(
 )
For such a simple object, we don't need any dependencies, but they could be specified using:
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnBinding(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnHeader(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnLib(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnFramework(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnInclude(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnLinkOption(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnSysLib(name)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;dependsOnFrameworkOrLib(frameworkName, libName)&lt;/code&gt;

#include &quot;IoState.h&quot;
#include &quot;IoTrivialObject.h&quot;

// _tag makes an IoTag for the bookkeeping of names and methods for this proto
IoTag *IoTrivialObject_newTag(void *state)
{
	// first allocate a new IoTag
	IoTag *tag = IoTag_newWithName_(&quot;TrivialObject&quot;);

	// record this tag as belonging to this VM
	IoTag_state_(tag, state);

	// give the tag pointers to the _free, _mark and _rawClone functions we'll need to use
	IoTag_freeFunc_(tag, (IoTagFreeFunc *)IoTrivialObject_free);
	IoTag_markFunc_(tag, (IoTagMarkFunc *)IoTrivialObject_mark);
	IoTag_cloneFunc_(tag, (IoTagCloneFunc *)IoTrivialObject_rawClone);
	return tag;
}

// _proto creates the first-ever instance of the prototype 
IoObject *IoTrivialObject_proto(void *state)
{
	// First we allocate a new IoObject
	IoTrivialObject *self = IoObject_new(state);

	// Then tag it
	IoObject_tag_(self, IoTrivialObject_newTag(state));

	// then register this proto generator
	IoState_registerProtoWithFunc_(state, self, IoTrivialObject_proto);

	// and finally, define the table of methods this proto supports
	// we just have one method here, returnSelf, then terminate the array
	// with NULLs
	{
		IoMethodTable methodTable[] = {
		{&quot;returnSelf&quot;, IoTrivialObject_returnSelf},
		{NULL, NULL},
		};
		IoObject_addMethodTable_(self, methodTable);
	}

	return self;
}

// _rawClone clones the existing proto passed as the only argument
IoObject *IoTrivialObject_rawClone(IoTrivialObject *proto)
{
	IoObject *self = IoObject_rawClonePrimitive(proto);
	// This is where any object-specific data would be copied
	return self;
}

// _new creates a new object from this prototype
IoObject *IoTrivialObject_new(void *state)
{
	IoObject *proto = IoState_protoWithInitFunction_(state, IoTrivialObject_proto);
	return IOCLONE(proto);
}

// _mark is called when this proto is marked for garbage collection
// If this proto kept references to any other IoObjects, it should call their mark() methods as well.
IoObject *IoTrivialObject_mark(IoTrivialObject* self)
{
	return self;
}

// _free defines any cleanup or deallocation code to run when the object gets garbage collected
void IoTrivialObject_free(IoTrivialObject *self)
{
	// free dynamically allocated data and do any cleanup
}

// This is the one method we define, which does nothing but return self.
IoObject *IoTrivialObject_returnSelf(IoTrivialObject *self, IoObject *locals, IoMessage *m)
{
	// A method should always return an IoObject*
	// Per Io style guidelines, it's preferred to return self when possible.
	return self;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Building ==
When &lt;code&gt;make addon TrivialObject&lt;/code&gt; is run, first &lt;code&gt;build.io&lt;/code&gt; is loaded and run. In our case it does nothing, but it could specify dependencies, perform system commands, or even trigger external make operations as in the case of SGML.

Next, the source tree is configured and AddonBuilder creates a new file in the source/ directory called IoTrivialObjectInit.c to serve as the entry point to the addon's library. The exact of this file depend on the number and types of files found in '''source/''' as described below.

'''IoTrivialObjectInit.c'''
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &quot;IoState.h&quot;
#include &quot;IoObject.h&quot;

IoObject *IoTrivialObject_proto(void *state);

void IoTrivialObjectInit(IoObject *context)
{
	IoState *self = IoObject_state((IoObject *)context);

	IoObject_setSlot_to_(context, SIOSYMBOL(&quot;TrivialObject&quot;), IoTrivialObject_proto(self));

}
&lt;/pre&gt;
As you can see, it defines &lt;code&gt;IoTrivialObject_proto(void* state)&lt;/code&gt; which initializes the addon by adding a new slot to the VM context named for the addon, and sets that slot to the brand new prototype created by IoTrivialobject_proto.

AddonBuilder builds an addon into the addon's _build directory. Within this directory you may find:
* _build/
** dll/ — Dynamic libraries are built here.
** headers/ — Any *.h files from the source/ directory are copied here.
** lib/ — Static libraries are built here
** objs/ — .o/.obj files produced by the build are placed here

After building, the Io install process then copies the entire addons/ directory to its final destination (e.g. /usr/local/lib/io/addons).

== Using Additional Sources ==
In a more complicated addon, there may be multiple source files in ''source/'' that exist for various purposes. These files are treated differently by AddonBuilder based on the format of their filenames.

* Any file in the source directory with the extension .h will be copied to _build/headers.
* Any source file named with the pattern Io*.c or Io*.cpp, and '''does not contain underscores''', will be treated as source code for an Io proto.
** These files may contain a line containing &lt;code&gt;docDependsOn('''Name''')&lt;/code&gt; to specify that the source depends on the object file produced by compiling a file called &lt;code&gt;Io'''Name'''.c&lt;/code&gt;. The sources will be built in an order specified by these dependencies.
** Each proto source files will have a corresponding entry generated in the addon's Init file: &lt;code&gt;IoObject *'''IoFileName'''_proto(void *state)&lt;/code&gt;
* Files named with the pattern Io*.c or Io*.cpp '''and containing underscores''', e.g., '''IoExtra_source''', are treated as &quot;extra&quot; sources, and will have a corresponding entry generated in the addon's Init file to perform their initializations: &lt;code&gt;void '''IoExtra_source'''Init(void *context)&lt;/code&gt;
* Any source file that contains &quot;Init&quot; in its name will be ignored, except for the automatically-generated Init file for this addon.
* All other files in the directory are ignored by AddonBuilder.

== Testing ==
Validation tests for your addon can be written and then run using &lt;code&gt;make testaddons&lt;/code&gt;.

To write a test:
* Create a file named '''run.io''' in the ''tests/correctness/'' directory of your addon tree to find and run any unit tests in the same directory.&lt;pre&gt;TestSuite clone setPath(System launchPath) run&lt;/pre&gt;
* Create test scripts under ''tests/correctness'' which clone UnitTest and use assertions to validate your conditions.

===Suspended solids dried at 103-105&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C===

Suspended solids are an important indicator of water quality. A well mixed sample is filtered through a weighed standard glass-fibre filter and the retained residue dried and reweighed. The main issue that makes this process tricky in salt lakes is the presence of salts in the water. If these are not rinsed completely out of the filter, the dried salts will be recorded as part of the mass of suspended solids. Very dense brines do not rinse out of the filter easily, and so a predilution step is advisable.

===Apparatus required in addition to analytical scales===
*Induction stirrer, 
*glass-fibre filters (GD 120, to retain particles &gt;2.7micron) 
*sartorius filtration support set or similar, 
*beakers, 
*drying oven, 
*dessicator, 
*wide bore pipettes, 
*deionised water, 
*vacumn apparatus, 
*aluminium weighing pans or pieces of aluminium foil. 

===Method=== 

Turn on the analytical scales (0.1mg) and allow to equilibrate. Weighing too soon is inaccurate. Allow twenty minutes for equilibration. 
    
Weigh filter and weighing pan, and record weight. Apply filter to sartorius unit, wrinkled side up. Be aware that the filter may not seat properly, so seat filter by wetting it with a little distilled water first.

Start vacumn.  

Where samples contain high levels of salts, they should be diluted to seawater equivalence PRIOR to filtering. Very saline water is viscous and will neither filter easily, nor rinse from the filter. For example, waste brine from solar salterns needs diluting 1:10 with deionised water before it is of a similar salinity (and viscosity) to seawater. 
 
The predilution prevents the measurement of filter-entrapped salts as 'solids'. It is necessary to record the dilution amount so that the final calculation can be corrected. 

Continuously stir sample while pipetting a measured volume onto centre of filter. After filtration, wash sample through with five 10mL volumes of distilled water.  

Remove filter carefully from the filter support unit and transfer to the weighed pan. Dry for at least one hour at 103-105oC, cool in a dessicator to 'balance temperature' and weigh. Repeat the drying/weighing cycle until the weight change is less than 0.5mg. 

===Calculation=== 

mg total suspended solids/L = [(A-B)x1000] / sample volume in mL

where 

A = weight of filter + dried residue in mg

B = weight of filter in mg 


===Things to be aware of with this method===

Weighing while the sample is hot gives an unstable reading. Use the dessicator to cool the sample to the same temperature as the balance. 

Sometimes your sample volume may be too large and your filter may clog up. Start again with a smaller volume. Ideally you would use sufficient sample to produce between 10mg and 200mg of dried solids. Use 'typical' values from the list below to decide what volume is required. 


If too small a volume is used, you will not gain an representative measure. 


List of typical suspended solids loads found in various waters:
*Marine waters 5-80mg/L, typ 25, so a litre is a reasonable sample
*Salt lake waters 0-80mg/L, needs diluting, filters don't deal with huge volumes so between 750mL and a litre is a reasonable sample
*River waters 0-200mg/L, headwaters frequently &lt;10, Australian lowland rivers may be 200, so sample a litre of very clear headwaters, ranging down to about 100mL for very turbid lower Murray water  
*Stormwaters 80-100mg/L, so sample between 200mL and a litre  
*Raw sewage 200-350mg/L, so sample between 100mL and 500mL  
*Treated sewage 100-200mg/L, so sample between 200mL and 750mL

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

To generate random numbers the &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; method can be used, which returns a {{java:double}}, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

The following code returns a random integer between n and m (where ''n &lt;= randomNumber &lt; m''):

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-30&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.30: A random integer.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  int randomNumber = n + (int)(Math.random() * ( m - n ));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Alternatively, the &lt;code&gt;java.util.Random&lt;/code&gt; class provides methods for generating random {{java:boolean}}s, {{java:byte}}s, {{java:float}}s, {{java:int}}s, {{java:long}}s and 'Gaussians' ({{java:double}}s from a normal distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0). For example, the following code is equivalent to that above:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-31&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.31: A random integer with Gaussian.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  Random random = new Random();
  int randomNumber = n + random.nextInt(m - n);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

As an example using random numbers, we can make a program that uses a Random object to simulate flipping a coin 20 times:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-25&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.25: CoinFlipper.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.util.Random;

public class CoinFlipper {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // The number of times to flip the coin
    final int TIMES_TO_FLIP = 20;
    int heads = 0;
    int tails = 0;
    // Create a Random object
    Random random = new Random();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; TIMES_TO_FLIP; i++) {
      // 0 or 1
      int result = random.nextInt(2);
      if (result == 1) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Heads&quot;);
        heads++;
      } else {
        System.out.println(&quot;Tails&quot;);
        tails++;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(&quot;There were &quot;
            + heads
            + &quot; heads and &quot;
            + tails
            + &quot; tails&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1='''Possible output for code listing 3.25'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;

There were 9 heads and 11 tails
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Of course, if you run the program you will probably get different results.

== Truly random numbers ==

Both &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class produce pseudorandom numbers. This is good enough for a lot of applications, but remember that it is not ''truly'' random. If you want a more secure random number generator, Java provides the &lt;code&gt;java.security.SecureRandom&lt;/code&gt; package. What happens with &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class is that a 'seed' is chosen from which the pseudorandom numbers are generated. &lt;code&gt;SecureRandom&lt;/code&gt; increases the security to ensure that the seed which is used by the pseudorandom number generator is non-deterministic &amp;mdash; that is, you cannot simply put the machine in the same state to get the same set of results. Once you have created a &lt;code&gt;SecureRandom&lt;/code&gt; instance, you can use it in the same way as you can the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class.

If you want ''truly'' random numbers, you can get a hardware random number generator or use a randomness generation service.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution Pollution] also occurred because people were living so close to animals that they could get sick more easily from them. This connects with disease because animals can spread disease.

==Unsanitary Conditions==

These were in part caused by how people lived very close to each other and their animals. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsanitary Unsanitary] conditions helped diseases spread more easily.

==Overpopulation==

Now that people needed to work less time, they had time to reproduce. Since no one was used to so many babies being born, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population population] became too much for them to handle. This could cause a shortage in food, and could also cause wars.

==War==

People now had more valuable property. If you had something another village wanted, they could try to take it. Your village would then recoil by declaring [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war war]. War, along with growing food, depended on weather at least partly.

==Dependency on Weather==

Now, people were dependent on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weather weather]. If there was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought too little rain], then plants would die. If there was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flood too much rain], then plants would drown. Nature became unalterably entwined with early people’s lives.

==Use, Limitations, and Options==
===Use===
----
Similar in use to the existing preformatting tags, but with styling options. The code to call the template and the result is shown below.

{| align=center style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot; 
 ! Example A
 ! 
 ! Result A
 |-
 | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;||border=1px solid gray|background:lightyellow|font=monospace|color=green|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;c&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;e&lt;br/&gt;
f&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;i&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;j&lt;br/&gt;
k&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;l&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;o&lt;br/&gt;
p&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;q&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;r&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;br/&gt;
u&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;v&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;w&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;y&lt;br/&gt;
z&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 | width=100px|&amp;nbsp;
 | {{{{PAGENAME}}|border=1px solid gray|background=lightyellow|font=monospace|color=green|
a  b   c    d     e
f  g   h    i     j
k  l   m    n     o
p  q   r    s     t
u  v   w    x     y
z
}}
 |}

'''Example B:'''

The preformatted text template '''Pretext''' is used here as a parameter of '''Prettypre''' to show the formats;  the template is called for use with:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{prettypre|border=1px solid dimgray|background=papayawhip|width=400px|align=center|{{pretext}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
'''Result B:'''
{{prettypre|border=1px solid dimgray|background=papayawhip|width=400px|align=center|{{pretext}}}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Limitations===
There is a slight control of how overflow is handled, though care is still needed to shorten the preformatted text to fit the page, if it is not to project beyond the right border.

For those looking for a method to wrap long lines but preserve preformatting of other lines, the CSS ''Pre-wrap'' value of the ''White-space'' property will do this;   at present Opera 8 and beyond support the value, Firefox 3 onwards supports it, and I am uncertain about Internet Explorer 7.   Please consider these browser compatibility issues before modifying the code.

===Options===
;align: text alignment; left, right, or center. Default: left.
;border: border, takes format eg; 1px solid black. Default: 0px.
;background: block background color. Any. Default: transparent to give same as page.
;color: font or foreground color. Any. Default: inherit from page
;font: font family, size, style, etc. Default: inherit from page
;overflow: sets how to handle text overflow. Visible, hidden, scroll, auto. Default: auto.
;style: allow complete control over styling the preformatted box
;width: block width, default 100%

      <comment>/* TCP */ to list more than one IP in acl, separate by semicolon</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== RTP ==
RTP streams use multicast IP adresses like 224.0.0.56 (default) and UDP datagrams for transport. Multicasts are generally not allowed in Internet (blocked by ISPs). RTP is designed for low latency.
=== Server ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; $ pactl load-module module-rtp-recv &lt;/source&gt;
=== Client ===
; [http://videolan.org VLC] : [http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-howto/en/ch09.html RTP docs]

== TCP ==
Only uncompressed audio is supported. 
=== Configuring the Server ===

This process is rather simple. You will need to load [http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/Modules#module-native-protocol-unixtcp module-native-protocol-tcp]. You can optionally specify an &lt;tt&gt;auth-ip-acl&lt;/tt&gt; to permit/blacklist anonymous connections from specific ips or IP ranges (to list more than one, separate by semicolon).

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=192.168.1.138
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Configuring the Client ===

Simply set the environmental variable &lt;tt&gt;PULSE_SERVER&lt;/tt&gt; to the destination and PulseAudio will redirect the stream over tcp to the provided destination.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ PULSE_SERVER=192.168.1.146 totem
&lt;/source&gt;

 |-

Hi,

My name is Seungwon Yang.  I'm a grad student in the Digital Library Research Laboratory at Virginia Tech.  Before I create The ETD Guide in wikibooks.org, a written permission from UNESCO under GFDL was sent to Urbane Reece at urbane.reece@hotmail.co.uk, who is one of the admins at wikibooks.org (Please see the copy of the permission from UNESCO at the end of this message). 


UNESCO originally published The ETD Guide online at http://etdguide.org/etdguide.pdf. Then, two undergrad student at Virginia Tech updated its information and migrated to our local version of wiki at http://curric.dlib.vt.edu/wiki/index.php/ETD_Guide.  Now, we would like to move this guide from our local wiki server to wikibooks.org so that the members in ETD and digital library community could update and add more content of The Guide efficiently.   If there is anything that I need to do to satisfy the requirement for publication at wikibooks.org, please let me know.  Thank you very much. 

Regards, Seungwon Yang

 * InstaView - a Mediawiki to HTML converter in JavaScript
 * Version 0.6.1
 * Copyright (C) Pedro Fayolle 2005-2006
 * //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pilaf
 * Distributed under the BSD license
 *
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 0.6.1
 * - Fixed problem caused by \r characters
 * - Improved inline formatting parser
 *
 * 0.6
 * - Changed name to InstaView
 * - Some major code reorganizations and factored out some common functions
 * - Handled conversion of relative links (i.e. [[/foo]])
 * - Fixed misrendering of adjacent definition list items
 * - Fixed bug in table headings handling
 * - Changed date format in signatures to reflect Mediawiki's
 * - Fixed handling of [[:Image:...]]
 * - Updated MD5 function (hopefully it will work with UTF-8)
 * - Fixed bug in handling of links inside images
 *
 * To do:
 * - Better support for &lt;math&gt;
 * - Full support for &lt;nowiki&gt;
 * - Parser-based (as opposed to RegExp-based) inline wikicode handling (make it one-pass and bullet-proof)
 * - Support for templates (through AJAX)
 * - Support for coloured links (AJAX)

A rafsi (affix) is a (usually) abbreviated version of a gismu (root/basic word) or a cmavo (structure word). They cannot be used alone, but may be compounded in order to create a lujvo –- a more complex word that derives its meaning from the rafsi that compose it (according to Lojbanic grouping-rules). A rafsi may not occur alone; however, a Lojbanic text may have a word that is spelled/said the same way as a rafsi.  Such occurrences are in actuality an attitudinal or sumtcita, for example: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;rafsi&lt;/i&gt;: po'o = Japanese...; &lt;i&gt;attitudinal&lt;/i&gt;: po'o = the only relevant case&lt;/b&gt;.

== Rafsi list ==

Below is a table of words. The first column is the rafsi; the second column is the gismu from which the rafsi are derived; the third column is the English keywords of the gismu. This table is composed of rafsi and rafsi-meaning since the [[Lojban/Rafsi/Great Rafsi Reallocation (1993)|Great Rafsi Reallocation]] of 1993. For a full list of both types of rafsi, see: http://www.lojban.org/files/history/bothraf.txt . For a full list of [[Lojban/Rafsi/Prior to Reallocation (1993)|pre-Reallocation rafsi]], click the [[Lojban/Rafsi/Prior to Reallocation (1993)|link]].

      <comment>/* Object Timelines */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page gives an explanation of some of the new features in Celestia 1.6.0. It is targeted at add-on creators who have some familiarity with making SSC files for earlier versions of Celestia. Each feature description is divided into two sections: background and 1.6.0 changes. The background section explains how a particular features of Celestia works in 1.5.0 and provides some motivation for why enhancements were made in 1.6.0. In all cases, backward compatibility with Celestia 1.5.0/1.5.1 has been maintained: add-ons written for 1.5.0 will work identically in 1.6.0.

= New Object Classes =

== Background ==

A body in an SSC files may be assigned a class that determines how it is categorized in Celestia's solar system browser. In some cases, the body's class also controls certain aspects of its appearance. For example, cometary dust tails are only shown for objects marked as class comet. Here is a typical usage in Celestia 1.5.0:

 &quot;Ceres&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;asteroid&quot;
     Radius 487.5
     ...
 }

The available classes in Celestia 1.5.0 are:
 * planet
 * moon
 * asteroid
 * comet
 * spacecraft
 * invisible

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

The 1.5.0 object classes are unchanged, but Celestia 1.6.0 adds several new object classes.

=== dwarfplanet ===

In 2006, the IAU passed a controversial resolution on the [[w:IAU definition of planet|definition of a planet]]. [[w:Pluto|Pluto]] was stripped of its planet status and reclassified as a member of the a new category of objects called ''dwarf planets''. [[w:Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], largest asteroid, and [[w:Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], the largest known Kuiper belt object, were also designated dwarf planets. To date, these plus [[w:Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] and [[w:Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]] are the only five objects recognized as dwarf planets by the IAU, but there are very likely to be more. A body may be marked as a dwarf planet by assigning it the class dwarfplanet:

 &quot;Ceres&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;dwarfplanet&quot;
     Radius 487.5
     ...
 }

In Celestia's 3D view window, dwarf planets are distinguished from planets with distinct orbit and label colors. Other than this, there is no difference between a dwarf planet and planet.

=== minormoon ===

There are over a hundred known moons in the Solar System. Most of these moons are small rocks that orbit the outer planets. While it is interesting to be able to visualize the orbits of these moons, there are so many of them that turning on moon orbits results in a confusing &quot;ball of string&quot; around the outer planets. The new object class minor moon was introduced to address this problem. In the default Celestia solar system files, the small moons of outer planets are now designated as minor moons. Orbit and label display for minor moons may be toggled separately from the major moon labels and orbits. It is important to note that unlike dwarf planet, &quot;minor moon&quot; is not a term recognized by the IAU. The class was added to Celestia purely for the convenience of users. There's no hard and fast rule about what a minor moon is, but in general outer planet moons with a diameter less than 100 km are marked as minor.

Here's an example of using the minor moon class:

 &quot;Sinope&quot; &quot;Sol/Jupiter&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;minormoon&quot;
     Radius 19
     ...
 }

=== surfacefeature ===

Surface feature is a new class for objects that are fixed to the surface of another body, such as buildings and terrain features. Previously, there was simply no good classification for these objects. Lacking a better option, SSC creators tended to classify them as either asteroids or spacecraft. The surface feature class has one other useful property: surface features are not visible as points of light at a distance. While rendering very distant objects as points is a realistic effect for objects orbiting in space, it does not look good when applied to objects on the ground. In addition to this advantage, classifying appropriate objects means that they will be sensibly organized in the solar system browser.

Example:

 &quot;Space Needle&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;surfacefeature&quot;
     Mesh &quot;needle.cmod&quot;
     OrbitFrame { BodyFixed {} }
     FixedPosition [ ... ]
     ...
 }

=== component ===

Objects with moving parts can be implemented in Celestia with multiple SSC objects. For example, a spacecraft with two movable solar panels could be defined as three objects: one for the main body of the spacecraft, and one object for each panel. Rather than defining all of the parts as spacecraft, only the main body should be a spacecraft and the other parts assigned the new class component. Like surface features, components are not rendered as points of light when they're far away from the viewer. This prevents the problem with multipart objects appearing overly bright at a distance. Using the class component appropriately also means that objects are better organized in the solar system browser.

Multi-part spacecraft example:

 &quot;Orbiter&quot; &quot;Sol/Mars&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Mesh &quot;spacecraft-body.cmod&quot;
     ...
 }
 
 &quot;Solar Panel - Left&quot; &quot;Sol/Mars/Orbiter&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;component&quot;
     Mesh &quot;spacecraft-leftpanel.cmod&quot;
     ...
 }
 
 &quot;Solar Panel - Right&quot; &quot;Sol/Mars/Orbiter&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;component&quot;
     Mesh &quot;spacecraft-rightpanel.cmod&quot;
     ...
 }

=== diffuse ===

Yet another set of objects that aren't good fits for any Celestia 1.5.0 class are dust clouds, accretion disks, volcanic plumes, and other extended, non-solid things. Celestia 1.6.0 adds a new class called diffuse for such objects. By default, diffuse objects cannot be clicked and selected by the user. They are never indicated with labels, nor are their trajectories shown when orbit paths are enabled. Lastly, they do not reflect light and result in &quot;planetshine&quot;. This last point is important. Because diffuse objects are not solid, they may intersect other objects; under such circumstances, Celestia's reflected light calculation is not valid and will result in unrealistic lighting. Marking an object with class diffuse is the only way to tell Celestia that an object isn't solid and should be treated differently for the purpose of lighting.

Example:

 &quot;Loki Plume&quot; &quot;Sol/Jupiter/Io&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;diffuse&quot;
     Mesh &quot;plume.cmod&quot;
     ...
 }

= Clickable property =

== Background ==

A Celestia user can select an object by clicking on it in the 3D view. However, there are times when this is undesirable. An SSC author may define an extended, gaseous object such as an accretion disc with the idea that the viewer may move freely through it. When the camera is inside such an object, a click in any direction will select it--behavior that is likely confusing to users.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

Celestia 1.6.0 offers a new boolean SSC property, Clickable. Specifying clickable false in an SSC body definition prevents that body from being selected when clicked. When a user click selects, an unclickable object is treated as if it weren't there at all; if there is a more distant object under the click point, that object will be selected instead.

Example:

 &quot;Accretion Disc&quot; &quot;Fomalhaut&quot;
 {
     Mesh &quot;disc.cmod&quot;
     Radius 1e9
     Clickable false
     ...
 }

Note that objects of class diffuse are not clickable by default. Thus, the above example is better written like this:

 &quot;Accretion Disc&quot; &quot;Fomalhaut&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;diffuse&quot;
     Mesh &quot;disc.cmod&quot;
     Radius 1e9
     ...
 }

If for some reason an SSC author wants to create a diffuse object that can be click selected, it is also possible to override the default unclickable status by setting the clickable property to true:

 &quot;Dust Cloud&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;diffuse&quot;
     Mesh &quot;cloud.cmod&quot;
     Clickable true
     ...
 }

= Visible Property =

== Background ==

When designing a dynamic Celestia body or when debugging a catalog file, it often is useful to have Celestia not draw an object.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

The SSC directives
  Visible true
and
  Visible false
determine whether or not an object is drawn.

The default is
  Visible true

For example:
 &quot;Dust Cloud&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     Class &quot;diffuse&quot;
     Mesh &quot;cloud.cmod&quot;
     Visible false
     ...
 }
causes the cloud to be defined but not drawn.


The Visible property can be controlled in a CELX (Lua) script by calling the setvisible method:

  local obj = celestia:find(&quot;Sol/Dust Cloud&quot;)
  obj:setvisible(true)

= OrbitColor Property =

== Background ==

Celestia allows users to toggle the display of orbit paths for planets, stars, moons, and other bodies. In version 1.5.0 of Celestia, new script commands were added for changing the color of the orbits shown for each class. But, there are situations where it is useful to have finer control over the colors of orbit paths. For example, a planetary system overview may be clearer if each planet is given a distinct orbit color.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

The color of an SSC object's orbit can be modified by setting the OrbitColor property. In this example, we'll set the color of the Moon's orbit to yellow:

 Modify &quot;Moon&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     OrbitColor [ 1 1 0 ]
 }

As with other color properties, the components of OrbitColor are values between 0 and 1, and are ordered red, green blue. The next example changes the orbit colors of all of the inner planets:

 Modify &quot;Mercury&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     OrbitColor [ 1 0.7 0.2 ]  # brown
 }
 
 Modify &quot;Venus&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     OrbitColor [ 1 1 0.7 ]  # light yellow
 }
 
 Modify &quot;Earth&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     OrbitColor [ 0.5 0.7 1 ]   # light blue
 }
 
 Modify &quot;Mars&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     OrbitColor [ 1 0.6 0.6 ]   # light red
 }

= Triaxial ellipsoids =

== Background ==

Celestia has two ways to set the shape of an object:
* A 3D mesh file can be specified using the Mesh property, or...
* Celestia will assume that the object is an ellipsoid if the Mesh property is omitted

In Celestia 1.5.0, the size of the ellipsoid is controlled by the Radius property. The shape of the ellipsoid is given by the value of the oblateness property. Oblateness is the amount of flattening or stretching along the polar axis. The default value of oblateness is 0.0, indicating that the ellipsoid is a sphere. If the oblateness greater than zero, the planet will be appear squashed. This squashed sphere shape is called an oblate spheroid. Gas giant planets can be very noticeably non-spherical: fast rotation distorts them, causing a noticeable bulge at the equator. Even solid bodies such as the Earth can experience some flattening, though to a smaller degree than giant planets.

[[Image:OblateSpheroid.PNG|thumb|Example of an oblate spheroid (oblateness &lt; 1)]]

Oblateness is calculated as &lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, where a is the equatorial radius and b the polar radius. Saturn has the most extreme flattening of any planet in the Solar System, with an oblateness of 0.0980. Earth has an oblateness of about 0.00335--visually indistinguishable from a sphere when seen from space.

While most large Solar System bodies are accurately represented as oblate spheroids, there are a few that cannot be. Some moons of giant planets are noticeably stretched along the equatorial axis pointing toward the planet. Three axis lengths have to be given: the polar axis, and two different equatorial axes. The term 'triaxial ellipsoid' refers to an ellipsoid with three axes that are all different lengths.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

The new SemiAxes property for SSC bodies is used to specify a triaxial ellipsoid. Images from the Cassini spacecraft show Saturn's moon Mimas to have a noticeably triaxial shape.

[[Image:Mimas_shape.jpg|left|frame]]

Its dimensions are 414.8×394.4×381.4 km. The first number is the length of the axis pointing toward Saturn, the second number is the  axis along the orbit of Mimas, and the last number is the polar axis. In an SSC file, we'd write:

 &quot;Mimas&quot; &quot;Sol/Saturn&quot;
 {
     SemiAxes [ 207.4 197.2 190.7 ]
     ...
 }

Notice that since we're specifying the ''semiaxes not the axes'', and thus the values are half the axis lengths. The relationship between axis and semiaxis is analogous to that between diameter and radius. The usage of the SemiAxes property is quite simple: you're essentially specifying three radii instead of just one. There are some subtleties in the interactions between the Radius, Oblateness, and SemiAxes properties:
* Radius is multiplied by the SemiAxes lengths if both properties are specified
* Oblateness is ignored if SemiAxes are given
* It is an error if neither SemiAxes nor Radius are specified

You can keep things simple and ignore these technicalities if you obey these guidelines:
* For spherical bodies, specify just the radius
* For oblate bodies, specify just the radius and oblateness
* For planets with triaxial ellipsoid shapes, specify just the semiaxes
* For irregular objects, specify just the mesh and radius

= Object timelines =

Object timelines are a major new feature of Celestia 1.6.0. With a timeline, it is possible to describe the motion of an object over its entire lifetime, even when multiple trajectory types or reference frames are required. What used to require awkward SSC files with multiple definitions for the same object can now be done with a single object.

== Background ==

The motivation for adding Timeline to Celestia is best explained via an example. We'll consider the Cassini−Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan, which is included in the base Celestia package. The Huygens probe was attached to Cassini from launch until December 25, 2004. On that day, Huygens separated from Cassini and then orbited Saturn for three weeks on its own until descending into Titan's atmosphere on January 14, 2005. Now, how do we describe the trajectory of Huygens in an SSC file? For Cassini, we use a SampledTrajectory (xyz file) that covers the entire lifetime of the spacecraft. We could do something similar for Huygens: the xyz file would be identical up to the point of separation from Cassini. However, this is a lot of data duplication. It's also extra maintenance: if the Cassini trajectory is updated (after the separation time), we must also update the Huygens trajectory file. Finally, this technique only works if Cassini isn't rotating, which in reality is not the case at all.

A more convenient and less wasteful approach would take advantage of the fact that Huygens and Cassini are joined together throughout their journey from Earth to Saturn. In Celestia 1.5.0, the only way to do this is to define two different versions of Huygens: one that's attached to Cassini, and another that's in orbit around Saturn. Here is the version that is attached to Cassini:

 &quot;Huygens (with Cassini)&quot; &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; 
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Mesh &quot;huygens.3ds&quot;
     Radius 0.00135
 
     Beginning 2450736.893877314 # 1997 Oct 15 09:27:11
     Ending    2453364.5847      # 2004 Dec 25 02:01:58
 
     OrbitFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
     BodyFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
     FixedPosition [ -0.0013 0 -0.0002 ]
     FixedRotation { }
}

The Ending property is set to the time of separation. At that point the version of Huygens attached to Cassini will disappear. Both the position and orientation of this Huygens is fixed relative to Cassini: Huygens will follow every movement and rotation of the Cassini spacecraft. After separation &quot;Huygens (with Cassini)&quot; is replaced by this version:

 &quot;Huygens (free flight)&quot; &quot;Sol&quot; 
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Mesh &quot;huygens.3ds&quot;
     Radius 0.00135
 
     Beginning 2453364.5847 # 2004 Dec 25 02:01:58
     Ending    2453384.8750 # 2005 Jan 14 09:00:00
 
     SampledOrbit &quot;huygens.xyz&quot;
 
     UniformRotation
     {
         Inclination 70
         Period 0.01
     }
 }

Now, Huygens has its own trajectory and rotation. Its motion is defined relative to the Sun rather than to Cassini. But, there are drawbacks:
* We have to replicate all the data about Huygens not related to trajectory or orientation: the mesh, class, radius, infoURL, etc.
* A user is likely to be slightly confused by the fact that there are two instances of Huygens in the solar system browser.
* Following Huygens as it separates from Cassini will not work; the camera will not track Huygens (free flight) after Huyges (with Cassini) disappears.

What we want is some way to give two different reference frames and trajectories for Huygens without creating to instances of the probe. This is exactly what object Timelines allow.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

In Celestia 1.6.0, we can merge the two versions of Huygens into a single object.

 &quot;Huygens&quot; &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; 
 {
     Class &quot;spacecraft&quot;
     Mesh &quot;huygens.3ds&quot;
     Radius 0.00135
 
     Timeline [
       # Phase 1: With Cassini
       {
          Beginning &quot;1997 19 15 09:27:11&quot;
          Ending    &quot;2004 12 25 02:02:34&quot;
 
          OrbitFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
          BodyFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Cassini&quot; } }
          FixedPosition [ -0.0014 0 0.0002 ]
          FixedRotation { Inclination 90 AscendingNode 90 } 
        }
 
        # Phase 2: Free flight to Titan
        {
          Ending &quot;2005 01 14 09:07:00&quot;
 
          OrbitFrame { EclipticJ2000 { Center &quot;Sol/Saturn&quot; } }
          BodyFrame { EclipticJ2000 {} }
 
          SampledTrajectory { Source &quot;huygens.xyz&quot; }
          UniformRotation
          {
            Period 0.125            # 7.5 revolutions per minute
          }
        }
      ] # End Timeline
 }

Observe the inside of the Timeline block, there are two sets of frames and trajectories. Each of these timeline sections is called a phase. The ''only'' things that are allowed in a phase are the beginning and ending time, trajectory, rotation model, body frame, and orbit frame. Timeline is not intended to be a general purpose system for animation, so there is no way to effect changes to the appearance of an object in a timeline phase by, say, putting a different model in each phase. Some other techniques will eventually be implemented to allow animation in Celestia.

=== Beginning and Ending ===

The beginning and ending properties define the span covered by the phases of the timeline. Collectively, the phases cover a continuous span of time: no gaps are allowed. Continuity is guaranteed because for all phases but the first, the phase beginning time is automatically set to the ending time of the previous phase. The rules for beginning and ending times in timeline are summarized below:

; First phase : Beginning may be specified, defaults to -infinity if it isn't
: Ending must be specified if there is more than one phase
; Last phase : Beginning must be specified if there is more than one phase
: Ending may be specified, defaults to +infinity if it isn't
; Other phases : Beginning is not allowed; it is automatically set to the Ending of the previous phase
: Ending must be specified; there is no default value

A few examples will serve to illustrate various ways that a timeline can be divided into phases. In the first example, there is just a single infinite phase:

 &quot;Satellite1&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     Radius 0.001
     Timeline [
       {
           EllipticalOrbit { ... }
       }
     ]
 }

Satellite1 is assigned an orbit that is valid over all time, because Beginning and Ending were omitted and have their defaults values of -infinity and +infinity. In this case, there's really no need to use a timeline at all. The object will be have identically to this simpler version:

 &quot;Satellite1&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     Radius 0.001
     EllipticalOrbit { ... }
 }

When there is just a single phase, there is no need to put the frames and trajectories in a timeline. A more useful timeline example is this definition of a lunar lander that is launched from the Earth on 25 Feb 2010 and lands on the Moon on March 12th of the same year:

 &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; &quot;Sol/Earth&quot;
 {
     Radius 0.001
     Timeline [
       # Phase 1: Launch and cruise
       {
         Beginning &quot;2010 2 25 12:30&quot;
         Ending    &quot;2010 3 12 15:30&quot;
         OrbitFrame { EquatorJ2000 { Center &quot;Sol/Earth&quot; } }
         SampledTrajectory { Source &quot;traj.xyzv&quot; }
       }
 
       # Phase 2: Landed on the Moon
       {
         OrbitFrame { BodyFixed { Center &quot;Sol/Earth/Moon&quot; } }
         FixedPosition [ ... ]
       }
     ]
 }

The landing time is defined in the first phase, so no beginning time is given (or allowed) in the second phase. Since there's no ending specified in the second phase, the lander will sit on the surface of the moon until the end of time.

= Position + Velocity Trajectories (xyzv files) =

Using a new trajectory file format can simultaneously improve positioning accuracy and decrease memory usage.

== Background ==

Sampled trajectories are used when the trajectory of an object is not adequately described by an ellipse or one of Celestia's built-in orbit calculations. Typically, sampled trajectories are used for interplanetary spacecraft, but they can be useful for other objects as well. There are two ways to use sampled trajectories in an ssc or stc file. The old way uses SampledOrbit:

 SampledOrbit &quot;trajectory.xyz&quot;

The new method added in 1.5.0 uses SampledTrajectory:

 SampledTrajectory { Source &quot;trajectory.xyz&quot; }

SampledTrajectory should be preferred over SampledOrbit, as it offers options to control the precision (double or single) and the interpolation type (cubic or linear.) SampledOrbit always uses single precision positions, which is not adequate for serious spaceflight applications of Celestia.

A sampled trajectory file is a list of time and position records. Usually the files are generated from SPICE kernels or JPL's [[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|HORIZONS]] system. Here's an excerpt from the trajectory file for Galileo:

 2447818.615972 134114700.2612462193 64912642.6984842718 39861.799941
 2447819.615972 133153386.7785827518 66969511.3118158504 237125.784089
 2447820.615972 132137795.3581911474 69024279.8844281882 418499.867572
 2447821.615972 131079666.1268854141 71061806.8872888833 596914.157647

The first value on each line is a Julian date, and that last three values are positions in kilometers. The reference frame for the positions is given in the ssc file. By default, Celestia uses a technique called cubic Hermite interpolation for smooth motion between points. For this discussion, the exact mathematics aren't important. What is relevant is that in order to interpolate between points, Celestia needs the velocity of the object as well as its position at each time. It's possible to estimate the velocity by looking at the difference in position between two successive points, but much improved accuracy is achievable saving velocities in the trajectory file.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

Celestia 1.6.0 adds support for position and velocity trajectory files. These files have the extension xyzv, and can be used in exactly the same manner as xyz files in a SampledTrajectory:

 SampledTrajectory { Source &quot;trajectory.xyzv&quot; }

The records in an xyzv file have the same layout as in an xyz file except that three velocity values are appended after each position. The units for velocity are kilometers per second. For a given file size, xyzv files give much more accurate positioning of objects. Thus, if it's possible to get velocities as well as positions for an object, an xyzv file should always be preferred over an xyz file. Celestia 1.6.0 will still support xyz files for backward compatibility and to cover situations where velocities are unavailable.

The web interface for HORIZONS can be used to produce trajectories with velocities as well as positions. There's also a new tool for Celestia called spice2xyzv that will generate an xyzv file from one or more SPICE kernels. Documentation on this tool is forthcoming.

= Multiple Names for SSC Objects =

Objects defined in SSC files can now be assigned multiple aliases.

== Background ==

In Celestia 1.5.1, it is possible to assign more than one name to a star or deep sky object. This is important because there is often several commonly used designations for stars and galaxies. For example, the red giant star Betelgeuse is often referred to by its Bayer designation Alpha Orionis. The Andromeda galaxy is also as NGC 598 and by its Messier number M 33. The definition for Andromeda in a DSC file might look something like this:

 &quot;Andromeda Galaxy:M 33:NGC 598&quot;
 {
     ...
 }

The names are delimited by colons.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

1.6.0 simply adds the same multiname capability for SSC objects. As with stars and deep sky objects, names are delimited by colons. A common situation in which multiple names are useful is for minor planets. When first reported, a minor planets is assigned a provisional designation. After further observation it will get a minor planet number, and the IAU may eventually approve a proper name for the object as well. Thus, in an SSC file, you may have a definition like this:

 Body &quot;136199 Eris:Eris:2003 UB313&quot; &quot;Sol&quot;
 {
     ...
 }

The first name in the list will be the one that appears in labels and in the solar system browser. All of the names will be shown in the upper left corner of the screen when the object is selected. Any of the names is valid in a path, so you could refer to Eris's moon Dysnomia as &quot;Sol/136199 Eris/Dysnomia&quot;, &quot;Sol/Eris/Dysnomia&quot;, or &quot;Sol/2003 UB313/Dysnomia&quot;.

= CustomRotation =

= Simplified Surface Placement =
 SurfaceObject &quot;name&quot; &quot;path/parent&quot; { ... }

Use of the SurfaceObject keyword invokes several useful defaults:

* The object's default OrbitFrame is the BodyFixed frame of the parent object
* The object's default BodyFrame is topocentric, with its Z axis pointing toward the zenith, its Y axis pointing toward the parent body's North Pole, and its X axis pointing to the East.
* The object's default Class is &quot;surfacefeature&quot;

= Add/Modify/Replace for Stars =

= Mesh Placement and Scaling =

== Background ==

Celestia add-on creators face some difficulties when trying to place mesh objects precisely relative to each other. Celestia's &quot;normalization&quot; of mesh objects is the cause of some of these problems. When a mesh is normalized, it is scaled and centered so that its longest axis fits into a sphere with the specified radius of the object. The common workaround is to add identically-sized invisible bounding box to objects that will be positioned close to each other. This ensures that the models will effectively share the same coordinate system.

While effective, creating these bounding boxes adds extra work for add-on creators. It also means that meshes end up getting incorrectly flagged as translucent for purposes of depth sorting.

== 1.6.0 Changes ==

Two new ssc properties solve the problem of mesh placement without resorting to adding bounding boxes:


 # defaults to true for backward compatibility
 NormalizeMesh &lt;boolean&gt;
 
 # defaults to 1
 MeshScale &lt;number&gt;


When an object has NormalizeMesh false specified, no automatic scaling and recentering of the mesh is done. The add-on creator must make sure to set the Radius of the object to a value large enough to contain it.

MeshScale converts the internal units of the model into kilometers as required by Celestia. For example, it is much more convenient to build a spacecraft in a system where the unit is one meter instead of one kilometer. For such a model, you would specify the MeshScale as 0.001.

Neither of these additions affect backward compatibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Independence Movements: The American Revolution&lt;br&gt;


== Origins of the American Revolution ==
&lt;br&gt;
''Colonial Background''&lt;br&gt;
Jamestown, Virginia (1607) was the first British colony in North America (by the time Americans declared independence, the colony was 100 years old)&lt;br&gt;
''Primary motivations for colonization/immigration''&lt;br&gt;
1.	The British government gave the right to colonists to colonize (acquire land) in the name of the king/queen (exception: Georgia was a colony where the debtors were sent)&lt;br&gt;
2.	Freedom of religion: many left to practice their religion without threat of persecution; however, many early colonists were intolerant of others with religious views different from their own &lt;br&gt;
3.	Economic gain (primary reason for colonization): &lt;br&gt;
-opportunity to own land&lt;br&gt;
-large profits for companies&lt;br&gt;
4.	Overcrowding: &lt;br&gt;
- homelessness&lt;br&gt;
- high levels of unemployment&lt;br&gt;
5.	Political issues: &lt;br&gt;
- wanted greater political freedom

== Colonial governments ==
&lt;br&gt;
Companies were given charters: agreements on how the colonies would be governed. The people that were to govern these colonies were sometimes elected, sometimes royally appointed, or appointed by the head of the companies. &lt;br&gt;
+Colonial Legislatures&lt;br&gt;
Initially, colonial legislatures were free from oversight. This was in large part due to the long distance (colonies were about 3,000 miles away) that separated the colonies from the mother country. Early on, colonies enjoyed a great deal of freedom. They had a relative degree of self-government—most of the laws colonists had to abide by were established by themselves. 

== Causes of the American Revolution ==
A. '''Economic Theory of Mercantilism'''
-Mercantilism: economic theory stating that the prosperity of a nation depends upon its capital. According to this theory all nations should seek a favorable balance of trade. Mercantilism also states that there finite amount of resources and all nations are in competition with each other to obtain access to these resources. Therefore, when one country gains access to any resource, it represents a loss for other countries&lt;br&gt;
- Economic theory that served as the basis for the economic policies that European nations imposed on their colonies.&lt;br&gt;
-The objective was to make colonies dependent upon the mother country for manufactured goods.&lt;br&gt;
-Colonies represented markets for British goods. EX: Textiles, weapons, house ware&lt;br&gt;
- Colonies were also supposed to serve as producers of raw materials that would either feed the European population or serve as inputs for factories&lt;br&gt;
* Overtime, it is important to recognize that the mother country becomes just as dependent on the colonies as the colonies on the mother country. According to Thomas Paine, “as long as the people of Europe like to eat every day, they will come to us.” &lt;br&gt;
B. '''The Enlightenment''' 
-The enlightenment was an intellectual movement that challenged world views. It emphasized rationality, reason, and logic. &lt;br&gt;
-Movement that questions everything.&lt;br&gt; 
-John Locke, an influential enlightenment thinker, proclaimed that all humans are born with natural (god-given) rights: life, liberty, and property (later became the pursuit of happiness). According to Locke, governments are established by men for the purpose of protecting the natural rights of its citizens. If the government infringes or fails to protect these rights, it is the responsibility and duty of the citizens to overthrow the government by any means necessary. A legitimate government requires the consent of the governed. &lt;br&gt;
C. '''The Navigation Acts'''
-late 1600s to early 1700s&lt;br&gt;
-Were designed to make mercantilism into policy.
''Key Provisions''&lt;br&gt;
1. Certain “enumerated goods” produced in the colonies, could only be sold to the mother country. EXS: tobacco, wool, rice, indigo.
(Counterintuitive, since as producers, the colonies would want to sell goods to the highest bidder).&lt;br&gt;
2. Any and all foreign goods that were headed to the colonies had to be shipped through England for inspection and taxation. This made it almost impossible to sell in the colonies, as the prices were very high.&lt;br&gt;
3. All trade had to be carried out on British ships and by British merchants.&lt;br&gt;
4. Colonists were prohibited from producing any goods that would compete with British goods—these were mainly manufactured goods. &lt;br&gt;
D. '''The French and Indian War (1754-1763)'''
The French and Indian war was the North American chapter of the Seven Year’s war, fought between the British and the French (and the native American forces that allied with the French). &lt;br&gt; ''Causes:''a. Desire for territorial expansion&lt;br&gt;
Both New France and New England wanted to expand their territories with respect to fur trading and other pursuits that matched their economic interests. Using trading posts and forts, both the British and the French claimed the vast territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, known as the Ohio Country. English claims resulted from royal grants which had no definite western boundaries. The French claims resulted from La Salle's claiming the Mississippi River for France—its drainage area includes the Ohio River Valley. In order to secure these claims, both European powers took advantage of Native American factions to protect their territories and to keep each other from growing too strong.&lt;br&gt;
b. Religious Ideology&lt;br&gt;
The English colonists also feared papal influence in North America, as New France was administered by French governors and Roman Catholic hierarchy. For the predominantly Protestant British settlers, French control over North America could have represented a threat to their religious and other freedoms provided by English law. Likewise, the French feared the anti-Catholicism prevalent among English holdings &lt;br&gt;
+ How did the French and Indian War contribute to the American Revolution?&lt;br&gt;
1.	Increase debt due to British military expenditures during the war. To compensate for the capital lost, the British levied high taxes on the American colonies (the British felt that because the Americans had benefited from the military protection provided by the British during the war, the colonists should pay).&lt;br&gt;
2.	In the aftermath of the war the French were expelled from North America (gave up claim to the disputed territory of Ohio). Before the war the British colonies perceived that they needed British military protection from the French. But after the war, the French threat was removed, making colonists question why they needed British military protection. &lt;br&gt;
3.	During the war, colonists gained military experience, which increased their confidence in their ability to successfully prosecute a war against Great Britain (George Washington gained his military experience from this war).&lt;br&gt;
4.	Negative experiences and perceptions that American colonists had toward British soldiers, as a result of a shared wartime service. Colonists disliked the pretentiousness of British officers, British failure to observe/recognize the Sabbath, harsh punishments, extended military contracts (British failure to uphold their side of the bargain). Also, there is an increased awareness that Americans have different values than the British. As a result, there is an emergence of an American mentality.&lt;br&gt;
5.	The myth of British invincibility is shattered as a result of their dismal showing in their first two years of the war. 
After the war ended, the British issued a series of acts and proclamations.&lt;br&gt;
* '''Proclamation of 1763'''
Colonists were prohibited from moving west of the crest of the Appalachian Mountains. The colonists were upset because they thought that the “Indians” (Native Americans) were being unfairly rewarded. In the colonists view point, they had fought a war and won the war against the “Indians” who were now being protected by the British. &lt;br&gt;
However, the British main motive to restrict colonist expansion was to keep the American colonists bunched up in the eastern sea board to better enforce the navigation acts. This proclamation was also issued to keep Native Americans and the colonists from waging a war, which would ultimately represent an economic drain for the British.  &lt;br&gt;
* '''Stamp Act (1765)'''
A tax that was to be levied on all printed documents (i.e. newspapers, playing cards, etc). This was the first revenue tax that the British parliament had ever placed on the American colonists (the navigation acts were not revenue oriented). The colonies felt that the British were unfairly levying taxes without the colonists’ consent (taxation without representation). Colonists began to question whether Britain had the right to tax the colonies. &lt;br&gt;
The colonists thought that the British were violating the intrinsic rights that all humans were born with: life, liberty, and the right to property (later pursuit of happiness). &lt;br&gt;
I. '''Liberty'''&lt;br&gt;
There were several liberties/freedoms/rights that the colonists believed the British government was infringing upon: &lt;br&gt;
1. The colonists thought that they were not being adequately represented in parliament:
Real/actual/individual vs. virtual representation&lt;br&gt;
''*virtual representation (British view)''&lt;br&gt;
When parliament makes a collective decision it is not only based on the people living on the isle, but also based on the whole British Empire. According to the British, it did not matter where one was because parliament took into account every colony of the British Empire. Parliament (King, House of Lords, and House of Commons) took into consideration the interests of ALL British subjects when making decisions regardless of where one might live. However, there was a flaw with the British argument—all members of parliament were from the British isle, they held all their meetings in London, and it was extremely probable that most members of Parliament had never been to British colonies.&lt;br&gt;
 ''* real representation (American/colonial view)''&lt;br&gt;
The colonists thought that the Parliament could not represent the interests of a given people unless some of the members of Parliament lived among the people they were representing. In the colonists’ view, voters from each colony should be able to elect a member from the colonies to represent them in the House of Commons (representatives must live and be responsible to the voters in a particular geographic district). 
Americans strongly believed that the British could not represent the interests of the colonies if they do not live amongst or depend on colonies. &lt;br&gt;The following Acts of Parliament were used a basis for the colonists' argument that Parliament was incapable of governing the colonies in a way that was &lt;i&gt;mutually&lt;/i&gt; beneficial:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;a.	Stamp Act: tax on all printed material
&lt;br&gt;b.	Townshend Act: tax levied on tea, paper, glass
&lt;br&gt;c.	Tea Act
&lt;br&gt;d.	Sugar Act&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All these were revenues oriented taxes, levied on the colonies in order to provide an influx of capital to the British government. According to the colonists, the British were breaking with the long tradition of autonomy that the colonial legislatures had. Also, this was the first time that the British government levied a revenue taxes on the colonies. Previously, goods that came directly from Britain had never been taxed by the British government. 
All acts were repealed and the colonists encouraged fellow colonists not to import British goods. As a result merchants pressured parliament, reinforcing colonist view of real representation. As a response to the colonists’ actions Britain issued the Declaratory Act, which stated that Britain had the right to tax and legislate the colonies. 
2. Right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures
Examples:
*Quartering Acts: allowed soldiers to come into house and requisite certain things—food, water, etc
* Writs of Assistance: general search warrants that most British officers had
From the British perspective, they were just trying to make sure that the navigation acts were being followed.
3. Right to trial by jury of ones peers
EXS:
Colonists and/or British convicted of certain crimes would be tried in British vice-admiralty courts. 
4. Right to self-government
EXS: 
Intolerable/coercive Acts: Britain dissolved Massachusetts’ colonial legislature and replaced it with an appointed one. The British were trying to send a message to other colonies: if disobedient they would be punished. The British were trying to scare/intimidate the other 12 colonies. This, however, did not work.
5. Right of Assembly
The people of Massachusetts were denied the right of assembly (right to hold town hall meetings) as a result of the coercive act. The British viewed assemblies as places were the colonists coordinated acts against Britain.
II) British infringement on the colonists’ right to life
The colonists cited the battles at Lexington and concord and the Boston massacre as clear examples of how the British were infringing upon the colonists’ right to live. 
* Lexington and Concord (April 1775) and the subsequent battle at Bunker Hill (May 1775)
At the battles of Lexington and Concord about 93 militia members were killed (compared to 200 British). 
In Bunker Hill there were over 1000 American casualties. In the colonists’ view the war had started. They questioned how can “we” reconcile with those who have killed “our” civilians? 
III) Right to property/ pursuit of happiness 
The colonists felt that the Quebec act (1774, nullified many of the Western claims of the coast colonies by extending the boundaries of the province of Quebec to the Ohio River on the south and to the Mississippi River on the west) and the proclamation of 1763 did not allow colonists to gain new territories (property) as they limited westward expansion. The restrictions on trade brought about by the navigation acts and the theory of mercantilism was an impediment for in some of the colonists’ quest to build wealth (which could be considered as pursuing happiness by acquiring material wealth).
As colonial unrest grew, there several more immediate causes that led the colonists to finally declare war on Britain. In January 1776, Thomas Paine published Common Sense, a pamphlet in which he expressed why the 13 colonies should seek independence from England. He argued that the mother country (Britain) needed the colonies more than they needed her. He claimed that remaining part of Great Britain would “suck” the colonies into future European wars. He argued that the British government was staffed and operated by “robbers” and “murderers.” Furthermore, Paine claimed that the British government represented an impediment for self-improvement. A massive number of copies were distributed (roughly 500,000). Common Sense drastically shaped public opinion—in January 1776 most colonists favored/remained loyal to Britain, but by April 1776, public opinion was in favor of the revolutionary cause. 
The most immediate factor that led to the declaration of independence was the king’s failure to respond favorably to the olive branch petition. The Olive Branch Petition, drafted on July 5, 1775, was a letter to King George III  from members of the Second Continental Congress who—for the final time—appealed to their king to redress colonial grievances in order to avoid more bloodshed. The king ignored the petition and responded by issuing the prohibitory act, which declared that all 13 colonies were in an official state of rebellion and therefore had no legal rights. The Second Continental Congress responded by raising colonial militias. 
Factors that help explain the colonists’ victory over the British in the American Revolution (Role of Outside Powers).
1. Foreign help/assistance 
AS a result of Burgoyne’s (British commander) defeat at Saratoga in 1778, the French signed a treaty of alliance with the U.S. This alliance undoubtedly provided several benefits to the army. The French gave supplies (gunpowder, riffles, heavy artillery (canons)) to the American army. The French also used their navy to support the patriots. 
2. Geography
1,500 mile coastline made it difficult/impossible for the British to achieve their objective of economically isolating the colonies by capturing major ports/cities (colonists were able to successfully smuggle goods). Also, the British lack of familiarity with the terrain slowed them down.
3. British mistakes
a. Failure/lack of key leaders to cooperate (work together)
b. Inability of the British to live off the land (British soldiers engaged in rape and pillaging).
4. Colonial persistence
The colonists were able to last 6-8 years of conflict with the British; this is surprising as most of the major battles were victories for the British. The continental army was able to win in large prt due to the strong leadership of George Washington.

Trivial really... but for the less initiated, perhaps definition of the terms &quot;RC feed&quot; and &quot;RC patroller&quot; should be included? I know in a general way what these are, but it would be useful to have a formal definition... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:24, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

== Minor cleanup ==

I found a few missing words and some slightly unclear phrases. I have cleaned them up a bit, without, I hope, changing meaning too much. Feel free to revert if necessary... I just have this nervous twitch. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:34, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

:I have been called on my edits, mentioned above, to this policy, in light of Darklama's opposition to its current length. My response, which is also on my talk page, is this:

:As I read it, what Darklama is complaining about is not the length of the individual bits, but the shoehorning of two policies together into a single article. It looks like what he is largely complaining about having both the Bot writeup, which he says is nothing new, and the Flood flag in the same policy, thus making it longer and, as it is two apparently only slightly related issues, more confusing. What I am aiming at is clarity; if it takes three words to make something clear, instead of one which leaves it somewhat confusing, I personally would take the three words.

:Additionally, I don't see a difference of about ten words (maybe 1% of the total article length) as being significant in anyone's view as regards the length of the document. A change that makes an insignificant difference in the length at the cost of some clarity is a net loss. We want people to be able to understand the policy, don't we?

:If you could see some way to reduce the length of the policy by 30-50%, without losing clarity, I think that would be enough to bring Darklama onside. But anything less than that is just pointless.

:That said, if you choose to back out my edits, that is your prerogative. I won't continue an edit war. But my position remains the same: clarity in a policy must trump brevity. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:27, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

::I agree that clarity trumps brevity, which is why I think Darklama's reasons for opposing the policy are not sound. However, I did try to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Bots/Unstable&amp;diff=1316600&amp;oldid=1316255 trim] it down, rather unsuccessfully. I don't think the clarity we would lose by culling large amounts of text is worth it. So I will stand by the current version, and hope that we can come to an agreement. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:50, 25 October 2008 (UTC)
:::The only way I can see to get both clarity and brevity is to split the policy into a Bot policy and a Flood Flag policy. Granted the two are very linked, still they can easily be split, which might well answer Darklama's objections.
:::That said, I think I'm going to have to bow out. This is more fight than I want to have. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:35, 25 October 2008 (UTC)
::::My objections are not related to having both the bot flag and flood flag in the same proposal. The issue to me is the proposal lacks clarity or sound reason for most of what is included, which I feel the verbose or length of proposal contribute to. I'm only suggesting that shorter sentences and paragraphs that are clearer could help made this proposal more clear and sound. I do not think that reducing the length of the policy would come at the expense of clarity. After Mike.lifeguard's fork I set out to simply and improve the clarity of the original version so it could be better understood quickly, which I feel was achieved. The forked version though does not have those changes, and even more was added to it borrowing from other project policies which I think fails to consider that Wikibooks does not have the same problems. I don't think policies should be trying to solve problems which the community has not expressed as being a problem in need of being solved yet. I think policies should reflect what the community wants rather than instruct or tell people what they need or have to do when the community has not shown an interest in having or making any requirements or in placing restrictions. I think because of the lack of need by the community that there is far too much instruction creep in the fork to support it in its current form. I do however support Wikibooks:Bots, because I think its easy to understand and does not attempt to place as many restrictions or requirements on bots, and allows the community to make up its own mind, like the deletion policy does, on a case by case bases. The bots policy can always be later expanded if and after the community feels that more is needed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:53, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

:I am in favour of the two policies becoming one, as both use similar terms and are relatively closely related. At this moment in time I can't see much benefit in splitting them up. We need to be careful not to lose any of the clarity in the policies, as ambiguity has been a major problem on a number of occasions before with other policies.

::I agree that ambiguity has been a problem and I think maybe the proposal to adopt the unstable branch was premature, because until recently little discussion has taken place about either one really. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:53, 26 October 2008 (UTC)

* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

= Lessons ([[User:Junesun|Junesun]]) =
These lessons suggestions are my idea for a Japanese course. Note that I have worked as a lesson writer for other languages for several years, but my knowledge of Japanese is not very good. The target audience is the hobbyist absolute beginner, characterized by
# knowing English well even if they are not a native speaker
# having no previous knowledge of Japanese except a shaky knowledge of the Kana
# being under no particular time constraints to learn the language
# wanting to learn Japanese for personal reasons, such as having Japanese friends, enjoying manga/anime or planning a trip to Japan
# being inexperienced at language learning and easy to scare off / easy to lose motivation

From my experience, this group is actually the majority of young people wanting to learn Japanese. This particular target audience places several restrictions on the course (which won't hurt it too much if somebody from outside the target audience visits either):
# everything has to be explained, e. g. including the very concept of a &quot;particle&quot;. Compare to English whenever possible to lessen the &quot;alien&quot; feel of Japanese.
# vocabulary and situations should be basic and taken from everyday life
# language should be polite in tourist situations and informal/modern in any other situation (for use with Japanese friends or over the internet)
# lessons need to be dead-easy. For this purpose, preferably write several small lessons rather than one big one. The ratio of Japanese dialog/text to grammar explanations or length of vocabulary lists should be always favoring Japanese dialog/text, as exposure to the language is vital.
# we need to provide the motivation. A lesson is motivating if it is funny, wow-ing, or at the very least of obvious usefulness. It also helps to have a consistent story told over several lessons, so people come back to read more.
# tips for how to learn/memorize something will always be welcome

=== [[/Lesson 1/]]: Arriving in Tokyo ===
'''Story:''' The protagonist arrives at the airport. His friend/host is supposed to pick him up there, but the protagonist is not sure which of the Japanese people it is, so he strikes up conversations with various people waiting there. &lt;br&gt;
'''Teach:''' Greeting, introducing oneself using &quot;desu&quot;, asking whether the other one is X using &quot;ka&quot;, answering negatively with ja-arimasen and answering positively.

=== [[/Lesson 2/]]: Introductions ===
'''Story:''' The protagonist has found his friend/host and has gone home with him. His friend introduces his friend or family. Small talk. &lt;br&gt;
'''Teach:''' Introducing others, particles &quot;no&quot; and &quot;wa&quot;, saying more about oneself (e. g. -jin, come from, occupation...)

=== Lesson 3: Around the house ===
'''Story:''' The protagonist is unfamiliar with Japanese interior design and has to ask where some things are in the house. &lt;br&gt; 
'''Teach:''' Questions with &quot;doko&quot; and &quot;arimasu ka&quot;, answers with &quot;arimasu&quot; / &quot;arimasen&quot;, particle &quot;ga&quot;, particle &quot;ni&quot; if unavoidable.

=== Lesson 4: Making plans ===
'''Story:''' For now the protagonist is too tired to do anything, but afterwards he may want to, and his host already has some ideas.
'''Teach:''' Questions with &quot;itsu... ka?&quot;, verbs for present and future, &quot;tai desu&quot;, maybe another particle (e. g. &quot;o&quot;) if it fits well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Layer (PSF).png|thumb|Layering]]'''Layering''' is a means of plant propagation in which a portion of an above-ground stem grows roots while still attached to the parent plant and then detaches as an independent plant. Layering has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants.

Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces [[w:adventitious roots|adventitious roots]]. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result. 

The horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the inner stem and optionally applying rooting compounds. In '''ground layering''', the stem is bent down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant. In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.

Layering is more complicated than taking cuttings, but has the advantage that the propagated portion can continue to receive water and nutrients from the parent plant while it is forming roots.  This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces.

==Ground layering==
Ground layering is the typical propagation technique for the popular [[w:Malling-Merton|Malling-Merton]] series of clonal apple rootstocks in which the original plants are set in the ground with the stem nearly horizontal, which forces side buds to grow upward. After these are started the original stem is buried up to the tip. At the end of the growing season, the side branches will have rooted, and can be separated while the plant is dormant. Some of these will be used for grafting rootstocks, and some can be reused in the nursery for the next growing season's crop.

==Air layering==
In '''air layering''' (or marcotting), the target region is wounded and then surrounded in a moisture-retaining wrapper such as sphagnum moss, which is further surrounded in a moisture barrier such as polyethylene film. Rooting hormone is often applied to encourage the wounded region to grow roots. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem from the parent plant is removed and planted.

==4.Most house plants like a 65-to 75-degree (18 C - 22 C) temperature. Name one that requires a cool room (45 to 55 degrees F.) (7 C - 13 C).==
The '''cyclamen''' commonly sold by florists is ''C. persicum'', which is frost-tender. Selected cyclamen cultivars can have white, bright pink, red or purple flowers. While flowering, florists' cyclamens should be kept below 68 °F (20 °C), with the night time temperatures preferably between 44 °F to 59 °F (6.67 °C to 15 °C). Temperatures above 68 °F (20 °C) may induce the plant to go dormant.

==5.Prepare a special potting mix soil including at least 3 different ingredients. Select two house plants from requirement two and grow them in this soil for three weeks.==
{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement
|Rather than calling out &quot;requirement two&quot;, it is almost certain that this requirement should be calling out &quot;requirement eleven&quot;.  The wording of requirement 11 supports this thought, and lists 21 plants for use in requirements 5 and 8.  Some of these are not raised for their flowers (Boston Fern being the prime example) as per requirement 2.  We therefore will assume in these answers that requirement 11 was the intended reference here.

===Soil Ingredients===
Different potting soil ingredients impart different properties to the soil.  We list several ingredients here along with their characteristics:
;Clay: Clay is soil that sticks together into a ball when compressed.  It is impermeable to water, so it inhibits drainage.  It is very common in garden soil and is typically avoided as a potting soil ingredient.
;Silt: Silt is soil or rock derived granular material of a specific grain size. Silt may occur as a soil or alternatively as suspended sediment in a water column of any surface water body. It may also exist as deposition soil at the bottom of a water body. 
;Sand: Sand is made up of mineral grains larger than those that make up silt.  Water will pass through sand, so it is useful in creating well-drained soils.
;Perlite: Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content.  It makes composts more open to air, while still having good water-retention properties.  It can therefore hold water in the soil until it is needed by a plant.
;Vermiculite: Vermiculite is a natural mineral that expands with the application of heat. It is very similar to perlite and has many of the same properties.
;Peat: Peat is soft and easily compressed. Under pressure, water in the peat is forced out.  It is also dug into soil to increase the soil's capacity to retain moisture and add nutrients.
;Humus: Humus refers to any organic matter which has reached a point of stability, where it will break down no further and might, if conditions do not change, remain essentially as it is for centuries, if not millennia.  It is often the basis for potting soils.
;Compost: Also known as brown manure, compost is the aerobically decomposed remnants of organic matter.  Compost serves as a growing medium,or a porous, absorbent material that holds moisture and soluble minerals, providing the support and nutrients in which most plants will flourish. To maximize plant growth, it is sometimes necessary to dilute compost with soil or peat to reduce salinity or to add neutralisers to bring the pH closer to 7, or additional nutrients like fertilisers or manure, wetting agents, and materials to improve drainage and aeration, such as sand, grit, bark chips, vermiculite, perlite, or clay granules.
;Manure: Manure is organic matter used as fertilizer. Manures contribute to the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients, such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil. Manure is generally acidic, lowering the soil's pH.  It is often combined with lime to bring the pH back to a neutral level.
;Pea gravel/crushed stone: These are often layered at the bottom of a pot to promote drainage.  Crushed stone will also raise the pH of the soil making is less acidic.
;Fertilizer: Inorganic fertilizers are described by three numbers (such as 10-20-20) which specify the amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) they contain.  These are essential plant nutrients.
;Lime: Lime is used for raising the pH of soil.  Combined with manure, the horticulturalist can set the soil's pH level to a plant's optimum level.
;Bonemeal: Bone meal is a mixture of crushed and coarsely ground bones that is used as an organic fertilizer. As a slow-release fertilizer, bone meal is primarily used as a source of phosphorus.
;Blood meal: Blood meal is dried, powdered animal blood used as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. It is one of the highest non-synthetic sources of nitrogen and if over-applied it can burn plants with excessive ammonia. Blood meal is completely soluble and can be mixed with water to be used as a liquid fertilizer.
;Pine bark: Shredded bark will make soil hold more water.

==6.How much light does an African violet need? Where in the house is the best place to grow them? Grow two or more African violets.==
African Violets do best when the available light is about 1000 foot candles, though unless you have access ot a light meter, this information is not terribly useful.  Instead, you should learn how to tell if the plant is getting too much or too little light by observing its leaves.  If they receive too much light, the leaves will turn pale or yellowish green.  If they are not receiving enough, the leaves will turn a deep, dark shade of green.  African Violets need fairly bright light, but should not be placed in direct sunlight.  Rather, they need diffuse, indirect light.  If you place your hand between the plant and its light source, your hand should cast a shadow, but it should not feel too hot.  This light level can typically be attained by placing the plant about one meter from a southeast- or west-facing window.

Furthermore, they will not bloom unless they have at least eight hours darkness every day, so if you are growing them under lights, make sure the lights are on a timer.

==7.All gesneriads need approximately the same growing conditions. Where do they come from originally? What kind of temperature, light, and humidity do they need?==
Saintpaulia, commonly known as African violet, is a genus of 6 species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae, native to Tanzania and adjacent southeastern Kenya in eastern tropical Africa, with a concentration of species in the Nguru mountains of Tanzania. 

African violets prefer a constant temperature between 20-25 °C (68-77 °F) with high humidity, and thrive best planted in well-drained humus or coir compost.  We sometimes think of the tropics as very HOT and HUMID places, but under the tall trees of a true tropical environment, the temperature is rather moderate and comfortable, though the amount of moisture in the air is higher than in many places in the western U.S.  

In practical houseplanting terms, this means that African violets and other gesnariads (jes nair' e ad OR guess nair' e ad) are comfortable in the same temperatures and moisture levels that human beings are UNLESS the African violet is placed near an air conditioning vent, where the cold dry air will cause it to perish.

|8. Name two house plants that can be propagated from leaves, stem sections or divi­sions. Select one plant from requirement eleven below, experiment with each of these methods of propagation and keep them growing for three months.
}}
===Cuttings===
;Leaf cuttings: Any plant with leaves such as African Violet, Geranium etc. can be propagated with leaf cuttings. Using a sharp knife, cut off a healthy leaf at the point where it joins the stem. Insert the cut part, called a petiole, into the rooting hormone. Place the end into a small container of light potting soil in which you make a small hole with a pencil.  Making a hole prior to planting assures that the rooting hormone will not be brushed off the cutting when you plant it. Perlite, Vermiculite, and/or water-soaked Sphagnum moss can be added to potting soil to make the soil light. Make sure the leaf is leaning slightly so that the new plants will have plenty of light and not be shaded by the leaf.

;Stem cuttings: These are treated just like leaf cuttings except you cut off a stem with several leaves instead of just one leaf. Remove the bottom leaves, leaving a few at the top. Proceed as with the leaf cutting.

In both instances, cover the pot with a plastic bag or inverted glass jar. This will keep moisture from evaporating and keep the cutting from wilting. Keep in a warm location with diffused light but out of direct sunlight. When there is indications of growth after about 3 to 6 weeks, transplant the new emerging plant into a new pot of potting soil. Continue to keep a humid environment for about 2 more weeks until active growth begins.
===Layering===
'''Layering''' is a means of plant propagation in which a portion of an aerial stem grow roots while still attached to the parent plant and then detaches as an independent plant. 

Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces adventitious roots. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result. 

The horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the inner stem and optionally applying rooting compounds. In '''ground layering''', the stem is bent down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in plant nurseries in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as brambles which bow over and touch the tip on the ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant. In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.

Layering is more complicated than taking cuttings, but has the advantage that the propagated portion can continue to receive water and nutrients from the parent plant while it is forming roots.  This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces.
===Offsets===
Offsets are layers of plants in the plant nursery business. They are clones of the mother plants (&quot;hens and chicks&quot;), meaning that they have the same genetic code.

Offsets form when meristem regions of plants, such as axillary buds or homologous structures enlarge, and differentiate into a new plant with self-sustaining structures. Tulips and lilies are examples which display offset characteristics.

When propagating plants to increase a stock of a cultivar, thus seeking identical copies of parent plant, various cloning techniques (asexual reproduction) are used. Offsets is a natural means by which plants may be cloned.

In contrast, when propagating plants to create new cultivars, sexual reproduction through pollination is used to create seeds. The recombination of genes gives rise to offspring plant with similar but distinct offspring genome.
===Division===
Division is a method of asexual plant propagation, where the plant (usually an herbaceous perennial) is broken up into two or more parts. Both the root and crown of each part is kept intact.  The technique is of ancient origin, and has long been used to propagate bulbs such as garlic and saffron.  

To divide a plant, wait until late summer when the plant has quit producing flowers and has died back. Dig up the bulbs and break them apart as you would a clove of garlic (which is a bulb).  Replant the bulbs wherever you want them (some perhaps in the very spot where you dug them up, others elsewhere).

===The Plants===
;a. Narcissus: The Narcissus is most easily propagated by dividing the bulbs in late summer.
;b. Aspidistra: Divide the rhizomes (underground stems).
;c. Philodendron: Propagate with stem cuttings, air layering, or by offsets.
;d. Aluminum plant: Propagate by cuttings or divisions.
;e. Daffodil: See Narcissus (Daffodils belong to the ''Narcissus'' genus)
;f. Sanseveria: Use leaf cuttings
;g. Boston fern: Propagate by division in early spring.
;h. Piggy-back plant: Propagate by divisions, layering, leaf cuttings
;i. Bird's nest fern: Divide the root ball.
;j. Caladium: Divide the roots in the fall, clean them, and store them over the winter in a dry, dark place at least 40°F (4°C) or warmer.  Replant in the spring.
;k. Gloxinia: Best when propagated from seed, but you can also try tuber, stem, and leaf cuttings.
;l. Spider plant: Propagate by layering or by dividing the mother plant.
;m. Geranium: Use stem cuttings in late summer or early fall before the first frost.
;n. Maidenhair fern: Divide mother plant in the spring.
;o. Begonia: Take stem cuttings and place them in a small jar of water until roots form and grow to a half inch (12 mm) long.  Then transplant to potting soil.
;p. Ficus: Remove a stem with at least five nodes.  Bury three of them in a well drained potting mix and water it well.
;q. Tulip: Tulips can be propagated through offsets.
;r. Iris: Divide the rhizomes in the fall.
;s. Crocus: Divide the corm (bulb-like stem) in the fall.
;t. Coleus: Take stem cuttings at any time of the year.
;u. Hyacinth: Divide bulbs into bulblets in the fall.

==9. What is a Bonsai?==
[[Image:Bonsai IMG 6421.jpg|thumb|200px|Bonsai]]
Bonsai is the art of aesthetic miniaturization of trees by growing them in containers. Cultivation includes techniques for shaping, watering, and repotting in various styles of containers.  The word ''bonsai'' has been used in the West as an umbrella term for all miniature trees.

==10. What is humidity? How is it important to house plants?==
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. The term &quot;humidity&quot; is usually taken in daily language to refer to relative humidity. Relative humidity is defined as the amount of water vapor in a sample of air compared to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at any specific temperature in a form of 0 to 100%.

Humidity, along with temperature, moisture, light, soil mixture, fertilizers, potting, and pest control, is one of the critical factors that should be considered when caring for a houseplant.  

Humidity is slightly more difficult to control than temperature. The more commonly used houseplants have established that they can survive in low humidity environments as long as their roots are kept properly irrigated. Most plants thrive in 80% relative humidity while most homes are usually kept around 20% to 60% relative humidity. Besides buying a humidifier, there are a few things that can be done to increase humidity around houseplants. The most popular methods used to raise the ambient humidity are misting and pebble trays, which are shallow trays covered with pebbles and filled with water that evaporates to increase humidity. Other methods of raising humidity include grouping plants closely together and not placing plants in drafty areas. Misting is somewhat controversial among gardeners, with some that swear by it and others that say it does little to increase humidity around plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Section 11.1 Number Sets and Fields===

You are familiar with many or all of the terms &lt;i&gt;natural numbers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;integers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rational numbers&lt;/i&gt; as well as &lt;i&gt;irrational numbers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;real numbers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;complex numbers&lt;/i&gt;.  Geometry uses abbreviation and set notation for these.  A &lt;i&gt;set&lt;/i&gt; is a number of unique objects such as numbers.  The following proposition describes number sets abbreviated thus: natural numbers are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;,
integers are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (because the German word starts with z,) rationals are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
(quotients,) reals are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and complexes are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and each
set on the left is a &lt;i&gt;subset&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. set contained within a set, of all sets on the right.  That is indicated by a symbol similar to &lt;,
because each set on the right is either greater than all on the left, or seems to be greater than
all on the left, though in some cases they are equal.  It is fine if you know how certain ones are
equal, but mainly note that the ones on the right have greater complexity than all to their left.

    '''proposition 11.0''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;⊂&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us review the definitions of these sets with &lt;i&gt;[http://www.wikipedia.com/Set_builder_notation set builder notation]&lt;/i&gt;.  Following are the natural numbers; there are two ways of defining them.  All objects within braces are elements, i.e. members, of the same set.

    &lt;i&gt;counting numbers&lt;/i&gt;: {1,2,3,...}

    &lt;i&gt;whole numbers&lt;/i&gt;: {0,1,2,3...}

Integers are counting numbers and negative whole numbers: clearly any counting number can be called an integer.

    &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;={...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...}

Each number set represents a number line, and a set with a subscript means numbers from 0 to 1 less than subscript, for example &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_3&lt;/math&gt;={0,1,2}.  That is a reason counting numbers start at 0.

The following statement uses the symbols |, which means 'such that the following is true' (people usually just say 'such that,') and &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; (Greek letter eta).  The object to the left of eta is an element of the set to the right of eta.  Any integer can be written as a rational, but rational numbers include fractions/decimals.

    '''proposition 11.1''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{m}{n} | m,n\in\mathbb{Z},n\ne0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The rational, real, and complex numbers are fields, which are higher categories than sets.  One property of fields is that they are ordered in a certain more complex way; it is good if you  noticed the way to define rationals uses some more complex order.

    '''proposition 11.2''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;eal numbers are simply sums of rationals for which they equal infinite
    decimals, such as 3.14159265359....  

Any rational number can be written as a real one (such as with infinite zeroes afterwards,) but reals include irrational numbers.  There are more complicated ways to define the reals which you do not need to know yet, but if you want to, read about [http://www.wikipedia.com/Cantor_snake Cantor's snake].

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;omplex numbers include imaginary numbers, and any non-imaginary number can be written as a complex one.  These are not used much in geometry except advanced topics, but there is something you might find interesting about them.  A number set with a superscript n means the set in n dimensions, defining n orthogonal number lines. 

   '''proposition 11.3''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Section 11.2  Dimensional Sets in Real Space===

A ray represents &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and lines represent &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, but the ray and lines are more continuous ('appearing solid') than the sets.

   '''proposition 11.4''':&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; represents the real number line, which is infinite.

A number set with a sign superscripted means the set in that sign, and objects on the left and right of a &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; symbol are defined to be in the same set.  For example &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+\cup0&lt;/math&gt; is a ray from 0 to infinity in real space.  Recall that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a line, and note that it is a real (continuous; appearing 'solid') line, and recall that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is 2 orthogonal lines.

   '''proposition 11.5''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; represents the Cartesian real plane, which is infinite.

   '''proposition 11.6''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; represents a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which is infinite.

   '''optional proposition (for enthusiasm/fun) 11.7''': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; represents a 4-dimensional Euclidean space, 
   a continuum or part of one, which is infinite.

Points in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt; are defined (x,y,z,t) and it is used to described temporal geometric operations such as rotations, translations, and transformations, which are the main things you might use it for in geometry, but the set also defines 4-dimensional objects.

An ordered set, ''S'', is said to be a '''linear continuum''' if it satisfies the following properties:

a) ''S'' has the least upper bound property

b) For each ''x'' in ''S'' and each ''y'' in ''S'' with ''x'' &lt; ''y'', there exists ''z'' in ''S'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''

A set has the least upper bound property, if every nonempty subset of the set that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Linear continua are particularly important in the field of topology where they can be used to verify whether a ordered set given the [[order topology]] is connected or not.

==Examples==

1. The ordered set of real numbers, '''R''', with its usual order is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial, and property a) is simply a reformulaton of the completeness axiom.

2. The set of rational numbers is not a linear continuum. Even though property b) is satisfied, property a) is not. Consider the subset:

:''A'' = { ''x'' | ''x'' &lt; &amp;radic;2 }

of the set of rational numbers. Even though this set is bounded above by any rational number greater than &amp;radic;2 (for instance 3), it has no least upper bound.

3. The set of non-negative integers with its usual order is not a linear continuum. Property a) is satisfied (let ''A'' be a subset of the set of non-negative integers that is bounded above. Then ''A'' is finite so that it has a maximum. This maximum is the desired least upper bound of ''A''). On the other hand, property b) is not. Indeed, 5 is a non-negative integer and so is 6, but there exists no non-negative integer that lies strictly between them. 

4. The ordered set ''A'' of nonzero real numbers:

:''A'' = (-∞, 0) U (0, +∞)

is not a linear continuum. Property b) is trivially satisfied. However, if ''B'' is the set of negative real numbers:

:''B'' = (-∞, 0)

then ''B'' is a subset of ''A'' which is bounded above (by any element of ''A'' greater than 0; for instance 1), but has no least upper bound in ''A''. Notice that 0 is not a bound for ''B'' since 0 is not an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A''.

5. Let Z&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; denote the set of negative integers and let A = (0,5) &amp;cup; (5,+∞). Let:

:S = Z&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; U A

Then S satisfies neither property a) nor property b). The proof is similar to examples 3 and 4.

6. The set ''I'' &amp;times; ''I'' (where &amp;times; denotes the Cartesian product and ''I'' = [0,&amp;nbsp;1]) in the lexicographic order is a linear continuum. Property b) is trivial. To check property a), we define a map, π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : I &amp;times; ''I'' -&gt; ''I'' by:

:π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'', ''y'') = ''x''

This map is known as the projection map. The projection map is continuous (with respect to the product topology on ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''I'') and is surjective. Let ''A'' be a nonempty subset of ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''I'' which is bounded above. Consider π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). Since ''A'' is bounded above, π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') must also be bounded above. Since, π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a subset of ''I'', it must have a least upper bound (since ''I'' has the [[least upper bound property]]). Therefore, we may let ''b'' be the least upper bound of π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''). If ''b'' belongs to π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''I'' will intersect ''A'' at say ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''c'' for some ''c''&amp;nbsp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''. We merely choose the maximum c satisfying the property and ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''c'' will be the desired least upper bound of ''A '' (note that: since ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''I'' has the same [order type of I, the set (''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''I'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;cap;&amp;nbsp;''A'', will indeed have a least upper bound). If ''b'' doesn't belong to π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A''), then ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;0 is the least upper bound of ''A''. for if ''d'' &lt; ''b'', and ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''e'' is a least upper bound of ''A'', then ''d'' would be a smaller upper bound of π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') than ''b'', contradicting the unique property of ''b''.

==Topological properties of linear continua==

Even though linear continua are important in the study of ordered sets, they do have applications in the mathematical field of topology. In fact, we will prove that an ordered set in the order topology is connected iff it is a linear continua (notice the 'if and only if' part). We will prove one implication, and leave the other one as an exercise:

'''Theorem'''

Let ''X'' be an ordered set in the order topology. If ''X'' is connected, then ''X'' is a linear continuum.

''Proof:''

Suppose, x is in X and y is in X where x &lt; y. If there exists no z in X such that x &lt; z &lt; y, consider the sets:

A = (-∞, y)

B = (x, +∞)

These sets are disjoint (If a is in A, a &lt; y so that if a is in B, a &gt; x and a &lt; y which is impossible by hypothesis), nonempty (x is in A and y is in B) and open (in the order topology) and their union is X. This contradicts the connectedness of X.

Now we prove the least upper bound property. If C is a subset of X that is bounded above and has no least upper bound, let D be the union of all open rays of the form (b, +infinity) where b is an upper bound for C. Then D is open (since it is the union of open sets), and closed (if 'a' is not in D, then a &lt; b for all upper bounds b of C so that we may choose q &gt; a such that q is in C (if no such q exists, a is an upper bound of C), then an open interval containing a, may be chosen that doesn't intersect D). Since D is nonempty (there is more than one upper bound of D for if there was exactly one upper bound s, s would be the least upper bound. Then if b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two upper bounds of D with b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will belong to D), D and its complement together form a separation on X. This contradicts the connectedness of X.

===Applications of the theorem===

1. Notice that since the [[ordered set]]: 

A = (-∞, 0) U (0,+∞) 

is not a linear continuum, it is disconnected.

2. By applying the theorem just proved, the fact that R is connected follows. In fact any interval (or ray) in R is also connected.

3. Notice how the set of integers is not a linear continuum and therefore cannot be connected.

4. In fact, if an ordered set in the order topology is a linear continuum, it must be connected. Since any interval in this set is also a linear continuum, it follows that this space is [[locally connectedness|locally connected]] since it has a basis consisting entirely of connected sets.

5. For an interesting example of a topological space that is a linear continuum, see long line (in Wikipedia).

==Exercises==

1. a)* Prove that if X is a linear continuum, then X is connected.
   
b) Give an example of a set that satisfies property b) in the definition of a linear continuum, but isn't connected

2. a) Is a locally connected, ordered set given the order topology a linear continuum?
   
b) Does the converse of a) hold?

3. Show that if Y is a well ordered set, then Y X [0,1) is a linear continuum.

4*. a) Every path connected ordered set given the order topology is a linear continuum, but is every linear continuum necessarily path connected? (Hint: Why not check the dictionary order topology?)

b) The reader is referred to exercise 4 of the next section for the answer to this problem. However, the reader is encouraged not to see exercise 4 in the next section unless he/she has solved the problem. Note that * is used in 4.a) to indicate difficulty. You must prove your claim in 4.a) !      

5.a) Determine whether or not an ordered set with the order topology satisfying b) has finitely many components.

b) Notice that property a) of the linear important is crucially important in order to determine the connectedness of an ordered set given the order topology. Show that if X is an ordered set with the order topology that only satisfies property b) in the definition of a linear continuum, then X may be totally disconnected. Give an example of such an ordered set X.

6. Is the following result true:

An ordered set X has the order topology equal to the discrete topology on X, if and only if X doesn't satisfy property b) in the definition of a linear continuum.  

If no, does at least one implication hold and which one is it?

{{TOC right}}

A '''comb space''' is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; that looks rather like a comb. The comb space satisfies some rather interesting properties and provides interesting counterexamples. The topologist's sine curve satisfies similar properties to the comb space.  The '''deleted comb space''' is an important variation on the comb space.

==Formal definition==

Consider &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; with its standard topology and let ''K'' be the set &lt;math&gt;\{1/n | n \in \mathbb N\}&lt;/math&gt;. The set ''C'' defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;(\{0\} \times [0,1] ) \cup (K \times [0,1]) \cup ([0,1] \times \{0\})&lt;/math&gt;

considered as a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\R^2&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the subspace topology is known as the comb space. The deleted comb space, D, is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;(\{0\}\times \{0,1\})\cup (K \times [0,1]) \cup ([0,1] \times \{0\})   &lt;/math&gt;

is just the comb space with the line segment &lt;math&gt;\{0\} \times (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; deleted. 

==Topological properties==

The comb space and the deleted comb space satisfy some interesting topological properties mostly related to the notion of local connectedness (see next chapter). 

1. We shall note that the comb space is clearly path connected and hence connected. Also, if we deleted the set (0 X [0,1]) out of the comb space, we obtain a new set whose closure is the comb space. Since this ‘new set’ is connected, and the deleted comb space, D, is a superset of this ‘new set’ and a subset of the closure of this new set, the deleted comb space is also connected.

2. However, the deleted comb space is not path connected since there is no path from (0,1) to (0,0).    

3. The comb space is an example of a path connected space which is not locally path connected; see the page on locally connected space (next chapter).

4. Let us prove our claim in 2. Suppose there is a path from ''p'' = (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to a point ''q'' in ''D''. Let ƒ:[0,&amp;nbsp;1]&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'' be this path. We shall prove that ƒ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} is both open and closed in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] contradicting the connectedness of this set. Clearly we have ƒ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} is closed in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] by the continuity of ƒ. To prove that ƒ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} is open, we proceed as follows: Choose a neighbourhood V (open in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) about ''p'' that doesn’t intersect the ''x''–axis. Then there is a basis element ''U'' containing ƒ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} such that ƒ(''U'') is a subset of ''V''.  We know that U is connected since it is a basis element for the order topology on [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. Therefore, ƒ(''U'') is connected. We assert that ƒ(''U'') = {''p''} so that ƒ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} is open. Suppose ƒ(''U'') contains a point (''z'',&amp;nbsp;1/''n'') other than ''p''.  Then (''z'',&amp;nbsp;1/''n'') must belong to ''D''. Choose ''r'' such that 1/(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1/''n''. Since ƒ(''U'') doesn’t intersect the ''x''-axis, the sets:

: ''A'' = (&amp;minus;&amp;infin;, ''r'') &amp;times; ''R''

: ''B'' = (''r'', +&amp;infin;) &amp;times; ''R''

will form a separation on ''f''(''U''); contradicting the connectedness of ''f''(''U''). Therefore, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;{''p''} is both open and closed in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This is a contradiction.

'''ATTEMPT QUESTIONS 2.c), 2.d) AND 3 IMMEDIATELY AFTER STUDYING THE NEXT SECTION.'''

==Exercises==

1. a)* Prove that the comb space is compact without using the Heine Borel theorem.
   
b) HENCE show that the set K = {1/n | n is a natural number} U {0}     is compact (Hint: Prove that if X  X  Y is a product space, and Y is compact, then the projection onto the first co-ordinate is a closed map (i.e, maps closed sets in X  X  Y onto closed sets in X). Then if C is the comb space, C is a closed subset of I X I (I = [0,1]) given the product topology. Assume that I = [0,1] is compact and use a theorem from the section on compactness)
   
c) Show that the deleted comb space is not compact

2*. a) Let A be a connected subset of R. Show that if x is in A, y is in A with x &lt; y, then the whole interval [x,y] is a subset of A.
    
b) Show that a compact subset of R necessarily contains both its supremum and infimum (Hint: If A is a compact subset of R, A is closed. Prove that both the supremum of A and infimum of A belong to the closure of A and hence to A.)
    
c) Show that every closed interval in R is locally connected.
    
d) Show that the comb space cannot be imbedded in R (Hint: Suppose it could be imbedded in R and let A be the subset of R that the comb space, C, is homeomorphic to. By noting that the comb space is path connected and hence connected, and that A must be compact (since C is homeomorphic to A and C is compact by exercise 1.a)), show that A has to be a closed interval. Therefore, A is locally connected by exercise 2.c)
    
e) Can the deleted comb space be imbedded in R? Justify your answer.

3. a) Prove that an open subspace of a locally connected space is locally connected.
    
b) Let X be locally homeomorphic to Y; that is there is a map f from X to Y that satisfies the following property:

For each point x of X, there is a neighbourhood V of x that is homeomorphic to an open subset of Y under the map f (i.e, the map f restricted to V is the homeomorphism)

Prove that if Y is locally connected, so is X (Hint: Use part a))

c) Let C be the comb space. Prove that C is not a manifold (a manifold is a Hasudorff topological space X that has a countable base for its topology and is locally homeomorphic to R^n for some integer n). (Hint: Use part b) and note that a subspace of a Haudorff space is Haudorff, and that a subspace of a space having a countable basis for its topology also has a countable basis for its topology).

__TOC__

'''Ada&amp;nbsp;80''' was a preliminary version of the Ada programming language. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 ([[Wikipedia:Ada Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and given the number '''MIL-STD-1815''' in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year.

The [[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada&amp;nbsp;83]] standard, MIL-STD-1815''A'', was later derived from Ada&amp;nbsp;80.

Ada&amp;nbsp;80 is just interesting from a historic point of view, there is no code that must conform with this standard.

== Re: Spat ==

Thanks for the suggestions. I am all for good, challenging excercises, but as I mentioned, I was simultaneously learning and editing the Topology book, and there are precious few tough problems a first time learner can come up with. However, keeping applications of theorems as excercises seems a great idea.

If you could spare some time, I suggest you glance over the book [[Real Analysis]]. I have added quite a bit of stuff there, but there are some flaws in it as it stands. (The heirarchy is tacky, some of the proofs (the ones I've come up with) look unpolished and there are no problems). Any comments for improvements (or improvements themselves!) are welcome.

Regards&lt;br /&gt;[[User:SPat|&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Pat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SPat|&lt;font face=&quot;italic&quot; color=&quot;black&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:40, 8 June 2008 (UTC)


:Thanks

:I have noticed in the [[Topology]] book that there is a sharp jump in difficulty level (or rather the level of preparedness) between the parts '''General Topology''' and '''Algebraic Topology'''. Is it possible to make the algebraic topology section a bit more accessible (by adding sections on prereqiusites of Algebra for example)? I couldn't make anything in the chapter [[Topology/The fundamental group|The fundamental group]] when I read it here, but I found Munkres' treatment quite accessible. 

:Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;[[User:SPat|&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Black&quot;&gt;S&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Pat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SPat|&lt;font face=&quot;italic&quot; color=&quot;black&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:05, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:::This is mostly because they are not very well-developed. I, as [[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] have tried to make the beginning sections very concise complete, so that people can move on to the next sections. This is the reason why it is not very developed. I, too, am simultaneously learning Topology and writing out the pages of the Topology book simultaneously, and I have not really gotten much to the part on the Fundamental Group yet.--[[Special:Contributions/131.243.31.197|131.243.31.197]] ([[User talk:131.243.31.197|talk]]) 22:23, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

== Abstract Algebra [And Differential Equations] ==

It seems that the Abstract Algebra could use a lot of work. If you are able to, can you do what you can to help improve the Abstract Algebra one?--[[User:The Scarlet Letter|A]] ([[User talk:The Scarlet Letter|talk]]) 07:18, 30 July 2008 (UTC)

Additionally, it seems like the Differential Equations book needs a lot of work as well. I think that we should work on it.

== [[Geometry for elementary school/Lines]] ==

I rolled back your changes to [[Geometry for elementary school/Lines]].  Although they may technically be correct, they are clearly beyond the comprehension of an elementary student (that is, a kid typically between the ages of 6 and 12, inclusive).  I am actually assuming that your additions were correct - they were beyond my grasp too, and I have taken a few graduate-level courses in mathematics (though it was some years ago).  I do not discount the possibility that there might be a half dozen or so elementary students ''somewhere'' in the world that could have understood what you wrote.  But it is clearly beyond the scope of the book.--[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:46, 30 October 2008 (UTC)

== Re: Real analysis ==

Thanks,

*I meant monotonically increasing. I thought the two terms were interchangeable.
*I am specifically refering to two (arbitrary) adjacent members of the partition, but yes, perhaps your way puts it better. 

As it stands the [[Calculus]] book is a high-school level calculus book, where as [[Real Analysis]] is what I would put as introductory undergraduate. Specifically, I think ''Real Analysis'' is kind of more proof-based than ''Calculus''. 

For ''Analysis'' as an advanced subject, we already have books on [[Measure Theory]] and [[Functional Analysis]]. I think this book fits in the gap between school level ''Calculus'' and advanced level ''Measure Theory''.

Cheers,

==\obeylines and \obeyspaces==

It is probably a good idea if someone works in the \obeylines and \obeyspaces commands in this section, as they can be fairly important when writing your own macro. It is rather confusing to discover (La)TeX  treats all whitespace as the same type of spacing glue, and that you need to wrap text you want to preserve the spacing and newlines as you wrote it for in

\begingroup&lt;br&gt;
\obeylines&lt;br&gt;
\obeyspaces&lt;br&gt;
Relevant text here&lt;br&gt;
\endgroup

which means that you will probably need to combine your own verbatim environment, and your command:

\newenvironment{\yourverbatim}{\begingroup \obeylines \obeyspaces}{\endgroup}&lt;br&gt;
\newcommand{\yourcommand}[n]{do something with #1 .. #n}

and then in your tex file:

\begin{yourverbatim}&lt;br&gt;
\yourcommand{&lt;br&gt;
whichever text it is important you&lt;br&gt;
preserve the spacing and newslines&lt;br&gt;
for, like when you want to generate&lt;br&gt;
a verbatim block later on.&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
\end{yourverbatim}


I don't have enough knowledge of wiki editing to do this cleanly, I'd probably just screw up a perfectly usable page somehow.

Thank you for your contribution! --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 15:46, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== keyval/xkeyval ==

Maybe someone can add some information about keyval/xkeyval which makes handling of arguments way more comfortable and powerful.

== A Little Question ==

In some point there is the sentence &quot;LaTeX will silently ignore it.&quot; What does &quot;it&quot; refer to? The LaTeX &quot;old&quot; command or the attempt of definition?

PS.: my thanks to anyone who answer that.

:Done by someone. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 13:40, 4 January 2013 (UTC)

== Multiple default values ==

The article gives an example of default values for a newcommand, but this method only works with one default value.

Is there a way to give more default values, and if so, please give an example.

:keyval and xkeyval, as told above. --[[User:Ambrevar|Ambrevar]] ([[User talk:Ambrevar|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ambrevar|contribs]]) 13:40, 4 January 2013 (UTC)

== Problem with source coloring ==

In my browser (Chrome) there seems to be a problem with source coloring. As an example the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\newcommand{name}[num]{definition}
&lt;/source&gt;
Shows the brace preceding ''name'' in the same coloring as the brace trailing ''definition''. Since these are not paired, i.e. opening with closing brace, I believe this is in error.
[[User:Hsmyers|Hsmyers]] ([[User talk:Hsmyers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hsmyers|contribs]]) 01:50, 20 December 2012 (UTC)

== Expanding arithmetic section ==

I was reading the section [[LaTeX/Macros#Arithmetic | Arithmetic]] and I find it hardly understandable. It has some packages' names and some examples but nothing else.
I would willingly expand it in some weeks, but if somebody wants to do it please go ahead. That is why I marked it to be expanded.
I would suggest to make this arithmetic section (if it is expanded enough!) to make it a subsection of the section ''technical texts'' as the subsection [[LaTeX/Mathematics]] is. I believe that this both packages ''calc'' and ''fp'' can be explained in greater detail and provide lots of useful functions. (I am working with them ;-))

      <text xml:space="preserve">While it is not required that you have a professional teach you (or your kids) to swim, it is highly advisable. Check with your local pool (a local college, or YMCA for example) to see what kind of swimming courses are offered.

== The Lack of Writing on Building Construction ==

Information on the practices of building are too complex, too esoteric to be grasped and comprehensively recorded by those who deal in words rather than in bricks and mortar. With neither the manual skills nor the know-how of the expert artisan, the men adept with words - those who had been formally educated in philosophy and other polite studies, the gentlemen of each era - have traditionally shown their superiority by denigrating the artisan and by relegating him to an inferior status in society. The intelligentsia - the philosophers and priests along with the politicians, administrators, and men of affairs - have invariably all media of the spoken and written word. What they did not understand they either belittled or ignored. This patronizing attitude toward artisans has prevailed everywhere, in almost all eras and civilized cultures, creating a major distinction, a social dichotomy, between those who worked with their hands, no matter how expertly, and those who talked and/or wrote.

 

Among a large number of examples confirming this attitude, a striking case - exceptional only because of the preeminent stature of the man involved and the fact he fought back articulately - is that of Leonardo da Vinci. 

Leonardo's greatest problems were caused by the contempt in which he was held by humanists... having lacked the opportunity of attending a university to study liberal arts, he had learned no Greek and very little Latin, This was to prove a major stumbling block in his life. The Renaissance humanists, who were his contemporaries, glorified the great culture of classical antiquity, but to him that culture was largely a closed book. He was probably never truly accepted in a humanist milieu, where discussion would very often be carried on in Latin... Thus, time and time again in his writings Leonardo returns to the scorns of the humanists: &quot;Because I am not a literary man some presumptuous persons will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging I am an unlettered man, Foolish men!... They say that because I have no letters I cannot express well what I want to speak of.&quot; He questions the right of these literati to judge him: &quot;They go about puffed and pompous, dressed and decorated with fruits not of their own labors but those of others, land they will not allow me my own. And if they despise me, an inventor how much more could they - who are not inventors but the trumpeters and declaimers of the works of other - be blamed.&quot;

We have these passages - and in others where Leonardo is outraged because the intellectuals consider him merely a manual worker, a technician - remarkable proof of the gulf that has always existed, wider at some times than at others, between the literary intellectual and the technologist, between what C.P. Snow, that rare combination of both types, appropriately called the Two Cultures. (Fitchen, John, &lt;u&gt;Building Construction Before Mechanism&lt;/u&gt;, 15-16).

Language, technology and culture have evolved since but there remains a prevalent theme of elitism throughout most of the world. The Chasms between the classes have between narrowed somewhat by increases in opportunity, but the bridge goes both ways and the result is often further alienation. The key to the future may be in becoming the bridge itself, or in other words holding your own gate key. Autonomy might be the greatest tool of the mason.        - Eiiot Sigler

==Industrial Archeology, the origins==

In times gone by those secrets were a defensive measure, their purpose was to act as job security for Stone masons, Quarry men, Lime burners, Lead Workers, and trade who worked with their hands, for an hourly pay, often under appalling conditions, the only form of insurance policy a working man could find. 

As one of those rare creatures time served, apprentice, Stone Dressers, Guild, now on the endangered species list, I want to thank all of you for your efforts and enthusiasm,, please keep up the good work; conservation and preservation of ancient monuments, sites and artifacts related to building construction. 

==Materials of Construction==

Ancient buildings are constructed of adobe, stone clay, rammed earth, wood, and some fairly modern, man made materials. Prior to beginning the restoration edifice, it is critical that those who are undertaking the project have familiarized themselves with the site's building materials.

This '''pencil sketch lithograph''' is a political cartoon from the mid-nineteenth century.  It depicts Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson repairing the rift that had caused the American Civil War.   Published in 1865, a century and a half of aging has yellowed and faded the paper.  Although generally well preserved, a few stains, smudges, and other marks distract from the central subject.

For encyclopedic restoration, the goal here is to remove distracting effects so that the viewer's attention is drawn to the style and content of the sketch itself.  The restoration was completed in approximately 3 hours.

== The original image ==
[[Image:Lincoln and Johnson original.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Original image from United States Library of Congress file, slightly downsized.]]
Selecting a suitable image is the most important decision in any restoration.  This file was reasonably high resolution (12mb in the original Library of Congress version), well composed, and fairly well drawn.

Other political cartoons of the United States from the mid-nineteenth century often look cluttered and obscure to twenty-first century eyes.  Artists often relied on complex allegories and large dialog bubbles.  This one had the advantage of two elements well known to modern readers: Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War.  The metaphor of sewing for mending the union is well illustrated and easy to understand.  So although this is not a particularly famous cartoon, it covers an important subject and is a reasonably good example of a particular cartooning style.

On a technical level, the file doesn't have inherent problems such as .jpg artifacting or scanner streaks and is in adequate focus.  The lithograph itself has been well preserved for an item of its age.

== First edit ==
[[Image:Lincoln and Johnsona.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Planning out the rotation and cropping: Try to get an idea of what your final crop will be, but don't actually do the crop yet.]]
It is generally a bad idea to crop before restoration is complete: If you later realize you cropped out something important, or that you messed up the rotation, it will be very hard to go back. Instead, just note what areas lay outside your planned final crop, and do not focus effort on those. 

If the image is very large, a loose crop of things you're certain not to need (such as tabletop around a scan) can be useful to improve your computer's performance with handling large files, however, otherwise, it's best not to.

Remember that in the final crop, the image can be rotated slightly, and, indeed, usually will need to be rotated at least a tenth of a degree or so, since humans aren't that good at positioning things on a scanner, or, indeed, at centering things on a page of hand-cut paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Optimizing C++}}

== Conventions ==

This is the local manual of style ([[WB:LMOS]]) for the Optimizing C++ Wikibook.

'''These conventions are not part of the book, and therefore are to be omitted from the PDF version of the book. They are only directives for contributors (aka editors).'''

This wikibook, after introductory chapters, contains three sets of programming guidelines:
* C++ specific guidelines to be applied at design-time or first-implementation-time.
* Language independent guidelines to be applied in bottlenecks at optimization-time, with examples in C++.
* C++ specific guidelines to be applied in bottlenecks at optimization-time.

Every guideline has the following format:
* Mnemonic title. It has a Title 3 style.
* Rule, having the following style: &quot;When you are in this situation, do this.&quot;. It is in bold type.
* Minimal example of C++ code.
* Rationale.

The C++ programming style is loosely that used in the books written by Bjarne Stroustrup.

There are no comparisons with other programming languages, except the C language.

Every guideline specifies exactly when it is to be applied, and what the programmer has to do to apply it.

Little reference is done to compiler optimization technology.

Only the most general and useful algorithms are mentioned.

Little reference is done to specific computer architectures, compilers, and operating systems.

The following terms are used:
* ''Member function'', instead of ''method''.
* ''Member variable'', instead of ''instance variable''.
* ''Function'', instead of ''routine'' or ''procedure''. The word ''routine'' is used only for machine language code.
* ''Argument'', instead of ''parameter'', for functions declarations, definitions or calls.
* ''Parameter'', instead of ''argument'', for templates definitions or instantiations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cockatoos===
Cockatoos share many features with other parrots including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with two forward toes and two backwards toes. They differ, however in a number of characteristics, including the often spectacular movable headcrest, the presence of a gall bladder and some other anatomical details, and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots. Also Cockatoo species are, on average, larger than the average size of true parrots.

==2. Name two species of parrot that builds its nest in a termite mound and tell where each is found. ==
===Golden-shouldered Parrot===
[[Image:Psephotus chrysopterygius1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Male and female Golden-shouldered Parrots in an aviary at the Queensland Museum]]
The Golden-shouldered Parrot (''Psephotus chrysopterygius'') is a rare bird of southern Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia. It measures 26 cm long and weighs between 54-56 g.

The Golden-shouldered Parrot lives in open forest, where it feeds on small grass seeds, principally those of firegrass. An important habitat requirement is the provision of terrestrial termite mounds, which the bird uses for nesting. This has led to the parrot also being known as the Antbed Parrot. They will preferentially seek out taller mounds (up to 2 m high), and will dig a burrow into them when the mound has been softened by the rains. A long tunnel is dug down into the mound, and capped off by a nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3-6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The mound regulates the temperature in the chamber, keeping it high enough that the eggs can be left unattended while the parents feed.

The Golden-shouldered Parrot is listed as endangered (CITES I). The species has a restricted range and suffers from a variety of threats, including predation by feral cats, tourist disturbance, and a change in burning regime in the grasslands upon whose seeds it depends. The wild population is around 3000 birds, with around 1500 held in captivity in Australia.

===Grey-cheeked Parakeet===
The Grey-cheeked parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhoptera), less commonly known as fire-winged parakeet, is a species of parrot in the Psittacidae family.

The grey-cheeked parakeet is indigenous to northwestern Peru and western Ecuador, living in subtropical or tropical regions encompassing dry forests, moist lowland forests, shrubland, and arable land.[2] Grey-cheeked parakeets do not build their nests in the canopies of trees. Rather, they prefer to build their nests in protected areas such as active termite mounds or tree hollows. It is yet unknown why termites tolerate their presence.

The grey-cheeked parakeet now faces habitat loss due to the irresponsible smuggling of pet birds and hunting due to their destruction of banana plantations. The species is now endangered with most populations existing within the homes of private individuals as pets. Because of this, efforts have been undertaken to save this and several other species of Brotogeris endemic to the region. It is protected by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also called the Bonn Convention or CMS).

Even in its native home, the grey-cheeked parakeet is widely kept as a pet. With patience, these birds may be taught to mimic human sounds, albeit without the clarity of larger parrots.

===Green-rumped Parrotlet===
[[Image:Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Green-rumped Parrotlet]]
The Green-rumped Parrotlet, ''Forpus passerinus'', is a small parrot. It is a resident breeding bird in tropical South America, from Caribbean regions of Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south and east to the Guianas and Brazil, on the downstream Amazon River. It has been introduced in Jamaica, Curaçao, Barbados and Tobago, and was not recorded on Trinidad prior to 1916.

Its habitat is open forest and scrub. The female lays five to seven white eggs in a hole in a termite nest, tree cavity, or even hollow pipe, and incubates the clutch for 18 days to hatching, with about another five weeks to fledging.

==3. Where in Australia would you find each of the following and describe the natural diet of each. ==
===a. Long Billed Corella===
[[Image:Longbilledcorella.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Long Billed Corella]][[Image:Bird range long-billed corella.png|thumb|200px|right|Long Billed Corella range (in red)]]
The Long-billed Corella, ''Cacatua tenuirostris'', is a cockatoo native to Australia. Species are mostly white, with a pink face and forehead. They also have faintly pink feathers on the breast and belly, and yellow on the underside of the wings and tail. The birds have a long white beak, which is used to dig for roots and seeds.

===b. Great Palm Cockatoo===
[[Image:Palm Cockatoo.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Great Palm Cackatoo]]
[[Image:Bird range palm cockatoo.png|thumb|200px|right|Range of the Great Palm Cackatoo (in red)]]
The Palm Cockatoo (''Probosciger aterrimus'') is distributed in rainforests and woodlands of New Guinea and northern Queensland, Australia. It measures around 55-60 cm in length and weighs between 500-1,000 g. It is a distinctive bird with a large crest and has one of the largest bills of any parrots (only the Hyacinth Macaw's is larger). The bill is unusual as the lower and upper mandibles do not meet for much of its length, allowing the tongue to hold a nut against the top mandible while the lower mandible works to open it.
{{clear}}

===c. Gang Gang Cockatoo ===
[[Image:Gang-gang female MJC01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Gang-gang Cockatoo]]
[[Image:Bird range gang-gang cockatoo.png|thumb|200px|right|Range of the Gang-gang Cockatoo (in red)]]
The Gang-gang Cockatoo, Callocephalon fimbriatum, is found in the cooler and wetter forests and woodlands of Australia, particularly alpine bushland. Mostly mild grey in colour with some lighter scalloping (more pronounced and buffish in females) the male has a red head and crest, while the female has a small fluffy grey crest. It ranges throughout south-eastern Australia and Tasmania. The Gang-gang Cockatoo is the faunal emblem of the Australian Capital Territory. It is easily identified by its distinctive call, which is described as resembling a creaky gate, or the sound of a cork being pulled from a bottle.

Gang-gang cockatoos eat fruits, and seem to have a particular weakness for Hawthorn berries (though Hawthorns are an introduced species, and not part of the cockatoo's natural diet).

==4. Which three species of cockatoo are known as the most rare? ==
&lt;gallery perrow=3 widths=200px&gt;
Image:Yellow-crested Cockatoo.jpg|Yellow-crested Cockatoo&lt;br&gt;''Cacatua sulphurea''
Image:Cacatua-haematuropygia.jpg|Red-vented Cockatoo&lt;br&gt;''Cacatua haematuropygia''
Image:Moluccan cockatoo 31l07.JPG|Moluccan Cockatoo&lt;br&gt;''Cacatua moluccensis''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
;Yellow-crested Cockatoo: The Yellow-crested Cockatoo, ''Cacatua sulphurea,'' is critically endangered. Numbers have declined dramatically due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. The current population is estimated at less than 10,000. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.
;Red-vented Cockatoo: This bird, ''Cacatua haematuropygia'', is critically endangered. Populations have decreased dramatically due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. The high price fetched per bird (c.US$160 in Manila in 1997) means that chicks are taken from virtually every accessible nest. Loss of habitat may also have contributed to its decline. The current population is estimated at less than 4,000 birds.
;Moluccan Cockatoo: The Moluccan Cockatoo, ''Cacatua moluccensis,'' is an endangered species, and has been listed on appendix I of CITES since 1989, which makes trade in wild-caught birds illegal. Trade in captive bred birds is legal only with appropriate CITES certification. Numbers have declined due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss. During the height of the trapping of this species over 6,000 birds were being removed from the wild per year. It has a stronghold in Manusela National Park on Seram, although even today some illegal trapping continues.

==5. Which is the largest species in the Rosella family? Where does it come from and what is its usual food? ==
[[Image:Green Rosella eating plucked flowers.jpg|thumb|200px|Green Rosella]]
The Green Rosella or Tasmanian Rosella (Platycercus caledonicus) is endemic to Tasmania. The largest of the Rosellas it is predominantly green and yellow in plumage with blue cheeks. 

Its diet consists mostly of seeds, fruits, and berries, and it will sometimes feed on the ground.
{{clear}}

==6. Every State of Australia has a Rosella that is common to that State. Some are found in more than one State but there is one that is commonly associated with your State. Which is it? ==

==7. When the Eclectus parrot was first found it was thought that the Male and Female were of different species. Why was this? Where are they found and what is their usual diet? ==
[[Image:Eclectus Parrot02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Male Eclectus Parrot]]
[[Image:Eclectus roratus -female side2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Female Ecletus Parrot]]
The Eclectus Parrot, Eclectus roratus, is a parrot native to the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, northeastern Australia and the Maluku Islands (Moluccas). It is unusual in the parrot family the males and females are so different from one another. The males of the species are bright green, having bright candy-corn-colored upper mandibles and black lower mandibles, and blue or red tail and wing feathers; while the females have red heads and blue to purple breasts, with black beaks. Joseph Forshaw, in his book Parrots of the World, noted that the first European ornithologists to see Eclectus Parrots thought they were of two distinct species.

The diet of the eclectus in the wild consists of mainly fruits, unripe nuts, flower and leaf buds, and some seeds. Two favorite fruits are the pomegranate and the papaya (pawpaw) with seeds. In captivity, they will eat most fruits including mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, any melons, stone fruits (peaches etc.), grapes, citrus fruits, pears and apples.

==8. What Australian cockatoo is regarded as the most beautiful in the world? Describe what it looks like and where it is found. ==
[[Image:Leadbeater cockatoo 31l07.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Major Mitchell's Cockatoo]]
[[Image:Bird range major mitchells cockatoo.png|thumb|200px|right|Range of Major Mitchell's Cockatoo]]
With its soft-textured white and salmon-pink plumage and large, bright red and yellow crest, Major Mitchell's Cockatoo is generally recognised as the most beautiful of all cockatoos. It is named in honour of Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, who wrote &quot;Few birds more enliven the monotonous hues of the Australian forest than this beautiful species whose pink-coloured wings and flowing crest might have embellished the air of a more voluptuous region&quot;.

It is restricted to arid and semi-arid inland areas of Australia (see map).

==9. Name four different Lorikeets and tell why they all have brush tongues.==
Lories and lorikeets are small to medium-sized arboreal parrots which comprise the subfamily Loriinae. They are widely distributed throughout the Australasian region, including south-eastern Asia, Polynesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, and the majority have very brightly colored plumage.

Image:BlueStreakedLory.jpg|Blue-streaked Lory
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Image:LoryTongueLyd4.png|thumb|left|Tongue of a Lory]]
Lories and lorikeets have specialized brush-tipped tongues for feeding on nectar and soft fruits. They can feed from the flowers of about 5,000 species of plants and use their specialised tongues to take the nectar. The tip of their tongues have tufts of papillae (extremely fine hairs), which collect nectar and pollen.
{{clear}}

==10. Be able to describe the nest of any one of the above parrots or cockatoos and also tell the color of the egg. ==
==11. Make a list of all the parrots and cockatoos that are common to your area.==
If there are no parrots and cockatoos in your area, make a list for an area where they do live.

==Information about me==

I am a mathematician as my name suggests and I am interested in almost all fields of mathematics. Most of all, I am interested in functional analysis, topology, measure theory, probability, differential geometry and real analysis. I am happy to help anyone who has a question related to mathematics.

==Contributions==

I have created three sections in Wikibooks in the topology wikibook. The sections are on the comb space, linear continua and locally connected spaces. I am mainly a Wikipedia user and have created quite a few articles in Wikipedia (see my user page in Wikipedia for more details)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ginny out of character ==

Twice, now, an anonymous editor has changed the analysis on this page to indicate that (1) Harry and Ron teasing Neville is appropriate as they need to make themselves feel better, and that (2) Ginny is deliberately cruel in her telling Hermione loudly that Harry and Ron don't have dates. Neither of these is accurate. For what it is worth, teasing Neville is never justified, no matter how much Neville seems to invite it, any more than teasing anyone else is justified. And Ginny's words are intended for Hermione alone, and we can assume that Hermione alone heard them, apart from Harry and perhaps Ron, as nobody else then in the common room was seen to react to them. Ginny's actions here are more along the lines of the way her mother would react, rather than a form of cruelty. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:02, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

:A third edit by apparently the same editor has appeared and disappeared, with the comment ''&quot;I'm sorry, i'm sorry, i just feel sorry for harry and ron because cho and fleur turned them down. Poor guys...i do feel bad for them, the patil twins aren't nearly as cool.&quot;'' I'd argue that point... Fleur at this point is far too full of herself, and Padma is a much better choice for Ron if he can forget Hermione. But of course he can't, even though he doesn't yet realize it himself. I wouldn't say the same about Lavender, but there you go. Cho... well, that's a whole other story in itself. Anyway... I note that all three edits have come in from wildly varying IP addresses, and if this anonymous editor is reading, I would invite him or her to sign up for a free ID so that we can at least know we're always talking to the same person.

== &quot;Teasing&quot; and Ginny's popularity ==

A recent editor has asked when Harry and Ron were teasing Neville, and why comments about Ginny's popularity were reverted.

The editor in question, who I hope will get an account, is correct about the teasing; at that point in the story, Neville is not even present. While there is some teasing going on, it is in absentia; Ron pokes fun at Neville for having asked Hermione, in a way which makes it a dig at Hermione as well, and then is astounded when Ginny, with some diffidence, admits that she is going to the Ball with Neville.

The reason for the reversion of the comment about Ginny's popularity is not that it is incorrect, but that it was worded unprofessionally:
:Thus, I think we can safely say that GOF is the first book we see &quot;the new, cool&quot; Ginny in, and not the little girl we saw in the first three books. (The fans like this Ginny better, too.)
and the editor who reverted the edit thought that it would be significantly more difficult to revise the text to bring it up to standard than its value merited. Myself, I'm not sure I agree, but the latest variant does come closer to the professional level we are trying to reach.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The weedy species of '''wild onions''' in the Mid-Atlantic are generally one of two species: the invasive ''Allium arvense'' or the native ''Allium canadensis''. For horticultural purposes, they are both treated in the same way as weeds, though ''A. arvense'' tends to form larger clumps and is more likely to become a weed of lawns.

Both plants need to be grubbed using a weeding tool that can get the roots out, since the roots tend to be deep and the stems easily break away allowing the plant to regrow. Both species will grow back from either the main bulb or the bulblets, so the area should be inspected for weed regrowth a week or two after the initial grubbing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chinese Bittersweet''' (''Celastrus orbiculatus'') is an invasive vine spread by birds which eat the fruits in fall and winter. The vine climbs by twining, and can grow quite rapidly over garden plants or other structures. 

The vines have a shallow root system and are thus easily pulled. Larger vines on trees and shrubs need to be cut off the tree rather than pulled off to avoid breaking branches.

==Introduction to Information Literacy in the K12 Classroom==

Hello Teresa.  Looks like you are making good progress on the above book, I think it wil be an interesting one.  Just a quick note so say you don't need to create placeholder pages (I have tagged a few pages with query this morning which had no actual content).  It's better not to create these pages as then they will show up as red links which poeple won't follow expecting to find content.   If you have any questions just let me know.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 06:30, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

== Images Without Licenses ==
Hi. I noticed you uploaded a number of images but it appears none of them have a license. If you do not add one by July 13, they will all be deleted. If you want to release them into the public domain, just add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page. Thanks.[[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 21:34, 7 July 2008 (UTC)
:The ones that were made by your students you could probably just add the PD tag, although legally you would have to get their permission. As for the other ones, I'm not really sure. I would suggest reading [[Wikibooks:Media]] and making the decision you feel is best. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 19:49, 8 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

&lt;ol type=1 start=1&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For the following list of sequences determine whether the following sequences converge or diverge directly from the definition of convergence:
&lt;ol type=a&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; the sequence &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(\frac{n-1}{n})_{n=2}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;li&gt; the sequence &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\frac{\sqrt{2n-1} + 2}{\sqrt{n+3}})_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;li&gt; the sequence &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \left(\frac{2n-7}{n^2+1}\right)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;li&gt; The recursive sequence defined by the following:
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = 2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x_n = \sqrt{x_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Let 
:&lt;math&gt;x_n=\begin{cases}\frac{n-1}{n} &amp;\text{if } n \text{ is odd;}\\ \frac{1}{n}&amp;\text{if } n \text{ is even.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.
Find lim&amp;thinsp;sup&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; For the following sequences determine for which real values ''x'' does the given sequence converge, and what the sequence converges to:
&lt;ol type=a&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\frac{x}{n})_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (x^n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\frac{1}{n^x})&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary real number ''x'';
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Given any real number ''c'', find a recursively defined sequence that converges to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{c}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Given a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), and a natural number ''k'', define a sequence ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n+k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Show that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent if and only if (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent.  Show further that when they converge they converge to the same limit. 
&lt;li&gt; Suppose that the sequences (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converge to a real number ''a''.  Show that the sequence (z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;z_n=\begin{cases}x_{2n-1} &amp;\text{if } n \text{ is odd;}\\y_{2n-3}&amp;\text{if } n \text{ is even.}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Show that ''z''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a''.
&lt;li&gt; Let (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of real numbers and let (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sub-sequence.  Suppose (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent, show that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) may not necessarily be convergent.
&lt;li&gt;Suppose that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a convergent sequence that does not converge to 0.  Further assume that for all ''n'' in '''N''', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0.  Show that there exists δ&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 so that |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;δ and |lim&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;δ.
&lt;li&gt;Cesaro Mean convergence: We say a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges to ''x'' '''by Cesaro means''' if the sequence of averages ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)/''n'' converges to ''x''.  Suppose (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges to a real number ''x'', show that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) converges by Cesaro means to ''x''.  Give an example to show that a divergent sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) may converge by Cesaro means. 
&lt;li&gt;Find the the sequence of Cesaro means for (1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1...) and determine if the converge.  If they converge, find the limit.
&lt;li&gt;Consider the recursively defined sequence given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Show that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges and find its limit. 
&lt;li&gt;In our discussion of telescoping series we showed that a telescoping series converged to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and for this to hold it was not necessary to have that lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Indeed, it is correct that this is not necessary. On the other hand we later proved that for a convergent series the limit of the terms must be 0.  How can both by correct?  Explain why, in our set up, we may have a convergent telescoping series such that lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, but it is still true that for every convergent series the limit of the terms is 0.
&lt;li&gt; Suppose that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all natural numbers ''n''.  Show that if both &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converge, then &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges.

Three new TAPs and a new patch have been written to help split files &amp; remove adverts.


== CutFile.tap ==
 

snips the recording at each bookmark
the resulting file dates are changed to match the time that part started recording
the first file retains the original file name
subsequent file pieces are called CUT_&lt;channelName&gt;_&lt;date&amp;Time&gt;.&lt;nn&gt;.rec
e.g. 
CUT_E4_200806031622.00.REC
CUT_E4_200806031622.01.REC

== Cutting MyStuff merged files ==


MyStuff maintains the file information in .mei files so using CutFile breaks this at present. Because the files are renamed they will be seen by the new name, but as MyStuff does not read the .rec headers MyStuf will not be able to display any program descriptions etc.

== Renaming cut files &amp; updating header information ==


A test version of mei2archive is available from [http://uk.geocities.com/igjack@btinternet.com/mei2archive.html here] which when installed on your system enables CutFile to get mei2archive to rename &amp; update the .rec headers of the newly cut files.

Older versions of mei2archive can be used to manually fix the headers, although if the file is from a merge of a small number of programs the extended header information will contain the other program information already if mei2archive is used in auto mode normally.

== JoinFile.tap ==


will reverse the actions of CutFile and leave the original file (assuming all the parts are still present and not modified). select the section of the original file that still has the original name to start the process.


== CutAds.tap ==


Assumes that the first bookmark is the start of the programme, and then subsequent pairs of bookmarks mark start and end of ads. The ads are cut out to a file suffixed with &quot;-ADS&quot; (and this file will be deleted if it already exists). Both files retain bookmarks at the start of each section (except the start of the ads). A final bookmark may be placed at the end of the program but this is optional in the case where the program goes right to the end of the recording.

There is no undo for CutAds but you could see exactly where it was going to cut by running CutFile first, then JoinFile to undo it.

Where the ads are removed the video may break up for a short time, maybe half a second. this should be concidered when positioning bookmarks but will not happen at every cut point.

== Bookmark patches ==


There are 4 development bookmark patches to assist placing bookmarks, they all cause the bookmarks to be added with more precision.

[http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=156365#156365 Bm-v1] makes the bookmark appear more accurately to where the green button is pressed

[http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=156787#156787 Bm-v2] adds yellow button snapping back to bookmark if it was near, rather than on to next bookmark

[http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=156810#156810 Bm-v3] adds play bar does not timeout

[http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=157513#157513 Bm-v4] play bar does not time out, green set button causes play position to snap back to bookmark position when near. This enables bookmark position to be crept backwards by repeatedly pressing green, or slipped forward by turning off the bookmark and resetting it a moment later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Wooden roller coaster txgi.jpg|thumb|220px|The cars of a roller coaster reach their maximum kinetic energy when at the bottom of their path. When they start rising, the kinetic energy begins to be converted to gravitational potential energy, but the total amount of energy in the system remains constant; assuming negligible friction and other energy conversion factors.]]

The '''kinetic energy''' of an object is the extra energy which it possesses due to its motion. It is defined as ''the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its current velocity''. Having gained this energy during its acceleration, the body maintains this kinetic energy unless its speed changes. Negative work of the same magnitude would be required to return the body to a state of rest from that velocity.

== Etymology ==
The  adjective &quot;kinetic&quot; to the noun energy has its roots in the Greek word for &quot;motion&quot; (kinesis). The terms ''kinetic energy'' and ''work'' and their present scientific meanings date back to the mid 19th century. Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis who in 1829 published the paper titled ''Du Calcul de l'Effet des Machines'' outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy.

William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the  term ''kinetic energy'' c. 1849.

==Introduction==

There are various forms of energy : chemical energy, heat, electromagnetic radiation, potential energy (gravitational, electric, elastic, etc.), nuclear energy, rest energy.  These can be categorized in two main classes: potential energy and kinetic energy. 

Kinetic energy can be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed from other forms of energy and to the other forms.  For example, a cyclist will use chemical energy that was provided by food to accelerate a bicycle to a chosen speed.  This speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air-resistance and friction.  The energy has been converted into the energy of motion, known as '''kinetic energy''' but the process is not completely efficient and heat is also produced within the cyclist.

The kinetic energy in the moving bicycle and the cyclist can be converted to other forms.  For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top.  The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill.  (Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it will never regain all of its speed without further pedaling. Note that the energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction.)  Alternatively the cyclist could connect a dynamo to one of the wheels and also generate some electrical energy on the descent.  The bicycle would be traveling more slowly at the bottom of the hill because some of the energy has been diverted into making electrical power.  Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as heat energy.

Like any physical quantity which is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object does not depend only on the inner nature of that object. It also depends on the relationship between that object and the observer (in physics an observer is formally defined by a particular class of coordinate system called an ''inertial reference frame''). Physical quantities like this are said to be not ''invariant''. The kinetic energy is co-located with the object and contributes to its gravitational field.

===Calculations===

There are several different equations that may be used to calculate the kinetic energy of an object. In many cases they give almost the same answer to well within measurable accuracy. Where they differ, the choice of which to use is determined by the velocity of the body or its size. Thus, if the object is moving at a velocity much smaller than the speed of light, the Newtonian (classical) mechanics will be sufficiently accurate; but if the speed is comparable to the speed of light, relativity starts to make significant differences to the result and should be used. If the size of the object is sub-atomic, the quantum mechanical equation is most appropriate.

==Newtonian kinetic energy==
===Kinetic energy of rigid bodies===

In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of a &quot;point object&quot; (a body so small that its size can be ignored), or a non rotating rigid body, is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;E_k = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt; where m is the mass and v is the speed of the body.

For example - one would calculate the kinetic energy of an 80 kg mass traveling at 18 meters per second (40 mph) as 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \cdot 80 \cdot 18^2 = 12,960 \ \mathrm{joules}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the kinetic energy increases with the square of the speed.  This means, for example, that an object traveling twice as fast will have four times as much kinetic energy. As a result of this, a car traveling twice as fast requires four times as much distance to stop (assuming a constant braking force. See mechanical work).

Thus, the kinetic energy can be calculated using the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the kinetic energy in joules
:''m'' is the mass in kilograms, and
:''v'' is the speed in meters per second.

For the ''translational kinetic energy'' of a body with constant mass ''m'', whose center of mass is moving in a straight line with speed ''v'', as seen above is equal to

:&lt;math&gt; E_t = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''m'' is mass of the body
:''v'' is speed of the center of mass of the body.

Thus kinetic energy is a relative measure and no object can be said to have a unique kinetic energy. A rocket engine could be seen to transfer its energy to the rocket ship or to the exhaust stream depending upon the chosen frame of reference. But the total energy of the system, i.e. kinetic energy, fuel chemical energy, heat energy etc., will be conserved regardless of the choice of measurement frame.

The kinetic energy of an object is related to its momentum by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation and definition===
The work done accelerating a particle during the infinitesimal time interval ''dt'' is given by the dot product of ''force'' and ''displacement'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v} d t = \frac{d \mathbf{p}}{d t} \cdot \mathbf{v} d t = \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the product rule we see that: 
:&lt;math&gt;  d(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = (d \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} \cdot (d \mathbf{v}) =  2(\mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; 

Therefore (assuming constant mass), the following can be seen:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \mathbf{v}) = \frac{m}{2} d (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}) = \frac{m}{2} d v^2  = d \left(\frac{m v^2}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Since this is a total differential (that is, it only depends on the final state, not how the particle got there), we can integrate it and call the result kinetic energy:
:&lt;math&gt; E_k = \int \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p}= \frac{m v^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

This equation states that the kinetic energy (''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') is equal to the integral of the dot product of the velocity ('''v''') of a body and the infinitesimal change of the body's momentum ('''p'''). It is assumed that the body starts with no kinetic energy when it is at rest (motionless).

===Kinetic energy of systems===

For a single point, or a rigid body that is not rotating, the kinetic energy goes to zero when the body stops.

However, for systems containing multiple independently moving bodies, which may exert forces between themselves, and may (or may not) be rotating; this is no longer true.

This energy is called 'internal energy'

The kinetic energy of the system at any instant in time is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of the masses- including the kinetic energy due to the rotations.

An example would be the solar system. In the center of mass frame of the solar system, the Sun is (almost) stationary, but the planets and planetoids are in motion about it. Thus even in a stationary center of mass frame, there is still kinetic energy present.

However, recalculating the energy from different frames would be tedious, but there is a trick. The kinetic energy of the system from a different inertial frame can be calculated simply from the sum of the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame and adding on the energy that the total mass of bodies in the center of mass frame would have if it were moving at the relative speed between the two frames.

This may be simply shown: let V be the relative speed of the frame ''k'' from the center of mass frame ''i'' :

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \int \frac{v_k^2 dm}{2} = \int \frac{(v_i + V)^2 dm}{2} = \int \frac{(v_i^2 + 2 v_i V + V^2) dm}{2} = \int \frac{v_i^2 dm}{2} + V \int v_i dm + \frac{V^2}{2} \int dm &lt;/math&gt;

However, let &lt;math&gt; \int \frac{v_i^2 dm}{2} = E_i &lt;/math&gt; the kinetic energy in the center of  mass frame, &lt;math&gt; \int v_i dm &lt;/math&gt; would be simply the total momentum which is by definition zero in the center of mass frame, and let the total mass: &lt;math&gt; \int dm = M &lt;/math&gt;. Substituting, we get:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Class/intro_physics_1/intro_physics_1/node64.html Physics notes - Kinetic energy in the CM frame]. Duke.edu. Accessed 2007-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E_k = E_i + \frac{M V^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt; 

The kinetic energy of a system thus depends on the inertial frame of reference and it is lowest with respect to the center of mass reference frame, i.e., in a frame of reference in which the center of mass is stationary. In any other frame of reference there is an additional kinetic energy corresponding to the total mass moving at the speed of the center of mass.

===Rotating bodies===

If a rigid body is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has ''rotational kinetic energy'' (&lt;math&gt;E_r&lt;/math&gt;) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and thus it is equal to: 

:&lt;math&gt; E_r = \int \frac{v^2 dm}{2} = \int \frac{(r \omega)^2 dm}{2} = \frac{\omega^2}{2} \int{r^2}dm = \frac{\omega^2}{2} I = \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} I \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:ω is the body's angular velocity.
:r is the distance of any mass dm from that line
:''I'' is the body's moment of inertia&lt;math&gt; = \int{r^2}dm&lt;/math&gt;

(In this equation the moment of inertia must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by ω must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).

===Rotation in systems===

It sometimes is convenient to split the total kinetic energy of a body into the sum of the body's center-of-mass translational kinetic energy and the energy of rotation around the center of mass rotational energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E_k = E_t + E_r \, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total kinetic energy
:''E&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the translational kinetic energy
:''E&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''rotational energy'' or ''angular kinetic energy'' in the rest frame

Thus the kinetic energy of a tennis ball in flight is the kinetic energy due to its rotation, plus the kinetic energy due to its translation.

==Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies==

In special relativity, we must change the expression for linear momentum. Integrating by parts, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{p}= \int \mathbf{v} \cdot d (m \gamma \mathbf{v}) = m \gamma \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} - \int m \gamma \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{v} = m \gamma v^2 - \frac{m}{2} \int \gamma d (v^2)&lt;/math&gt;
Remembering that &lt;math&gt;\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}\!&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = m \gamma v^2 - \frac{- m c^2}{2} \int \gamma d (1 - v^2/c^2) = m \gamma v^2 + m c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2)^{1/2} + C&lt;/math&gt;
And thus:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = m \gamma (v^2 + c^2 (1 - v^2/c^2)) + C = m \gamma (v^2 + c^2 - v^2) + C = m \gamma c^2 + C\!&lt;/math&gt;
The constant of integration is found by observing that &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1\!&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v }= 0&lt;/math&gt;, so we get the usual formula:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = m \gamma c^2 - m c^2 = \frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - m c^2&lt;/math&gt;

If a body's speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, it is necessary to use '''relativistic mechanics''' (the theory of relativity as expounded by Albert Einstein) to calculate its kinetic energy.

For a relativistic object the momentum p is equal to: 

:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{m v}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''m'' is the rest mass, ''v'' is the object's speed, and ''c'' is the speed of light in vacuum.

Thus the work expended accelerating an object from rest to a relativistic speed is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} - m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The equation shows that the energy of an object approaches infinity as the velocity ''v'' approaches the speed of light ''c'', thus it is impossible to accelerate an object across this boundary.

The mathematical by-product of this calculation is the mass-energy equivalence formula—the body at rest must have energy content equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mbox{rest} = m c^2 \!&lt;/math&gt;

At a low speed (v&lt;&lt;c), the relativistic kinetic energy may be approximated well by the classical kinetic energy. This is done by binomial approximation. Indeed, taking Taylor expansion for square root and keeping first two terms we get: 

:&lt;math&gt;E_k \approx m c^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} v^2/c^2\right) - m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

So, the total energy E can be partitioned into the energy of the rest mass plus the traditional Newtonian kinetic energy at low speeds.

When objects move at a speed much slower than light (e.g. in everyday phenomena on Earth), the first two terms of the series predominate. The next term in the approximation is small for low speeds, and can be found by extending the expansion into a Taylor series by one more term:

:&lt;math&gt; E \approx m c^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} v^2/c^2  + \frac{3}{8} v^4/c^4\right) = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{3}{8} m v^4/c^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

For example, for a speed of 10 km/s the correction to the Newtonian kinetic energy is 0.07 J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 50 MJ/kg) and for a speed of 100 km/s it is 710 J/kg (on a Newtonian kinetic energy of 5 GJ/kg), etc.

For higher speeds, the formula for the relativistic kinetic energy &lt;ref&gt;In Einstein's original [http://www.uni-kiel.de/ub/digiport/ab1800/G4378.html Über die spezielle und die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie] (Zu Seite 41) and in most translations (e.g. [http://bartleby.com/173/15.html Relativity - The Special and General Theory]) kinetic energy is defined as &lt;math&gt;m c^2 / \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; is derived by simply subtracting the rest mass energy from the total energy:

:&lt;math&gt; E_k = m \gamma c^2 - m c^2 = m c^2\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} - 1\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The relation between kinetic energy and momentum is more complicated in this case, and is given by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} - m c^2&lt;/math&gt;.

This can also be expanded as a Taylor series, the first term of which is the simple expression from Newtonian mechanics.

What this suggests is that the formulas for energy and momentum are not special and axiomatic, but rather concepts which emerge from the equation of mass with energy and the principles of relativity.

==Quantum mechanical kinetic energy of rigid bodies==
In the realm of quantum mechanics, the expectation value of the electron kinetic energy, &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{T}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, for a system of electrons described by the wave function &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a sum of 1-electron operator expectation values:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{T}\rangle = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m_e}\bigg\langle\psi \bigg\vert \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla^2_i \bigg\vert \psi \bigg\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the electron and &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_i&lt;/math&gt; is the Laplacian operator acting upon the coordinates of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; electron and the summation runs over all electrons. Notice that this is the quantized version of the non-relativistic expression for kinetic energy in terms of momentum:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{p^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

The [density functional formalism of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the electron density ''only'', i.e., it formally does not require knowledge of the wavefunction.  Given an electron density &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;, the exact N-electron kinetic energy functional is unknown; however, for the specific case of a 1-electron system, the kinetic energy can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; T[\rho]  =  \frac{1}{8} \int \frac{ \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r}) }{ \rho(\mathbf{r}) } d^3r &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T[\rho]&lt;/math&gt; is known as the Von Weizsacker kinetic energy functional.

==Some examples== 
Spacecraft use chemical energy to take off and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach orbital velocity.  This kinetic energy gained during launch will remain constant while in orbit because there is almost no friction. However it becomes apparent at re-entry when the kinetic energy is converted to heat.

Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player gives kinetic energy to the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick. If the cue ball collides with another ball, it will slow down dramatically and the ball it collided with will accelerate to a speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, where kinetic energy is preserved.

Flywheels are being developed as a method of energy storage (see article flywheel energy storage).  This illustrates that kinetic energy can also be rotational.  Note the formula in the articles on flywheels for calculating rotational kinetic energy is different, though analogous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algebra''' is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of structure, relation and quantity. The name is derived from the treatise written by the Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer, Muhammad bin Mūsā al-Khwārizmī titled Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala meaning &quot;The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing&quot;, which provided symbolic operations for the systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. Al-Khwarizimi's book made its way to Europe and was translated into Latin as Liber algebrae et almucabala.

Together with geometry, analysis, combinatorics, and number theory, algebra is one of the main branches of mathematics. Elementary algebra is often part of the curriculum in secondary education and provides an introduction to the basic ideas of algebra, including effects of adding and multiplying numbers, the concept of variables, definition of polynomials, along with factorization and determining their roots.

Algebra is much broader than elementary algebra and can be generalized. In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra covers working with symbols, variables, and set elements. Addition and multiplication are viewed as general operations, and their precise definitions lead to structures such as groups, rings and fields.

'''Mathematics''' is the body of knowledge centered on such concepts as quantity, structure, space, and change, and also the academic discipline that studies them. Benjamin Peirce called it &quot;the science that draws necessary conclusions&quot;. Other practitioners of mathematics maintain that mathematics is the science of pattern, and that mathematicians seek out patterns whether found in numbers, space, science, computers, imaginary abstractions, or elsewhere. Mathematicians explore such concepts, aiming to formulate new conjectures and establish their truth by rigorous deductive reasoning|deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
 
Through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, mathematics evolved from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Knowledge and use of basic mathematics have always been an inherent and integral part of individual and group life. Refinements of the basic ideas are visible in mathematical texts originating in the ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indian, Chinese, Greek and Islamic worlds. Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's ''Elements''. The development continued in fitful bursts until the Renaissance period of the 16th century, when mathematical innovations interacted with new scientific discoveries, leading to an acceleration in research that continues to the present day.

Today, mathematics is used throughout the world in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences such as economics. Applied mathematics, the application of mathematics to such fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

This book aims to be an accessible introduction to Higher Level Leaving Certificate Mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Maple has two packages for linear algebra: 

''LinearAlgebra'' is more recent, it is based on the ''rtable'' data structure, hence it is more efficient for numerical calculations and uses direct evaluation.

''linalg'' has an older design, it is based on the ''table'' data structure, hence uses &quot;last name evaluation&quot;, but it could still be useful for abstract linear algebra.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mussolini and Fascism==
Benito Mussolini got his qualifications as an elementary schoolmaster in 1901 and 1902, emigrated to Switzerland, as a way to avoid military service (he ended convicted of desertion in absentia). During that time he became interested in politics and social philosophies, especially socialism. He was later deported as a result of his political involvement with the Italian workers' union in Lausanne, Switzerland, but returned illegally to Switzerland. In 1904 the Switzerland authorities arrested him for falsifying his papers, he then returned to Italy, taking advantage of an amnesty for his desertion, where he subsequently volunteered for military service in the Italian Army for two years. As a soldier fought in the First World War and was angered by the Versailles Treaty's failure to deliver more land to the nation of Italy.

After 1906 he returned to teaching, and continued to participate in the socialist movement. On March 23, 1919, Mussolini reformed the Milan ''fascio'' as the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squad), consisting of 200 members. It was the start of Fascism. 
[[Image:Benito Mussolini in Yugoslavia crop.JPG|thumb|100px|Benito Mussolini]]
Mussolini and the fascists managed to be simultaneously revolutionary and traditionalist.  Because this was vastly different from anything else in the political climate of the time, it is sometimes described as &quot;The Third Way&quot;. The ''Fascisti'', led by one of Mussolini's close confidants, Dino Grandi, formed armed squads of war veterans called Blackshirts (or ''squadristi'') with the goal of restoring order to the streets of Italy with a strong hand. The Blackshirts clashed with communists, socialists, and anarchists at parades and demonstrations, while factions within the Blackshirts were also involved in clashes against each other. The government rarely interfered with the Blackshirts' actions, due in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The ''Fascisti'' grew so rapidly that within two years, it transformed itself into the National Fascist Party at a congress in Rome. Also in 1921, Mussolini was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time.

==March on Rome==
The March on Rome was a coup d'état by which Mussolini's National Fascist Party came to power in Italy and ousted Prime Minister Luigi Facta. The &quot;march&quot; took place in 1922 between October 27 and October 29. On October 28, [[w:Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] refused his support to Facta and handed over power to Mussolini. Mussolini was supported by the military, the business class, and the liberal right-wing.

==In Power==
===Resistance===
Mussolini's influence in propaganda was such that he had surprisingly little opposition to suppress. Nonetheless, he was &quot;slightly wounded in the nose&quot; when he was shot on April 7, 1926 by Violet Gibson, an Irish woman and sister of Baron Ashbourne. In January 1927, 15-year-old Anteo Zamboni attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna. Zamboni was lynched on the spot. Mussolini also survived a failed assassination attempt in Rome by anarchist Gino Lucetti, and a planned attempt by American anarchist Michael Schirru, which ended with Schirru's capture and execution.

The various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the MVSN or &quot;Blackshirts,&quot; who terrorized incipient resistances in the cities and provinces. He would later form the OVRA, an institutionalized secret police that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing any rival from emerging.

===Economy===
Mussolini launched several public construction programs and government initiatives throughout Italy to combat economic setbacks or unemployment levels. His earliest, and one of the best known, was Italy's equivalent of the Green Revolution, known as the &quot;Battle for Grain&quot;, where 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns on land reclaimed by draining the Pontine Marshes. This plan diverted valuable resources to grain production, away from other less economically viable crops. The huge tariffs associated with the project promoted widespread inefficiencies, and the government subsidies given to farmers pushed the country further into debt. Mussolini also initiated the &quot;Battle for Land&quot;, a policy based on land reclamation outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the unemployed and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Grain (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 peasants resettled on the redistributed land, and peasant poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.
[[Image:March on rome 1.png|thumb|250px|March on Rome]]
Mussolini came up with other ideas, such as ''Gold for the Fatherland'', where he encouraged Italians to hand their gold over to the government in exchange for a steel wristband. The gold would be melted down and handed out to National banks.

===Propaganda===
As dictator of Italy, Mussolini's foremost priority was to subjugate the minds of the Italian people and the use of propaganda to do so; whether at home or abroad, and here his training as a journalist was invaluable. Press, radio, education, films—all were carefully supervised to create the illusion that fascism was the doctrine of the twentieth century, replacing liberalism and democracy.

===Foreign policy===
In foreign policy, Mussolini soon shifted from pacifistic anti-imperialism to an extreme form of aggressive nationalism. He dreamt of making Italy a nation that was &quot;great, respected and feared&quot; throughout Europe, and indeed the world. An early example was his bombardment of Corfu in 1923. Soon after he succeeded in setting up a puppet regime in Albania and in ruthlessly consolidating Italian power in Libya, which had been loosely a colony since 1912. It was his dream to re-create an Italian ''mare nostrum'' (&quot;our sea&quot; in Latin) in the Mediterranean by re-establishing the greatness of the Roman Empire also at sea. For a short time between summer/fall 1941 to November 1942, the Mediterranean sea became effectively an Italian ''mare nostrum'', threatening the historic dominance of the British Royal Navy and secure access to their colonies via the Suez Canal. Naval bases on the Italian-occupied Aegean Islands also supported his strategic interests on the eastern Mediterranean. His early foreign-policy initiatives aimed to establish him as a 'statesman', for he participated in the Locarno Treaties of 1925, and the attempted Four Power Pact of 1933 was Mussolini's brainchild. Following the Stresa Front against Germany in 1935, however, Mussolini's policy took a dramatic turn, revealing itself as aggressive in nature. Following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Italy conquered and annexed Ethiopia.

==Relations with Germany==
===A Rough Start===
The relationship between Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was a contentious one early on. While Hitler cited Mussolini as an influence, Mussolini had gone as far as deriding Hitler as &quot;a barbarian, a criminal and a pederast&quot; after the Nazis had assassinated his friend and ally, Engelbert Dollfuss the Austrofascist dictator of Austria in 1933. The two countries nearly went to war over Austria in 1934. 

===Good Friends===
Despite the two's differences in ideology, as Mussolini did not believe in Hitler's Aryan race, they both had the same ambitions. Though Italy had served as a counterbalance to Nazi power in the early 1930's Mussolini desired for more, to restore the Roman Empire. After his invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Britain and France condemned Italy's actions.  Regardless of some differences in ideology, Hitler's Nazi Germany had clearly established itself as a formidable power that was rising quickly in prominence by the mid 1930s and in November 1936, Mussolini had coined the term Axis Powers to refer to the Rome-Berlin relationship between the states. Ideologically Italian fascism did not discriminate against the Italian Jewish community: Mussolini recognized that a small contingent had lived there &quot;since the days of the Kings of Rome&quot; and should &quot;remain undisturbed&quot;. There were even some Jews in the National Fascist Party.

In 1939, the ''Pact of Steel'' was signed between Germany and Italy. The Pact consisted of two parts: the first section was an open declaration of continuing trust and cooperation between Germany and Italy while the second, a 'Secret Supplementary Protocol'  encouraged a joint military and economic policy.

== Relations with Spain ==
Significant changes in relationships between Fascist Italy (the Italian [[w:National Fascist Party|National Fascist Party]], which under [[w:Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini]] ruled the [[w:Kingdom of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] from 1922 until 1943) and Spain began in the period between 1923 and 1930, though no official and formal decisions had been made on the subject.

The principal issue in relations was the due to the colonial expansion and military activity over the north of Africa and this included interests in the Mediterranean. It is still debatable what influence the Italian government and other powers had in the continued fragmentation of the Spanish state, but it was mostly a political implosion based on national regional aspirations. Europe in general was in an economic volatile situation and political system were still under heavy discussion and flux. The Spanish nation has been always an artificial construct over very distinct regions with the escalation of tension King Alfonso XIII with [[w:Miguel Primo de Rivera|Miguel Primo de Rivera]] took political control of Spain and Rivera in a secession of steps installed as dictator. In a state visit of  to Italy in 1923, King Alfonso described Rivera as “My Mussolini”, but Rivera during his permanence in power never showed any fascist inclination, something that was clear with Franco.  

By 1931 and 1936, the Spanish state fragmented by several radical factions and becoming increasingly violent, hurting diplomatic efforts so much that Mussolini was incapable having any influencing any Spanish affairs. Then, in the year of 1939, the Spanish Civil War began, giving Mussolini the perfect opportunity help the Spanish nationalists more so than Hitler was ever able to. Between the end of 1939 and 1943, Spanish and Italian relations were at a peak, but began to dwindle in importance as Spain began focusing on Nazi Germany.

Pyrex is a programming language developed to aid in creating Python modules. Its syntax is very close to Python, with the aim of making it easy for Python programmers to write the non-Python code usually required for such modules in a language which at least is very close.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fish and chips are usually served in polystyrene containers or even better plates these days, newspaper ink is too toxic to eat from.  Ive lived in the UK all my life so i thought id add this in.

Newspaper ink is actually made of a soy-bean based product these days. [[User:Trumpy|Trumpy]] ([[User talk:Trumpy|talk]]) 07:38, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

Haddock or Coley could be used instead.

Also, newsprint is RARE these days, as plain white catering paper is now used

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why &quot;More&quot;? ==
Why the title of this book is &quot;More C++ Idioms&quot;, instead of simply &quot;C++ Idioms&quot;?
''More'' than what?
Are there any other C++ idioms?
--[[User:Carlo.milanesi|Carlo.milanesi]] ([[User talk:Carlo.milanesi|talk]]) 21:17, 8 June 2008 (UTC)
::There are several reasons for that: (1) This book has more (and modern) idioms than the earlier book (Advanced C++ ...) by James Coplien. (2) There are certainly more idioms out there than what are listed currently in the book. I expect the number of idioms to grow because C++ is continuously evolving. Hopefully the new ones will be added as they are discovered/invented. (3) Some books on C++ that came in sequence had &quot;More&quot; in their title. For example, Effective C++/More Effective C++, Exceptional C++/More Exceptional C++, and Who's Afraid of C++?/Who's Afraid of MORE C++?! I thought it is cool to follow the tradition because it is second book on idioms.  [[User:Sutambe|Sutambe]] ([[User talk:Sutambe|talk]]) 02:25, 11 November 2009 (UTC)

== Table of contents ==
I think You should rearrange your table of contents.
There are few fields that currently link to the same URL, is it temporary or would it be the same in the final version?
if it's not temporary than i think you should group them together.

Thanks

== Idiom = pattern? ==

Is there a reason for using the word &quot;idiom&quot; over &quot;pattern&quot;? All here looks so familar with what I would call a &quot;pattern&quot;. 

I think &quot;Idiom&quot; is more a &quot;common name for something&quot; to me than &quot;the whole something&quot; (which is the pattern). Also, pattern is very wide-spread, especially in non-C++ areas and these people seem to be a major interest group for the book (moderate level = people coming from other languages?). Note that I am coming from the Java world, where it's all about the word &quot;pattern&quot; (or at least much more ;-)

----
I think that patterns are programming language independent, whereas idioms are programming language dependent; therefore Idiom != pattern. Most of the usage of the word &quot;pattern&quot; is about design patterns, not programming patterns. Looking up Merriam-Webster dictionary:

idiom(2): an expression in the usage of a language that is peculiar to itself either grammatically (as no, it wasn't me) or in having a meaning that cannot be derived from the conjoined meanings of its elements.

pattern(1) : a form or model proposed for imitation

pattern(2) : something designed or used as a model for making things

pattern(3) : an artistic, musical, literary, or mechanical design or form

On the other side, if this wikibook contains something that is actually more a pattern than an idiom, I think it should be removed.

== Page completion indicators ==

I've noticed that a lot of the pages on this book are marked as '75%' complete with {{stage short|75%|whatever}}. I'd be in favour of updating quite a lot of these to be 100%, unless anyone has any particular objections. I see the 100% mark as meaning that the text is high quality, and that nothing necessary is missing from the text. I don't think text needs to be utterly unimprovable or not have any content that could be added in order to achieve this mark. What do other people think? If I don't hear back, I'll probably go ahead and update some of the indicators, but this shouldn't be taken to be an irreversible change. If you can see missing content, feel free to knock the marker back down to 75% and detail on the talk page what content you feel is missing. --[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fishpi|contribs]]) 21:23, 21 February 2011 (UTC)

== Merge? ==

Would it be appropriate to request a merging of wikibooks, I don't really have a specific wikibook in mind other than perhaps [[C++ Programming]] I feel that it could be added under a section like [[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns]] and the move would unite communities and potentially increase content development speed as well as create a better unified C++ programming wikibook so users don't have to store many bookmarks/links/references. I feel that this helps out everyone in the long run, by joining forces with the 'competition' you can work together to create something everyone agrees on and is easier to share with others than fragmented resources. That's just my 2 cents [[User:Zenware|Zenware]] ([[User talk:Zenware|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Zenware|contribs]]) 00:50, 17 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==French Wars of Religion==
The French Wars of Religion were a series of conflicts between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots) involved both civil infighting and military operations.

==Dutch Revolt 1568-1648==
===Religious Troubles===
During the 16th century, Protestantism rapidly gained ground in northern Europe. Dutch Protestants, after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities. By the 1560s, the Protestant community had become a significant influence in the Netherlands, although it was only a minority of the population then.
[[Image:19- Rei D. Filipe I - O Prudente.jpg|thumb|250px|Philip II, King of Spain.]]
In 1556 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, passed his throne to his son, Philip II. Charles, despite his harsh actions, had been seen as a ruler empathetic to the needs of the Netherlands. Philip, on the other hand, was raised in Spain and spoke neither Dutch nor French. During Philip's reign, tensions flared in the Netherlands over heavy taxation, suppression of Protestantism, and centralisation efforts. The growing conflict would reach a boiling point and would lead ultimately to the war of independence.

In an effort to build a stable and trustworthy government of the Netherlands, Philip appointed several members of the high nobility of the Netherlands to the States General, the governing body of the seventeen Netherlands. He put his confidante Granvelle as head of the States General. Furthermore, he appointed Margaret of Parma as governor of the Netherlands. However, already in 1558 the states started to contradict Philip’s wishes, by objecting to his tax proposals and demanding the withdrawal of Spanish troops. Subsequent reforms met with much opposition, which was mainly directed at Granvelle. Petitions to King Philip by the high nobility went unanswered. Some of the most influential nobles, including the count of Egmont, the count of Horne, and William of Orange, withdrew from the States General until Philip recalled Granvelle.

As unrest grew in the Netherlands, the nobles urged Philip to be more tolerant, however he refused. He believed that the only way to solve the religious &quot;problem&quot; was opression. In 1566, desperate, the nobles sent a petetion to Margaret of Parma. The petition was sent on to Philip for a final verdict.

==The Revolt Begins==
The atmosphere in the Netherlands was tense due to the rebellion preaching of Calvinist leaders, hunger after the bad harvest of 1565, and economic difficulties due to the Northern Seven Years' War. In August 1566, a Calvinist mob stormed a Church in Flanders. This event sparked a mass Calvinist movement all across the country. Calvinists stormed churches and other religious buildings to desecrate and destroy statues and images of Catholic saints all over the Netherlands. According to the Calvinists, these statues represented the worship of idols.
[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1580.jpg|thumb|240px|William the Silent.]]
By this time Philip had lost control in the Netherlands. He saw no other option than to send an army to suppress the rebellion. On August 22, 1567, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, marched into Brussels at with 10,000 troops.

Alba took harsh measures and rapidly established a special court (Raad van Beroerten or council of upheavals) to judge anyone who opposed the king. No one, not even high nobility who had been pleading for less harsh measures, was safe. Egmont and Horne were forced to resign, and later executed.  The reason for their execution was that Alba considered they had been treasonous to the king in their tolerance to Protestantism. Their death, ordered by a Spanish noble, rather than a local court, provoked outrage throughout the Netherlands. Over one thousand people were executed in the following months. The large number of executions led the court to be nicknamed the &quot;Blood Court&quot; in the Netherlands, and Alba to be called the &quot;iron duke&quot;. Rather than pacifying the Netherlands, these measures helped to fuel the unrest.

William of Orange, otherwise known as William the Silent, had fled the Netherlands in 1567. Prior to 1567, he was stadtholder of the provinces Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, and Margrave of Antwerp.  In 1568, William returned to try to drive the highly unpopular Duke of Alba from Brussels. He did not see this as an act of treason against the king (Philip II), but as an option for reconciliation with the Spanish king. William put together an army and invaded. After some inital success, William ran out of money and his own army disintegrated, while those of his allies were destroyed by Alba.

==Dutch Succses==
===Spanish Troubles===
Spain was troubled by the fact that it had to wage war on different fronts simultaneously. Its struggle against the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean Sea put limits on the military power it could deploy against the rebels in the Netherlands. Even so, by 1570 the Spanish had, for the most part, suppressed the rebellion throughout the Netherlands. However, in March 1569, in an effort to finance his troops, Alba had proposed to the States that new taxes be introduced, among them the &quot;Tenth Penny&quot;, a 10 per cent levy on all sales other than landed property. This proposal was rejected by the States, and a compromise was subsequently agreed upon. Then, in 1571, Alba decided to press forward with the collection of the Tenth Penny regardless of the States' opposition. This aroused strong protest from both Catholics and Protestants, and support for the rebels grew once more and was fanned by a large group of refugees who had fled the country during Alba's rule. On March 1, 1572, the English Queen Elizabeth I ousted the Gueux, known as Sea Beggars, from the English harbours in an attempt to appease the Spanish king. The Gueux under their leader Lumey then unexpectedly captured the town of Brill on April 1. In securing Brill, the rebels had gained their first foothold.

After the capture of Brill, many towns and cities across the provincies pf Zeeland and Holland declared their loyalty to William the Silent.  He was recognized as Governor-General and Stadholder of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Utrecht at a meeting in Dordrecht in July 1572. It was agreed that power would be shared between Orange and the States. With the influence of the rebels rapidly growing in the northern provinces, the war entered a second and more decisive phase.

William was faced with the problem with uniting the Catholics and the Calvinists to a common cause. Although he himself was Catholic he sympathized with the Calvinists and began to move towards their cause. However, most people, whether Catholic or Calvinist, respected and Admired William as he was one of the most popular figures of the age. He officially declared himself a Calvinist in 1573.

===Replacement of Alba and the Spanish fury===

Being unable to deal with the rebellion, Alba was replaced in 1573 by Luis de Requesens and a new policy of moderation was attempted. Spain, however, had to declare bankruptcy in 1575. Requesens had not managed to broker a policy acceptable to both the Spanish king and the Netherlands when he died in early 1576. The inability to pay the Spanish mercenary armies endured, leading to numerous mutinies and in November 1576 troops sacked Antwerp at the cost of some 8,000 lives. This so-called &quot;Spanish Fury&quot; strengthened the resolve of the rebels in the 17 provinces to take fate into their own hands.

The Netherlands negotiated an internal treaty, the Pacification of Ghent in the same year 1576, in which the provinces agreed to religious tolerance and pledged to fight together against the mutinous Spanish forces.

==Union of Utrecht and the Oath of Abjuration==
[[Image:Plakkaat van Verlatinghe.jpg|thumb|140px|The Oath of Abjuration]]
===Independence===
On January 6, 1579, prompted by the new Spanish governor Alexander Farnese,  and upset by aggressive Calvinism of the Northern States, some of the Southern States, the so-called Walloon Flanders located in what is now France and Wallonia, signed the Union of Arras (Atrecht), expressing their loyalty to the Spanish king.

In response to the union of Arras, William united the northern provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders and Groningen in the Union of Utrecht on January 23, 1579. Southern cities like Bruges, Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp joined the Union of Utrecht. Effectively, the 17 provinces were now divided into a southern group loyal to the Spanish king, and a rebellious northern group.

In 1581, the Oath of Abjuration was issued, in which the Netherlands proclaimed that the king of Spain had not upheld his responsibilities to the Netherlands population and would therefore no longer be accepted as rightful king. They attempted to find a replacement, trying the Prince of Anjou, but he proved to be a disater. When Queen Elizibeth of England was offered the crown, she declined. All options for foreign royalty being exhausted, the civilian body States General eventually decided to rule as a republican body instead.

===Death of William II the Silent===

In March of 1580, Philip II had William officially declared an outlaw, putting a price of 25,000 crowns for his assassination. A Catholic Frenchman named Balthasar Gérard, was a supporter of the King and in his opinion, William of Orange had betrayed the Spanish king and the Catholic religion. In May 1584, he presented himself to William as a French nobleman, and gave him the seal of the Count of Mansfelt. This seal would allow for forgeries of messages of Mansfelt. William sent Gérard back to France to pass the seal to his French allies. Gérard returned in July, having bought pistols on his return voyage. On July 10, he made an appointment with William of Orange in his home in Delft, nowadays known as the Prinsenhof. When William left the dining room and descended the stair, Gérard shot him in the chest from close range and fled. As William lay dying, his last words were ''&quot;My God have Pity on my soul and on my poor people.&quot;'' Gérard was quickly captured and brutaly tortured to death.

==Spanish Advances==
===Fall of Antwerp===
Immediately after the oath of abjuration, Spain sent a new army to recapture the United Provinces. Over the following years, Parma reconquered the major part of Flanders and Brabant, as well as large parts of the northeastern provinces. The Roman Catholic religion was restored in much of this area. In 1585, Antwerp — the largest city in the Low Countries at the time — fell into his hands, which caused over half its population to flee to the north. Between 1560 and 1590, the population of Antwerp plummeted from c. 100,000 inhabitants to c. 42,000.

===Looking for Support===
While England had unofficially been supporting the Dutch for years, Elizabeth now decided to intervene directly. In 1585, under the Treaty of Nonsuch, Elizabeth I sent the Earl of Leicester to take the rule as lord-regent, with 5,000 to 6,000 troops, including 1,000 cavalry. The Earl of Leicester proved to be a poor commander, and also did not understand the sensitive trade arrangements between the Dutch regents and the Spanish. Moreover, Leicester sided with the radical Calvinists, earning him the distrust of the Catholics and moderates. Leicester also collided with many Dutch patricians when he tried to strengthen his own power at the cost of the Provincial States. Within a year of his arrival, he had lost his public support. Leicester returned to England, after which the States-General, being unable to find any other suitable regent, appointed Maurice of Orange (William's son), at the age of 20, to the position of Captain General of the Dutch army in 1587.

==The War turns against Spain==
===Campaigns of Maurice===
[[Image:Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt - Maurits van Nassau, prins van Oranje en Stadhouder.jpg|thumb|140px|Maurice of Nassau, prince of Orange and Stadhouder.]]
The borders of the present-day Netherlands were largely defined by the campaigns of Maurice of Orange. The Dutch successes owed not only to his tactical skill but also to the financial burden Spain incurred replacing ships lost in the disastrous campaign of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and the need to refit its navy to recover control of the sea after the subsequent English counter attack. In 1595, when Henry IV of France declared war against Spain, the Spanish government  again declared bankruptcy. However, Spain retained control of the seas and received a large amounts of gold and silver from her colonies in the Americas.

Under financial and military pressure, in 1598, Philip ceded the Netherlands to his favorite daughter Isabella and to her husband, Philip's nephew Archduke Albert of Austria, following the conclusion of the Treaty of Vervins with France. By that time Maurice was engaged in conquering important cities in the Netherlands. Starting with the important fortification of Bergen op Zoom (1588), Maurice conquered Breda (1590), Zutphen, Deventer, Delfzijl and Nijmegen (1591), Steenwijk, Coevorden (1592) Geertruidenberg (1593) Groningen (1594) Grol, Enschede, Ootmarsum, Oldenzaal (1597) and Grave (1602). As this campaign was restricted to the border areas of the current Netherlands, the heartland of Holland remained at peace, during which time it moved into its Golden age.

==Twelve Years Truce==

After a failed attempt to sieze the important Spanish port of Dunkirk, the Dutch began to build up their navy. After the Battle of Gibraltar in 1607, in which the Spanish lost over 20 warships, both sides agreed to a ceasefire, in 1609. It was mediated by France and England at The Hague. During this time the Dutch expanded their navy even further, which would play a significant role in the future. Negotiations for a permanent peace went on throughout the truce. Two major issues could not be resolved. First, the Spanish demand for religious freedom of Catholics in Northern Netherlands was countered by a Dutch demand for a similar religious freedom for Protestants in the Southern Netherlands. Second, there was a growing disagreement over the trade routes to the different Dutch and Spanish colonies (in the Far East and the Americas) which could not be resolved.

==War Breaks out Again==
The Spanish made one last effort to reconquer the North, and the Dutch used their navy to enlarge their colonial trade routes to the detriment of Spain. The war was on once more — and crucially, merging with the wider Thirty Years' War.

In 1622, a Spanish attack on the important fortress town of Bergen op Zoom was repelled. However, in 1625 Maurice died while the Spanish laid siege to the city of Breda. The Spanish commander Ambrogio Spinola succeeded in conquering the city of Breda. After that victory, however, the tide changed definitively in favor of the Dutch Republic. Maurice's half-brother, Frederick Henry had succeeded his brother and took command of the army. Frederick Henry conquered the pivotal fortified city of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. This town, largest in the northern part of Brabant, had been considered to be impregnable from attack. Its loss was a serious blow to the Spanish
[[Image:Uebergabe von Breda.jpg|thumb|240px|The Siege of Breda]]
In 1632, Frederick Henry captured Venlo, Roermond, and Maastricht during his famous &quot;March along the Meuse&quot; in a pincer move to prepare for the conquest of the major cities of Flanders. Attempts in the next years to attack Antwerp and Brussels failed, however.

===Colonial Battles===
In the Western colonies, the Dutch States General mostly restricted itself to supporting privateering by their captains in the Caribbean to drain the Spanish coffers, and to fill their own. The most successful of these raids was the capture of the larger part of the Spanish treasure fleet by Piet Hein in 1628; which allowed Frederick Henry to finance the siege of 's Hertogenbosch; and seriously troubled Spanish payments of troops. The Dutch, who were at war with the Portuguese at this time, siezed Brazil and Angola, but they would eventually be driven out.

==End of the War==
===End of Spanish Sea Power===
In 1639, Spain sent an armada bound for Flanders, carrying 20,000 troops to assist in a last large scale attempt to defeat the northern &quot;rebels&quot;. The armada was decisively defeated by Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp in the Battle of the Downs. This victory had historic consequences far beyond the Eighty Years' War as it marked the end of Spain as the dominant sea power.

===Peace===
On January 30, 1648, the war ended with the Treaty of Münster between Spain and the Netherlands. In Münster on May 15, 1648, the parties exchanged ratified copies of the treaty. This treaty was part of the European scale Peace of Westphalia that also ended the Thirty Years' War. In the treaty, the power balance in Western Europe was readjusted to the actual geopolitical reality. This meant that de jure the Dutch Republic was recognized as an independent state and retained control over the territories that were conquered in the later stages of the war.

:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' for now, to soon for a VfD just because it's very empty. Subject and content wise it fits Wikibooks standards, the only thing I dislike is the title.... As for the writing, it is indeed different but not so an uncommon approach, we have also to keep in mind that the creator only edited it 2 times (24 April 2008) and on the same day, we will always have orphaned works from time to time but we should help contributors and keep them working. One very important point is that if a work is initiated even as a simple stub in no instance is the originator obligated to finish the work, we can only give incentives for participation. In any case I think that we need a book on that topic and don't see any reason for a deletion for now.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:01, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

:{{Neutral}} I don't vote to delete it only because the book is so young and there is the potential (although it's becoming increasingly unlikely) that the author will return to improve it, or a new author will like the idea and adopt it. I added {{tlx|New book}} to it, so that should give it some exposure. Give it a little while and if it stays at it's current condition, we delete it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:35, 1 May 2008 (UTC)
::{{comment}} FYI this was originally on WP, but [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What does it take to be a competent_server|they didn't want it]]. The author on the same day copied it to both here and to [[wikihow:Be-a-Competent-Server|WikiHow]], where it appears to have received more contributions. I think its unlikely that the version here will receive any more contributions by its original author. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:18, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol move vote.svg|15px]] '''Redirect''' - I hope nobody minds that I went ahead and moved this piece to [[Bartending/Work/Servicing patrons/Tips for providing good service]]. It's been in limbo for a month with no clear consensus developing. I think it actually fits in very well with the [[Bartending|Bartending Guide]] that is being developed. Obviously it needs cleanup and editing for style, but the concepts are sound. If nobody objects to this, I will remove the notices and cleanup the article soon (after several other backlogged changes within the Guide are resolved). If there objections, please forgive me. I'm an experienced editor, but still acquainting myself to the subtle nuances of Wikibooks. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 10:12, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

Thank you for writing up information about the ARM Instruction Set Format.
I hope you don't mind me moving it into the &quot;ARM&quot; section of the [[Embedded Systems]] Wikibook.
(Following [[Embedded Systems/ARM Microprocessors]]).
I hope someday that section will grow enough to split out into a separate Wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although this page does point out changes in the circumstances of the characters, it fails to point out real development in these characters. The same Harry Potter seems to be present in all of the books, except book five. Indeed, it is arguably that Harry Potter as a character does not develop. Instead, he simply grows in experience without experiencing change. (I mean, &quot;OMG KILLING IS BAD&quot; or &quot;GREED IS NOT GOOD&quot; is not exactly what I consider character development.) &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:169.232.127.252|169.232.127.252]] ([[User talk:169.232.127.252|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/169.232.127.252|contribs]]) 22:42, 8 June 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:The key event is actually late in book 7. Up until that time, he has basically reacted, meekly going where he was led... though he did think for himself in book 1, it was debatable whether he had actually made a wise choice there. Through all of books 1 through 6, Harry acts either as he is instructed to act, or in a way that places him directly between Voldy and his goals, as best he understands them. In book 7 at Shell Cottage, though he finally understands that Voldy wants the Elder Wand, and is about to get it, Harry refuses to enter the race, instead speaking with Ollivander about wand lore and Griphook about Gringotts in order to work around Voldy's plans. From that point on, Harry heads in his own direction, largely unsteered by what Voldy is doing. Whether that can be classed as &quot;development&quot; or not is uncertain; it does seem to me that it is a clear maturation.

===Color overview===

The color of natural waters varies considerably, and this can indicate the chemicals dissolved in it, organic materials such as peat, blooms of phytoplankton, and soil erosion. Field measurements of colour tend to be subjective, and a wide range of colour scales have been developed for measuring colour in water, ranging from the platinum scale, to the Forel-Ule scale and the Borger and Munsell colour systems. The following methods may be used for measuring colour in salty waters.

===&quot;Apparent&quot; color/turbidity measurement using a spectophotometer:===   
[[Image:nomogram.jpg|right|350px]]
Color as APHA 'color units' or 'hazen' (see Eaton ''et al'', 1995) may be measured using a spectrophotometer. A sample is placed in a cell and a beam shone through it. The machine may need calibration by zeroing against a blank.
 
Record the absorbance of the sample at 425nm and 580nm. As color and turbidity affect each other, correct by plotting the readings on the Nomogram Chart below. The chart is derived from AT Palin (1955) &quot;Photometric determination of the colour and turbidity of water.&quot; ''Water &amp; Water Engineering'', 59:341-345. 

To plot the turbidity and color onto the nomogram, mark the long scale on the left side of the nomogram with the reading you obtained when you used a wavelength of 425nm. Mark the long scale on the right hand side with the reading you obtained when you used a wavelength of 580nm. Take a ruler and carefully rule a straight line that connects the two readings. Where this line intersects the color scale and the turbidity scale in the centre of the nomogram, the intersections mark the values to record for each parameter.

Record colour as Hazen's or Color Units.

Note: The nomogram is dependent on the path length of the spectrophotometer cell. This chart was developed for a 10mm cell path length. Should you have a different cell path length the chart will need adjusting.  

===&quot;Apparent&quot; color reflected from a Secchi disk:===

A rapid method for use in the field, is to observe the apparent color of water reflected from the white quadrants of a secchi disk. The color may be compared to a set of color standards. 

Gently lower the secchi disk into the water until the disk is one meter below the surface. Note whether you are looking at a surface scum (opaqhe, deep colored material that floats on the water surface) or whether you are looking at the color of the main water column. Look at the color reflecting back from the white quadrant of the disk and visually compare this colour with your color standard. Record the color, and the name of the standard you were using.

====Useful color standards for  reflected apparent color measurements====
[[Image:ISSLRColors.jpg|right|350px]]

* Forel-Ule scale - a set of glass vials filled with colored water, developed for estuarine studies
* Permanent glass standards such as those made by Lovibond, in either the Pt-Co scale, Hazens or Color Units
* Munsell's color books - there are some choices - the full 2-volume Book of Color, the single volume 'Soil Color Charts' (useful for muddy water, and the single volume 'Plant Tissue Color Charts' (useful for yellow-green water or algal blooms)
* Globe put out color books for soil and plants too, that are less expensive
* A chart such as the one shown here that uses HTML-RGB codes to define its colors (selected from the 216 non-dithering color palette), and which includes a similar range of colours to the Forel-Ule scale used in estuarine studies. This chart was initially developed for use by community Waterwatch groups in South Australia, by Coleman and Cook (2007) and has been extended to display colours found in hypersaline conditions.


On the HTML-RGB chart shown here, the yellowy colors across the top row may represent dissolved organic (humic) substances. The unusual blues in the left-most column are likely to reflect dissolved minerals like calcite. Water colors in the 2c-3e area may represent cyanobacterial blooms or blooms of other extremely small chlorophyllous bacteria in the water column. Green flagellated algae such as ''Chlamydomonas'' may cause colors such as those in the 3b-5c region, while dinoflagellate and euglenoid blooms may develop colors in the 4c-4e and 5c areas. Muddy waters may have colors similar to 5d and column 6, while grey colors such as 5e suggest anaerobia has recently occurred in the waterbody. Column 7 shows colors frequently found in very hypersaline situations. The lighter, pinker colors may represent bacterial blooms, while the more orange, intense colors suggest blooms of the unicelluar algae ''Dunaliella salina''.

===&quot;True&quot; color using a spectrophotometer:===
Should a sample need testing for hue, saturation and luminance, the method as specified in ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (Eaton ''et al'', 1995) should be followed. The method measures absorbance at a minimum of thirty different wavelengths, and then uses calculations to determine hue, saturation and luminance. This method provides a quantitative, rather than a qualitative measure of color.

*British vs. American English:  Use the one thats easier for you. While I am an American English writer, my first book was in British English and had a hard time learning American spelling. [[User:Saltysailor|Saltysailor]] ([[User talk:Saltysailor|talk]]) 11:01, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

*Do not delete existing techniques.  If you have another or better one, add it as an alternative and add notes at top of chapter about the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative.  For example, multiple techniques to get a sticky slider to work are appropriate.    Some techniques require  tools or supplies that may not be available.

*Crowbar
*Torx drive set
*Large channel lock pliers
*Framing hammer

=== More Tools ===
*Soldering iron, portable.
*Flash light, artificial light sources needed when your power is out or it is dark.

== Supplies ==

=== Basic Supplies ===
*Duct tape: so many repair uses.
*Electrical tape: cover up wire splices.
*Spare gland hand ruppers.


=== More Supplies ===
*Spare lights.
*Spare fuses of each type used in vehicle (required by law in some countries).
*Electrical connectors:
** Butt connectors.
** Three-way splice connectors.
** Male and female disconnect connectors: to make it possible to easily add and remove items like a CB radio.

2. How are the concepts of base and open cover related? It seems that every base is an open cover, but not every open cover is a base. But, why are both concepts needed?

The terms base and open cover are not evidently related. Every base is an open cover which is probably the main relation. Take a second countable topological space for instance (secound countable means that the space has a countable base for its topology). Such a space satisfies the property that every open cover has a countable subcover. To prove this we use the countability of the base. Basically, for any open cover, we choose for each element of the space, an element of the open cover containing it and hence a basis element contained in that element of open cover. Therefore, for any open cover, we can generate a open cover of basis elements that is an 'open refinement' (see Wikipedia for definition). From here we can get properties of open covers from properties of the base. If the base is countable, we can generate a countable open cover from the original cover. Does this answer you question?

I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. &lt;br&gt; I'm going to show them... a world without rules or controls, borders or boundaries. &lt;br&gt;A world where anything is possible. &lt;br&gt;Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.&lt;p&gt; &quot;[[w:Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]&quot; in ''[[w:The Matrix|The Matrix]]''

==Way to go!==
Way to go for starting to teach Hawaiian here. This has always been on my languages-to-learn list and I could never find enough materials to give it a serious shot! Of course being in Germany doesn't help ;-)  Let me know if you need help developing a lesson plan or just generally tips on writing a good course; I have done a lot of that, both for commercial projects and for Wikibooks. Good luck! [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] ([[User talk:Junesun|talk]]) 15:16, 9 June 2008 (UTC)
:Though I didn't start this book and I'm not sure what the creator ([[User:Geek]]) had in mind as far as how this book should be organized, I'm sure help with structuring would be much appreciated in the long run :) '''[[User:Kalathalan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#a8a8a7&quot;&gt;Kal&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kalathalan|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#919191&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:06, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>comment about Fortran/C data type mapping</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">can someone add instructions for how to do this in the opposite direction? (using bits of C code in a fortran program) [[Special:Contributions/82.13.80.230|82.13.80.230]] ([[User talk:82.13.80.230|talk]]) 23:05, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

The mapping between Fortran and C data types is not correct for every architecture. For example, long int is a 4 byte integer on i386 but an 8 byte integer on amd64. long double is even more intricate. On i386 it is a 10 byte float (extended precision from i387), on amd64 it is also a 10 byte float but stored in a 16 byte area of memory. Other architectures might use long double for IEEE quadruple precision numbers or a non-standard way of implementing higher precision than double. On AIX on PowerPC using the XLC compiler, long double is identical to double. Using special compiler flags long double is interpreted as to separate 64 bit floats that must be added to yield the total result, effectively doubling the size of the mantissa.
While there is no easy portable way of mapping Fortran and C floats, integers can be easily mapped using C99's integer types (int16_t, int32_t, etc.) --[[Special:Contributions/46.128.18.193|46.128.18.193]] ([[User talk:46.128.18.193|talk]]) 23:35, 12 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Cudeath.jpg|align=right|thumb|300px| Cúchulainn is an important figure in Irish mythology]]

Mythology is rich with character, history and enduring examples. They are possibly the most ancient form of storytelling. Before there were written histories of cultures and lands there were half truths and stories about them. These stories served as the connection between the people that told them. Often there were morals and guidelines to the stories and to a community with no written laws, these held the fabric of their society together. Many of the moral ideas which cement our own society were passed down to us through fictional stories. Although a diverse genre, there are some distinguishing features of myths and legends that are common to most languages and cultures. The main aspect, however, is the flexibility of these stories to adapt to whatever culture they find themselves in. This genre is a fascinating section of literature. 

===History===

Mythology is prehistoric, meaning that it pre-dates written language. Predominantly, it survived through oral history, passed on by word of mouth. Legends are stories that began as real events and people but were blown out of proportion by embroidery and retelling. It is suspected that the Arthurian legend began with a real man, who led the people of Britain some time in the dark ages. However, most accounts of the story include mentions of magic and impossible creatures. Myths are creative tales, but they often serve as vessels for complex ideas. They include well known tales such as The Minotaur and Icarus. They served to bring cultures together and occasionally against each other. The Romans and Carthaginians justified their wars by calling to mind the legendary Aeneas, who, supposedly, had been at odds with the ruler of Carthage in his journey to found Rome. By a common history, true or imagined, a land mass could become a nation.

===Social Functions===

One of the functions of mythology was to lay an unofficial guideline of the values of a society. This is particularly evident in the legends about Gods and heroes. Often in ancient times, religion and mythology were indistinguishable, both explaining supernatural phenomena and events. This is true in the famous myths of Ancient Greece and Rome, Australian Aboriginal folklore, and many beside. It was also used as a way of defining moral ground. Before there were written laws and governments, societies modelled themselves on glowing legends of perfect lands and rulers. The Arthurian legend is a brilliant example of this. King Arthur is famed as having introduced and enforced the rule of law and having disputed the theory of “might is right.” For hundreds of years afterwards, English society modelled itself on these ideas. In Australian Aboriginal legends, the dreamtime spirits lived in the ideal way and aboriginal culture continued almost unchanged for thousands of years by following their example. Myths and legends have played a vital role in the structure of different cultures.

===Across Cultures===

Mythology is common to most people. Because of this they are as varied as the cultures which invented them. Some defining features do connect them, however. Most have an underlying theme. A story with no meaning or purpose could hardly stand the test of time to survive as mythology. However, the beauty of this genre lies in its freedom. Each story that has been passed down through the generations is open to individual interpretation. They are refreshed with every new era. T. H. White’s The Once and Future King, telling the story of King Arthur, took most of its inspiration from Malory’s Le Morte D’Arthur written 400 years earlier. It, in turn, had brought together different stories from much older books and poems. Myths and Legends are being constantly adapted to keep up with current culture and this is what defined their nature. The film Troy (2004), The Alexander series of novels by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, and much more popular literature are stories thousands of years old. Without doubt, they will be retold time and time again.

There must have been millions of myths and legends told over the ages, most lost to the passing of time. For thousands of years they have been a part of every culture. They gave those who knew them an identity and a character. They gave societies a common memory and a connection to the land in which they lived. Often, they laid out the ground rules by which a group of people strove to live. In a time before laws, they separated people from just animals by enforcing order with a common standard. Having evolved separately in most parts of the world, mythology has got to be one of the most diverse and varied genres. It is this tendency to adapt to whatever society they have been accepted into that really defines it. No other stories are as rewritten, retold, and recreated as those of myth and legend. They shall no doubt live on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Theatre of Cruelty was founded by Antonin Artaud in 1935. It was his next step after his “Théâtre Alfred Jarry” which he had had joint management of. It took some of it’s inspiration from the surrealist movement. The idea of cruelty refers to the emotional shock and strain of the audience during the performance. Effects such as light and sound are intensified and exaggerated to create a feeling of exhaustion of emotion. The Theatre of cruelty has had a great impact on modern horror movies. It also uses ideas like unexplainable phenomenon and mystical forces in its plays. Fear is a vital part of the idea, the types of plot are generally about the unknown, and bloodshed etc. is frequent. Often there is a lack of dialogue and concrete storyline to heighten the idea of confusion. It differs from older drama by its focus on effects and not language. The theatre of Cruelty was in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Samuel Beckett lived from 1906 – 1989 and wrote from 1931 until his death. His work focuses on the absurdity of existence, humanity’s search for meaning in life, and our nature. He wrote in both English and French, often translating his own work. He started his career by writing in a very rambling style. He also put sections of his own life and experiences into his work, often only subtly changed, which caused tension among his friends and family. After about 1950, his style of writing changed and he began to write in a more minimalist way, sometimes writing plays that were only a few pages long. His works often took on imaginative and yet strange and sometimes depressing tones, notably his idea of each person living entrapped in a container of some sort, unable to get out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Method acting is a style of acting, which involves the actor trying to make themselves actually feel what the character is feeling and not just act like it. It was started by Lee Strasburg from the acting studio who took inspiration from Konstantin Stanislavski. It requires the actor to use what they are thinking or feeling at the moment and their past experiences to shape their portrayal of a character. It relies not on the actor memorising and repeating a script and a set of actions but on them immersing themselves in the character and then reacting naturally to the circumstances they are put in. Its origins are American and it became popular in the 1940s and 50s. Paul Newman, Al Pacino, and James Dean were early actors of this technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Australian Coat of Arms.png|thumb|px400|align=right|The Australian coat of arms is entwined with wattle showing Australia's cultural identity with the natural landscape]]

Federation had a massive impact on Australia’s identity; both how it saw itself and how it was seen by others. This change can be traced through a study of the poetry of the era. Because of its geographical isolation from the rest of the world, Australia came into contact with other countries very late. At the time of Federation it was only 100 years old. This made it a poet’s dream for words of future and dawning power. The relationship between Australia and its coloniser, Britain, has also been mentioned by many poets, and is probably that most notable area of change over the time scale. Something that has remained constant would be the focus of poets on the landscape of Australia, strange and wild to their predominantly English eyes, and their neglect of the people and character of Australia. This is an intriguing segment of poetry to study.

A recurring theme in the history of Australian poetry is that of the youth of the country and the many opportunities for its future. Australia has only entered the global stage and been in contact with other countries for about 200 years and has only been a country in its own right for the last 100 years. It is important to note, however, that the published poetry of the era from Australia’s colonisation until quite recently was only that of Anglo Saxons. Undoubtedly the Aboriginal perspective would have been quite different. In most Australian poems, imagery such as that of Australia being a child, often of Britain, or an untapped source of culture and prospects is prevalent in both colonial and post federation works. Bernard O’Dowd speaks of Australia as the “last sea thing dredged by sailor Time from space” and then hypothesises what future the country will shape for itself. W. C. Wentworth names it Britains “last-born infant” and Henry Kendall proclaims himself a “singer of the dawn” as he praises the beauty and potential of the land. It is fascinating to observe the hopes and dreams of the past in light of Australia’s current situation.

Integral to the representation of Australia in poetry has been the representation of Britain and Australia’s relationship with it. This has changed drastically during the period surrounding Federation in 1901. Originally, Australia was merely a colony of Britain aspiring to the sophistication and culture of its founder. In the later years, It was evident that Australia had developed a much more individual identity and was no longer desiring only to replicate Britain. This can be easily seen in a comparison between W. C. Wentworth’s (1793 – 1872) Australasia and Dorothea Mackellar’s (1885 – 1967) My Country. Wentworth dreams that the future of Australia may be as rich as England’s past. He calls for an “Austral Milton”, “Austral Shakespeare”, and “Austral Pindar” and muses of a day when Britain has been obscured by time and Australia risen “A new Britannia in another world.” On the other hand, Mackellar draws a clear line between the English and the Australians, recognising their love for their land but saying “I know but cannot share it, my love is otherwise”. As Australia has matured, this gap has grown wider and the individual identity of the country has grown stranger.

Another interesting aspect of Australian poetry is the subject matter that most poems focus on. There is a definite inclination towards the landscape and natural occurrences such as weather. Very few poems have a distinguishable Australian character or national hero. This is probably because of the youth of Australia as a separate culture, meaning that there was yet a stereotype for Australians to identify with, such as the outback Crocodile Dundee of today. An interesting development towards a national identity is seen in Henry Kendall’s Australasia where he speaks of people important to Australia. Captain Cook is glorified as an idol, along with Forby Sutherland and Arthur Phillip, all people distinguished in Australia’s history alone. The Aborigines are almost never mentioned in the poetry of white settlers and only in derogatory terms to serve as contrast for the white culture. The common people of Australia are also notable only by their absence. Only recently has Australia really identified with a unified national character.

The Period surrounding the Federation of Australia is rich with change and development. It was a time when Australia was just shaping its identity and still experimenting. This is reflected in the poetry of the time. Many references are made to the youth and inexperience of Australia and consequently, its unfulfilled potential. It was also a time when Australia was just beginning to see itself as a country in its own right, separate from Britain and British culture. In particular, the landscape of Australia was marvelled at and described in detailed passages. However, there was yet to be a definite national character and the common people of Australia are hardly ever mentioned. These characteristics and developments make it an exciting topic of research.

===Title?===

Why was this named &quot;Tibetian&quot; rather than the usual (in English) &quot;Tibetan&quot;? This name makes it much more difficult to find when searching for Tibetan.

These long, puffy buns are stuffed with cream and topped with rich chocolate icing. The buns are made with choux pastry, which is made by bringing butter and water to the boil, tipping in the flour and then beating in the eggs. 

==Ingredients==
'''For the pastry'''
* 75g/2½oz butter, diced
* 200ml/7fl oz water
* salt
* 100g/4oz strong plain flour
* 3 free-range eggs, beaten

'''For the cream'''
* 250ml/9fl oz double or whipping cream

'''For the chocolate icing'''
* 100g/4oz caster sugar
* 100ml/3½oz water
* 50g/2oz dark chocolate
* 25g/1oz unsalted butter

==Procedure==
# Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Place the butter, water and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon as the butter melts.
# Meanwhile, sift the flour into a small bowl.
# When the butter has melted, turn up the heat and bring the mixture to the boil. Switch off the heat and quickly tip the flour into the saucepan. Immediately beat the flour into the liquid with the wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Stop beating when the mixture swells into a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the saucepan. This should take only a few seconds.
# Let the mixture cool for 3-4 minutes. Pour in a little of the beaten egg into the flour mixture and beat it in well. Keep adding and beating in the egg, a little at a time, until the dough looks thick, smooth and shiny and still holds its shape well. You may not need the last two or three tablespoonfuls of egg if your eggs are large.
# Spoon the mixture into a freezer bag (you'll need to scrape it out of the pan with a plastic spatula). Fold down the top of the bag to squeeze the dough to the bottom. Snip off one of the bottom corners of the bag to give you a hole about 1cm long.
# Line two flat baking sheets with baking parchment. Squeeze the mixture into chipolata-sized sausage shapes on to the parchment, allowing about 4cm between each one (they will at least double in size in the oven). You should be able to make about 12.
# Wearing oven gloves, place the baking sheets in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Take the éclairs out when they are puffed up, golden brown all over, and feel hard when you poke one with a knife. 
# Immediately take each éclair off the baking sheet (they will be very hot, so wear oven gloves) and, with the point of a knife, gently slit the side to let out the steam. (Otherwise, the steam sits trapped in the éclair and turns back to water, leaving you with a soggy bun.) Leave them to cool and dry out on a wire rack.
# Whip the cream in a small bowl until it is just thick enough to hold its shape. Place it in the fridge while you make the chocolate icing.
# For the icing, place the sugar and water in a small saucepan over a low heat. Heat gently, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar. Bring to the boil and boil fast for three minutes. Switch off the hob and wait for a few minutes for the syrup to cool down (you can speed this up by dipping the base of the pan in a bowl of cold water if you like). Meanwhile, break up the chocolate and cut the butter into chunks. 
# When the syrup is very warm, rather than very hot, add the chocolate and butter. Stir until both have melted and blended to a smooth, glossy sauce. Leave to cool, stirring occasionally. When the sauce starts to thicken, it's ready to ice your éclairs. 
# When the buns are cool, use a teaspoon to fill the inside of each éclair with whipped cream (you may need to enlarge the slit you made before). Then take a different teaspoon and smear the chocolate icing generously over each éclair. Leave the éclairs on the wire rack until the icing has set. In the unlikely event that you're not going to eat them straight away, you can put them in the fridge for a few hours.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Trailer Air Lines=

== Problem 1: Air Lines Hang Too Low ==
Trailer air lines must be 18 inches above the ground.  A common problem on 53 foot trailers is that the sliding process damages the hanger springs causing the air lines to hang too low or actually touch the ground.  This is a significant problem since the air lines can develop holes causing the spring brakes to come on and stopping the vehicle.  When going through Weigh Stations, Weigh masters can easily see air lines that are hanging too low and are likely to stop the rig.

=== Solution 1A ===
Use nylon string to attach at the spring attachment points both on the air line and on the underside of the trailer.  A slip knot should be used on one end so that the string can be easily detached when sliding the axles.  Be sure that no string or spring is hanging low.

=== Solution 1B ===
Sometimes a stretched out spring is the problem.  High quality side cutters can be used to trim the spring and a plier used to bend the end through the attachment point and then wrap ''bitter end'' around the ''standing end'' of the spring.

== Problem 2: Holes in Air Lines ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">The XForms/Input page is the same page for both 3.2.1 and 4.1 as shown in the Table of Contents.  Because of this, its ''Next Page'' and ''Previous Page'' links are wrong.  This should be fixed as it is confusing for new readers who follow through the book using next page.  The readers suddenly find themselves reading more complex examples, while unknowingly skipping almost the entire XForms Architecture section.</text>

This is a relatively new book (I found it while removing the {{tlx|new book}} tag from it). It's had an NPOV warning on it for a while, and taking a quick browse through, I tend to agree with that. It's a border-line case, and because of it's young age I suppose there is a potential for this to improve. Either way, I figure it's better to discuss it here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:32, 10 April 2008 (UTC)
* {{del}} '''Very Strong Delete''' This book is awful.

*{{comment}} - I won't vote, but will say this: the issues identified are real issues for the USA (and, in fact, many other countries), but are contentious and the book appears to violate [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] requirements. However, it has only been going for a few months and perhaps deserves more of a chance. If anything, its main problem appears to be one of [[WB:OR]] - it sounds like it is attempting to explore new territory, rather than presenting knowledge, and on that basis perhaps the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Towards A Better|Towards A Better...]] series should be questioned. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:28, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} They are real issues but they only present one side of the arguement - i.e. they claim that &quot;immigrants cost the economy millions per year&quot; but don't mention the fact that most immigrants don't claim benefits, most immigrants pay taxes and most immigrants are more productive than regular workers for example.  Also NPOV is expressed when the writer expresses suprise that a socialist country (Cuba, France, etc.) has better healthcare than the USA -  what would you expect?  The USA doesn't even have universal healthcare.  If the book is quickly cleaned up and presents both arguements then fine but this doesn't look like it'll happen.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:16, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
*:You're basically saying, then, that it's incomplete... &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sofixit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (FWIW, even the silly Cuba statement has some merit - the USA likes to measure things by GDP, and Cuba ranks 83 compared to the USA's 10; by Human Development Index, Cuba ranks 51 compared to USA's 12; and yet, USA citizens can't all access good health care.) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:21, 11 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} Even after I added &quot;drugs&quot;, it's still missing several important issues. However, several of its claims are weak and biased. The best example (worst example) I could find was on the illegal immigration page, when in its &quot;What's wrong with it?&quot; section, it listed as an item &quot;It's Against the Law, claiming &quot;By not enforcing certain laws, the government loses credibility and respect&quot;. So prior to June 26, 2003, the government lost credibility and respect whenever sodomy laws weren't enforced in states that had them? Prior to 1965, the government lost respect and credibility when it didn't enforce Jim Crow laws? Anyone else want to comment on this aspect? [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 08:20, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
*:This is what I was talking about. It's ''possible'' to do w/ NPOV, but would be prohibitively difficult. The main way around these problems is to attribute those points of view. So it's not just that the author says the gov't loses credibility, but rather that &lt;insert authoritative source&gt; says that the gov't loses credibility. Then we also run into problems of balance between the various people who might comment on that issue, and it ends up being unwieldy and bloated. I think the best solution if one wants to fix it instead of scrap it is to instead have 3 sections: [[Toward A Better America/The Republican's Dream]], [[Toward A Better America/The Democrat's Dream]] and [[Toward A Better America/The American's Dream]] where you can unapologetically state three different visions. Then a conclusion that tries to present some conclusions of leading modern political theorists (so it's not the author's own synthesis) which compromises on all three. If there's someone willing to do this, I suspect they'd rather start over anyways. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:04, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
*::That sounds like you have a plan. Just one suggestion: instead of calling them &quot;The Republican's Dream&quot; and &quot;The Democrat's Dream&quot;, we should call them &quot;The Conservative Dream&quot; and &quot;The Liberal Dream&quot;, since there are some conservative Democrats (like Bill Clinton). How do you picture &quot;The American's Dream&quot; as coming out? [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 07:16, 16 April 2008 (UTC)
*::Both terms would be confusing.  &quot;Liberal&quot; Dream would be confusing as liberal (US meaning refers to left politics focusing on social liberalism.  The rest of the world uses liberal to mean right wing focusing on economical liberalism) has a very different meaning to the rest of the world.  But surely all &quot;liberals&quot; and conservatives have different opinions especially in American politics where the main policies of a party are determined by the party leader?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:16, 16 April 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} - If the intended target audience is right wingers than I don't see what's wrong with this book being written from a right wing perspective. However I think the title probably needs to be change to remove &quot;better&quot; from its title and to make its intentions clearer. Maybe &quot;America Tomorrow - A Right Wing Perspective&quot; or &quot;America Tomorrow&quot; if its intended audience is more broad. Also problems with NPOV shouldn't be a reason to delete, but rather a reason to improve it so it is neutral. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:27, 14 May 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' - This seems more like a political statement of opinions than a textbook. There is almost nothing to be ''learned'' from it, though there are plenty of opinions about why things are ''wrong'' in the U.S. and how to ''fix'' them. It's largely an unfinished opinion piece. Maybe there's a better place for that sort of stuff; otherwise delete it. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:54, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

Two points:
1. I have taken the liberty of altering the definition of the Dative Case.
2. I cannot understand the sentence &quot;Gothic makes these cases destinctive for each type of stem that is used by using Verb Strength.&quot;  How is 'stem' to be understood in this context?  And what connection is there in Gothic between 'Verb Strength' and Case? 
Best Regards to all!

==1. Make a collection of 30 various colored sands. Correctly label with the name and locality where each was secured. ==
Sand can be found almost anywhere.  Lakes, rivers, beaches, ponds, and even backyards are all places where you can find sand.  When you have collected sand from a location, check there again - most places have more than one color of sand.

While collecting, you will need plastic baggies (in which to store the sand), and a permanent marker (to label the baggies).  Label each bag with your name, the date, and the location where the sand was found.  Be as specific as possible (perhaps recording latitude and longitude if you have a GPS receiver).

Be sure to collect enough sand to share with others.  If you are working on this honor with your club, 30 colors should not be very difficult to achieve if everyone collects enough sand for everyone else.  You can also trade sand with other ''Arenophiles'' (sand collectors) whom you can contact via the Internet:

* http://www.arenophile.com/
* http://www.sand-collecting.org/

Get started, explorer!

==2. What does the term &quot;sand&quot; mean? Name two kinds of sand.==
Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.  As the term is used by geologists, sand particles range in diameter from 0.0625 (or 1⁄16 mm) to 2 millimeters. An individual particle in this range size is termed a sand grain.

There are three major types of sand:
;Terregenous: This type of sand is eroded from rocks (sedimentary, volcanic, and crystalline), and is generally transported by water.  Most sand is of this type.
;Carbonate: This type of sand has organic origins, being made from ground sea shells, corals, and other marine sources.
;Pyroclastic: This type of sand is created when volcanoes erupt and blow their ash (pyroclastic sand) into the atmosphere.

==3. Give the origin of sand and mineral content.==
Sand is made when rock of any kind is eroded by wind or by water.  The mineral content of sand is the same as the parent rock - quartz, granite, feldspar, etc.  The color of the sand depends on the parent rock.

==4. What is the difference between sand and soil?==
Soil is very similar to sand, and it is formed in much the same way.  In fact sand is a component of soil.  The main difference though is that soil contains a lot of organic material (such as decayed plants, decayed animals, etc.).

==5. What is meant by shape, surface, grain fracture, and grain size?==
===Shape===
The shape of a grain of sand can tell us about its history.  Rounded grains are those which are relatively old, the rounding being caused by the grain getting blown around by wind or pushed around by water.  Grains with more angular surface are relatively young, not having had time to get rounded by the forces of nature.

===Surface===
The surface texture of grains may be polished, frosted, or marked by small pits and scratches. This information can usually be seen best under a binocular microscope, not in a thin section.

===Grain Fracture===
In the field of mineralogy, fracture is a term used to describe the shape and texture of the surface formed when a mineral is broken. Minerals often have a highly distinctive fracture, making it a principal feature used in their identification.

====Conchoidal fracture====
[[Image:ObsidianOregon.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Obsidian]]
'''Conchoidal fracture''' is a curved breakage that resembles the concentric ripples of a mussel shell.  It often occurs in amorphous or fine-grained minerals such as flint, opal or obsidian, but may also occur in crystalline minerals such as quartz.  '''Subconchoidal fracture''' is similar to conchoidal fracture, but not as curved.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

====Earthy fracture====
[[Image:Limonite_bog_iron_cm02.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Limonite]]
'''Earthy fracture''' is reminiscent of freshly broken soil.  It is frequently seen in relatively soft, loosely bound minerals, such as limonite, kaolinite and aluminite.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

====Hackly fracture====
[[Image:Cuivre_natif1_%28USA%29.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Native copper]]
'''Hackly fracture''' (also known as '''jagged fracture''') is jagged, sharp and uneven.  It occurs when metals are torn, and so is often encountered in native metals such as copper and silver.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

====Splintery fracture====
[[Image:Chrysotile_1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Chrysotile]]
'''Splintery fracture''' comprises sharp elongated points.  It is particularly seen in fibrous minerals such as chrysotile, but may also occur in non-fibrous minerals such as kyanite.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

====Uneven fracture====
[[Image:MagnetitaEZ.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Magnetite]]
'''Uneven fracture''' is self descriptive.  It occurs in a wide range of minerals including arsenopyrite, pyrite and magnetite.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Grain Size===
Grain size, also called particle size, refers to the diameter of individual grains of sediment.

==6. Define the following and give the use of each:==
;a. Glacial: Glacial sand is sand produced by the action of a glacier grinding the rock over which it passes.
;b. Calcareous: Sand composed primarily of calcium carbonate or limestone.
;c. Quicksand: Quicksand is a ''colloid hydrogel'' consisting of fine granular matter (such as sand or silt), clay, and salt water. In the name &quot;quick&quot; does not mean &quot;fast,&quot; but &quot;alive&quot; (as in the expression ''the quick and the dead'').
;d. Glass sand: Glass sand is sand with low iron content, and high silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) content.  This type of sand is ideal for glass making.
;e. Molding sand: Molding sand, foundry sand, or green sand is sand that when moistened or oiled tends to pack well and hold its shape. It is used in the process of sand casting.
;f. Polishing sand: Sand can be used as an abrasive material for polishing materials.  This type of sand must be very fine grained.
;g. Building sand: Building sand is used for making concrete.  Sharp sands (with angular surfaces) are preferred.
;h. Filter sand: Sand can be used to filter water or other liquids. A media filter is a type of filter utilizing a bed of sand, crushed granite or other material to filter water for drinking, swimming pools, aquaculture, irrigation, stormwater management and other applications.
;i. Furnace sand: Furnace sand is used for lining the floor of industrial furnaces which are used for processing molten metals (such as steel).
;j. Lake shore sand: Sand created by the wave action of a lake.  A prime example would be the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in northwest Indiana.

==7. Examine five types of sand specimens under magnification and observe their vari­ous characteristics.==
Using a hand lens or a microscope, examine the sand grains, looking for the features described in requirement 5 (shape, surface, grain fracture, and grain size).  You can also note its color and its variability are all the grains the same size?  Are they all the same shape, or are there big differences from one grain to the next?

==8. Memorize and discuss Genesis 22:17, Proverbs 27:3, and Ps. 139:17-18.==

==A New Visualization of Atomic Structure==

===Introduction===

Most models of atomic structure are very difficult to comprehend, especially at introductory levels. This tool will attempt to illustrate a more visually intuitive atomic model enabling a deeper understanding of how nature works at it most fundamental level. This allows a much improved understanding of chemical bonding and the creation of molecules all with minimal violation to the theory of quantum mechanics (which is beyond the scope of this essay).

===The Gossamer Nature of Matter===
First, one must understand the vast emptiness of an [http://trshare.triumf.ca/~safety/EHS/rpt/rpt_1/node7.html atom]. Visualize a propeller on the wing of an aircraft (or the blades of a fan). Let this propeller have two props (or fan blades), 180 degrees apart, with a diameter of 1 meter. Facing the spinning propeller one observes a circle of 360°. It is important to note that this circle is translucent such that objects, in the observer’s line of sight behind the propeller, can be seen. Dependent upon the speed of the propeller’s rotation and speed of a bullet, one could fire bullets through this translucent circle and toward targets beyond, sometimes hitting a propeller (or fan blade) and sometimes hitting a target.

[[Image:Fig1_iHydrogen_01C.jpg|center|750px]]

Keeping this translucent propeller in the mind’s eye, imagine having a magical BB, similar in size to that used in a pneumatic BB gun. For example’s sake, give this imaginary BB two attributes: 1) it must remain within a volume of a beach ball (say 1 meter in diameter), and 2) it must always move at nearly the velocity of light (as is predicted by modern sub-atomic theory). Think about what one would observe … an almost invisible 1m diameter ball, yet due to the speed of the BB it would be very difficult to poke a stick through such a ball. Placing a hand against this sphere (and ignoring potential problems from friction) one would feel a solid surface (the outermost electron “shell”). Two such balls thrown at each other (or colliding) would mutually bounce away. But furthermore, they would have the additional force of mutual electronic repulsion powerful enough to prevent them from actually touching (unless enough pressure/heat is applied to cause bonding as explained later). A stadium could be filled with such imaginary spheres, one atop the other as a grocer stacks oranges, never violating each other’s space (never touching) and still the stadium would appear nearly empty. This mostly empty ball is very analogous to how the electron “cloud” of a hydrogen atom would appear at such a macro scale, except it would actually be much emptier, for if the hydrogen proton were the same size as this electron BB, the atomic diameter would be on a scale of kilometers . And actually, the commonly used term “cloud” is incorrect. Cloud, implies “many” as in fog with its countless aerosols. A better term is “envelope” or “orbital” as there is exactly one electron within the boundaries of its envelope. Let’s agree to refer to this imaginary electron particle as “iEp”, its envelope as “iEn”, and its velocity as “iEv”.

For reference, let us call this magic sphere “iH” for imaginary hydrogen. It is approximated in Figure 1A. Note the gossamer nature of the atom and that it is “see-thru”. So, it is much more accurate to visualize electrons as electron envelopes than as particles. A real-world visual analog is a substance called [http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/tech/aerogel.html Aerogel&amp;reg;] (Figure 1B; See also:[http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/images/technology/aerogelhand.jpg Aerogel]) that is 99% empty space!  Note this is not like a gas or air. It is a state of matter with attributes that change with the number of protons, electrons and neutrons.  To “poke” another electron envelope within a “shell” of electron envelopes requires specific conditions. These conditions vary with each element and current conditions such as heat and pressure. Furthermore, depicting the iEn as a sphere is a simplification. More accurate is to show the iEn as [http://daugerresearch.com/orbitals/index.shtml eigenstate orbitals]. Figure 1C shows the eigenstates for iH where the probability of the electron’s position and velocity is proportional to the figure’s brightness. In actuality, the orbitals are in constant “rotation” about the nucleus. The sphere of Figure 1A is indicative of the boundary of rotation of these [http://daugerresearch.com/orbitals/index.shtml orbitals]. 

Now, imagine iH composing the earth’s entire atmosphere and the sun raining down visible iL, or particles of light (see below). Your mind’s eye should be able picture a thick blanket of mostly empty iH filled with the passing of billions of iL. With billions of iL passing through billions of iH every once in awhile an iL will hit an iH “just right”, scattering some of this imaginary light in this imaginary atmosphere. This is one way of understanding how different electromagnetic energy can pass through different materials. The iL with a frequency most easily scattered would give this imaginary atmosphere its imaginary color depending upon how may iL get through without hitting an iH electron or proton. If you have trouble “seeing” this then slow everything down and remember that if these figures were to scale then the orbitals and the space between each particle would be hundreds (even thousands) of times larger than can be shown on this page. Assume the iEp moves at 1 meter/minute such that it would take about 1 minute to traverse from one side of its envelope to the other. Next, imagine that iL travels at 1 meter/minute. As iL travels through all of these mostly empty iH in our imaginary atmosphere it would have to be at exactly the right time and place to strike either an electron or a nucleus.

===A Conceptual Analogy for the Duality of Light===
Next, we need imaginary electromagnetic light rays. It’s very difficult to understand the duality of light without mathematics. However, we may make an analogy that will allow one to “picture” how the photon (or electron) can be a wave and point particle simultaneously depending upon how it is observed. Additionally, this analog will allow one to grasp how it can have two types of spin. Let our imaginary photons be similar to the BB shown except they are squashed into a discus shape with the following attributes;

: 1) They move in straight lines (excluding gravitational effects) at the velocity of light,
: 2) They spin along their major axis at a frequency proportional to that of visible light, and
: 3) They spin along their minor axis.
 
Now we have a much more comprehensible tool for imagining the duality of light. Viewed from the side these moving particles will appear sinusoidal (similar to the “expanded iEp in Figure 2.), and viewed head-on they appear as a particle. Pick up a pencil, point its tip away from yourself, close one eye and use the other to view the eraser “head-on”. Imagine this was a fast spinning disk coming toward you. You should see a circle (looking like a particle), with no indication that it has a pencil trailing behind. Now, turn the pencil sideways, imagining it to be the path of the spinning disk, you should be able to imagine it as the passing of a sinusoidal wave. Thus, a spinning disk moving in a straight line may appear as either a particle or a wave simultaneously.  

Let ”iL” designate such imaginary light particles. This concept of iL makes it much easier to understand how light acts, can have duality, and how it may be polarized by a filter. Assume a multitude of iL is directed at (shining on) a grate with separations smaller than the major diameter (Amajor) of iL but larger than iL’s minimum thickness (Aminor). Only those iL parallel to the grate would get through. Think of it as a discus spinning about both axes thrown towards a fence with picket gaps smaller than the discus diameter but larger than the discus is thick. A discus hitting the grate parallel to the ground will not get through the gaps, but those discus vertical to the ground as they near the grate will make it through the gaps. The passed iL would now be “in sync” or polarized.

====A Mechanical Double-Slit Experiment====
Using our imaginary moving discus model for light, one may explain the famous [[w:Double-slit_experiment|double-slit]] experiment in mechanical terms. In this experiment, a single beam of light passes through two very narrow slits to hit a wall. If light is a round particle one would expect it to show as two spots on the wall; But, it appears spread out along the wall primarily in three groups of concentration! How can this be? If we assume that light is a spinning discus we may explain that as the discus passes through the double-slit; it will be at various angles of rotation, or phase. The phase will determine which slit the discus passes, and if we imagine that it touches one side or the other of the slit as it passes, it will have a variation of deflection. As the discus particles careen through the slits, they may show up at any place along the wall, but when all the factors are considered (the probability of the outcome), the vast majority of the discii will hit three places on the wall. These factors include: Double-slits to wall distance, width of slits, distance between slits, depth of each slit, and light particle/wave phase.

===Helium===
[[Image:Fig2 iHelium 01B.jpg|center|750px]]

What might imaginary helium (iHe) look like? The mass of iH is equal to the mass of one electron plus one proton while the mass of helium is equal to the mass of two electrons plus two protons plus two neutrons, or four times that of iH. But the shape of iHe is more like a dumbbell than a sphere. Figure 2 shows two protons and two neutrons at the center of opposing electronic envelopes. Due to like charges each electron has trouble violating the others envelope, and as they must maintain nearly the velocity of light, they seem to be everywhere in their own envelope at once. One must imagine these envelopes as three dimensional coming out of the page as well as below, more like an apple eaten down to the core!


===Classical Model vs. New Model===
[[Image:Fig3AB iCarbon 01C.jpg|center|750px]]

Figure 3A shows a typical middle school rendering of the carbon atom. Such a view is inaccurate and makes nuclear electro-mechanics more difficult to comprehend. The imaginary carbon (iC, Figure 3B) and imaginary oxygen (iO, Figure 3C) is more realistic and will lead to a much more intuitive understanding of chemical bonding (the dotted lines are for visual reference only). Performing the &quot;thought experiment&quot; of imagining the push-pull of electromagnetic forces upon these various particles, one can &quot;see&quot; how these subatomic components hold together. The two electrons in the innermost shell of Figure 3C are compelled to “fall” towards the nucleus, repel one another, and maintain near light speed. The four electrons in the outer shell are in a similar predicament, rapidly organization into synchronized equilibrium. This equilibrium is what defines substances and gives rise to their crystallization characteristics and chemical properties. Note that the Figure 3B model of carbon is an equilateral tetrahedron (a triangle in 3 dimensions). Triangles are among the strongest geometric forms, and equilateral triangles are the strongest triangles. Equilateral tetrahedrons are the strongest 3D shapes, and perfect for turning soft carbon or graphite to that hardest of natural substances... Diamonds! The more one learns about Nature, the more one can appreciate the connections from algebra to zoology. Nature can be wonderfully logical!

===Chemical Bonding of Oxygen===
[[Image:Fig4 iOxygen Bond 03A.jpg|center|750px]]

Noting that the space between all components of iO would be orders of magnitude greater than this page can show, Figure 4 shows schematically how two iO could bond. Assume that for whatever reasons that electron iO2e2 has come well into the influence of iO1e1 and iO1e2 as shown. We say they are sharing their shells. Since electrons repel each other electromagnetically atom iO1 and atom iO2 are now coupled together by the force labeled FR.  Additional bonding force (FA) is supplied by the displaced of iO1e1 and iO1e2 being attracted to iO2’s nucleus. This is much like linking your knuckles together and attempting to pull your hands apart. But if electrons repel how could they get into such a configuration to begin with? Either by pressure &amp; heat, or catalytically, or electromagnetically. If the pressure and heat is sufficient, the electron envelopes deform allowing the outer shells to slip amongst one another. This is how the sun and deep earth turn carbon to diamond. If a catalyst has the correct properties, it can pull the electron envelopes apart creating a “hole” for another envelope to slip into, freeing the catalyst to slip away for another reaction. This is how catalytic converters convert automobile emissions to less toxic substances. Electromagnetically, electron envelopes may be pulled apart creating a “hole” for coupling. This is how “buckyballs” are created in an [[w:Fullerene|electric arc]].

===Atomic Crystal Matrix===
[[Image:Fig5 iCrystal Matrix 01B.jpg|center|750px]]

This new schematic view of atomic structure lends itself well to showing how atoms form crystalline structures. Figure 5 shows such a matrix schematically (inner shell removed for clarity). Again, this is a 2-D analog of a 3-D structure, so one must imagine some of the electron envelopes going under the page while others extend above the page (the gray circles are for visual boundary reference only).

This model also explains the cohesion of water (H2O) and the release of energy when hydrogen is burned in the presence of oxygen. Figure 6A shows one oxygen and two hydrogen in close proximity (hydrogen shown with it’s single electron as four eisenstate orbitals). If enough energy is added, electron envelopes (or orbitals) can jump to a “higher shell”, creating room for hydrogen orbitals to “slip” between, such that hydrogen’s electron envelopes are “lower” than or within oxygen’s electron envelopes (Figure 6B). 


==The Combustion of Hydrogen and Oxygen==
===Burning into Water===
[[Image:Fig6ABC H2O 01B.jpg|center|750px]]

When oxygen releases the energy previously gained it’s electron envelopes fall back to their “lower shell”, but now, all three atom’s mutually repellent electron forces “squeeze” the hydrogen envelopes releasing more energy (Figure 6C). Note, that the iEn volume of a free iH is much reduced. This reduction is a tremendous loss of energy. Think about this: If 2 volumes of iH are mixed with 1 volume of iO and ignited a huge amount of energy is released and the resultant volume of water is much smaller than the original 3 volume units!


===The Release of Energy===
[[Image:Fig7 H2O 01.jpg|center|750px]]

Further note in Figure 7, how the attachment of 2 iH to one iO exposes naked protons. One may easily discern how such exposed protons would automatically adhere to any surface exposing electrons. Now one is able to visualize why H2O clings to a glass and why it is such an excellent solvent and reactant. With this model of the atom chemistry may now be visualized much more logically! A hydrophobic substance would have hydrogen trapped on its surface making it water repellent. Think of oil. They are often hydro-carbons strings of C+H2, with the hydrogen exposed such that oil and water don’t mix! 


==Electrons: Shells, Eigenstates &amp; Orbits==
Figure 8 presents a computer generated view of an element with many electrons. Note the “shells” are clearly delineated. The energy differential between each shell is a quantum unit and the movement from one shell to another is called a quantum jump. For an electron to jump from an inner shell to an outer shell it must absorb one quantum unit of energy per jump. Likewise to jump from an outer shell to an inner shell it must give up one quantum unit per jump, often in the form of a photon on light. Be aware that the distance between these subatomic components is several orders of magnitude larger than can be represented on a sheet of paper, such that the atom is much “emptier” than it looks. For example, if the nucleus contained protons and neutrons the size of BB’s (4.33mm) the innermost shell’s diameter would be approximately 200 meters; the second shell’s diameter 800 meters, and the third shell’s diameter 1900 meters. Thus, on the scale of BB’s, one would need a 2 kilometer square paper sheet to show Figure 8 at true scale! Emphasizing once again how “empty” atoms are. Amazingly, on a percentage basis, the nucleus is even emptier… but, that is a story for another paper!

I saw your question about uploading images. Your account must be over 4 days old before you can upload images. However, if you don't want to wait, you should upload the images to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], they don't have a waiting period. Images that you upload on that website can be immediately used here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:31, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Just a quick note that this nomination isn't meant as criticism of your dedication or intentions. I simply believe that the analogies it draws are what we consider original research, that weeding them out would leave little content, and that rather than replacing them under a new book title, we should just start fresh.

Furthermore, while most pages that are brought up for deletion discussion, it is by no means a judgment in itself. Every page gets its fair discussion. A discussion that isn't rushed. Even books for which there is consensus to delete ususally stay for about a month. Books for which there is no consensus as to what policy should dictate are not deleted. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:12, 27 March 2009 (UTC)


I'm a new user to Wiki,.. ? But than you to write about this. Wonderful work.  I find the model a great help in a visual understanding of the atom. I think complainers and crybabies should try to creat their own works before putting down others. LBate from Michigan</text>

== Introduction ==

[http://felix-cat.com Felix] is a CAT tool for Microsoft Windows with add-ins for Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as a stand-alone editor ([http://felix-cat.com/tagassist/ Tag Assist]) for translating HTML files.

Felix stores memories in its own unique XML format, but can also import and export memories in [http://www.lisa.org/tmx TMX] format.

== Comparison to Other Tools ==

Felix is somewhat similar to SDL Trados and Wordfast in that it allows translators to work from within Microsoft Word. It is different from these two programs in that instead of creating &quot;bilingual&quot; files translators overwrite the original file, and it allows translators to work directly from PowerPoint and Excel instead of using an external editor.

== External image linking ==

Hi Mike,

Such images are essential to the book's information - I knew that downloading them and reuploading to wiki would potentially be copyright infringement but I fail to see how externally linking (essentially saying: if you want more information, visit this external link) breaks any laws, US or otherwise.

Please clarify,

Leo
:It doesn't break the law, we just frown upon it (strongly). There are possibly suitable diagrams in [[commons:|Commons]], and you can ask someone to make you a diagram if you need to. Also, there may well be free sources of such diagrams/photos on the internet, but it will take some looking. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:34, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

I do my best to look for appropriate images on the commons but I often find they are too advanced or too simple for my needs - a common problem since A-Levels are somewhat of an intermediary course between simple (GCSE) and complicated (university courses). I will look for free image sources, but in cases where they are not available and I cannot easily make them myself, I will externally link to images, as well as describe the images best as I can to reduce their necessity. Is this an acceptable compromise? --[[User:Greenie|Greenie]] ([[User talk:Greenie|talk]]) 22:24, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
:I would rather you didn't link to unfree images; this is almost as bad as using a copyrighted image where a free alternative could be made (which we don't do). If you are finding images at Commons which are not quite right for your purposes, you should work with the uploader or [[commons:Commons:Graphic Lab School/Images to improve]] to alter it to fit your needs. Until then, even a sub-par image from Commons is better than linking to an unfree image elsewhere! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:52, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

== [[Bartending]] and {{tl|Delete}} ==

First, thank you for helping me clean up all that stuff. I noticed in the logs you were the person doing all the grunt work. I was going to send you a thank you before logging off, but you beat me too it. :-) Especially think you for the [[Talk:Bartending/Alcohol/Wine]] merge help.

Secondly, sorry about going overboard on he delete comments. I don't know all the buzzwords for speedy delete here, so I figured it was better to just explain why it was an obvious SD even if it didn't ''exactly'' fit neatly into a specific SD policy (or perhaps fit into several). Since I contribute on several Foundation sites (mostly the English versions of Wikipedia, Commons, and once again here), it gets hard for me to remember every site's particular nuances when it comes to that sort of thing. I basically act boldly (but not recklessly) until someone slaps me for something, and then I try to learn. So, I will try to do better here and won't use my signature. Do you have suggested verbiage for the types of delete requests I have been making? In a big project like this, I kind of become a human bot, and just replicate my actions as much as possible to avoid burning out brain cells. Some stock request comments ''would'' make it easier than coming up with new ones each time. This will be even more important when I delve into the cruft littering the cocktail recipes area. And after all that is cleaned up, I will need some help transwikiing a lot of stuff over from Wikipedia into [[Bartending Guide]] here, and then linking the two sites together better. The second part should be easy, but the transwikiing part I'm still a little tentative on. Maybe I can ask for a little assistance from you when I get to that point? Thanks again! --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 17:30, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
:The default delete reasons are listed at [[MediaWiki:Deletereason-dropdown]] - anything there would be fine. For bringing stuff over from WP, you'll want to make a request at [[WB:RFI]] listing the pages you want transwikied. And you can always ask me or another admin if you get stuck. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 31 May 2008 (UTC)
::Thanks for both pieces of info. As to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Vodka]] reading like a Wikipedia article... I'm not really into the cleanup and improvement phase yet. I'm just trying to get everything reorganized first. I noticed that [[Cookbook:Vodka]] was a double-redirect, so I pulled that one section out of the larger article. I tried massaging the info a bit to be a bit more narrative, but, yes, it still sucks. :-) I'm trying to formulate a more standard layout for the various articles, but until I see for sure what all is there, it's pretty hard. I thought there was a lot more bartending info, but mostly it looks like a Wikipedia dumping ground (which I already knew from being on the Wikipedia side where everyone else's mantra is &quot;Wikipedia is NOT a recipe book... dump it onto Wikibooks!&quot;). My goal is to change that. I want to get the Wikipedia articles to have good in-depth information about notable drinks, and I want a variety of classic and modern drinks that are typically ordered in bars to be listed here. Fill these articles with some fun factoids that bartenders could share with customers, a little history if it's significant, and some ''common'' variations (not every possible variation under the sun!), and tips on preparation and presentation. You know, the stuff a beginning bartender might want to know. All the rest of the cruft can be dumped on 1001cocktails.com or someplace that readily accepts every drink and variation known to man. Dunno if I will ever finish or not, but it's a goal. :-) It took me 3 months to get Wikipedia whipped into a lot better shape, and 1.5 years later, the effects are still visible (which makes me happy). I would appreciate it if you don't tag every article with a &quot;needs improvement&quot; badge, though. The whole dang book needs improvement, and that's what I'm trying to do. Once we get some decent articles, then we can start tagging the worst ones. Ok? :-) Also, I don't want this to remain a one-man show forever. Since the book has had basically no work done on it for months (except transwiki dumping), I figured it was time to rebuild the framework, and then once that's in place, try to drum up some help to improve and add content within that framework. That's what worked at Wikipedia, and hopefully it will work here, too. I still can't get over the radically slower pace around here, though. It's much more peaceful and comfortable here. I really like it! I'm just telling you all this so you understand my motivations and methods. I'm not a flake, though things are stirring in my offline life that may keep me away for a while (family health issues that could require a lot of back and forth distant travel).

:::: Right now, in that particular book, no... not really helpful. Once we get things sorted out, then yes. Do you use article assessments here like on Wikipedia? You know, where a page is stub, start, B, A, GA, FA, etc.? I know you have featured books, and since this is a book-oriented site, page-specific stuff might not usually be helpful. However, I think that for a sprawling project like this one, it would be helpful. If there isn't such a tool here, what do you think about me starting one? It would go on the talk pages, just like at Wikipedia--keeping it out of the main content. I could certainly keep it project-only, but if anyone else would find it useful, then maybe it should be offered to all and used by those who want it, and ignored by most everyone else.

Yes, it's a wikibook, not an encyclopedia article.

Hi Mike,

Yes, these pages were created in error.  The links were fine and dandy, except for that &quot;editing&quot; at the beginning.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thanks for your hard work.  Wikibooks runs more smoothly because of you and your fellow admins.

Now, for a question, what is the official party line on wiki usernames on module pages?  We have created an &quot;About the Authors&quot; section in our most recent wikibook and believe that posting links to authors' user pages would substantially add to the user-friendliness of our book.  Can you see your way clear to give us permission to do this?  If not, do you have any alternative suggestions we may not have considered?

As always, thanks very much for your help.  Hope you have a great day!

:Do you mean just a link to the student's userpage on the module? People can always look at the history to see all editors of the page, but if you think it's useful to have links to the author's page on the module itself, go for it. Of course you can always put that kind of thing on the talk page. The purpose of the talk page is for stuff about the module - notes, plans, discussion etc. But yeah, on the module itself is fine if that's what you want to do.

The world will end when its thought system has been completely reversed. Until then, bits and pieces of its thinking will still seem sensible.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Germknödel''' 

The Germknödel is a traditional Austrian dish, which originated from the Viennese and Bohemian cuisine. A Germknödel is a yeast dumpling filled with plum jam and served with poppy seeds, powdered sugar and lots of melted butter or vanilla sauce on top. Plum jam is a special kind of jam and it is referred to as Powidl. The plums are cooked for 24 hours without any other ingredients except for unripe walnuts, which give the jam its dark color. Its tart flavor, makes Powidl the perfect filling to contrast the sweet dumpling. In Austrian ski huts the Germknödel is certainly one of the favorites on the menu. The delicious Germknödl can be eaten as a desert or as a main dish.

In Austria it is common to eat a sweet dish not only as a desert, but also as a main course. Due to the main ingredient we call them ‘Mehlspeisen’, literally meaning ‘flour dish’. One reason for eating sweets as a main course was the influence of the Catholic Church. During the Lenten season, the seven weeks before Easter, the members of the Church were not allowed to eat meat. Since fish was very expensive, people made up meals with vegetables, eggs and flour. Over the years the meals developed into sweet dishes such as, 'Kaiserschmarrn', 'Buchteln', or 'Marillenknödel'. In the 19th century the term ‘Mehlspeise’ was coined and since then it is a synonym for ‘Süßspeise’, meaning sweet dish. It is typical in Austrian to have a soup as a starter and then eat a ‘Mehlspeise’ as the main dish.

In Austrian supermarkets frozen Germknödel are sold and all it needs to prepare them is basically boil them for 20 minutes, top them with poppy seeds, powdered sugar and melted butter. Alright, when lacking time this is very convenient, but like most frozen foods, it is not a worthwhile alternative to the homemade version.

The first time I ate a Germknödel was in a ski hut in the mountains. I was surprised to see so much melted butter poured on top, but then I was positively surprised by the scrumptious flavor of the mixture of poppy seeds, powdered sugar and butter that covered the dumpling. That is when it became my favorite dish. When I got home from skiing I asked my Mom to buy Germknödel and cook them for dinner the next day. She decided to prepare them from scratch and in doing that she made my day. Soon after that my Mom taught me how to make Germknödel. My friends from school used to come around and we had great fun making Germknödel and eating them together.
 
While I was visiting friends in Mexico last year, I wanted to cook a typical Austrian dish. My first choice was to cook Germknödel, but when I tried to find poppy seeds, all attempts were in vain. Apparently they are not sold in Mexican stores or markets, or at least it was impossible for me to track them down. So, if you live in a country where the ingredients required to cook Germknödel are not available, the best solution would probably be to come straight to Austria and experience this delicious dish on site. The Germknödel is a reason to come to Austria on its own, but of course the country has a lot more to offer.

I love Germknödel, especially on cold winter days. Just try it and you will love them too!

'''Recipe for 4 servings:'''
[[File:Germknödel.JPG|right|450px|Germknödel]]
'''Ingredients:'''
* 2 tbsp yeast
* 4 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup softened butter 
* 1 cup lukewarm milk
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 egg
* 1 package vanilla sugar or 1 tbsp vanilla extract

'''Filling:'''
* 1 ¼ cups plum jam
* 1 tbsp rum (optional)

'''Topping:'''
* ¾ cup ground poppy seeds 
* powdered sugar
* ½ cup melted butter

'''Preparation:'''

For the dough mix the flour, salt, vanilla, eggs and sugar in a bowl. In another bowl, mix the lukewarm milk with the yeast and stir until all of the yeast has dissolved. Then, pour the mixture into the flour and knead everything together with the softened butter. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour. Cover the dough and leave it to rise for one hour until it has doubled its size.

Now divide the dough into 8 pieces and pad them flat and round on a board until they are about 4 inches in diameter. Fill each of the pieces of dough with a tablespoon of the plum jam and carefully form round dumplings. Make sure that the seam is completely closed. Place the dumplings on a board with a dishtowel covering them and let them rest for 10 minutes.

Boil water in a large pot, put some salt in the water and then put in the Germknödel (about 4 at a time in order to give them space to rise). Let them simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on. Do not take the lid off, otherwise the dumplings will not rise properly. 

When finished, take the Germknödel out of the water, place them in a bowl, top the dumplings with poppy seeds and powdered sugar and pour butter or vanilla sauce over the top. Serve right away. Enjoy the delicious dumplings!</text>

'''Introduction''' - The Ancient Near East

&lt;/big&gt;

''The ancient Near East refers to early civilizations in a region roughly corresponding to the modern Middle East: Mesopotamia (modern Iraq and Syria), Anatolia (modern Turkey), the Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan), as well as  Persia (modern Iran), and Ancient Egypt, from the beginnings of Sumer in the 6th millennium BC until the region's conquest by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC.  This chapter will discuss the first three, while information on the latter two can be found in chapters nine and four, respectively.''

''The ancient Near East is considered the cradle of civilization. It was the first to practice intensive year-round agriculture; it produced the first writing system, invented the potter's wheel and then the vehicular- and mill wheels, created the first centralized governments, law codes and empires, as well as introducing social stratification, slavery and organized warfare, and it laid the foundation for the fields of astronomy and mathematics.''

''Due to the broad scope of this chapter, it is divided into three parts: Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Levant.''

In this chapter, the subject matter is pretty obvious: but first we need to start by giving the numbers in Bengali from 0 to 99.

As one can immediately tell, the numeral system is [[w:Indian numerals|exactly the same as in the Western world]].

There is no clear-cut way to determine how a number from 20 to 99 sounds like: though there may be patterns, the rules of sandhi and liaison will have modified the pronunciation greatly. The best way to learn, like with all Bengali concepts, is to hear the numbers used in daily life, and the patterns will come out smoothly.

There are also more Sanskritized numbers, which are not used as much, but from which ordinals are derived:

==Notes==

*11-18 may be spelled with a final ও.
*79-88 may be spelled -াশী as well.

== 1. View an ADRA video on the topic of world hunger and discuss with your Pathfinder Club unit or class the methods shown in the video which ADRA is using to combat hunger. ==
The ''ADRA Presents'' series of videos includes very good introductions to ACS and disaster response in short video segments. These videos are available through [http://adventsource.org Advent''Source''] .

== 2. Interview the person who directs the community food pantry in your local church or another local church in your area. Ask this person about the types of people they serve, what causes food needs in the community, and how they meet these needs. Take notes during the interview. ==
If you do not know who this person is in your church, ask your Pastor.  As a courtesy, let this person know ahead of time what questions will be asked so that preparations can be made.  Invite this person to a club meeting - the question and answer session would make an excellent devotional activity for your club's opening exercises.

== 3. Visit a food bank and talk with the staff, and then explain to your instructor how the food bank gathers donated groceries and provides supplies to food pantries, soup kitchens, etc. ==
A '''food bank''' is a non-profit organization which distributes non-perishable goods and perishable food items to non-profit agencies involved in local emergency food programs.  Emergency food programs provide immediate hunger relief to individuals and families who are unable to afford food and receive inadequate government financial assistance from programs such as the Food Stamp Program. Food stamps is the government program whereby households below certain income thresholds are provided monthly food spending credits which can be redeemed at local food stores.  

The agencies receiving food from food banks are typically non-profit organizations operated as part of a church, government or community group, and commonly called a &quot;food pantry&quot;.  A food bank is like the wholesale arm of the food distribution system for those living in poverty, while food pantries are the retail arm that serve people directly with the emergency food.  Some food pantries serve only a few families each month, but there are many that provide emergency food support to hundreds of families each month.  The need for food bank and food pantry services has been growing in recent years as income has not kept up with rising costs and federal program funding is not tied to inflation.

Food banks receive their food from companies or supermarkets with unsaleable stock, and also from donations from the general public, especially around holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. In addition, the U.S. government and state governments often contract with food banks to distribute USDA surplus commodities and FEMA food. In addition, food banks who are members of [[w:America's Second Harvest|America's Second Harvest]], the nation's food bank network organization, are able to take advantage of relationships with major manufacturers. Food banks distribute goods such as canned and boxed dry groceries, fresh produce, frozen foods, bakery products, and some personal hygiene or household cleaning products.

The best way for your club to meet this requirement is to contact a local food bank and offer to conduct a &quot;Can Collecting&quot; drive for them.  The food bank will likely be more than willing to talk to your club when you deliver the food you have collected.

Many food banks around the country have employed the use of [http://aidmatrix.org/virtual-aid-drive.html Virtual Food Drives], originally developed by The North Texas Food Bank and The Aidmatrix Foundation, to make it easy for the public to help their local communities contribute to the hunger relief efforts in their area.  

===List of acceptable donations===
Usually, these items are accepted.

* Breakfast items (bread loaves, oatmeal, cold cereal, breakfast bars, toaster pastries…)
* Lunch and dinner items (bags/cans of pasta, rice, instant noodle packets, dry soup pouches, pork and beans, chili beans, canned soups, canned vegetables and fruit, beef stew, canned chicken and tuna, instant mashed potatoes, dry beans…)
* Snack and dessert items (canned fruit, pudding cups, granola bars, crackers, dessert mix, fruit cups, raisins by the box, store-bought cookies, wafers, potato chips of any flavor, trail mix, dried fruit, fruit leather, pretzels, beef jerky, candies…)
* Baking supplies (pancake and muffin mixes, cake and icing mixes, flour, condensed milk, canned pie fillings…)
* Condiments (ketchup, mustard, gravy, pasta sauce, peanut butter, jelly…)
* Beverage items (powdered milk, juice, canned/bottled pop, bottled water, meal replacement drinks, drink mixes, tea bags, coffee…)
* Pet food/treats
* Personal hygiene products
* Household cleaning products

== 4. Describe in an essay of at least 500 words the causes of hunger in each of the following situations: ==
=== a. Developing nations overseas ===
Formerly nations were referred to as ''third world countries'' if they fell into a category like this.  Today the terms ''emerging'' and ''developing nations'' describe those countries that have generally stable governments but lack the resources to manage their own economy and population.  Countries that cannot be easily be defined as ''developing nations'' include countries such as the Sudan and Somalia where the governments have collapsed or are not widely recognized as legitimate by other nations.  These nations are normally in a perpetual state of civil war and often provide breeding grounds for extremist and terrorist organizations.  Nations of this type have little to no infrastructure and rely heavily on international forces to protect the &quot;civilian&quot; population and provide for their every need.  Many developing countries were in such states just fifteen or twenty years ago (2006) and are finding today that in spite of a more stable government and economy they have difficulty in truly emerging to the level of industrialized nation because the protection and services provided during their past has turned their people into a population of welfare seeking citizens who do not feel need or purpose for being productive.  This is one reason that has lead to the focus of ADRA on development even in the Sudan and Somalia today.  Providing skill-training and purpose to such people will help them to participate in the stabilization and development of their nation.

=== b. Inner-city and other disadvantaged areas in this country ===

&quot;In this country&quot; literally applies to the United States and Canada.  Surprisingly even major European countries such as France are not &quot;developed&quot; countries any more by western standards.  This is so true that the United Nations has many of the same programs on the ground in France and other Western European Nations that it has in place in the nations of the former Soviet Union and on the African continent.

== Alternate requirement 4: Make a presentation of at least 10 minutes during a Sabbath School program, Pathfinder Club Devotional, to a school assembly or civic club on the same topics. ==
The point of this presentation should be to convince the group to whom you are speaking to participate in a hunger relief program.  It could be that you wish to establish an ongoing &quot;food pantry&quot; in your church, or simply participate in an annual food drive.

== Alternate requirement 4: Create a video tape, slide and sound show, or presentation software production on the same topics and show the production to a Sabbath School group, school assembly or civic club. ==
As in the previous alternate requirement, the aim should be to convince a group of people to act to help relieve hunger.

The most common software for doing this would be Microsoft's Power Point program, but if you do not have access to it, you could instead try ''Impress'', part of the [http://openoffice.org Openffice.org] software suite which is high quality, free software you can download over the Internet.

== 5. Collect at least 50 non-perishable food items for the community food pantry in your local church or the nearest Adventist Community Services center. ==
Many Pathfinder club participate in an annual can drive, often around Halloween.  Typically, the club will donate the collected food items to needy families for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

If your club has never done this, you begin by printing out a map of the territory you wish to cover.  Divide your club into small teams, with at least one adult per team, and assign a territory to each team.  Some clubs go door to door and collect food all in a single day.  Others distribute plastic grocery sacks to each residence and pick them up at a later date (such as the next day or the next week).  If you opt to distribute grocery sacks, it is a good idea to staple a flier to each sack describing what you are doing, including contact information.  This can also be an opportunity to distribute evangelistic literature, such as Steps the Christ.

== 6. Volunteer in a soup kitchen for at least two meals, This can be done as a group project with others in your Pathfinder Club or school.  If there is no Soup Kitchen in your area, prepare and distribute six sack lunches to the needy or homeless. ==
Either one of these is an excellent activity for a Sabbath afternoon.  This activity can certainly  be used to fulfill Outreach requirements found in the AY Class curriculum.

If you choose to help out in a soup kitchen make arrangements ahead of time, letting them know how many helpers you expect to bring.  The only thing your club will need to do is show up and do the work.  

A group of Pathfinders can prepare enough food to feed a group of people three times larger than themselves in less than an hour.  You will need to buy supplies ahead of time, and it's not a bad idea to have the menu approved by the kitchen ahead of time.  A simple sack lunch could consist of the following:

*Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
*Juice box
*Apple, orange, banana, or other fruit
*Cookies, brownies, or other &quot;dessert&quot; item.

If you buy the food at a discount warehouse club (such as Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's, etc.) you should be able to keep the cost close to $1.50 per meal.  You can also talk to a grocery store manager in your neighborhood, and they may be willing to donate the items you need.

As with any off-site Pathfinder activity, ''be sure to bring copies of medical release forms and permission slips for each one of the participants under the age of 18.''

==Notes==
This honor could be earned with little difficulty if it were integrated into the regular autumn programming of a typical Pathfinder Club.  Start by presenting the ''ADRA Presents'' videos to your club. Then have your club prepare and make a presentation to your church in readiness for your annual Can Collecting drive.  Invite your church's ACS coordinator to provide input on this presentation.  After the Can Collecting drive, deliver the food to a local food bank and ask the staff there to talk to the club. Follow that up by making sack lunches for a soup kitchen.  The rest, as they say, will be easy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Form Input ==
One of the most common user interface controls in a web form is a simple, one-line text area.  In this example we have a very simple form with two input fields.  Each input has its own label to the left of the input field.

[[Image:XForms-input.jpg|frame|center]]

== Link to XForms Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/02-controls/01-input/Input-value-styling.xhtml Input Fields]

== Program Structure ==
Our program has two parts, a model and a view.  The model has instance data in it to store the values that the user enters in the form.  The view is part of the presentation in the body of the HTML document.

== Sample Program ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
 xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
 xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XForms inputs with labels&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;data&gt;
               &lt;guru/&gt;
               &lt;PersonSurName/&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Enter your first name, and last name.&lt;/p&gt;
         &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Input First-Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:hint&gt;Also known as given name.&lt;/xf:hint&gt;
         &lt;/xf:input&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;PersonSurName&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:label&gt;Input Last Name:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
            &lt;xf:hint&gt;Also known as sur name or family name.&lt;/xf:hint&gt;
         &lt;/xf:input&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         Output First Name: &lt;b&gt;&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;PersonGivenName&quot;/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
         &lt;br/&gt;
         Output Last Name: &lt;b&gt;&lt;xf:output ref=&quot;PersonSurName&quot;/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note that as you type the model output will be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hints ==

You can also provide the user with data entry hints using the &lt;xf:hint&gt; element.

== Discussion ==
Notice that as you type, the output gets immediately updated.  This is because the XForms input control has an &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;incremental=&quot;true&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

Our model is simple, just the first and last name of a person.

Note that the '''&lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;''' and '''&lt;code&gt;hint&lt;/code&gt;''' tags are nested INSIDE the input tags.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/122.164.13.9|122.164.13.9]] ([[User talk:122.164.13.9|talk]]) to last version by Jens Østergaard Petersen</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
XForms creates a general way to represent a button that will work on web pages and cell phones.  But it is not called &quot;button&quot; as in most other systems.  It is an abstraction or generalization of a button called a &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;trigger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  A trigger is an abstraction of a web button or another event such as a button on a cell phone.  Using a trigger abstraction allows your XForms to be more portable.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-button-hint-hello.jpg|frame|center|A simple XForm button and the resulting message]]

== Sample Program ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
 xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
 xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
 xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;
&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Button Example&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;
             &lt;data/&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;xf:trigger&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Button&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;xf:hint&gt;If you press this you will get a hello world message.&lt;/xf:hint&gt;
          &lt;xf:message level=&quot;modal&quot; ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/xf:message&gt;
      &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
This example has both a label and a hint.  XForms also has help text that can be used but the way help is implemented is implementation specific.

== Styling a Trigger ==
By default each trigger looks like an HTML button.  You can turn this off by setting '''appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:trigger appearance=&quot;minimal&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Save&lt;/xf:label&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Having a Button Trigger Multiple Events =
When you press on a button (trigger) you sometimes want the trigger to do more than a single submission. Whenever you want to do this you can just add an action element and wrap multiple sends in the action:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:trigger&gt;
   &lt;xf:label&gt;Submit&lt;/xf:label&gt;    
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;getTime&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;getTemperature&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:trigger&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

SBJohnny has added a vfd tag on the Future book. It's very new--started just yesterday--and already has lots of entries. These articles are all lengthy, but not overly long; they have links and references where appropriate; they don't have much bias (except for the Matriarchy page); they discuss an important topic that is growing in importance; some of the pages are conceptual about futurology, others about various common predictions, and others are archetypal scenarios. I would like to know the reason for the proposed deletion, and whether everyone else agrees on its being deleted. Thank you. --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 17:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:See below :). The sheer volume of contributions over the past couple days (even with references) makes it prety clear that this wasn't written on wikibooks, but is either a database dump from the author's own material (thus original research), or copied without attribution from another wiki or website. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[Future]] ==

While there is indeed a science and field of futurology, this book is not a textbook about the subject, but rather a group of hypotheses and results, with little or no material that addresses the mechanics of futurology. Most chapters should simply be deleted, some of the material about method could be cleaned up and kept. 

I'm also concerned about the copyright status. The main author is apparently a practicing futurologist, so it may just be his/her own material, but at least some was apparently copied from wikipedia (unattributed), and possibly from future.wikia and futureswiki (also without attribution). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:17, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

: '''Too soon''' I remember the Author just 12 hours ago asking whether or not this book would be allowed here. VFDs require at least a week before they are even requested. I would suggest talking it over with the author and working with him so that the book falls into policy in the mean time. I think as per deletion policy, this VfD should be closed. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::Not in this case, I think. There's no way he had time to write all this in 12 hours, so it's gotta be copied from somewhere. Copyvio is a criteria for speedy deletion. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:23, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

Oh okay, well then I'll just go ahead and add the attributions. That'll be easy... wikipedia and future wikia are both free-content (and I think the futureswiki is also free content, since it's a wiki, if I did have a page based on that place, which I don't think I did). Therefore, it's not anyone's own material. Some of it is mine, which I release to the public domain. --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 17:28, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

: Yo, Yunzhong Hou, please sign your comments when you leave them :-p. It is quite easy, just do &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it will sign automatically. Anyway, future wiki is GFDL. So it should be fine on wikibooks as well. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

I'd also put in that I agree I need to rewrite [[Future/Human Mind Project]] and [[Future/Matriarchy]]. Any other suggestions? --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 17:28, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:(edit conflict) If it's your own stuff, then no problem copyright-wise. If it's from another GFDL source, it needs to be attributed (GFDL is not the same thing as public domain)... I'll leave you instructions on your talk page.
:Keep in mind that posting your own work here doesn't make it public domain either: if it's used somewhere else, the enduser is likewise required to attribute the work to you... what you're releasing is control over the end user's choices. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

&lt;strike&gt;*'''Keep''' - It's too soon unless we have an obvious copyright violation.  I thought we should wait about 7 days before nominating for deletion votes?  It's also possible that he has all of the content on his computer and is copying it over to Wiki - that's what I usually do. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 17:43, 25 November 2006 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;

*'''Comments''' I would like the page I drew the editors attention to on their talk page look at by them - the links are excessive.  I would also like to know why Wikibooks is the recipient of this body of work?  I'll consider my vote. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)


:Well in that case you can always delete the extra links. I'm planning to compile a book about the future, and wikibooks is suited to that goal as no other wikia is. Also note that if you don't like certain parts of the whole, you can just delete them, rather than the entire book. --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 18:31, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:: Though, it really is your job to keep the book in policy. I should add though, this is looking more like a macropedia instead of a book on the subject. One goal of wikibooks is to eventually make a printed book on the subject, so keep that in mind as you make the book. It is still early, so I'm sure you can make it so. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' This book while new and needing time to made suitable for Wikibooks, probably needs someone who knows something about Futurlogy to keep an eye on it, to make sure it doesn't drift astray. In addition to original research, I'm wondering if there might be a possible associated issue with it discussing what may happen in way that might not be suitable for Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:55, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

(edit conflict)

::I guess my point is that wikibooks really isn't appropriate for this book as it stands now. Continuing to add similar materials isn't going to be a productive use of your time, and will in the end only end up requiring administrative time spent deleting later. Ask yourself of each chapter:
::*Is it fiction? (I.e., discussing an event that never happened, and might never happen)? If so, fiction is not permitted.
::*Is it verifiable? If not, it's not permitted.
::Again, there's nothing wrong with having a book about futurology. A discussion of how it employs [[w:Psychohistory]], addresses [[w:Teleology]] or [[w:Free will]], and other information about ''how to '''practice''' futurology'' (either professionally or otherwise) would be totally appropriate, and an interesting read. But that's not what you're doing: most of what you're contributing here are scenarios, without any discussion of the forces bringing about the scenarios... in essence, these are &quot;stubs&quot; for science fiction stories.
::I brought this to vfd rather than tagging them with {{tl|copyvio}} (thank you for adding the citations, by the way!) and {{tl|delete}} because it was quite clear that the tags would be contested, since you clearly feel that they are appropriate. But these chapters really ''aren't'' appropriate, and I rather suspect our hands will be tied on this issue. Before adding more material of this nature, I strongly urge you to bring it up on [http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/textbook-l textbook-l], which is where we discuss things with the wikimedia foundation. Fiction is simply not permitted on wikibooks, and the wikibooks community has absolutely no say on that matter.
::I don't mean to be harsh, and this has nothing to do with the level of respect/esteem/etc. I hold for your work or the field of fututology in general (actually, I spent a few years studying the possibility of teleology in transcendental phenomenology in grad school), it's just that there's no way this material can be kept here, and it's best to nip in the bud.  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:57, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:::*'''Further comment''' I do consider this can be voted on as, though it has only been here 24 hours, the body of work must have been under construction much longer than this.  What we are getting is a cut and paste (and hoping to avoid edit conflicts &lt;g&gt;) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:03, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Just to clarify for darklama: Predicting the future can be done in one of 4 ways (or a combination thereof):
::::# Through statistical analysis of empirical trends ([[w:Moore's law]] is a famous example)
::::# Using techniques developed through [[w:Psychohistory]] (not well known to most people, though similar techniques are applied in interrogation, sales, reverse psychology, etc.... this field essentially just analyzes how humans react to certain stimuli).
::::# Through conjecture and narrative (this is science fiction, which is often quite instructive, but not appropriate on wikibooks)
::::# Through revelation (when God/etc. tells someone what will happen: annotations of revelation (or science fiction, for that matter) would be OK on wikibooks, but if someone wrote a wikibooks on what God revealed to him, we'd probably not want to keep that here.)
::::This book is an example of #3: conjecture. Nothing wrong with it ''per se'', but a wikibook about this method would need to describe '''''how conjectures are made''''', rather than just offering conjectures. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::::: Just offers conjectures was basically what I was thinking about. Was thinking about how in certain forms as you described, it may not be appropriate for Wikibooks and in other forms may be fine. I suspected if Futurlogy were to be acceptable here that it would require careful scrutiny to ensure it remains firmly inside the policies of Wikibooks, which would require both the willingness and patience of the community and those providing contents for the book. I suspected also it might be walking a fine line between acceptable and unacceptable for inclusion here. I kind of wonder what the motivation is behind having it here anyways if it already has a home on [http://future.wikia.com http://future.wikia.com] as [[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] said. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:05, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

&lt;strike&gt;* '''Further Comment''' - I've just been reading part of this book, particularly the parts about the EU, and I'm quite fascinated.  Great work.  It's not fiction but speculation and speculation is the only possible way to talk about the future. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:00, 25 November 2006 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;
**I agree... some of it's very interesting, but that's not the issue. Wikibooks is not for sci-fi. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:25, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

Well, Future Wikia isn't getting much attention, and it's best for a small community rather than a book, and there aren't enough people to make it into a thriving community. As for the conjecture part, sure, I'll be adding '''justifications''' for how individual conjectures are made, and there already is a page for how they are made in general: [[Future/Prediction Methods]]. I'm going to trim down on the scenarios some time. --[[User:Yunzhong Hou|Yunzhong Hou]] 22:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

**I don't think it's sci-fic. It's speculating about the future and it's based on truth. However, I've now taken back my 'keep' vote as I don't see any need in duplicating information on two sites. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:39, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::: I'm neutral towards forks, if a person fels like he wants to spend lots of time making a fork, there is probably a reason. As long as they keep up with the project and it doesn't turn into a stub, then I'm fine. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:05, 26 November 2006 (UTC)


::::'''Comments''' I gave it a quick look over. The scenarios are definitely sci-fi. They're written as if they have happened or are happening and they are clearly fictional in nature. That said, there seems to be significant content regarding the science side. I really wanted to say science-ish side because I'm just kind of skeptical about calling much of it science, but I'm more of a hard nosed evidence based science person and predictions of the future, to me, are generally a bit of a joke. As an example, I can pull out old 50's Popular Mechanics with the stories about how by the 70s there would be a helicopter in every garage (you don't have to be a genius to see how disasterous that would have been had it come true).
::::But honestly, the book, except for the scenarios aspect, appears to be largely grounded in science and predictions based on trends and educated and informed opinions. As for the scenarios, I'm not even thinking there's anything wrong with them, in the context that they're in. They're one section of a book that has a number of other sections, among them, Biology, Politics, Engineering, Informatics, Social, Prediction Methods, Concepts, Uncertainty. I don't think there's anything wrong with a book that says, &quot;okay, here are all these ideas, and here's an example of how it can all be put together.&quot; Even if it's fiction, it's an example of putting the science of futurology into a context to communicate it.
::::Is this a book I would want to read or that I would put any faith into its predictive power? Me personally? No. But do I think it should be deleted? No, not really. Since it was all moved over in a big chunk and we haven't seen how it has developped, it's far too soon to say how the author(s) intend to extend it. It definitely appears to have possibilities as a textbook on futurology (and believe me, I even went to the dictionary because I didn't believe it was a real word, and it is and this book seems to fall right in line with the the definition of the word). So based on that, I'm leaning pretty heavily towards keep unless I see it go completely the way of sci-fi. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:12, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

::&lt;strike&gt;'''Delete'''&lt;/strike&gt; My understanding is that the inventive speculation contained in this book is not allowed by Wikibooks guidelines. It is fictional in nature, and even if it wasn't it would be own research and it lacks NPOV. I have not seen the author acknowledge that the content as it stands is in violation of policy, so it seems unlikely that it will be fixed. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:18, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

:::'''More Comments''' Xixtas, I have to disagree. Look at the [[Future/Prediction_Methods|Prediction Methods]] page, and in particular [[Future/Prediction_Methods#Delphi_Survey_Method|Delphi Survey Methods]] which specifies that a panel of &quot;experts&quot; are queried. Now, I'd want to know more specifically what &quot;experts&quot; means, but I suspect the intention is that experts in a particular field are surveyed about their beliefs on trends in their particular area of expertise. The NPOV policy specifically states, &quot;Consequently, modules should be written from a neutral point of view, which means that modules should represent differing views on a subject fairly...&quot;
:::I'm kind of surprised I'm here defending this book, but the fact is, I think it's no less scientific than stock market predictions and they sell that as a science too. It's predicting trends based on present data and past behavior and that's pretty much what this book is trying to do, except in a larger scope. At least that's my take on it from what I've read of it. I admit the scenario stuff is a bit out there, but as I said before, in the context of being examples of putting together the different components of the subject, I consider it legitimate. Perhaps if they were written in a less story-telling way and more as a practical: &quot;If X and Y happened, then it's conceivable that Z could happen. And if Z happens, blah, blah blah...&quot;
:::I don't buy into any of it. But at the same time, I feel that technically, it falls within the scope of the wikibook guidelines. It might skirt the edges a bit, but I don't think there's anything about it that's a clear violation in intention or in fact. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 05:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
::::'''Comment''' So we would consider a book that discussed how to pick stocks and then went on to extensively predict specific stock futures to be a book we'd keep? While such a book has academic value, the actual act of picking the stocks makes it unsuitable for Wikibooks in my view. The content being discussed here goes way beyond an illustration of a methodology. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:25, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
::::: Well, no. But in this case, the author is still here, and we can ask him to take those parts out and/or modify those parts. It is still only day 2 anyway, and I'm sure he wants to just copy/paste everything over before he starts working on some parts. If this becomes an eternal stub as is, we can delete it. But it is still WAY too early to think about that kind of thing. It isn't even old enough to have a real VfD according to policy. Aka, it shouldn't even be here.

*'''Comment''' --- ''&quot;The public school systems around the world propagate their rather liberal agenda to people ages 4-22. They attempt to teach their children that their parents are &quot;wrong&quot; and that the government is questionable. Spiritualism is stripped from the young open-minded students and is treated like an &quot;extracirrcular hobby.&quot; The propaganda is subtle in Kindergarden and becomes increasingly overt until the students reach the twelfth grade. Teachers of the public school system constantly push their oppressed students into college or university, although some students rather live on welfare or have a blue collar job than graduate from a post-secondary institution.&quot;'' This book is filled with this kind of stuff. This sample and the book as a whole lacks NPOV, is fiction, and includes original research. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:56, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

:::I have only seen the page you indicated and another one focused on China, regarding factual data I don't see any major errors and speculation or inference is a bit different from OR (or what we normally define as OR), that is the declaration of personal or fringe ideas as scientific facts. In fields like politics, economics and sociology we should permit editors to add and build (without anyone exercising editorial control) some inferences and speculations if clearly indicated as such, much like we support when dealing with book annotations that have the same value...
:::So far I don't see any problem that needs to be addressed outside of that specific book community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:28, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

=for comment
This document is in Pod format.  To read this, use a Pod formatter,
like &quot;perldoc perlpod&quot;.

=head1 NAME
X&lt;POD&gt; X&lt;plain old documentation&gt;

perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation
for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl modules.

Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats
like plain text, HTML, man pages, and more.

Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs:
L&lt;ordinary|/&quot;Ordinary Paragraph&quot;&gt;,
L&lt;verbatim|/&quot;Verbatim Paragraph&quot;&gt;, and 
L&lt;command|/&quot;Command Paragraph&quot;&gt;.


=head2 Ordinary Paragraph
X&lt;POD, ordinary paragraph&gt;

Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks
of text, like this one.  You can simply type in your text without
any markup whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and
after.  When it gets formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, 
like being rewrapped, probably put into a proportionally spaced
font, and maybe even justified.

You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for B&lt;bold&gt;,
I&lt;italic&gt;, C&lt;code-style&gt;, L&lt;hyperlinks|perlfaq&gt;, and more.  Such
codes are explained in the &quot;L&lt;Formatting Codes|/&quot;Formatting Codes&quot;&gt;&quot;
section, below.


=head2 Verbatim Paragraph
X&lt;POD, verbatim paragraph&gt; X&lt;verbatim&gt;

Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or
other text which does not require any special parsing or formatting,
and which shouldn't be wrapped.

A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character
be a space or a tab.  (And commonly, all its lines begin with spaces
and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to
be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no special formatting codes,
so you can't italicize or anything like that.  A \ means \, and
nothing else.


=head2 Command Paragraph
X&lt;POD, command&gt;

A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks
of text, usually as headings or parts of lists.

All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long) start
with &quot;=&quot;, followed by an identifier, followed by arbitrary text that
the command can use however it pleases.  Currently recognized commands
are

    =pod
    =head1 Heading Text
    =head2 Heading Text
    =head3 Heading Text
    =head4 Heading Text
    =over indentlevel
    =item stuff
    =back
    =begin format
    =end format
    =for format text...
    =encoding type
    =cut

To explain them each in detail:

=over

=item C&lt;=head1 I&lt;Heading Text&gt;&gt;
X&lt;=head1&gt; X&lt;=head2&gt; X&lt;=head3&gt; X&lt;=head4&gt;
X&lt;head1&gt; X&lt;head2&gt; X&lt;head3&gt; X&lt;head4&gt;

=item C&lt;=head2 I&lt;Heading Text&gt;&gt;

=item C&lt;=head3 I&lt;Heading Text&gt;&gt;

=item C&lt;=head4 I&lt;Heading Text&gt;&gt;

Head1 through head4 produce headings, head1 being the highest
level.  The text in the rest of this paragraph is the content of the
heading.  For example:

  =head2 Object Attributes

The text &quot;Object Attributes&quot; comprises the heading there.  (Note that
head3 and head4 are recent additions, not supported in older Pod
translators.)  The text in these heading commands can use
formatting codes, as seen here:

  =head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;

Such commands are explained in the
&quot;L&lt;Formatting Codes|/&quot;Formatting Codes&quot;&gt;&quot; section, below.

=item C&lt;=over I&lt;indentlevel&gt;&gt;
X&lt;=over&gt; X&lt;=item&gt; X&lt;=back&gt; X&lt;over&gt; X&lt;item&gt; X&lt;back&gt;

=item C&lt;=item I&lt;stuff...&gt;&gt;

=item C&lt;=back&gt;

Item, over, and back require a little more explanation:  &quot;=over&quot; starts
a region specifically for the generation of a list using &quot;=item&quot;
commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs.  At the end
of your list, use &quot;=back&quot; to end it.  The I&lt;indentlevel&gt; option to
&quot;=over&quot; indicates how far over to indent, generally in ems (where
one em is the width of an &quot;M&quot; in the document's base font) or roughly
comparable units; if there is no I&lt;indentlevel&gt; option, it defaults
to four.  (And some formatters may just ignore whatever I&lt;indentlevel&gt;
you provide.)  In the I&lt;stuff&gt; in C&lt;=item I&lt;stuff...&gt;&gt;, you may
use formatting codes, as seen here:

  =item Using C&lt;$|&gt; to Control Buffering

Such commands are explained in the
&quot;L&lt;Formatting Codes|/&quot;Formatting Codes&quot;&gt;&quot; section, below.

Note also that there are some basic rules to using &quot;=over&quot; ...
&quot;=back&quot; regions:

=over

=item *

Don't use &quot;=item&quot;s outside of an &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.

=item *

The first thing after the &quot;=over&quot; command should be an &quot;=item&quot;, unless
there aren't going to be any items at all in this &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot;
region.

=item *

Don't put &quot;=headI&lt;n&gt;&quot; commands inside an &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.

=item *

And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use
&quot;=item *&quot; for all of them, to produce bullets; or use &quot;=item 1.&quot;,
&quot;=item 2.&quot;, etc., to produce numbered lists; or use &quot;=item foo&quot;,
&quot;=item bar&quot;, etc. -- namely, things that look nothing like bullets or
numbers.

If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as
formatters use the first &quot;=item&quot; type to decide how to format the
list.

=back

=item C&lt;=cut&gt;
X&lt;=cut&gt; X&lt;cut&gt;

To end a Pod block, use a blank line,
then a line beginning with &quot;=cut&quot;, and a blank
line after it.  This lets Perl (and the Pod formatter) know that
this is where Perl code is resuming.  (The blank line before the &quot;=cut&quot;
is not technically necessary, but many older Pod processors require it.)

=item C&lt;=pod&gt;
X&lt;=pod&gt; X&lt;pod&gt;

The &quot;=pod&quot; command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it
signals to Perl (and Pod formatters) that a Pod block starts here.  A
Pod block starts with I&lt;any&gt; command paragraph, so a &quot;=pod&quot; command is
usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an ordinary
paragraph or a verbatim paragraph.  For example:

  =item stuff()

  This function does stuff.

  =cut

  sub stuff {
    ...
  }

  =pod

  Remember to check its return value, as in:

    stuff() || die &quot;Couldn't do stuff!&quot;;

  =cut

=item C&lt;=begin I&lt;formatname&gt;&gt;
X&lt;=begin&gt; X&lt;=end&gt; X&lt;=for&gt; X&lt;begin&gt; X&lt;end&gt; X&lt;for&gt;

=item C&lt;=end I&lt;formatname&gt;&gt;

=item C&lt;=for I&lt;formatname&gt; I&lt;text...&gt;&gt;

For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data that
are not generally interpreted as normal Pod text, but are passed
directly to particular formatters, or are otherwise special.  A
formatter that can use that format will use the region, otherwise it
will be completely ignored.

A command &quot;=begin I&lt;formatname&gt;&quot;, some paragraphs, and a
command &quot;=end I&lt;formatname&gt;&quot;, mean that the text/data in between
is meant for formatters that understand the special format
called I&lt;formatname&gt;.  For example,

  =begin html

  &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

  =end html

The command &quot;=for I&lt;formatname&gt; I&lt;text...&gt;&quot;
specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph (starting
right after I&lt;formatname&gt;) is in that special format.  

  =for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

This means the same thing as the above &quot;=begin html&quot; ... &quot;=end html&quot;
region.

That is, with &quot;=for&quot;, you can have only one paragraph's worth
of text (i.e., the text in &quot;=foo targetname text...&quot;), but with
&quot;=begin targetname&quot; ... &quot;=end targetname&quot;, you can have any amount
of stuff inbetween.  (Note that there still must be a blank line
after the &quot;=begin&quot; command and a blank line before the &quot;=end&quot;
command.

Here are some examples of how to use these:

  =begin html

  &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  =end html

  =begin text

    ---------------
    |  foo        |
    |        bar  |
    ---------------

  ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

  =end text

Some format names that formatters currently are known to accept
include &quot;roff&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;latex&quot;, &quot;tex&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;.  (Some
formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)

A format name of &quot;comment&quot; is common for just making notes (presumably
to yourself) that won't appear in any formatted version of the Pod
document:

  =for comment
  Make sure that all the available options are documented!

Some I&lt;formatnames&gt; will require a leading colon (as in
C&lt;&quot;=for :formatname&quot;&gt;, or
C&lt;&quot;=begin :formatname&quot; ... &quot;=end :formatname&quot;&gt;),
to signal that the text is not raw data, but instead I&lt;is&gt; Pod text
(i.e., possibly containing formatting codes) that's just not for
normal formatting (e.g., may not be a normal-use paragraph, but might
be for formatting as a footnote).

=item C&lt;=encoding I&lt;encodingname&gt;&gt;
X&lt;=encoding&gt; X&lt;encoding&gt;

This command is used for declaring the encoding of a document.  Most
users won't need this; but if your encoding isn't US-ASCII or Latin-1,
then put a C&lt;=encoding I&lt;encodingname&gt;&gt; command early in the document so
that pod formatters will know how to decode the document.  For
I&lt;encodingname&gt;, use a name recognized by the L&lt;Encode::Supported&gt;
module.  Examples:

  =encoding utf8

  =encoding koi8-r
  
  =encoding ShiftJIS
  
  =encoding big5

=back

And don't forget, when using any command, that the command lasts up
until the end of its I&lt;paragraph&gt;, not its line.  So in the
examples below, you can see that every command needs the blank
line after it, to end its paragraph.

Some examples of lists include:

  =over

  =item *

  First item

  =item *

  Second item

  =back

  =over

  =item Foo()

  Description of Foo function

  =item Bar()

  Description of Bar function

  =back


=head2 Formatting Codes
X&lt;POD, formatting code&gt; X&lt;formatting code&gt;
X&lt;POD, interior sequence&gt; X&lt;interior sequence&gt;

In ordinary paragraphs and in some command paragraphs, various
formatting codes (a.k.a. &quot;interior sequences&quot;) can be used:

=for comment
 &quot;interior sequences&quot; is such an opaque term.
 Prefer &quot;formatting codes&quot; instead.

=over

=item C&lt;IE&lt;lt&gt;textE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- italic text
X&lt;I&gt; X&lt;&lt; IZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, italic&gt; X&lt;italic&gt;

Used for emphasis (&quot;C&lt;be IE&lt;lt&gt;careful!E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;) and parameters
(&quot;C&lt;redo IE&lt;lt&gt;LABELE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;)

=item C&lt;BE&lt;lt&gt;textE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- bold text
X&lt;B&gt; X&lt;&lt; BZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, bold&gt; X&lt;bold&gt;

Used for switches (&quot;C&lt;perl's BE&lt;lt&gt;-nE&lt;gt&gt; switch&gt;&quot;), programs
(&quot;C&lt;some systems provide a BE&lt;lt&gt;chfnE&lt;gt&gt; for that&gt;&quot;),
emphasis (&quot;C&lt;be BE&lt;lt&gt;careful!E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;), and so on
(&quot;C&lt;and that feature is known as BE&lt;lt&gt;autovivificationE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;).

=item C&lt;CE&lt;lt&gt;codeE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- code text
X&lt;C&gt; X&lt;&lt; CZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, code&gt; X&lt;code&gt;

Renders code in a typewriter font, or gives some other indication that
this represents program text (&quot;C&lt;CE&lt;lt&gt;gmtime($^T)E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;) or some other
form of computerese (&quot;C&lt;CE&lt;lt&gt;drwxr-xr-xE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;).

=item C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;nameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a hyperlink
X&lt;L&gt; X&lt;&lt; LZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, hyperlink&gt; X&lt;hyperlink&gt;

There are various syntaxes, listed below.  In the syntaxes given,
C&lt;text&gt;, C&lt;name&gt;, and C&lt;section&gt; cannot contain the characters
'/' and '|'; and any '&lt;' or '&gt;' should be matched.

=over

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;nameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link to a Perl manual page (e.g., C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;Net::PingE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;).  Note
that C&lt;name&gt; should not contain spaces.  This syntax
is also occasionally used for references to UNIX man pages, as in
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;crontab(5)E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;.

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;name/&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;name/secE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link to a section in other manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;/&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;/secE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link to a section in this manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;/&quot;Object Methods&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=back

A section is started by the named heading or item.  For
example, C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;perlvar/$.E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;perlvar/&quot;$.&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; both
link to the section started by &quot;C&lt;=item $.&gt;&quot; in perlvar.  And
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;perlsyn/For LoopsE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;
both link to the section started by &quot;C&lt;=head2 For Loops&gt;&quot;
in perlsyn.

To control what text is used for display, you
use &quot;C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|...E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;, as in:

=over

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|nameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link this text to that manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;Perl Error Messages|perldiagE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|name/&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|name/secE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link this text to that section in that manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;postfix &quot;if&quot;|perlsyn/&quot;Statement Modifiers&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|/&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|/secE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;
or C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|&quot;sec&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Link this text to that section in this manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;the various attributes|/&quot;Member Data&quot;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=back

Or you can link to a web page:

=over

=item *

C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;scheme:...E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Links to an absolute URL.  For example,
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;http://www.perl.org/E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;.  But note
that there is no corresponding C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;text|scheme:...E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; syntax, for
various reasons.

=back

=item C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;escapeE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a character escape
X&lt;E&gt; X&lt;&lt; EZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, escape&gt; X&lt;escape&gt;

Very similar to HTML/XML C&lt;&amp;I&lt;foo&gt;;&gt; &quot;entity references&quot;:

=over

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;ltE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a literal E&lt;lt&gt; (less than)

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;gtE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a literal E&lt;gt&gt; (greater than)

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;verbarE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a literal | (I&lt;ver&gt;tical I&lt;bar&gt;)

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;solE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; = a literal / (I&lt;sol&gt;idus)

The above four are optional except in other formatting codes,
notably C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;...E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;, and when preceded by a
capital letter.

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;htmlnameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

Some non-numeric HTML entity name, such as C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;eacuteE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;,
meaning the same thing as C&lt;&amp;eacute;&gt; in HTML -- i.e., a lowercase
e with an acute (/-shaped) accent.

=item *

C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;numberE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number.  A
leading &quot;0x&quot; means that I&lt;number&gt; is hex, as in
C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;0x201EE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;.  A leading &quot;0&quot; means that I&lt;number&gt; is octal,
as in C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;075E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;.  Otherwise I&lt;number&gt; is interpreted as being
in decimal, as in C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;181E&lt;gt&gt;&gt;.

Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal or
hex numeric escapes, and that many formatters cannot reliably
render characters above 255.  (Some formatters may even have
to use compromised renderings of Latin-1 characters, like
rendering C&lt;EE&lt;lt&gt;eacuteE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; as just a plain &quot;e&quot;.)

=back

=item C&lt;FE&lt;lt&gt;filenameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- used for filenames
X&lt;F&gt; X&lt;&lt; FZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, filename&gt; X&lt;filename&gt;

Typically displayed in italics.  Example: &quot;C&lt;FE&lt;lt&gt;.cshrcE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&quot;

=item C&lt;SE&lt;lt&gt;textE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- text contains non-breaking spaces
X&lt;S&gt; X&lt;&lt; SZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, non-breaking space&gt; 
X&lt;non-breaking space&gt;

This means that the words in I&lt;text&gt; should not be broken
across lines.  Example: S&lt;C&lt;SE&lt;lt&gt;$x ? $y : $zE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;&gt;.

=item C&lt;XE&lt;lt&gt;topic nameE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- an index entry
X&lt;X&gt; X&lt;&lt; XZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, index entry&gt; X&lt;index entry&gt;

This is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for building
indexes.  It always renders as empty-string.
Example: C&lt;XE&lt;lt&gt;absolutizing relative URLsE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;

=item C&lt;ZE&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;&gt; -- a null (zero-effect) formatting code
X&lt;Z&gt; X&lt;&lt; ZZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, null&gt; X&lt;null&gt;

This is rarely used.  It's one way to get around using an
EE&lt;lt&gt;...E&lt;gt&gt; code sometimes.  For example, instead of
&quot;C&lt;NEE&lt;lt&gt;ltE&lt;gt&gt;3&gt;&quot; (for &quot;NE&lt;lt&gt;3&quot;) you could write
&quot;C&lt;NZE&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;lt&gt;3&gt;&quot; (the &quot;ZE&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;&quot; breaks up the &quot;N&quot; and
the &quot;E&lt;lt&gt;&quot; so they can't be considered
the part of a (fictitious) &quot;NE&lt;lt&gt;...E&lt;gt&gt;&quot; code.

=for comment
 This was formerly explained as a &quot;zero-width character&quot;.  But it in
 most parser models, it parses to nothing at all, as opposed to parsing
 as if it were a E&lt;zwnj&gt; or E&lt;zwj&gt;, which are REAL zero-width characters.
 So &quot;width&quot; and &quot;character&quot; are exactly the wrong words.

=back

Most of the time, you will need only a single set of angle brackets to
delimit the beginning and end of formatting codes.  However,
sometimes you will want to put a real right angle bracket (a
greater-than sign, '&gt;') inside of a formatting code.  This is particularly
common when using a formatting code to provide a different font-type for a
snippet of code.  As with all things in Perl, there is more than
one way to do it.  One way is to simply escape the closing bracket
using an C&lt;E&gt; code:

    C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

This will produce: &quot;C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;&quot;

A more readable, and perhaps more &quot;plain&quot; way is to use an alternate
set of delimiters that doesn't require a single &quot;&gt;&quot; to be escaped.  With
the Pod formatters that are standard starting with perl5.5.660, doubled
angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) may be used I&lt;if and only if there is
whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace right
before the closing delimiter!&gt;  For example, the following will
do the trick:
X&lt;POD, formatting code, escaping with multiple brackets&gt;

    C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;

In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so
long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing
delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
'&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;'
of the closing delimiter.  (The whitespace is ignored.)  So the
following will also work:
X&lt;POD, formatting code, escaping with multiple brackets&gt;

    C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  $a &lt;=&gt; $b     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

And they all mean exactly the same as this:

    C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these bits of
code in C&lt;C&gt; (code) style:

    open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!
    $foo-&gt;bar();

you could do it like so:

    C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $! &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;

which is presumably easier to read than the old way:

    C&lt;open(X, &quot;E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!&gt;
    C&lt;$foo-E&lt;gt&gt;bar();&gt;

This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man (Pod::Man),
and any other pod2xxx or Pod::Xxxx translators that use
Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.

=head2 The Intent
X&lt;POD, intent of&gt;

The intent is simplicity of use, not power of expression.  Paragraphs
look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out
visually, and so that I could run them through C&lt;fmt&gt; easily to reformat
them (that's F7 in my version of B&lt;vi&gt;, or Esc Q in my version of
B&lt;emacs&gt;).  I wanted the translator to always leave the C&lt;'&gt; and C&lt;`&gt; and
C&lt;&quot;&gt; quotes alone, in verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a
working program, shift it over four spaces, and have it print out, er,
verbatim.  And presumably in a monospace font.

The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.  Pod
is just meant to be an idiot-proof common source for nroff, HTML,
TeX, and other markup languages, as used for online
documentation.  Translators exist for B&lt;pod2text&gt;, B&lt;pod2html&gt;,
B&lt;pod2man&gt; (that's for nroff(1) and troff(1)), B&lt;pod2latex&gt;, and
B&lt;pod2fm&gt;.  Various others are available in CPAN.


=head2 Embedding Pods in Perl Modules
X&lt;POD, embedding&gt;

You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.
Start your documentation with an empty line, a &quot;=head1&quot; command at the
beginning, and end it with a &quot;=cut&quot; command and an empty line.  Perl
will ignore the Pod text.  See any of the supplied library modules for
examples.  If you're going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and
you're using an __END__ or __DATA__ cut mark, make sure to put an
empty line there before the first Pod command.

  __END__

  =head1 NAME

  Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time

Without that empty line before the &quot;=head1&quot;, many translators wouldn't
have recognized the &quot;=head1&quot; as starting a Pod block.

=head2 Hints for Writing Pod

=over

=item *
X&lt;podchecker&gt; X&lt;POD, validating&gt;

The B&lt;podchecker&gt; command is provided for checking Pod syntax for errors
and warnings.  For example, it checks for completely blank lines in
Pod blocks and for unknown commands and formatting codes.  You should
still also pass your document through one or more translators and proofread
the result, or print out the result and proofread that.  Some of the
problems found may be bugs in the translators, which you may or may not
wish to work around.

=item *

If you're more familiar with writing in HTML than with writing in Pod, you
can try your hand at writing documentation in simple HTML, and converting
it to Pod with the experimental L&lt;Pod::HTML2Pod|Pod::HTML2Pod&gt; module,
(available in CPAN), and looking at the resulting code.  The experimental
L&lt;Pod::PXML|Pod::PXML&gt; module in CPAN might also be useful.

=item *

Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod
command and after every Pod command (including &quot;=cut&quot;!) to be a blank
line.  Having something like this:

 # - - - - - - - - - - - -
 =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

 This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
 =cut
 sub boom {
 ...

...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see the Pod block
at all.

Instead, have it like this:

 # - - - - - - - - - - - -

 =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

 This noisily detonates the firecracker object.

 =cut

 sub boom {
 ...

=item *

Some older Pod translators require paragraphs (including command
paragraphs like &quot;=head2 Functions&quot;) to be separated by I&lt;completely&gt;
empty lines.  If you have an apparently empty line with some spaces
on it, this might not count as a separator for those translators, and
that could cause odd formatting.

=item *

Older translators might add wording around an LE&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt; link, so that
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;Foo::BarE&lt;gt&gt;&gt; may become &quot;the Foo::Bar manpage&quot;, for example.
So you shouldn't write things like C&lt;the LE&lt;lt&gt;fooE&lt;gt&gt;
documentation&gt;, if you want the translated document to read sensibly
-- instead write C&lt;the LE&lt;lt&gt;Foo::Bar|Foo::BarE&lt;gt&gt; documentation&gt; or
C&lt;LE&lt;lt&gt;the Foo::Bar documentation|Foo::BarE&lt;gt&gt;&gt;, to control how the
link comes out.

=item *

Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block might be ungracefully
wrapped by some formatters.

I propose that this page should be '''deleted''' on the following grounds:

*It is irrelevant to the textbook - there are countless other syntheses which are more important to consider for an undergraduate student (the book's target audience).

*It is intended for domestic, unsupervised creation of an explosive material; one which has been/can be used for terrorist purposes. Such a synthesis is potentially homicidal and/or suicidal and certainly brings the wikibook project into disrepute.

The issue has been discussed on the [[Talk:Organic_Chemistry/Acetone_peroxide_synthesis|Talk page for the article]].

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 13:57, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:This issue has already come up, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to persuade other people in the community to delete this one. We do have a warning template somewhere that can be used to point out the danger of the module, and the sheer stupidity of actually following the instructions. I doubt, however, that we will be able to get this one deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:02, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

:::The previous discussion centered mostly around censorship. People didn't think that wikibooks should exclude information only on the grounds that it poses a clear, immediate threat to anybody who ever reads it. Also, the fact that the article is written from a &quot;do it yourself in your own kitchen while mom and dad are away&quot; perspective, which poses an even greater risk to health and safety, only makes the article more &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot;, and therefore mandated that it be kept here on wikibooks. The previous discussion is likely somewhere in the archives, i'll try to dig up the link. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:46, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

OK, I've read the previous discussion. It's [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Chemical synthesis/Acetone peroxide|here]].

I'd like to bring some new facts to the debate:

The synthesis is '''not''' part of any undergraduate course I am aware of, and it is '''not''' part of any undergraduate textbook I am aware of. I have checked, but there is always a chance that I am wrong. I await contradiction, but I would be surpised: I have studied and taught chemistry (at the level this wikibook is aimed towards) since 1985. I checked books with literally hundreds of syntheses, and those books implicitly rate those many syntheses as more important than the synthesis of acetone peroxide.

The chemical concerned, and the methods involved in its preparation, have '''zero educational value'''. In fact, apart from its use in improvised explosive devices, the chemical has no value whatsoever. Again, I have checked, but there is always a chance that I am wrong. I await contradiction. Contrast this with 'Mathematics'; Yes, you can use maths to engineer nuclear weapons ''but you can also use maths for other purposes''.

If wikibooks contributors wanted to alert the authorities about the availability of recipes for explosives, instead of writing a working method they could include a spoof method which claimed to be correct. It would make the same point at no risk.

I would classify this article alongside '''pornography''', and treat it accordingly. Why does anyone ''need'' to know how to make this chemical? Why would anyone ''need'' to view porn? I would not include porn where it could be accessed inadvertently. Likewise this synthesis.

This article should be '''deleted'''. Perhaps we should have a book clearly marked for lethally dangerous activities which people can access if they want, but with no risk that they read the article without being warned of its content first. This synthesis would find a place there.

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 16:08, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

* I '''agree''' with Whiteknight and Ewen. This module is not necessary neither for the Organic Chemistry book nor for anyone studying chemistry and may serve criminal purposes. I think that in such situations we should choose te safest solution and remove the content that is doubtful. I don't agree that Wikibooks is a place where the freedom of speech is the most important principal. Where everything is allowed, chaos occurs, and I believe that quality, not quantity, is the thing we should take as our target. People in Commons are in similar situation: there are many graphics that have unclear copyrights. Decision in all cases is the same: such images are removed from Commons. I don't see any reason why we should behave different. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

: '''Comment''' If indeed the book holds no educational value, and is dangerous (I know nothing about chemestry myself...) then I feel it should be removed. I don't like the idea of spreading dangerous &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; tutorials, especially on a wiki. A smart vandal can cause great danger to the reader, more than usual. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:06, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Last time sockpuppets and Wikipedia users came over to cast their opinions on how to run our project and surprise, surprise, those users have done nothing here since those votes. Let's actually delete this thing now. The arguments for deleting it are not new and the reason it failed last time was because one user made a huge argument out of it. Time to use consensus and not 100% acceptance to get this done if it happens again. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
*: Last time, arguments for non-censorship were put forth and not countered. Some users offering their views were indeed new to the project but views aren't votes (and consensus isn't a vote) and arguements against censorship weren't refuted.
*: At least one of the Wikipedia users stayed on Wikibooks (more active here than there). Consensus is only reached after the debate is over. If arguments haven't been countered, the debate isn't over.
*: Withinfocus, even  a mere hint of an acusation of sockpuppetry weighs heavily on me. I'd like a formal apology. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
**:Arguments for non-censorship were significantly refuted and I think it was more of an issue of arguing just to argue about rights more than keeping the actual content alive. Seeing this page in its present state seems to push even more that the article is hurting the progress of the book and some of the book's own editors are bothered by it. Is its presence here truly helping the book and project as a whole? '''All''' of the votes I marked as being too new to be true opinions of members of the Wikibooks project have done no editing since that voting period; they were quick swoops into Wikibooks and I don't think that's fair to the project. Having some activity here and at least understanding productive book-writing are in my opinion essential to be a fully-weighted voter here, even though you pulled out the rule-book to cite that no explicit rules existed to stop their swoops. I decided to stop being part of that discussion because it would have continued on and on. A single user with continual follow-ups shouldn't block a decision. You are not the one accused of sockpuppetry, it is the four users I mentioned earlier, and so an apology will not be given, and I'm not really sure what formal would even mean in an online wiki. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;'''Clarification''' -- my vote is neutral... I gave my arguments for keeping last time, but will concede the point join any consensus.&lt;/s&gt; (see below...) --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

*:'''Delete''' - As a contributor to this book, I think this synthesis has no business being in the book. It's an organic chemistry textbook, not an organic synthesis textbook, let alone an explosives synthesis textbook. If someone wants to write a book on the synthesis of explosives, I have no opposition to that, but I think having that single synthesis in the book is out of place, it detracts from the legitimacy of the text by making it seem more like an Anarchists Cookbook kind of text, and to be honest, if remains attached to the organic chemistry textbook, I'm going to have to stop contributing. I don't mean that as any sort of threat, since it has little weight based on how new I am. It's simply that I don't want to be associated with a text like that. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 19:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

Swift proposes keeping this page because to delete it from 'Organic chemistry' would be censorship. (Do correct me if I'm misrepresenting you, Swift...)
Whether removing the page from this book is censorship or not, its removal is a very good idea because:
#The article is available elsewhere, so its removal from this place does not cause a loss of information.
#The context of the 'Organic chemistry' textbook creates the possibility that people will come across the article and believe it to be a useful and important part of their organic chemistry education. Some younger readers may even attempt the synthesis because they are young and irresponsible. (NB I don't assume that all youngsters are irresponsible, or that everyone older is 'mature' in their behaviour, but legally there are ages which are taken as the threshhold of responsibility, and this text is aimed at students who may be below that age.) Accessing this material could in some companies, colleges and universities prove to be such a serious breach of IT policy that users are dismissed, when in fact they accessed the material in good faith. Some nefarious users may defend their possession of this method on the grounds that it was included in an otherwise innocent book, when in fact they intend to use it to murder.
#Teachers will find it impossible to recommend this otherwise-valuable resource if it contains this page.

So, if removing this article is censorship, then censorship is a good idea. Call it what you want, it doesn't matter. Please delete this article from 'Organic chemistry'. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:29, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

(BTW: Swift, your previous vote is no longer included ;-) Are you still in favour of keeping the Acetone peroxide synthesis as part of 'Organic chemistry' ''and'' 'Chemical synthesis' or would you accept it as part of 'Chemical synthesis' alone?) [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:32, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

: OK, it seems you aren't so much wanting the page deleted from Wikibooks as you want it out of [[Organic Chemistry]]. If this is the case, I'll gladly '''move''' it to [[Chemical synthesis]] as previously suggested.
: If not, my vote is '''strong keep''' which I'll elaborate on if needed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:05, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

:: Are we agreed then? Delete Organic chemistry/Acetone peroxide synthesis and keep Chemical synthesis/Acetone peroxide synthesis? I'd be happy for that to happen. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 22:48, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

::: Yes, but give me time to merge the two into the CS book. I'll get it done in the next few days. Just remove links to the page from OC and this will be over in a few days if no-one objects. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
:::: '''Comment:''' Ewen has started editing on the CS book and I've stayed back to avoid what I think would only result in conflict. I don't think there is any hurry. I'm going to wait till Ewen and I sort out our differences or he backs away from the relevant book pages.
:::: '''Do not delete before then.''' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:45, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Once you complete this action (if no one objects), then we should start another VfD for the entire Chemical Synthesis book since it seems many users voting here are worried about its content. Another censorship argument might explode, but with a single user pushing that topic a consensus to delete might still be achieved past that single user. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::This is going to open the flood gates, but perhaps some outside &quot;official&quot; opinion from the Wikimedia bigwigs needs to address this. I believe that such books violate public responsibility and I would think some sort of legal response is needed. Housing books that can show how to make bombs could jeopardize the whole project. Since there might be more that one strong proponent for non-censorship (even though I think that can be a misleading term) based on this comment, I wouldn't want to go forward with the VfD until a policy is created or a consultation takes place. I assumed a VfD would succeed with a single dissenter but if you and others climb on this could last way too long. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:57, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::I'll throw my $0.02 into this. I'd probably vote against a delete. First of all, there are so many web sites and documents on eMule on how to synthesize just about anything that really, this is all pretty easy to obtain information. Anyone who wants to make a bomb is going to easily find out how. It's as simple as that. You don't need to be a chemist, you don't need to have fancy equipment or hard to get materials. Most homes have all the necessary ingredients lying around to make at least a moderately powerful bomb. So, I have no problem with there being a wikibook that contain that.
::::::That said, I would expect a book called Chemical Synthesis to have a lot more than just explosives. If that's all you want to have in it, then call it what it is: Chemistry of Explosives. I'm just a firm believer in &quot;truth in advertising&quot; and that you should call a spade a spade. But I have no moral objections to it. I've had the know how and the ability to make drugs, explosives, and so forth, since I was in high school, back when doing that kind of stuff interested me. But the fact is, 99% of the readers, like me, aren't going to have the motivation to actually do it, because a lot of them are a lot of work to do right. Of that 1% that do, about 60% are going to go blow up a tree trunk or something. 35% are going to blow themselves up (and that's okay, because that's what evolution is all about), and maybe 5% will actually do something bad with it, but if they didn't get the info from this book, they'd get it somewhere else, because clearly they're motivated. Anyway, that's my $0.02. I'd vote to keep it. Hell, I'll probably read through it, just out of curiousity, and to be honest, for an organic chemist, there's good techniques to be learned that are applicable to other stuff. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::Just wanted to add one more note. I'm setting up a lab in a work room behind my garage. The #1 concern I have is making sure I don't blow up the work room and garage by accident. One of the primary chemicals involved in explosives is Nitric Acid. Nitric acid is also used in a great number of perfectly legitimate organic chemistry. In fact, it's practically a must-have. My biggest concern is making my lab safe for nitric acid so I don't blow the place up. So really, anyone who can get their hands on it, can make explosives by accident. The advantage of a book with this information is that it's going to have a lot of safety tips for dealing with Nitric Acid, or at least, I assume it will. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:33, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::There is a difference between deleting a single errant page, and an entire book, especially if the deletions are performed in a policy grey-area. But don't misunderstand me, i'm neither pro nor contra censorship (at least not noticably). The issue of censorship therefore is not important to me whatsoever. What is important to me, however, is the wikibooks project. I would like to see a few things: (a) the wikibooks project is safe, secure, and stable, (b) the members here are happy (and by extension, prolific), (c) the materials we produce are high quality, or are improving in quality. Deleting the page from the [[Organic Chemistry]] book certainly helps with point (c), by making the [[Organic Chemistry]] book higher quality. However, deleting the [[Chemical Synthesis]] will hurt point (b) without necessarily helping either of the other points, and I see that as a net loss for the project. Now, if the [[Chemical Synthesis]] book was against policy, or it posed a distinct threat to the project (legal threat, etc), the importance of maintaining point (a) would trump the hurt feelings of point (b). Until I know that the book poses such a threat, however, i won't vote to delete it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::::So what is the proper direction to take this then? Does anyone know of who to contact regarding the legalities of this situation? I think being appropriate overrules being happy, and if my book had inappropriate areas that I personally enjoyed I would still remove them because their presence is controversial. Like Derbeth said, I wouldn't use Wikibooks as a platform for free speech because I think high-quality, appropriate book-writing is the real goal. Chemical synthesis seems to be there for controversy and fun, not so much being a good book. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:06, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::::: &quot;''Chemical synthesis seems to be there for controversy and fun''&quot;. Withinfocus, this is precisely why we have [[WB:AGF]]. You make an assumption based on prejudice, not on knowledge, and make no attempt to approach the &quot;other side&quot; and understand their viewpoint. This, not the content, is what makes the discussion so heated and difficult to solve. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::Please, please do not continue to tell '''me''' what '''I''' am saying. I and any other user here are entitled to opinions, and besides that an opinion was stated I do believe it to have a strong basis here. [[WB:AGF]], although not an actual policy or guideline, is about intentions and I see those intentions as malicious. The book is in quite a poor state which is understandable and I would fully support its quality improvement, but the book is almost entirely based on making extremely dangerous chemicals and has not changed in some time to refute that association. I '''know''' that there is a large percentage of the main page covered in bright red warning type and almost every page has a huge disclaimer on it. The &quot;other&quot; viewpoint was established several months ago and I stopped being a part of that discussion, yet I see little to no positive improvement for making this a book about overall chemical synthesis and less about explosive chemical synthesis. When a work is in jeopardy, I would want it tended to by those who support it. The conversation switched to discussing the legal issues with housing this content, yet you are pulling it back and thus I will not make further response on that front and will only discuss what I intended to. Wikimedia legal people can officially decide if the book can be housed here, labeled as controversial or not. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:56, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' &quot;Censorship&quot;? Really now, it's GPL information. If you want to copy it and put it somewhere else to &quot;save it,&quot; by all means, do so. I don't think the reason we should delete it is ''because explosives are bad''. I think whether we want explosive-making instructions on this site is another question entirely. The reason we should delete this is because synthesizing explosives isn't that relevant to organic chemistry. Really, have you ever gone to an organic chemistry course and have your professor show you that? Organic chemistry is centrally about the chemistry of living things - that involved within biological creatures. Organic chemistry is not about learning ways to 'bring down the man.' If you want this knowledge to spread, go ahead and copy it. But it doesn't belong over here in this book, because outside of the 'chemistry' word, it really has nothing to do with the textbook's subject.

In other words, it's not being censored, so stop whining. You have every right to share this knowledge. You just don't have the right to force others to cram this knowledge in a place it doesn't belong, just because you want more people to see it. Censorship is when the flow of an idea is prevented. I could care less whether this idea goes around or not, but it's not the job of an organic chemistry to teach people how to build explosives. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 19:16, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Hold''' -- consider my vote '''keep''' until this is sorted out. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:27, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Information''' - Swift has moved this controversial page to Chemical Synthesis, where I believe it belongs and it is now out of the Organic Chemistry textbook. My concern was largely with the quality of the Organic Chemistry textbook and so I am happy.
:Whiteknight and others have a more general concern about the quality of wikibooks in general and I too share that concern. Swift has made clear (though possibly not here, but I have read some comments from him in various places), that the Chemical Syntehsis book is intended to contain a lot more entries than simply the explosives currently contained. His reasoning for the existing synthesis examples, to my understanding (Swift, correct me if I'm wrong), is that these pages were removed from Wikipedia. I am personally satisfied by this explanation and I don't think any timetable need be enforced on how soon non-explosives entries need to be added to the Chemical Synthesis text.
:I hope to get involved in that text at some point and it's unlikely that any of the synthesis examples I give will have anything to do with explosives. But I don't expect to get to it until possibly mid-2007 as I have my hands full with the organic chemistry textbook. But I am satisfied that the synthesis book can serve as more than an anarchist cookbook and be a serious, valuable source. Just, like many other books here, it will require a lot of work. If there's a separate vote to delete that book, I will likely vote against deletion unless I see a compelling argument for deletion and, at this point, I haven't seen such an argument. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 19:48, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

:: &quot;''correct me if I'm wrong ... these pages were removed from Wikipedia.''&quot; Partly, as some were already here.
:: Those that I found here were of the anarchist-cookbook-type. It didn't bother me since I know well from Wikipedia that content doesn't get added by importance, but interest and excitment (think [[w:Jenna Jameson]] vs. [[w:Andrew Wiles]] -- guess which has the longer article).
:: Those copied from Wikipedia were done so because, in effect being instruction manuals, they lay [[w:WP:WIW#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|outside the scope of the project]]. My involvement came through the [[w:Nitroglycerin]] article where it was deceided the content should be moved elsewhere. I found a collection of controversial syntheses and moved all of them here (the respective WP articles link to us via the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{wikibooks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template). I would not be the least bit surprised if Wikipedia still had other synthases which no-one has bothered over, just as the countless food and drink recipes go unnoticed (I've recently alerted the WP Cocktail project of WB as they had a lot of these). It would certainly be a good idea to browse Wikipedia and see if it has content that belongs in the [[Chemical synthesis]] book, but I haven't gotten around to that. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 11:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

I have edited the Organic Chemistry and Chemical Synthesis versions of the recipes to (a) replace domestic chemicals with lab chemicals and (b) reduce quantities to give safer yields. I'll not be editing these any more so if Swift wants to get on with merging the Acetone Peroxide synthesis to make one article under Chemical synthesis then please do... [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 13:26, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

* It would ''appear'' to me that this one has been resolved as a keep/merge decision.  I suggest if there are no other views expressed in the next 5 days it is closed as such --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:12, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

I have merged the content of [[Organic Chemistry/Acetone peroxide synthesis]] with [[Chemical synthesis/Acetone peroxide]]. Can the 'Organic Chemistry' version now be deleted and the 'Chemical synthesis' one kept? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

This document is in Pod format.  To read this, use a Pod formatter,
like &quot;perldoc perlpod&quot;.
--&gt;

== NAME ==
 
perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format
 
== DESCRIPTION ==
 
Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation
for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl modules.
 
Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats
like plain text, HTML, man pages, and more.
 
Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs:
* [[ordinary|Ordinary Paragraph]]
* [[verbatim|Verbatim Paragraph]], and 
* [[command|Command Paragraph]].
 
 
=== Ordinary Paragraph ===
 
Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of text, like this one.  You can simply type in your text without any markup whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after.  When it gets formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped, probably put into a proportionally spaced font, and maybe even justified.
 
You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for '''bold''', ''italic'', &lt;code&gt;code-style&lt;/code&gt;, [[perlfaq|hyperlinks]], and more.  Such codes are explained in the [[Formatting Codes]] section, below.

=== Verbatim Paragraph ===
 
Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or
other text which does not require any special parsing or formatting,
and which shouldn't be wrapped.
 
A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character
be a space or a tab.  (And commonly, all its lines begin with spaces
and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to
be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no special formatting codes,
so you can't italicize or anything like that.  A \ means \, and
nothing else.
 
 
=== Command Paragraph ===
 
A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks of text, usually as headings or parts of lists.

All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long) start with &quot;=&quot;, followed by an identifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can use however it pleases.  Currently recognized commands are

    =pod
    =head1 Heading Text
    =head2 Heading Text
    =head3 Heading Text
    =head4 Heading Text
    =over indentlevel
    =item stuff
    =back
    =begin format
    =end format
    =for format text...
    =encoding type
    =cut

To explain them each in detail:
 
: &lt;code&gt;=head1 Heading Text&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;=head2 Heading Text&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;=head3 Heading Text&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;=head4 Heading Text&lt;/code&gt;

Head1 through head4 produce headings, head1 being the highest
level.  The text in the rest of this paragraph is the content of the
heading.  For example:

: &lt;code&gt;=head2 Object Attributes&lt;/code&gt; 
The text &quot;Object Attributes&quot; comprises the heading there.  (Note that head3 and head4 are recent additions, not supported in older Pod translators.)  The text in these heading commands can use formatting codes, as seen here:

: &lt;code&gt;=head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Such commands are explained in the [[Formatting Codes|Formatting Codes]] section, below.
 
: &lt;code&gt;=over indentlevel&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;=item stuff...&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;=back&lt;/code&gt;
 
Item, over, and back require a little more explanation:  &quot;=over&quot; starts a region specifically for the generation of a list using &quot;=item&quot; commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs.  At the end of your list, use &quot;=back&quot; to end it.  The I&lt;indentlevel&gt; option to &quot;=over&quot; indicates how far over to indent,  generally in ems (where one em is the width of an &quot;M&quot; in the document's base font) or roughly comparable units; if there is no I&lt;indentlevel&gt; option, it defaults to four.  (And some formatters may just ignore whatever &lt;indentlevel&gt; you provide.)  In the I&lt;stuff&gt; in C&lt;=item I&lt;stuff...&gt;&gt;, you may use formatting codes, as seen here:

: &lt;code&gt;=item Using $|&lt;/code&gt; to Control Buffering
 
Such commands are explained in the
&quot;L&lt;Formatting Codes|/&quot;Formatting Codes&quot;&gt;&quot; section, below.
 
Note also that there are some basic rules to using &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; regions:
 
:* Don't use &quot;=item&quot;s outside of an &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.
:* The first thing after the &quot;=over&quot; command should be an &quot;=item&quot;, unless there aren't going to be any items at all in this &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.
:* Don't put &quot;=headI&lt;n&gt;&quot; commands inside an &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.
:* And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use &quot;=item *&quot; for all of them, to produce bullets; or use &quot;=item 1.&quot;, &quot;=item 2.&quot;, etc., to produce numbered lists; or use &quot;=item foo&quot;, &quot;=item bar&quot;, etc. -- namely, things that look nothing like bullets or numbers.

:If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as formatters use the first &quot;=item&quot; type to decide how to format the list.
 
: &lt;code&gt;=cut&lt;/code&gt;
 
To end a Pod block, use a blank line, then a line beginning with &quot;=cut&quot;, and a blank line after it.  This lets Perl (and the Pod formatter) know that this is where Perl code is resuming.  (The blank line before the &quot;=cut&quot;
is not technically necessary, but many older Pod processors require it.)

: &lt;code&gt;=pod&lt;/code&gt;
 
The &quot;=pod&quot; command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it signals to Perl (and Pod formatters) that a Pod block starts here.  A Pod block starts with I&lt;any&gt; command paragraph, so a &quot;=pod&quot; command is usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an ordinary paragraph or a verbatim paragraph.  For example:
 
  =item stuff()
 
  This function does stuff.
 
  =cut
 
  sub stuff {
    ...
  }
 
  =pod
 
  Remember to check its return value, as in:
 
    stuff() || die &quot;Couldn't do stuff!&quot;;
 
  =cut
 
* &lt;code&gt;=begin formatname&lt;/code&gt;
 
* &lt;code&gt;=end formatname&lt;/code&gt;
 
* &lt;code&gt;=for formatname text...&lt;/code&gt;
 
For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data that are not generally interpreted as normal Pod text, but are passed  directly to particular formatters, or are otherwise special.  A formatter that can use that format will use the region, otherwise it will be completely ignored.
 
A command &quot;=begin I&lt;formatname&gt;&quot;, some paragraphs, and a command &quot;=end I&lt;formatname&gt;&quot;, mean that the text/data in between is meant for formatters that understand the special format called I&lt;formatname&gt;.  For example,
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
  =begin html
 
  &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;
 
  =end html
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The command &quot;=for I&lt;formatname&gt; I&lt;text...&gt;&quot; specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph (starting 
right after I&lt;formatname&gt;) is in that special format.
 
  =for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;
 
This means the same thing as the above &quot;=begin html&quot; ... &quot;=end html&quot; region.
 
That is, with &quot;=for&quot;, you can have only one paragraph's worth of text (i.e., the text in &quot;=foo targetname text...&quot;), but with &quot;=begin targetname&quot; ... &quot;=end targetname&quot;, you can have any amount of stuff inbetween.  (Note that there still must be a blank line after the &quot;=begin&quot; command and a blank line before the &quot;=end&quot;
command.
 
Here are some examples of how to use these:
 
  =begin html
 
  &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
  =end html
 
  =begin text
 
    ---------------
    |  foo        |
    |        bar  |
    ---------------
 
  ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^
 
  =end text
 
Some format names that formatters currently are known to accept include &quot;roff&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;latex&quot;, &quot;tex&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;.  (Some formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)
 
A format name of &quot;comment&quot; is common for just making notes (presumably to yourself) that won't appear in any formatted version of the Pod document:
 
  =for comment
  Make sure that all the available options are documented!
 
Some I&lt;formatnames&gt; will require a leading colon (as in C&lt;&quot;=for :formatname&quot;&gt;, or C&lt;&quot;=begin :formatname&quot; ... &quot;=end :formatname&quot;&gt;), to signal that the text is not raw data, but instead I&lt;is&gt; Pod text (i.e., possibly containing formatting codes) that's just not for normal formatting (e.g., may not be a normal-use paragraph, but might be for formatting as a footnote).
 
* &lt;code&gt;=encoding encodingname&lt;/code&gt;
 
This command is used for declaring the encoding of a document.  Most users won't need this; but if your encoding isn't US-ASCII or Latin-1, then put a C&lt;=encoding I&lt;encodingname&gt;&gt; command early in the document so
that pod formatters will know how to decode the document.  For I&lt;encodingname&gt;, use a name recognized by the L&lt;Encode::Supported&gt; module.  Examples:
 
  =encoding utf8
 
  =encoding koi8-r
 
  =encoding ShiftJIS
 
  =encoding big5
 
 
And don't forget, when using any command, that the command lasts up until the end of its I&lt;paragraph&gt;, not its line.  So in the examples below, you can see that every command needs the blank line after it, to end its paragraph. Some examples of lists include:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt; 
  =over 
  =item * 
  First item 
  =item * 
  Second item 
  =back 
  =over 
  =item Foo() 
  Description of Foo function 
  =item Bar() 
  Description of Bar function 
  =back
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Formatting Codes ===
 
In ordinary paragraphs and in some command paragraphs, various
formatting codes (a.k.a. &quot;interior sequences&quot;) can be used:
 
&lt;!-- &quot;interior sequences&quot; is such an opaque term. Prefer &quot;formatting codes&quot; instead. --&gt;
 
; I&lt;text&gt;
: italic text
: Used for emphasis (&quot;C&lt;be I&lt;careful!&gt;&gt;&quot;) and parameters (&quot;C&lt;redo I&lt;LABELE&gt;&gt;&quot;)
 
; B&lt;text&gt;
: bold text
: Used for switches (&quot;C&lt;perl's B&lt;-n&gt; switch&gt;&quot;), programs (&quot;C&lt;some systems provide a B&lt;chfn&gt; for that&gt;&quot;), emphasis (&quot;C&lt;be B&lt;careful!&gt;&gt;&quot;), and so on (&quot;C&lt;and that feature is known as B&lt;autovivification&gt;&gt;&quot;).
 
; &lt;nowiki&gt;C&lt;code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: code text
: Renders code in a typewriter font, or gives some other indication that this represents program text &lt;code&gt;&quot;C&lt;gmtime($^T)&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or some other form of computerese &lt;code&gt;&quot;C&lt;drwxr-xr-x&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
 
; L&lt;name&gt;
: a hyperlink
: There are various syntaxes, listed below. In the syntaxes ''given'', ''text'', ''name'', and section cannot contain the characters '/' and '|'; and any '&lt;' or '&gt;' should be matched.
 
:*; L&lt;name&gt;
: Link to a Perl manual page (e.g., L&lt;Net::Ping&gt;). Note that name should not contain spaces. This syntax is also occasionally used for references to UNIX man pages
: E.g &lt;code&gt;L&lt;crontab(5)&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;
:*; L&lt;name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt; or L&lt;name/sec&gt;
: Link to a section in other manual page.
:: E.g. &lt;code&gt;L&lt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:: L&lt;/&quot;sec&quot;&gt; or L&lt;/sec&gt; or L&lt;&quot;sec&quot;&gt;
: Link to a section in this manual page.  E.g.,
:: L&lt;/&quot;Object Methods&quot;&gt;

A section is started by the named heading or item.  For example, C&lt;L&lt;perlvar/$.&gt;&gt; or C&lt;L&lt;perlvar/&quot;$.&quot;&gt;&gt; both link to the section started by &quot;C&lt;=item $.&gt;&quot; in perlvar.  And C&lt;L&lt;perlsyn/For Loops&gt;&gt; or C&lt;L&lt;perlsyn/&quot;For Loops&quot;&gt;&gt; both link to the section started by &quot;C&lt;=head2 For Loops&gt;&quot; in perlsyn.
 
To control what text is used for display, you use &quot;C&lt;L&lt;text|...&gt;&gt;&quot;, as in:
 
* L&lt;text|name&gt;
 
Link this text to that manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;L&lt;Perl Error Messages|perldiag&gt;&gt;
 
=item *
 
C&lt;L&lt;text|name/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&gt; or C&lt;L&lt;text|name/sec&gt;&gt;
 
Link this text to that section in that manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;L&lt;postfix &quot;if&quot;|perlsyn/&quot;Statement Modifiers&quot;&gt;&gt;
 
=item *
 
C&lt;L&lt;text|/&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&gt; or C&lt;L&lt;text|/sec&gt;&gt;
or C&lt;L&lt;text|&quot;sec&quot;&gt;&gt;
 
Link this text to that section in this manual page.  E.g.,
C&lt;L&lt;the various attributes|/&quot;Member Data&quot;&gt;&gt;
 
=back
 
Or you can link to a web page:
 
=over
 
=item *
 
C&lt;L&lt;scheme:...&gt;&gt;
 
Links to an absolute URL.  For example,
C&lt;L&lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;&gt;.  But note
that there is no corresponding C&lt;L&lt;text|scheme:...&gt;&gt; syntax, for
various reasons.
 
=back
 
=item C&lt;E&lt;escape&gt;&gt; -- a character escape
X&lt;E&gt; X&lt;&lt; EZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, escape&gt; X&lt;escape&gt;
 
Very similar to HTML/XML C&lt;&amp;I&lt;foo&gt;;&gt; &quot;entity references&quot;:
 
=over
 
=item *

=item *
 
C&lt;E&lt;sol&gt;&gt; = a literal / (I&lt;sol&gt;idus)
 
The above four are optional except in other formatting codes,
notably C&lt;L&lt;...&gt;&gt;, and when preceded by a
capital letter.
 
=item *
 
C&lt;E&lt;htmlname&gt;&gt;
 
Some non-numeric HTML entity name, such as C&lt;E&lt;eacute&gt;&gt;,
meaning the same thing as C&lt;&amp;eacute;&gt; in HTML -- i.e., a lowercase
e with an acute (/-shaped) accent.
 
=item *
 
C&lt;E&lt;number&gt;&gt;
 
The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number.  A
leading &quot;0x&quot; means that I&lt;number&gt; is hex, as in
C&lt;E&lt;0x201E&gt;&gt;.  A leading &quot;0&quot; means that I&lt;number&gt; is octal,
as in C&lt;E&lt;075&gt;&gt;.  Otherwise I&lt;number&gt; is interpreted as being
in decimal, as in C&lt;E&lt;181&gt;&gt;.
 
Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal or
hex numeric escapes, and that many formatters cannot reliably
render characters above 255.  (Some formatters may even have
to use compromised renderings of Latin-1 characters, like
rendering C&lt;E&lt;eacute&gt;&gt; as just a plain &quot;e&quot;.)
 
=back
 
=item C&lt;F&lt;filename&gt;&gt; -- used for filenames
X&lt;F&gt; X&lt;&lt; FZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, filename&gt; X&lt;filename&gt;
 
Typically displayed in italics.  Example: &quot;C&lt;F&lt;.cshrc&gt;&gt;&quot;
 
=item C&lt;S&lt;text&gt;&gt; -- text contains non-breaking spaces
X&lt;S&gt; X&lt;&lt; SZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, non-breaking space&gt; 
X&lt;non-breaking space&gt;
 
This means that the words in I&lt;text&gt; should not be broken
across lines.  Example: S&lt;C&lt;S&lt;$x ? $y : $z&gt;&gt;&gt;.
 
=item C&lt;X&lt;topic name&gt;&gt; -- an index entry
X&lt;X&gt; X&lt;&lt; XZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, index entry&gt; X&lt;index entry&gt;
 
This is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for building
indexes.  It always renders as empty-string.
Example: C&lt;X&lt;absolutizing relative URLs&gt;&gt;
 
=item C&lt;Z&lt;&gt;&gt; -- a null (zero-effect) formatting code
X&lt;Z&gt; X&lt;&lt; ZZ&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; X&lt;POD, formatting code, null&gt; X&lt;null&gt;
 
This is rarely used.  It's one way to get around using an
E&lt;...&gt; code sometimes.  For example, instead of
&quot;C&lt;N&lt;3&gt;&quot; (for &quot;N&lt;3&quot;) you could write
&quot;C&lt;NZ&lt;&gt;&lt;3&gt;&quot; (the &quot;Z&lt;&gt;&quot; breaks up the &quot;N&quot; and
the &quot;&lt;&quot; so they can't be considered
the part of a (fictitious) &quot;N&lt;...&gt;&quot; code.
 
=for comment
 This was formerly explained as a &quot;zero-width character&quot;.  But it in
 most parser models, it parses to nothing at all, as opposed to parsing
 as if it were a E&lt;zwnj&gt; or E&lt;zwj&gt;, which are REAL zero-width characters.
 So &quot;width&quot; and &quot;character&quot; are exactly the wrong words.
 
=back
 
Most of the time, you will need only a single set of angle brackets to
delimit the beginning and end of formatting codes.  However,
sometimes you will want to put a real right angle bracket (a
greater-than sign, '&gt;') inside of a formatting code.  This is particularly
common when using a formatting code to provide a different font-type for a
snippet of code.  As with all things in Perl, there is more than
one way to do it.  One way is to simply escape the closing bracket
using an C&lt;E&gt; code:
 
    C&lt;$a &lt;=&gt; $b&gt;
 
This will produce: &quot;C&lt;$a &lt;=&gt; $b&gt;&quot;
 
A more readable, and perhaps more &quot;plain&quot; way is to use an alternate
set of delimiters that doesn't require a single &quot;&gt;&quot; to be escaped.  With
the Pod formatters that are standard starting with perl5.5.660, doubled
angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) may be used I&lt;if and only if there is
whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace right
before the closing delimiter!&gt;  For example, the following will
do the trick:
X&lt;POD, formatting code, escaping with multiple brackets&gt;
 
    C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;
 
In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so
long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing
delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
'&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;'
of the closing delimiter.  (The whitespace is ignored.)  So the
following will also work:
X&lt;POD, formatting code, escaping with multiple brackets&gt;
 
    C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  $a &lt;=&gt; $b     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 
And they all mean exactly the same as this:
 
    C&lt;$a &lt;=&gt; $b&gt;
 
As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these bits of
code in C&lt;C&gt; (code) style:
 
    open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!
    $foo-&gt;bar();
 
you could do it like so:
 
    C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $! &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;
 
which is presumably easier to read than the old way:
 
    C&lt;open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!&gt;
    C&lt;$foo-&gt;bar();&gt;
 
This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man (Pod::Man),
and any other pod2xxx or Pod::Xxxx translators that use
Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.

== The Intent ==
X&lt;POD, intent of&gt;
 
The intent is simplicity of use, not power of expression.  Paragraphs
look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out
visually, and so that I could run them through C&lt;fmt&gt; easily to reformat
them (that's F7 in my version of B&lt;vi&gt;, or Esc Q in my version of
B&lt;emacs&gt;).  I wanted the translator to always leave the C&lt;'&gt; and C&lt;`&gt; and
C&lt;&quot;&gt; quotes alone, in verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a
working program, shift it over four spaces, and have it print out, er,
verbatim.  And presumably in a monospace font.
 
The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.  Pod
is just meant to be an idiot-proof common source for nroff, HTML,
TeX, and other markup languages, as used for online
documentation.  Translators exist for B&lt;pod2text&gt;, B&lt;pod2html&gt;,
B&lt;pod2man&gt; (that's for nroff(1) and troff(1)), B&lt;pod2latex&gt;, and
B&lt;pod2fm&gt;.  Various others are available in CPAN.
 
 
=== Embedding Pods in Perl Modules ===
 
You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.
Start your documentation with an empty line, a &quot;=head1&quot; command at the
beginning, and end it with a &quot;=cut&quot; command and an empty line.  Perl
will ignore the Pod text.  See any of the supplied library modules for
examples.  If you're going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and
you're using an __END__ or __DATA__ cut mark, make sure to put an
empty line there before the first Pod command.
 
  __END__
 
  =head1 NAME
 
  Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time
 
Without that empty line before the &quot;=head1&quot;, many translators wouldn't have recognized the &quot;=head1&quot; as starting a Pod block.
 
=== Hints for Writing Pod ===
 
=over
 
=item *
 
The B&lt;podchecker&gt; command is provided for checking Pod syntax for errors and warnings.  For example, it checks for completely blank lines in Pod blocks and for unknown commands and formatting codes.  You should still also pass your document through one or more translators and proofread the result, or print out the result and proofread that.  Some of the problems found may be bugs in the translators, which you may or may not
wish to work around.
 
=item *
 
If you're more familiar with writing in HTML than with writing in Pod, you
can try your hand at writing documentation in simple HTML, and converting
it to Pod with the experimental L&lt;Pod::HTML2Pod|Pod::HTML2Pod&gt; module,
(available in CPAN), and looking at the resulting code.  The experimental
L&lt;Pod::PXML|Pod::PXML&gt; module in CPAN might also be useful.
 
=item *
 
Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod
command and after every Pod command (including &quot;=cut&quot;!) to be a blank
line.  Having something like this:
 
 # - - - - - - - - - - - -
 =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()
 
 This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
 =cut
 sub boom {
 ...
 
...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see the Pod block
at all.
 
Instead, have it like this:
 
 # - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
* $firecracker-&gt;boom()
** This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 
 sub boom {
 ...

&lt;/source&gt;
 
* Some older Pod translators require paragraphs (including command paragraphs like &quot;=head2 Functions&quot;) to be separated by I&lt;completely&gt; empty lines.  If you have an apparently empty line with some spaces on it, this might not count as a separator for those translators, and that could cause odd formatting.

* Older translators might add wording around an L&lt;&gt; link, so that C&lt;L&lt;Foo::Bar&gt;&gt; may become &quot;the Foo::Bar manpage&quot;, for example. So you shouldn't write things like C&lt;the L&lt;foo&gt; documentation&gt;, if you want the translated document to read sensibly -- instead write C&lt;the L&lt;Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar&gt; documentation&gt; or C&lt;L&lt;the Foo::Bar documentation|Foo::Bar&gt;&gt;, to control how the link comes out.
 
* Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block might be ungracefully wrapped by some formatters.

|current=Induced homomorphism
|previous=The fundamental group
|next=Simplicial complexes}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The induced homomorphism is related to the study of the fundamental group. We will give a few theorems and notes, but first we make a definition.

'''Definition'''

Let X and Y be topological spaces; let x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a point of X and let y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a point of y. Suppose h is a continuous map from X to Y such that h(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Define a map h* from π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) by composing a loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) with h to get a loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Then h* is a homomorphism between fundamental groups known as the homomorphism induced by h.

'''Note 1'''

Let us check that if f is a loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), then h*(f) is a loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Note that h*(f) is a continuous map from [a,b] to Y (we will assume that [a,b] = [0,1] which has no difference to the general case since these two sets are homeomorphic), and h*(f(0)) = h*(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = y0 and h*(f(1)) = h*(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. 

'''Note 2'''

We will check that h is indeed a homomorphism. To avoid repetition, whenever we call f and g loops, they will be known as loops based at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose f and g are two loops. Then [0 is the group operation on π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and + is the group operation on π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)]

                   
h*(f 0 g) =        h*(f(2t))  for t in [0,1/2]                  = (h*(f)) + (h*(g)) 

h*(f 0 g) =        h*(g(2t-1)) for t in [1/2,1]                 = (h*(f)) + (h*(g))
 
                  

so that h* is indeed a homomorphism.

'''Note 3'''

Checking h* is a function (i.e, every loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) gets mapped onto a unique loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)) follows from the fact that if f and g are loops in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x0) that are homotopic via the homotopy H, then h*(f) and h*(g) are homotopic via the homotopy h*H.

'''Note 4'''

Note that none of the above notes would be true unless h is continuous which is why this is needed in the hypothesis. We leave it to you to work out why h(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; [which is fairly trivial].

We now prove one important theorem which can be used to check whether two topological spaces are homeomorphic or not. In fact, this theorem illustrates why algebraic topology was invented in the first place.

'''Theorem''' 

Suppose X and Y are two homeomorphic topological spaces. If h is a homeomorphism from X to Y, then the induced homomorphism, h* is an isomorphism between fundamental groups [Assume that we are considering the fundamental groups π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(X,x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) with h(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]

'''Proof'''

We have already checked in note 2 that h* is a homomorphism. It remains to check that h* is bijective. Suppose p is the inverse of h; then p* is the inverse of h*. This follows from the fact that (p(h))*(f) = p*(h*(f)) = f = (h(p))*(f) = h*(p*(f)). If f and g are two loops in X where f is not homotopic to g, the h*(f) is not homotopic to h*(g); if F is a homotopy between them, p*(F) would be a homotopy between f and g. If k is any loop in π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(Y,y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) , then h*(p*(k)) = k where p*(k) is a loop in X. This shows that h* is bijective.

'''Note''': It is a good exercise to check that we used all the properties that h satisfies, i.e we used completely, the fact that h is a homeomorphism.

'''Applications of the Theorems'''

1. The torus is not homeomorphic to R^2 for their fundamental groups are not isomorphic (their fundamental groups don’t have the same cardinality). Note that, a simply connected space cannot be homeomorphic to a non-simply connected space; one has a trivial fundamental group and the other does not.

2. In fact, any two topological spaces have homomorphic fundamental groups (at a particular base point). See note 2 where we may let h* be the homomorphism induced by the constant map. However, they need not have isomorphic fundamental groups (at a particular base point). This is interesting because it shows that the fundamental groups of any two topological spaces always have the same ‘group structure’.

3. The fundamental group of the unit circle is isomorphic to the additive group of integers. Therefore, the fundamental group of [0,1] is isomorphic to the set of integers since [0,1] and the unit circle are homeomorphic (why is this statement false?). The one-point compactification of R also has a fundamental group isomorphic to the set of integers (since the one-point compactification of R is homeomorphic to the unit circle).

4. The converse of the theorem need not hold. For example, R^2 and R^3 have isomorphic fundamental groups but are still not homeomorphic. Their fundamental groups are isomorphic because each space is simply connected. However, the two spaces cannot be homeomorphic because deleting a point from R^2 leaves a non-simply connected space but deleting a point from R^3 leaves a simply connected space (If we delete a line lying in R^3, the space wouldn’t be simply connected anymore. In fact this generalizes to R^n whereby deleting a (n-2) dimensional parallelepiped from R^n leaves a non-simply connected space).

Hello Dallas!

I am an instructor for a course at Old Dominion University. Our students write the wikibooks titled Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment.  You have been tampering with our pages and I am not sure why.  I am not clear why you have put an {{Alphabetical|E}} on our page.  We are required to post the Category button on all pages we create.  Is there something I am missing? I would be more than happy to explain our project in more detail, if this would clear up the confusion. 
We also have students rate each others work.  Is there something incorrect with our rating button coding? Thank you for your clarification!

[[User:Jkauf007|Jkauf007]] ([[User talk:Jkauf007|talk]]) 01:52, 26 August 2008 (UTC)


Hello Dallas,

Each semester we build a new edition to our book.  Students sign up to write the articles, but sometimes there are a few empty pages.  We place category buttons on these so that they are no tampered with or erased. This also allows visitors from outside of the class to contribute to our book.  Currently we are building the third edition.  Unfortunately, with all of our responsibilities, we can not build over a thousand pages in a day.  We would appreciate your hesitation in marking blank pages (those without category buttons) because we are on a mission to finish them ASAP.  We really appreciate your assitance to the Wikibook project and please feel free to send me a message if you have any questions and/or before you mark a lot of pages.  This will save both of us time.  Have a great day!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Photosynthesis is the method that plants and photoautotrophes utilize light energy to produce ATP via photophosphorylation in order to anabolise sugars. It is an energy transfer process, and almost all energy transferred to ATP in all organisms is derived from light energy trapped by autotrophs.

The equation for it is listed below;

:6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; + photons → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2(g)&lt;/sub&gt;
:carbon dioxide + water + light energy → glucose + oxygen

Two reactions are involved in photosynthesis, the light dependent and independent.

==Light Energy==

Light energy is used to split H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into H  and O in a process called photolysis, and is trapped by photosynthetic pigments. These pigments fall into 2 categories: chlorophylls and carotenoids. Chlorophylls absorb mainly red and blue-violet light, reflecting green light, whilst carotenoids absorb mainly the blue-violet light. These spectra, where the pigments can absorb light energy are known  as absorption spectra (singular: spectrum). An action spectrum is a graph displaying the rates of photosynthesis at different wavelengths of light. See [http://www.mrothery.co.uk/images/Imag53.gif] for an action spectrum. The shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy contained.c

Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy through exciting electrons within the pigments. The 2 photosynthetic pigments fall into 2 sub-categories: i)primary pigments and ii)accessory pigments. The primary pigments comprises 2 types of &quot;chlorophyll a&quot; (with slightly different absorption peaks), whereas accessory pigments consists of other types of &quot;chlorophyll a&quot;, &quot;chlorophyll b&quot; and carotenoids. All the pigments are arranged in photosystems, and several hundred accessory pigments surround a primary pigment, so that the light energy absorbed by accessory pigments can be transmitted to the primary pigments. The primary pigment is known as the reaction center.

=Light Dependent=

Light-dependent reactions are the synthesis of ATP from ADP+Pi and the breakdown of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O using light energy to give protons. 

==Photophosphorylation==
[[Image:Z-scheme.png|right|500px|framed| The Z-scheme - representing the relative energy levels of the photosystems]]
This is the process by which ATP is synthesised from ADP+Pi, and can be either cyclic or non-cyclic.

===Cyclic===

This type of photophosphorylation involves only photosystem I. When light is absorbed by photosystem I and passed to &quot;chlorophyll a (P700)&quot;, an electron in this chlorophyll molecule is excited to a higher energy level and then captured by an electron acceptor. It is then passed back to a &quot;chlorophyll a&quot; molecule through a cycle of electron carriers (or electron transport chain/ETC), which at the meanwhile, release energy to synthesise ATP from ADP+Pi (phosphorylation) by a mechanism known as chemiosomosis. This ATP later enters the light independent stage.

===Non-Cyclic===

Non-cyclic photophosphorylation utilises both photosystems in a &quot;Z-Scheme&quot;. See picture above.  Light is absorbed by both photosystems I and II, and excited electrons are passed from both primary pigments to electron acceptors as well as electron transport chain before exiting the photosystems positively charged. Photosystem I receives electrons from photosystem II, which instead replenishes electrons from the photolysis of water. In this chain, as in cyclic, ATP is synthesised using the energy lost during the phase of electron transport chain.

====Photolysis of water====

Photosystem II has a water-splitting enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, producing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a waste product. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; combine with e&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; from photosystem I and the carrier molecule NADP to give reduced NADP. This then passes to the light independent reactions, and is used in the synthesis of carbohydrates.

=Light Independent=
[[Image:Calvin-cycle4.svg|center|700px]]
{{clear}}
===Calvin cycle===

See picture

In the light-independent stage, RuBP (5-C) combines with one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, that then splits into 2 glycerate-3-phosphate (GP) molecules (3-C), which is finally reduced to 2 triose phosphates (3-C). 1 triose phosphates (3-C) feed back in to the cycle to regenerate RuBP (5-C), 1 is polymerised into starch. The products of this cycle are used to form glucose, amino acids or lipids.

=Leaf Structure/Function=

The leaf is the main site of photosynthesis in most plants - it has a broad, thin lamina and an extensive network of veins. The functions of a leaf are best achieved by containing photosynthetic pigments, absorbing carbon dioxide (and disposing of oxygen) and have a water and solute supply/transport route. The leaf itself has a large surface area and arrangement such that it can absorb as much light as possible.The green color is from chlorophyll, where absorbs light energy to drive the synthesis of organic molecules in the chloroplast. Chlorophyll’s pigments absorb visible light.

===Epidermis/Cuticle===

The cuticle, on the upper epidermis provides a watertight layer for the top of the plant, and together with the epidermis (thin, flat, transparent cells) allow light through to the mesophyll below, and protect the leaf.

===Palisade Cells===

The palisade cells are the main site of photosynthesis, as they have many more chloroplasts than spongy mesophylls, and also have several adaptions to maximise photosynthetic efficiency;

* Large Vacuole - Restricts chloroplasts to a layer near the outside of the cell where they can be reached by light more easily.

* Cylindrical Arrangement - They are arranged at right angles to the upper epidermis, reducing the number of light-absorbing cross walls preventing light from reaching the chloroplasts. This also allows long-narrow air spaces between them, providing a large surface area for gaseous exchange.

* Movement of chloroplasts - Proteins can move the chloroplasts within cells to absorb maximum light.

* Thin cell walls - to allow gases to more easily diffuse through them.

===Spongy Mesophyll===

These cells are the main site for gaseous exchange, and contain fewer chloroplasts, and will only photosynthesise at high light intensities. The irregular packing of the cells provides a large surface area for gaseous exchange.

===Stomata===
CO2 enters and O2 exits the leaf through stomata.
[[Image:Chloroplast.svg|right|thumb|Chloroplast ultrastructure

 1. outer membrane
 2. intermembrane space
 3. inner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)
 4. stroma (aqueous fluid)
 5. thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)

 7. granum (stack of thylakoids)
 8. thylakoid (lamella)

 11. plastidial DNA

]]
The lower epidermis is basically the same as the upper, except that there are many stomata in the lower epidermis, which are pores in the epidermis through which gaseous exchange occurs. Each stomata is bounded by two guard cells, and changes in the turgidity of theses guard cells cause them to change shape so that they open and close the pore. If the guard cells gain water, the pore is open, and vice-versa. 

Osmosis controls how much water is in the guard cells, and to have more end the water potential of the guard cells must belowered via the active removal of hydrogen ions, in an active transport process.

===Chloroplast===

The actual photosynthetic organelle is chloroplast -  an image of a chloroplast is on the right. As you can see, 1,2 and 3 are the envelope of two phospholipid membranes. The system of membranes (4) running through the cell is the stroma, and provides space for the thylakoids, a series of flattened fluid-filled sacs (5,6), which form stacks called grana (7). This membrane system of the grana provides a large surface area for reactions, and as said before, the pigment molecules are also arranged in light-harvesting clusters with primary pigments and accessory pigments. Chloroplasts are found in cells of mesophyll, the interior tissue of the leaf. The chlorophyll is in the membranes of thylakoids. Thylakoids stack in grana

===Stroma===

The stroma is the site of the light-independent reactions, contain the Calvin cycle enzymes, sugars and organic acids. The ribosome (10), DNA (11) and some lipids (12) can also be seen.

=Rate of Photosynthesis=

===Factors===

The main factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis are light intensity, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration. at constant temperature, the rate of photosynthesis varies with light intensity, increasing at first but at higher light intensities this increase levels off.

The effect on the rate of photosynthesis at constant light intensities and varying temperatures - at high light intensities, the rate of photosynthesis increases as temperature does (to a limited range), but at low light intensities temperature does not make much difference.

===Dehydration===
Dehydration is one of the most common problems for plants, and it sometimes requires trade-offs with other metabolic processes, like photosynthesis. On hot and dry days, plants close stomata to conserve water but it then limits the ability for photosynthesis.  The closing of stomata reduces access to the CO2 and causes O2 to build up. Plants have developed some mechanisms to solve this problem.

-In most plants (C3 plants), initial fixation of C02 via rubisco and it forms a three-carbon compound.  Rubisco adds O2 instead of CO2 in the Calvin cycle during photorespiration. Photorespiration consumes O2 and releases C02 with no producing ATP and carbohydrate.

-C4 plants minimize the cost of photorespiration by incorporating CO2 into four carbon compounds in mesophyll cells. Enzyme PEP carboxylase is required during this process. PEP carbonxylase has a higher affinity for CO2 than rubisco, so it can fix CO2 even when CO2 concentrations are low. 

-CAM plants are those that use CAM to fix carbon. They open their stomata at night, and this incorporates CO2 into organic acids. During the day, they close their stomata to reduce the chance of dehydration and CO2 is now released from organic acid in the calvin cycle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Meiosis==
[[Image:MajorEventsInMeiosis.jpg|right|framed|Main events in meiosis]]
In sexual reproduction as a result of meiosis, zygotes formed from gametes, genetic variation occurs during meiosis, and genetic mutations can occur.

For A2 level, you are required to know the stages of Meiosis.
http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/88/78588-036-DAFF2140.jpg
===Meiosis I===
* Early/Middle I Prophase - Homologous chromosomes pair up, a process known as synapsis - each pair is known as a bivalent. Centrioles move to opposite ends of the nucleus as in mitosis, forming spindle fibres. Nuclear membrane begins to break down.

* Late Prophase I - Nucleolus disappears, bivalents may cross over - chromatids may break and reconnect to other chromatids - forming a chiasmata, a point where the crossing over occurs.

* Metaphase I - Bivalents line up on the spindle fibre equator, attached by centromeres.

* Anaphase I - Bivalent chromosomes move towards opposite poles within the cell. They are pulled apart because the microtubule fibres begin to shorten, pulling them along.

* Telophase I - Nucleus, nucleolus reforms. Cytokinesis also occurs - the division of cytoplasm and cell into two by constriction from edges of cell.

===Meiosis II===

So now we have two cells ready to divide again in meiosis II;

* Prophase II - Nuclear envelope and nucleolus disperse, centrioles replicate and move to opposite poles of the cell

* Metaphase II - Chromosomes line up separately across the equator

* Anaphase II - Chromatids (identical copies of chromosomes) separate as they are pulled towards opposite poles within the cell. They are pulled because the microtubule fibres begin to shorten, pulling them along.

* Telophase II - Nucleus, nucleolus reforms and chromosomes unravel into longer chromatin structures for reentry into interphase. Cytokinesis also occurs - the division of cytoplasm and the two cells into two by constriction from edges of cell. This forms 4 haploid cells.

===Crossing over===

Crossing over and independent assortment of the homologous chromosomes helps genetic variation. Crossing over is when chromatids (still in bivalent pairs) cross over, forming a chiasma. When the two formed gametes fuse at fertilisation randomly, yet more variation is produced amongst the offspring

Sections 2-6 regards genetics, the study of the way genes are passed on these chromosomes.

=Alleles=

A gene is a length of DNA that codes for the production of a polypeptide, and this code is held in a sequence of triplet bases. Chromosomes for making the same polypeptides are said to homologous, and a diploid cell contains one homologue from the mother and one from the father, and so in each diploid cell there are two copies of each genes, which lie in the same locus on the two homologous chromosome. The allele is a '''form or a variety of the same gene'''. 

==Genotype==

Most genes have several alleles. We will take for example a gene that codes for eye colour (there are several, but for simplicities sake we will say there is one, and two possible colours - blue (dominant) and green (recessive))

E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; - the allele for blue eyes
E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; - the allele for green eyes. 

'''Note''' the smaller letter for a recessive allele (g) and the bigger letter for a dominant allele (B), this is standard notation and should be used at all times.

The E stands for the locus of the gene, whilst B and g stand for blue and green. Combining these in a diploid cell might result in E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;,  E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; or E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;. These are known as it's genotype, and there are only 3 in this case. The first and the last genotype there, are said to be homozygous since they have the same allele for that gene, and the other is heterozygous, since it has different alleles.

==Phenotype==

Genotype affects phenotype. If a person has E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, they will have blue eyes (homozygous blue), if they have E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; they will have blue eyes, since they have the dominant blue allele, and are so simply a carrier of the green eye allele. Only when a person has E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; will they have green eyes.

===Gene Inheritance===

When sperm are made in the testes of a man with E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;, a blue eyed, green carrier, two of his gametes will have the E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; and two will have E&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;. The same with a heterozygous, blue eyed, green carrier woman. Thus, the combinations that can occur are.

The first is the man, the second is the woman;

* E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; = E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, blue eyed

* E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; = E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;, blue eyed green carrier

* E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; = E&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;, blue eyed green carrier

* E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; + E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; = E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;, green eyed

Each is individually likely, 1 in 4.

===Dominance===

Frequently, only one allele has an affect in a heterozygous organism, and is said to be the dominant allele to its recessive counterpart. When alleles of a gene behave like this, their symbols are written using a capital letter for the dominant allele and a lowercase letter for the recessive allele. 

===Typical monohybrid cross===
In this example, both organisms have the  '''Bb'''.  They can produce s that contain either the '''B''' or '''b''' alleles. (It is conventional in  to use capital letters to indicate dominant alleles and lower-case letters to indicate alleles.)  The probability of an individual offspring having the genotype '''BB''' is 25%, '''Bb''' is 50%, and '''bb''' is 25%.

=Sex=

In humans, the chromosome that determines sex is appropriately known as the sex chromosome, and the rest are autosomes. The sex chromosomes are not always homologous, and this is due to the fact there are two types of sex chromosome, the X and the Y chromosome, and the Y is shorter with fewer genes. XX = Female, XY = Male.

===Linkage===

If an allele for a gene is only on the X chromosome, then females will have two copies whilst men will only have one.

=Dihybrid crosses=

The inheritance cross of two genes at once is known as a dihybrid cross. As before, genes have two alleles, a dominant and recessive. The dominant allelle is represented by a capital letter, and the recessive by a lowercase. For example, Aa. We'll use a bean plant as an example.

A = allele for purple stem
a = allele for green stem

and Dd, a different locus on a chromosome, codes for leaf shape

D = allele for cut leaves
d = allele for smooth leaves

So what happens when Aa/Dd (heterozygous for both), is mixed with aa/dd (homozygous for both)? When the heterozygous plant cells undergo meiosis to form gametes, the homologous chromosomes line up independently of each other on the equator during metaphase I. Usually, independent assortment occurs, with roughly half in one way, the other half lining up the other way. We can therefore predict the gaemetes will be of four types - '''AD''', '''Ad''', '''aD''' and '''ad''', in equal numbers. The homozygous plant cells will produce gametes that are ALL '''ad'''.

This causes 

* ad + AD = AaDd
* ad + Ad = Aadd
* ad + aD = aaDd
* ad + ad = aadd

This causes a 1:1:1:1 ratio of the four possible phenotypes.

====Heterozygous dihybrids====

If both parents are heterozygous, we have '''AD''', '''Ad''', '''aD''', '''ad''' in equal proportions from both plants.

This causes:

&lt;table width=&quot;40%&quot; border=1 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=12% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''AD'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''Ad'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''aD'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''ad'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=12% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''AD'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AADD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AADd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=12% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''Ad'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AADd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;green&quot;&gt;AAdd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Aadd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=12% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''aD'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;red&quot;&gt;aaDD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;red&quot;&gt;aaDd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=12% align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;'''ad'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;yellow&quot;&gt;AaDd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Aadd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;red&quot;&gt;aaDd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=22% align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;aadd&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The result in this cross is a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, as shown by the colors, where yellow represents a round yellow (both dominant genes) phenotype, green representing a round green phenotype, red representing a wrinkled yellow phenotype, and blue representing a wrinkled green phenotype (both recessive genes).

===The X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test===

The previous section shows the probability of close to 9:3:3:1 ratio of phenotypes is likely - it is unlikely that the numbers will come out exactly that. In theory, if our two plants produce 144 offspring, and were definitely heterozygous, and we have the alleles correctly we should get.

* AD = 81
* Ad = 27
* aD = 27
* ad = 9

However, we might receive results such as;

* AD = 75
* Ad = 36
* aD = 20
* ad = 16

The question is - is this close enough to be by chance or have we got something wrong? The chi-squared, or X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test tells us just that.

The formula is below;

:&lt;math&gt; \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} {(O_i - E_i)^2 \over E_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;O_i&lt;/math&gt; = an observed frequency;
:&lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; = an expected (theoretical) frequency, asserted by the null hypothesis;
:&lt;math&gt;n &lt;/math&gt;  = the number of possible outcomes of each event.

So, we find out the expected results, and calculate (and then square) the difference between each set of results. Divide this by the expected value, and square it to get the X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value. This value is a probability rating for whether the difference between expected and observed results are due to chance.

So we are looking for a low probability representation in the chi-squared table [http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/PopEcol/tables/chisq.html] P = probability greater than and df = Degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom is calculated by the amount of classes of data minus 1, since we added up all the calculated values, more data sets, larger X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will be. A perfect result (wherein all expected = observed), would be 0, and thus basically have a probability of being to chance of 0.

=Mutations=

A mutation is an unpredictable change in the genetic material, and produces a different allele of a gene known as a gene mutation. Mutations can also cause changes in the structure or number of chromosomes in the cell, known as chromosome mutations. They can be caused by radiation, including UV radiation from the sun or carcinogenic chemicals. These factors are known as mutagens, and increase the chance of mutation occurring.

There are three different ways gene mutations can occur;

:Base addition - where one or more additional bases are added - CCT GAG GAG may become CCA TGA GGA G.
:Base substitution - where one based takes the place of another - CCT GAG GAG may become CCT GTG GAG.
:Base deletion - where one or more bases are deleted from the sequence - CCT GAG GAG may become CCG AGG AG.

Addition and deletion usually have a major effect on structure, and most often completely breaks the polypeptides that it codes for function. They cause frame shifts in the base sequence, causing a ripple change effect down the line for example ;

:CCT-CCT-'''G'''AG-CCG-GAG-AGG

If we remove the bolded letter during base deletion, we are left with

:CCT-CCT-AGC-CGG-AGA-GG

Which is a completely different sequence, and likely completely useless - especially since the last triplet code is not a triplet at all. However, base substitutions can sometimes have no effect, and are said to be a silent mutation - usually only if the substitution results in a STOP triplet prematurely in the sequence, and the protein synthesis will never complete. 

===Sickle Cell Anemia===

A base substitution with significant effect is shown in sickle cell anemia where a small difference in the gene that codes for one of the amino acid chains in haemoglobin causes a big problem. When the haemoglobin is not combined with oxygen, the error causes haemoglobin to be much less soluble, causing it to stick together forming long fibres inside the red blood cells, pulling them out of shape or 'sickling' them. This makes them useless at transporting oxygen and can cause them to get stuck in capillaries.

===Phenylketonuria===

Another example of a base substitution causing issues is phenylketonuria, and affects an enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine (which is then converted to melanin, the brown pigment in skin and hair). If phenylalanine cannot be converted to tyrosine, then tyrosine is not converted as much as it should be to melanin, causing lighter skin and hair colour. It can also cause a serious health problem in young children, with phenylalanine accumulating in the blood and tissue fluid. Testing can prevent serious brain damage, since if the child shows positive for PKU, they will be placed on a phenylalanine-free diet.

=Phenotype=

Your genotype affects your phenotype, but it merely gives you the potential for some things, such as height. that can be affected by your environment.

===Environment===

Your diet can affect how tall you are - if you have protein or vitamin deficiencies you may not grow to your full height potential, and thus your phenotype is affected. Another example is the himalayan rabbit - there is an allele that allows the formation of a dark hair pigment only at low temperatures - and thus the coldest parts of the rabbit (ears, nose, paws and tail) all receive dark hair.

====Lac Operon (E.Coli)====

Another example of how environment can affect phenotype is the way E.coli has genes that code for enzymes that can break down lactose (lactose permease and B galactosidase, which hydrolyse lactose to glucose and galactose). However, if the bacterium is grown in a glucose only environment, neither of the genes are switched on, but if it is moved to a lactose environment the enzymes are synthesised - said to be expressed.

The genes that regulate this are known as the '''lac operon''' (operon: a length of dna containing the base sequence that actually codes for the production of proteins, structural genes). This lac operon is show below;

[[Image:Lac operon1.png]]

The LacZ and LacY are the lactose permease and B galactosidase respectively, and ignore lacA. As you can see, before this there is a promoter. This is the section that RNA polymerase binds to catalyse the transcription of mRNA from the structural genes (lacZ, lacY). Along from the promoter is the operator, and if nothing is bound to it then the promoter is available to be bound to. What prevents this from being unbound all the time? 

Elsewhere in the gene, a regulator gene codes for a repressor protein, which has two binding sites, one for the operator site and one for lactose. Usually, it is bound only to the operator site, preventing the promoter being bound to and the structural genes being expressed. However, if the repressor protein binds with lactose, it deforms the protein so that it no longer fits into the operator DNA. Thus, the promoter can bind to RNA polymerase and the structural genes are expressed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Classification=

Animals are classified into groups, and this classification is known as taxonomy. This classification is done by looking for homologous features between different organisms, looking for a similar underlying design form which the two animals evolved from. A species of creatures will have many homologous features, and have evolved from a common ancestor and are grouped into the same genus. Horses, zebras, donkeys all belong to the gene Equus. Genus is then grouped into families, that are grouped into orders, that are grouped into classes that are grouped into phylum, grouped into kingdoms. Below is the full classification of the bacterium e.coli.

This classification reflects the evolutionary history of this bacteria, all animals of the proteobacteria have a common ancestor and this evolutionary history is known as phylogeny. 

==Five Kingdoms==


The five kingdoms are;

*Prokaryotae
*Protoctista
*Fungi
*Plantae
*Animalia


Prokaryotes features vs the other four kingdoms are found below. 

*Protoctists - simple eukaryotic organisms, many of which are unicellular, and may be autotrophic (an organism that can trap an inorganic carbon source using energy from light or from chemicals) or heterotrophic (an organism needing a supply of organic molecules as its carbon source). Most of them are aquatic or live in moist conditions such as the soil.

*Fungi - simple eukaryotic organisms that feed heterotrophically, they have cell walls but they contain materials such as chitin, no cellulose unlike plants. Some are unicelluar.

*Plants - multiceulluar eukaryotic that feed via photosynthesis. They have chloroplast and walls full of cellulose.

*Animals - multiceulluar eukaroytic organisms that feed heterotrophically. No cell walls, no chloroplasts and large sap-filled vacuoles.

=Genetic variation=

Genetic variation is caused by;

*Mutation
*Random mating between organisms
*Random fertilisation
*Crossing over between chromatids of homologous chromosomes during meiosis

The last 3 of these factors reshuffle alleles within a population, giving offspring combinations which differ from their parents and from others - phenotypic variation. However, mutation can create entirely new alleles, perhaps by a mistake during DNA replication creating a new base sequence. This is likely how sickle cell anemia occurred, due to gene mutation. It takes  awhile to show up because it is usually recessive (since if it is not, it usually kills the recipient before they can pass it on)

Mutations that occur in reproductive organs can pass to gametes and thus will be passed to the zygote created by two gametes.

=Overproduction=
[[Image:MyxoRabbit1.JPG|right|thumb|A rabbit with myxomatosis, a disease introduced to control rabbit numbers]]

Rabbits are a prime example of how overproduction can lead to problems - they produce perhaps 50 offspring per year and if all these survive - perhaps due to lack of natural predators and a large amount of food available then their numbers will soar. In this case, 1859 Australia, after being introduced,  they seriously affected the amount of food available for sheep. Usually, most of their offspring would die before they could reproduce.


Environmental factors come into play to keep their numbers down. Biotic factors are those such as predators, or just in general caused by other living organisms. Abiotic factors are non-living components, such as water supply. If the pressure of these factors is sufficiently large, then the population size will decrease.


Myxomatosis was introduced to control rabbit numbers, and was helped by the overcrowding that occurred due to their large numbers (other disease were also easily transmitted).

=Natural Selection=

Not all animals are created equal. Some of the rabbits in the above section will be born with a better chance of survival, due to genetic variation. Coat colour for example, will affect whether a rabbit will survive - for example, a white coat for a rabbit living in a snow-laden area will do well, whereas a black coated one will not do well, and is likely to be quickly eaten. This is said to be a selective advantage for the white-coated rabbit, and this rabbit is much more likely to survive and pass on its genes. This is known as natural selection.

==Evolution==

Most of the time, stabilising selection is the status quo - natural selection serves only to keep things the same. The things that can (and do) affect this is a new environmental factor, or a new allele. Thus, survival of the fittest.

===Changing Environments===

If the environment changes, slowly or quickly, possibly in the case of global warming, those animals with thin (or no) coats of hair and good haemostasis systems will be able to survive to reproduction age, and thus the alleles that makeup these changes will be more likely to be passed on, and over time nearly all of the specie will have them.

===Allele===

Random mutations usually cause the organism to die, or be less adjusted to their surroundings. However, occasionally mutations may cause a specie to have a genetic advantage, such as an allele mutation that leads to a moth having a more camouflaged body, and thus is able to blend in better with its surroundings, survive longer and thus reproduce more. This allele will then be passed on more often than the allele for the un-camouflaged skin, and thus evolution occurs. Natural selection gives some alleles a better chance of survival than others.

==Darwin-Wallace Evolution theory==

This is a theory about how evolution might occur was put forward by Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace in 1856.

*Observation 1 - Organisms produce more offspring than are needed to replace parents
*Observation 2 - Natural populations tend to remain stable in size over long periods
*Observation 3 - There is variation among the individuals of a given species
*Deduction 1 - There is a struggle for existence
*Deduction 2 - The best adapted variants will be selected for by the natural conditions at the time - natural selections. The best variants have a selective advantage.

==Examples==
Below are a few examples of how selection pressures can cause useful allele mutations, causing evolution.

===Antibiotic resistance===

When a person takes an antibiotic to treat a bacterial infection, bacteria sensitive to it will die. But if there is a mutation, providing a resistance to the antibiotic, due to the way bacteria divide, they have a tremendous selective advantage. This bacteria becomes ten thousand million within 24 hours, all resistant to antibiotics, whilst the bacteria without the resistance are killed off. The different antibiotics we use place selection pressures on bacteria.

===Moths===

The peppered moth relies on its camouflage to protect it from predators, and in some areas of the country in 1849, a black form of the moth was found, and increased dramatically in population size, whilst in other areas the white speckled form remained more common. This was due to industrial pollution in certain areas causing the trees to be blackened, meaning that to blend in the moth would more likely have to be black, and thus they were given a selection advantage by this allele mutation that changed their colour to black, since they were more likely to survive long enough to reproduce. The likelihood of this alllele surviving in this population was hugely improved as their habitat became the perfect camouflage for it, and the white allele became the worst.

===Sickle Cell Anemia===

Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which a allele that produces part of haemoglobin does not work correctly and causes sickling of red blood cells, and those who are homozygous (have both copies of the allele) suffer from sickle cell anemia, which usually kills them. This puts them at a selective disadvantage - they are much less likely to reproduce because they die before they can. However, in East Africa, 50% of babies are born as carriers, and 14% are homozygous.

The reason for this is that malaria is prevalent in these areas, and usually kills much earlier on than sickle cell anemia. This is relevant, since those that are heterozygous sickle cell anemia (carriers, only 1 copy) are much less likely to suffer from a serious attack of malaria  than those who have two healthy alleles. Thus, the allele stays prevalent because heterozygous carriers are much more likely to survive to reproduction age as they are more likely to survive an onset of malaria.

==Artificial Selection==

Artificial selection is when humans purposefully apply selection pressures to a population, such as the development of modern cattle. Since cattle have been domesticated for a long time, they have been improved by people selecting features such as docility, fast growth rates and high milk yields. This is known as selective breeding, choosing alleles conferring these features, and over generations these alleles will reduce in frequency.

=Speciation=

Speciation is how new species occur - something not described so far. To understand how new species are created, we must first define a species. Most biologists accept;

*A group of organisms, with similar morphological, physiological, biochemical and behavioral features, which can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, and are reproductively isolated from other species.

This section describes how two organisms can become reproductively isolated.

==Allopatric==

Allopatric speciation is that which geographical isolation, that is, two groups of the same species have been separated, by a stretch of water or a forest animal being separated by areas of the forest being cut down. The group of that species in the new location find that the selection pressures are very different, resulting in different alleles being selected from. Over time, these changes affect the morphological, physiological, biochemical and behavioral features to the point where the original group cannot breed with the group in the new location. Thus, a new species is born.

==Sympatric==

Sympatric speciation is the way in which new species arise without the original species being separated by a geographical barrier. The most common way this occurs is polyploidy. 


A polyploid organism is one with more than two complete sets of chromosomes in its cells, and can be caused by meiosis going wrong in that one gaemete is formed with two sets of chromosomes, one with none. If two such gametes fuse, the zygote gains 4 complete sets, a tetraploid. However, this tetraploid cannot breed with its diploid parent - it's gametes will be diploid, and thus if they fuse with a normal haploid gamete (such as that of its diploid parent) since there will be 3 sets of chromosomes, and no way to evenly split them. Thus, a new specie in just one generation.


An autopolyploidy, the one described above, contains 4 sets of chromosomes all from the same species. However, an allopolyploidy contains 2 from one species and two from another closely-related species. Meiosis occurs more frequently, since the chromosome sets are not identical, providing a less muddled situation than when an autopolyploidy attempts meiosis. Thus it may be able to produce many gametes and is fertile, and is once again for the same reason a new species.

== mashed potatoes ==

You know, if I want mashed potatoes I'll get a recipe for one. The secret to restaurant fries is oil blanching, not water blanching. I tried this recipe and it tasted more like fried mashed potatoes than fries. Paper towels make it greasy anyways because it absorbs it and holds it right at the surface of the food, thus making it greasy. That's why I always use a cooling rack to drain.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Homeostasis=

Homeostasis is the internal maintenance of a stable internal environment - temperature, amount of water and amount of glucose. If temperature is too high, the enzymes could become denatured. Too low, and metabolic processes will be too slow. Lack of water causes water to be drawn out via osmosis causing metabolic reactions to stop, whereas too much water will cause the cell to burst. Lack of glucose causes respiration to stop, whilst too much glucose may draw water out of the cell via osmosis.

Homeostasis is achieved using a negative feedback control loop, involving a receptor and an effector. The receptor receives information about the parameter being regulated, the input, and sets off a series of events culminating in an action by the effector, the output. Continuous monitoring keeps the parameter around an ideal level, and in negative feedback a rise in the parameter results in something happening that makes the parameter fall.

A positive feedback system is a problem - for example in high carbon dioxide concentration air, a person breathing will have high carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, causing the carbon dioxide receptors to increase the breathing rate, breathing in more carbon dioxide.

=Excretion=

The removal of unwanted products of metabolism is called excretion. The two biggest excretory products in humans are urea and carbon dioxide. Urea is produced by the liver from excess amino acids and is transported from the liver to the kidneys in the blood, and the kidneys remove urea and excrete it dissolved in water, as urine. Urea is the main nitrogenous excretory product of humans.

Carbon dioxide is produced in every cell in the body, as a product of aerobic respiration, and is transported in the bloodstream to the lungs and is exhaled.

===Deamination===

The body must get rid of nitrogenous wastes from nucleic acids and proteins. The protein that we do not use is converted to urea, with the liver salvaging the energy by removing the nitrogen atoms, and this process is known as deamination. The amino group of an amino acid is removed with an extra hydrogen atom, and combines to produce ammonia, a soluble and highly toxic compound. Because of ammonia's toxicity, this ammonia is rapidly converted to the less soluble and less toxic compound, urea.

==Kidney structure==
[[Image:Illu kidney2.jpg|right|framed|Section through the kidney to show the position of a nephron]]
[[Image:Gray1128.png|right|framed|Scheme of renal tubule and its vascular supply]]

The human body has two kidneys, and each receives blood via a renal artery and returns blood via a renal vein. The ureter carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, which excretes urine to the outside of the body via the urethra. The picture to the right shows a longitudinal section through a kidney, and it's clear that the kidney is covered by a tough capsule, beneath which is the cortex. The central area is the medulla, and where the ureter joins there is an area known as the pelvis. A microscope section shows that the kidney is made up of thousands of tubes known as nephrons.

The nephrons structure is shown in the second picture down, and the labelled glomeluar capsule is known also as a renal or Bowman's capsule, and the renal capsules of all nephrons are in the cortex. They then run towards the centre of the kidney, forming a twisted region called the ''proximal convoluted tubule'' (PCT), and then a long ''loop of Henle'' (in the medulla). 
This then runs back up toward to cortex where it forms another twisted region called the distal convoluted tubule, before reaching a collecting duct which leads down through the medulla and into the pelvis of the kidney, joining the ureter. 

[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Gray1129.png The linked picture shows the distribution of blood vessels in cortex of kidney], including how each renal capsule is supplied with blood from a branch of the renal artery known as an afferent arteriole that leads to the glomerulus, a tangle of capillaries in the capsule. These capillaries then rejoin to form an efferent arteriole that leaves the capsule to rejoin with the vein.

===Ultrafiltration===

Urine production is a two-part process, ultrafiltration and reabsorption. The former is done in the renal capsule, where small molecules, including urea are taken out of the blood and into the renal capsule where they take the nephrons route through the kidney. 

Structure of a renal capsule is as follows;

*Network of capillaries that come from the afferent arteriole, separated by two cell layers from the renal capsule lumen.
*The first cell layer is endothelium cells, with thousands of tiny gaps.
*The second cell layer is the basement membrane formed from epithelial cells which make up the wall of the renal capsule, and have many finger-like projections, and have gaps. They are known as podocytes.
*The holes in the capillary endothelium and renal epithelium are large enough to allow any dissolved substances in the blood to get through. The basement membrane stops large protein molecules from getting through, as well as blood cells.

The rate of ultafiltration is known as the glomerular filtration rate, and is usually around 125cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is due to a variety of factors. The concentration of solutes in the blood plasma in the capillaries is higher than in the renal capsule, since the plasma protein molecules are too big to get through, creating a water potential that is lower in the blood capillaries.

However, the water potential of the blood plasma is raised by the pressure inside the capillaries, causing blood to continue to move down this water potential gradient from the blood to the capsule.

===Reabsorption===

Many of the filtered substances need to be kept in the body, and so are selectivley reabsorbed (as some of them do need to be excreted). Most of this process occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule.

====Proximal Convoluted Tubule====

Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump in proximal tubule cell membrane using ATP (made by its numerous mitochondria) to transport sodium ions out of the cell into the blood plasma, lowering the concentration inside the cell, so that they can passively diffuse (using the created concentration gradient) back into it from the proximal tubule. The sodium ions use special transporter proteins, at the same time taking up glucose from the proximal tube and is then taken into the blood. The membrane itself is folded to increases surface area for exchange on the blood plasma side.

Glucose, amino acids, vitamins, 65% of the water from the PCT and many sodium/chloride ions are actively reabsorbed here. Some urea is also reabsorbed, around half. The numerous microvilli on the proximal tubule side provide an increased surface area for uptake of solutes. This reduces the volume of liquid remaining from 125cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to around 45cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to go to the loop of Henle.

====Loop of Henle====

The loop of Henle serves to create a high concentration of salts in the tissue fluid in the medulla of the kidney, allowing a lot of water to be reabsorbed from the fluid in the collecting duct as it flows through, producing very concentrated urine and preserving water for the body.

As you can see in the above picture, there is a descending and ascending limb. The method by which it concentrates urine is below;

:1. Sodium and Chloride are actively transported out of the ascending limb
:2. This raises the concentration of sodium and chloride in the tissue fluid
:3. This in turn causes loss of water into the tissue fluid in the descending limb.
:4. This loss of water concentrates sodium and chloride in the descending limb
:5. The concentrated sodium and chloride ions can then diffuse out of the ascending limb into the tissues.

Having the two limbs run side by side allows maximum concentration to be built up both inside and outside the tube at the bottom, and is known as a counter-current multiplier. 

The fluid then is flowing up the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, losing sodium and chloride as it goes, it continues round into the collecting duct, which dips into the medulla again, passing through the high-solute concentration regions of the tissues. This causes yet more water to move out of the collecting duct via osmosis.

====Distal Convoluted Tubule====

The first part of the DCT acts in the same way as the ascending loop of Henle, the second part behaves in the same way as the collecting duct. Functions of second part of the DCT and collecting duct are below;

*Sodium ions are actively pumped from the fluid in the tubule into the tissue fluid, where they pass into the blood.
*Potassium ions are actively transported into the tubule

=Osmoregulation=

The control of water in an organism is known as osmoregulation. 

==Hypothalamus==

Osmoreceptors within the hypothalamus detect when the water potential in the blood is low since the loss of water reduces their volume which triggers stimulation of nerve cells in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus are receptors and the effector is the pituitary gland and the walls of the distal convoluted tubule. The stimulated nerve cells produce a chemical known as antidiueretic hormone (ADH), a poly peptide made up of nine amino acids. When nerve cells are stimulated by the osmoreceptors, action potentials travel down them, causing ADH to be released from the blood in the capillaries in the posterior pituitary gland.

==ADH==

Antidiuretic hormone, or ADH is a hormone that is produced in the hypothalamus and stored and released in the pituitary gland. It acts on the kidney cells making up the walls of the collecting ducts, increasing their permeability to water by increasing the amount of water channels in the plasma membrane. ADH makes the blood more dilute by increasing the concentration of the urine. This is used to control the saltiness of the urine. If an organism does not have enough water, ADH will be activated to increase reabsorption of water.

===Negative feedback===

Again this is a negative feedback system - when blood water content is low, the hypothalamus acts to make the pituitary gland release ADH, and stops once blood water content rises (since the osmoreceptors are no longer being stimulated).

=Hormones=
===Exocrine/Endocrine===

An endocrine gland is one that secretes hormones directly into the blood. Exocrine glands are glands that secrete to the outside, into a tube or a duct along which the secretion flows.

===Structure/Function of Hormones===

Structure:

*Relatively small
*Can be proteins or steroids
*Usually have a short life in the body and are broken down by enzymes, or lost in urine. 
*Secreted in a very small concentration

Function:

*To carry information from one part of a mammals body to another part
*Respond to stimulus (such as adrenaline responding to a frightening stimulus)
*Transported by the blood and have a group of cells which it affects - target cells. These target cells contain receptors specific to the hormone.

==Pancreas==

[[Image:Gray1100.png‎|right]]

The picture on the right shows the structure of the pancreas. The pancreas is unique in that it is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland - separate parts taking care of each. The exocrine function is the secretion of pancreatic juice which flows along the pancreatic duct into the duodenum. The endocrine function is the secretion of glucagon and insulin, by the α and β cells, respectively, of the islets of Langerhans.

===Blood glucose===

Blood glucose levels are controlled by the secretion of glucagon and insluin by the islets of langerhans. When the stomach has carbohydrates in it, glucose from the digested food is absorbed from the small intestine and passed into the blood. When this blood flows through the pancreas, the α and β cells detect the raised glucose levels. α cells respond by stopping the secretion of glucagon (glucagon converts glycogen (a storage molecule) to glucose, it also produces glucose from other compounds and uses fatty acids instead of glucose as the main fuel in respiration.), whilst β cells secrete insulin into the blood plasma, where it is carried to all parts of the body. 

Insulin acts to lower blood glucose by the following methods;

:Increase in the rate of use of glucose in respiration
:Increased absorption of glucose into cells
:Increase at the rate at which glucose is converted into glycogen

Once blood glucose levels are back to normal, α cells start secreting glucagon again and β cells stop secreting insulin. It is a continuous cycle - with glucagon raising the glucose levels, insulin may have to be switched on again soon - and blood sugar levels never remain constant because of the time delay between a change and a correction.

====Diabetes mellitus====

There are two forms of diabetes;

*Insulin-dependent diabetes - this is when the pancreas cannot secrete enough insulin, and requires regular insulin injections.
*Non-insulin-dependent diabetes - This is when the pancreas does secrete insulin but neither the liver or muscle cells respond properly to it, and usually begins relatively late in life and is associated with obesity.

Symptoms for both are the same;

*After a carbohydrate meal, blood glucose levels rise and stay high
*Glucose can appear in the urine, along with extra water and salts, causing the person to feel hungry and thirsty constantly

===Control of insulin secretion===

β cells in the islets of Langerhans release insulin in response to the high levels of glucose in the blood. They do this via the following functions

:1. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Potassium) channels in the plasma membrane are open, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffuses out and the inside of the cell is -70mV compared to outside (potential difference)
:2. Glucose enters the cell if there are high glucose levels
:3. Glucose is phosphorylated by the enzyme glucokinase and metabolised to produce ATP.
:4. The presence of extra ATP makes K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels close
:5. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cannot diffuse out, and the potential difference reduces to around -30mV
:6. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are usually close open in response to the change in membrane potential.
:7. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions cause the vesicles (created by the golgi apparatus, full of insulin) to release insulin by exocytosis

=Nervous communication=
[[Image:Neuron.svg|right|framed|The structure of a typical motor neurone]]
===Neurones===

The other method (except hormones) is an electrical signal system along pathways, and the cells that make these paths and carry the signals are known as neurones. The picture to the right shows a motor neurone which transmits messages from the brain to a muscle or gland. The cell body of this neurone always lies within the spinal cord or brain. The dendrites (labelled) are processes and conduct impulses towards the cell body. The long process is known as an axon (labelled), and may stretch from the brain/spinal cord all the way to your foot, so can be extremely long. Large numbers of mitochondria are found at the terminal branches, with vesicles containing transmitter substances.

The Schwann cells (they are not in every neurone) wrap themselves round the axon all the way along, enclosing the axon in a myelin sheath, which affects the speed of conduction. The small uncovered areas of axon between Schwann cells are known as nodes of Ranvier, which together with the myelin sheath massively increase the speed of conduction.

A sensory neurone is similar to a motor neurone except it has one long dendron and is designed to bring impulses to the brain.

===Reflex arc===

A reflex arc is the pathway along which impulses are carried from a receptor to an effector, without conscious thought - reflexes. The impulse comes from the receptor, up the dorsal root of the spinal nerve, crosses into an intermediate neurone, and then reaches the cell body of motor neurone. It then immediately leaves to the effector via the ventral root of the spinal nerve.

===Transmission===

Transmission of nerve impulses is controlled by rapid movememnt of sodium/potassium ions in/out of the axon, and not electrons such as in an electric current. In a resting axon, the inside has a slightly negative electrical potential when compared with the outside - this is known as the potential difference (usually -65mV). This resting potential is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump of the axon, which serves to carry sodium ions to the outside and potassium to the inside utilising active transport against their concentration gradients.


===Action potentials===

An action potential is the rapid fleeting change in potential difference across the membrane of an axon when an electric current is applied. This electric current controls voltage-gated channels for sodium and potassium in the axons plasma membrane. This is a two part process - first, the electric current stimulates the axon to open channels in the plasma membrane for sodium to come through, and they flood through, depolarising that section of the axon, until it reaches +40mV. At this point, sodium channels close and potassium channels open and potassium ions diffuse out of the axon down their concentration gradient, known as re polarisation. So many potassium ions flood out that there is a brief overshoot in negativity of the potential difference, but this is corrected by the sodium potassium pump - restoring the action potential

These action potentials are just for one area of the axon - how does information get taking along a neurone? The depolarisation of the membrane of any part of the axon sets up a 'local circuit' between the depolarised region and the resting regions either side - sodium ions flow sideways inside the axon towards the resting regions, depolarising them and setting off an action potential. The reason that information can be sent one way via a neurone (and does not keep coming back on itself) is that directly after an action potential, whilst the sodium-potassium pump is returning things to normal and cannot create a new action potential - the refractory period.

====What starts it?====

An action potential in an organism is started by a receptor cell, responding to stimulus. They convert one energy form to another, light, heat or sound into energy in an electrical impulse in a neurone. The receptor you are required to know about is the Pacinian corpuscle, a receptor found in the dermis of the skin. They contain an ending of a sensory neurone surrounded by a capsule.

When pressure is applied to a Pacinian corpuscle, the capsule is pressured out of shape, deforming the nerve ending inside, allowing sodium/potassium channels to open in the cell membrane, depolarising it. This increased positive charge inside the axon is called a receptor potential. The more pressure applied, the more channels open and the greater the receptor potential comes, and if it is over a certain threshold, it will be large enough to trigger an action potential. If not, it will remain as a local depolarisation.

===Stimulus===

The intensity of the stimulus does not increase the speed or 'power' of the action potential, since speed is always the same - what a strong stimulus does (and how it tells the brain that it is strong) is have a rapid succession of action potentials each one following just behind the other. Also, a strong stimulus is more likely to stimulate many neurones as opposed toa weak stimulus. So, the frequency of action potentials, number of neurones carrying action potentials give the brain information about the strength of the stimulus.

===Speed===

Axons with a myelin sheath can transmit nerve impulses around a 100 metres a second, whilst nonmyelinated neurones can only transmit at a speed of 0.5 metres a second. This is due to myelin insulating the axon membrane, and so sodium and potassium ions cannot flow through the myelin sheath and depolarise any area of the axon surrounded by it. So, in a myelinated neurone, it can only occur at the nodes of Ranvier. This is known as saltatory conduction, and action potentials jump from one node (of Ranvier) to the next, 1-3mm, and this can increase the transmission by up to 50x.

Diameter of axon also affects speed of transmission

==Synapses==

A synapse is where two neurones meet, and includes the parts of the two neurones next to each other and the small gap between them known as the synaptic cleft (cleft means gap).

===Mechanism===

Obviously from what you now know about action potentials, there is no way for them to jump like an electric current can. Instead, a transmitter substance is used, a chemical. An action potential travelling along a neurone reaches a the presynaptic neurone of a synapse, causes it to release it's transmitter substance which diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane, setting up an action potential there and continuing the message.

More detail of this process is below;

:1. An action potential arrives at the presynaptic membrane.
:2. The action potential causes calcium channels to open, thus uptake of calcium ions.
:3. The calcium ions cause vesicles containg acetylcholine (a transmitter substance) to fuse with the presynaptic membrane
:4. Acetylcholine is then released and diffuses across the synaptic cleft.
:5. The acetylcholine molecules then bind with the postsynaptic membranes receptors, opening sodium channels.
:6. The sodium ions that consequently flood in depolarise the membrane and initiate an action potential.
;7. Acetylcholine is hydrolysed and diffuses back across the synaptic into the presynaptic neurone.

To prevent acetylcholine keeping the sodium channels open, creating continuous action potentials, the synaptic cleft contains acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that splits each Ach molecule into acetate and choline. The choline is then taken back to the presynaptic neurone, and combined with acetyl co-enzyme A to form ACh once more, and prepares in vesicles for the enxt action potential.

====Neuromuscular junctions====

This is between a motor neurone and a muscle where the nerve forms motor end plates, and the synapse is called the neuromuscluar junction.

===Roles===

So why do we have synapses - they slow down a stimulus response since they break up the route.

*Synapses increase the range of reactions in response to a stimulus - the action potentials created by neurones come together at synapses, and your reaction can be determined by this - if you have to decide whether to pull out at a junction for example, action potentials from your eyes and ears telling your brain there is a car comig will make it more difficult for the action potentials from your brain thinking 'I'm late'. Action potentials from your eyes and ears outweigh. However, reflex reactions are quick and automatic, and the value of a rapid response is greater than a considered one if it saves your life.

*Synapses are involved in memory and learning. 

*Synapses ensure one-way transmission, allowing signals to be directed and not spread at random.
note: Synapses travel in one direction because only the presynaptic neurone has vesicles containing neurotransmitter
      Receptors are found on the postsynaptic neurone
*Summation.( low frequency impulses that produce insufficient amounts of neurotransmitter to trigger a new action potential in the postsynaptic neurone,can be made to do so by a process of summation. This entails a build-up of neurotransmitter in the synapse by:
1. a number of different presynaptic neurones together release enough neurotransmitter to trigger a new action potential
2. a single presynaptic neurone releases neurotransmitter many times over a short period.
note: if neurotransmitter exceeds threshold value of postsynaptic neurone a new action potential is triggered.

===Other chemicals===

Nicotine: Similar in shape to ACh molecules and will fit into the receptors on the postsynaptic membranes, initiating action potentials were there are none, and is not broken down by enzymes and so stays for a longer time.

Organophosphorous insecticides inhibit the enzyme that breaks down ACh, allowing continuous production of action potentials, and several nerve gases work in this way.

Botulinum: A toxin produced by bacterium that prevents the release of ACh, and is usually fatal to consume.

=Plant growth regulators=

Plants also need communication systems providing co-ordination in their bodies and very little of it is electrical signals like those of an action potential - it is usually chemicals known as plant hormones and plant growth regulators. These chemicals can be produced in a variety of tissues in small quantities. You are only required to know about auxins, gibberellins and absicisic acid. 

===Auxins===

Auxins are involved in determining whether a plant grows upwards or whether it branches sideways, and is synthesised in the growing tips of roots and shoots, where cells are dividing.The presence of an apical bud - an active growing point at its apex - prevents lateral, branching buds growing and is known as apical dominance. High quantities (relatively) of auxin are transported to lateral buds such that it inhibits their growth, and removal of the apical bud allows for their growth. It is thought that auxin is not the only player here - cytokinins and abscisic acid are thought to be involved.

===Gibberellins===
[[Image:Budowa nasienia-dwuliscienne.png|thumb|180px|Diagram of the internal structure of a dicot seed and embryo. (a) seed coat, (b) endosperm, (c) cotyledon, (d) hypocotyl.]]
Giberellins are plant growth regulators and are synthesised in most places, particularly in young leaves and seeds.

====Seed germination====

In some seeds, gibberellins control germination to a certain extent. A seed shed from its parent lies in a state of dormancy, metabolically inactive and thus can survive in adverse conditions. The seed contains an embryo, which grows to form the new plant when the seed germinates, and is surrounded by endosperm tissue which is a food store containing starch. The outer edge is a protein-rich aleurone layer, and the whole seed is covered by a tough waterproof layer.

When the seed absorbs water, gibberellin production begins, which stimulates the synthesis of amylase by the aleurone layer. Amylase hydrolyses the starch, converting it to maltose, which is then converted to glucose and the embryo uses respires this to begin to grow. Gibberellin acts a regulator for the genes that synthesise amylase.

====In stems====

Gibberellins partly control the height of some plants, and is in turn conrolled by their genes. The dominant allele of the tallness gene synthesises an enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of gibberellin, stimulating cell division and stem elongation.

===Abscisic acid===

Absicics acid, also known as ABA, is found in almost every plant, and is synthesised in almost every cell that possesss chloroplasts or amyloplasts.

====Stomatal closure====

One role of ABA is responding to any stressful conditions that the plant may experience - high temperatures, low water supplies, and the plant reacts by secreting ABA, causing the stomata to close, reducing loss of water vapour from the leaf. It achieves this by increases the turgor of the guard cells by actively transporting hydrogen ions out of the guard cell, making potassium ions move into the cell. The extra potassium ions lower the solute and water potential, and water moves in via osmosis opening the stomata. It is thought that ABA binds to the proton pump and does not regulate the expression of genes like gibberellin.

====Leaf abscission====
Keep in mind, leaf abscission has nothing to do with absicic acid. Leaves fall because the leaf stalk breaks off from the stem. These are the stages;

*Useful substances are withdrawn from the leaves and taken into the stem, involving the breakdown of some pigments, causing the colour change of leaves.
*An abscission zone forms where the leaf stalk meets the stem - a separation layer on the leaves side, made of small cells with thin cell walls. Nearest the stem is the protective layer, made of cells whose walls contain suberin, a waxy waterproof cell.
*Enzymes then break down the cell walls at the separation layer and the leaf stalk breaks at this point

Auxin concentration is usually low in an absicsed leaf, indicating it may be to blame, but high concentrations of auxin applied later can promote leaf abscission.

[http://curric.dlib.vt.edu/papers/ETD07-DLcurric-06122007-draft-clean.doc Improving Education and Understanding of NDLTD]
Paper and data submitted to ETD Symposium '07 by the digital library curriculum development group.

''Abstract:''

To understand ETDs, what NDLTD is, how it works, and the benefits of NDLTD, it is necessary to educate those involved, such as students who will create and submit their ETDs, as well as the library staff members who will be participating in NDLTD and administering their local system.  To help educators prepare digital library (DL) courses supportive of their goals, our DL curriculum group has been developing educational modules and conducting field analyses since January 2006.  
This paper is a follow-up to our previous study of the subject distribution of ACM DL papers, JCDL papers, and D-Lib Magazine articles.  In this paper, we focus on the selected DL modules that might help scholars conduct their research and share their knowledge.  The contents are:
*Revised DL educational module framework: Based on our analysis of hundreds of DL papers, we identified 10 core topical areas, and 43 sub-areas.  A detailed diagram is provided.
*After discussion, our team selected several DL modules which might be the most relevant to scholars’ research endeavors.  Especially, those modules are important to fully utilize ETDs.  The module numbers and their descriptions are presented.
*To help scholars navigate and study the corresponding ETD Guide (www.etdguide.org) sections, we mapped the selected DL modules into the Guide sections.  The section numbers, titles and starting page numbers are also provided.  
*In our previous study, we’ve collected DL course syllabi in the computer science (CS) and the library and information science (LIS) areas.  Then the readings were retrieved from the syllabi collections.  These readings were classified into the selected DL modules.  They are presented here; the complete data can be accessed from our project web site.
Increased understanding about DLs might improve scholars’ research efficiency and effective-ness as well as universities’ participation in NDLTD.  We invite the ETD community to assist with module development and evaluation so students, scholars, and staff will know more about DLs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The UNESCO Guide for Creating Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) aims to help all those interested in projects and programs involving ETDs. To the extent possible, it has the eventual goal of aiding all students at all universities to be able to create electronic documents and to use digital libraries. It has particular focus on the emerging genre of ETDs, which should enhance the quality, content, form, and impact of scholarly communication that involves students engaged in research. It should help universities to develop their local infrastructure, especially regarding electronic publishing and digital libraries, which in turn build upon networking, computing, multimedia, and related technologies. In so doing, it should promote the sharing of knowledge locked up in universities, and the collaboration of universities spanning across all countries and continents, from North to South, from East to West, from developing to developed, from public to private, and from large to small. The ultimate effect may be one of the world's largest sustainable programs for diffusion of knowledge, across all fields, including science, technology, and culture. 

This work should be of interest to diverse audiences. Its various sections (see discussion in section 1.6) are aimed to address the needs of universities (including administrators and faculty), students (including those who wish to create ETDs as well as those who wish to make use of already-created works), and those involved in training or setting up ETD projects or programs.  Ample technical details are covered to support the needs of students wishing to apply multimedia methods to enhance their ability to communicate complex results, as well as the requirements of staff building a local support infrastructure 
to help such students. 

This work is a living document that will continue to be updated in connection with the work of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD, www.ndltd.org). It was born as a result of the support provided by UNESCO in grants given to Virginia Tech and University of Montreal.  It was prepared by an international team of faculty and staff; coordinated by Shalini Urs. Its organization and content are the result of the editorial labor of Joseph Moxley. Its availability in a broad range of languages is the result of teams of translators, some funded in part by UNESCO, and others volunteering their assistance. 

While the development of a comprehensive worldwide program of ETDs of necessity builds upon an enormous range of knowledge and experience, it is hoped that this work will suffice as an initial Guide. We hope that those who read some or all of the sections contained herein will build upon the foundation laid out in the Introduction, so they understand the key ideas and are energized to move forward to advance the cause.  In keeping with the goals of NDLTD, we hope that people around the globe who are interested in ETDs will help each other, and together transform graduate education, promote understanding, vastly expand access to new discoveries, and empower the next generation of researchers to become effective leaders of the Information Age.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETDs can be managed through automated procedures honed to take advantage of modern networked
information systems. Since the shift to ETDs requires policy and process discussion among campus
stakeholders, it is possible to streamline workflow and save time and labor. Checking of submissions and
cataloging is sped up, moving and handling of paper copies is eliminated, and delays for binding are
removed. The time between submission and graduation can be reduced, and ETDs can be made available
for access within days or weeks rather than months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first real activity directed toward ETDs was a meeting convened by Nick Altair of UMI in Ann Arbor, Michigan during the fall of 1987 involving participants from Virginia Tech, ArborText, SoftQuad, and University of Michigan. Discussion focussed on the latest approaches to electronic publishing and the idea of applying the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, an ISO standard approved in 1985) to the preparation of dissertations, possibly as an extension of the Electronic Manuscript Project. In 1988, Yuri Rubinsky of SoftQuad was funded by Virginia Tech to help develop the first Document Type Definition (DTD) to specify the structure of ETDs using SGML. Pilot studies continued using SoftQuad’s AuthorEditor tool, but only with the appearance of Adobe’s Acrobat software and Portable Document Format (PDF) in the early 1990s did it become clear that students could easily prepare their own ETDs.

In 1992 Virginia Tech joined with the Coalition for Networked Information, the Council of Graduate Schools, and UMI, to invite ten other universities to select three representatives each, from their library, graduate school/program, and computing/information technology groups. This meeting in Washington, D.C. demonstrated the strong interest in and feasibility of ETD activities among US and Canadian universities. In 1993, the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) and Southeastern Library Network (Solinet) decided to include ETD efforts in regional electronic library plans. Virginia Tech hosted another meeting involving multiple universities in Blacksburg, VA in 1994 to develop specific plans regarding ETD projects. On the technical side, the decision was made that whenever feasible, students should prepare ETDs using appropriate multimedia standards in addition to both a descriptive (e.g., SGML) and rendered (e.g., PDF) form for the main work.

Then, in 1996, the pace of ETD activities sped up. SURA funded a project led by Virginia Tech to spread the concept around the Southeastern Unted States. Starting in September 1996, the US Department of Education funded a three-year effort to spread the concept around the USA. The pilot project that had proceeded at Virginia Tech led to a mandatory requirement for all theses and dissertations submitted after 1996 to be submitted (only) in electronic form. International interest spread the concept to Canada, UK, Germany, and other countries. To coordinate all these efforts, the free, voluntary federation called NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations) was established and quickly began to expand. Annual meetings began in the spring of 1998 with about 20 people gathering in Memphis, TN. In 1999 about 70 came to Blacksburg, VA while in 2000 about 225 arrived in St. Petersburg, FL for the third annual conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A key method to gain access to ETDs is through browsing. Browsing promotes serendipity, in analogous fashion to when a person looks around in library stacks, picking up and glancing at a number of works, typically ones that are relatively close to each other.

Browsing often involves a researcher in a learning process connecting with the concepts, areas, and vocabulary used in a particular field. A researchers often moves around in &quot;concept space&quot;, seeing what concepts are broader and which are narrower, which are related, and which are examples or applications of theories or methods. Thus, in the case of medical works, browsing often encourages researchers to think about diseases, treatments, location in an organism (or human body or subsystem thereof), symptoms, and other considerations.  In many fields, browsing involves exploring a taxonomic system, managing an organization chart or hierarchical structure, or moving from a term to a more focused noun phrase.

In many disciplines, there are official classification systems. Some are quite broad, in some cases covering all areas, as is the case when using the subject headings prepared by the US Library of Congress (LCSH), or the Dewey Decimal Classification system (DDC, available from Forest Press, owned by OCLC). However, for in-depth characterization of a research work in a particular field, it is more appropriate to use the category system for the field. In computing, the ACM system is popular. In medicine, MeSH or UMLS are widely used. In physics, PACS is widely used. Gradually, digital library support for ETDs will support browsing using both broad schemes like DDC, as well as narrow schemes like PACS, integrated synergistically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETD submission over networks has zero cost, which compares favorably with the charges of hundreds or
thousands of dollars otherwise required to print, copy, or publish TDs using paper or other media forms.
In many institutions, the networking, computing, and software resources available to students suffice so
that students preparing ETDs need make no additional expenditure. Similarly, on many campuses,
assistance is available to answer questions and train students regarding word processing and other skills
valuable for authors of electronic documents and users of digital libraries. If students elect to use
personal computers and acquire their own software to use in ETD creation, these will later be useful in
other research and development work, for both professional and personal needs, with low marginal
expense specifically required for ETDs. Thus, it is typical that the pros far outweigh the cons regarding
students preparing ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With thousands of students each year preparing ETDs, the creativity of the newest generation of scholars 
is being continuously expressed as they work to present their research results using the most appropriate 
form, structure, and content. While conforming as needed to the requirements of their institution, 
department, and discipline, students should develop and apply skills that will best prepare them for their 
future careers and lead to the most expressive rendering possible of their discoveries and ideas. Thus, 
ETDs are a new genre of documents, continuously re-defined as technology and student knowledge 
evolve. 
 
The first benefit is that new, better types of TDs may emerge as ETDs develop as a genre. Rather than 
being bound by the limits of old-style typewriters, students may be freed to include color diagrams and 
images, dynamic constructs like spreadsheets, interactive forms such as animations, and multimedia 
resources including audio and video. To ensure preservation of the raw data underlying their work, 
promote learning from their experience, and facilitate confirmation of their findings, they may enhance 
their ETDs by including the key datasets that they have assembled. 
 
As the new genre of ETDs emerges from this growing community of scholars, it is likely to build upon 
earlier forms. Simplest are documents that can be thought of as “electronic paper” where the underlying 
authoring goal is to produce a paper form, perhaps with color used in diagrams and images. Slightly 
richer are documents that have links, as in hypertext, at least from tables of contents, tables of figures, 
tables of tables, and indexes – all pointing to target locations in the body of the document. To facilitate 
preservation, some documents may be organized in onion-fashion, with a core mostly containing text 
(that thus may be printable), appendices including multimedia content following international standards, 
and supplemental files including data and interactive or dynamic forms that may be harder to migrate as 
the years pass by. Programs, applets, simulations, virtual environments, and other constructs yet to be 
discovered may be shared by students who aim to communicate their findings using the most suitable objects and representations

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once ETDs are available, through diverse means, others may gain access.  In particular, such access may be the only recourse open to those in developing countries who cannot afford to make purchases from Proquest, who cannot wait for expensive shipping of copies through interlibrary loan, who cannot attend the myriad conferences that demand the considerable expenses related to travel, or who cannot pay for expensive journals (that only may have short summaries of thesis or dissertation results).

Access may result from word of mouth, from search, from announcements, or by following links or citations. They may occur quickly after a work is made known to those whose works are referred to or to those who employ Selective Dissemination of Information services. They may occur intermediated by digital library systems or similar mechanisms. They may result when ETDs are referred to journal articles, conference papers, reports, course notes, and other forms.

Numerically, if theses and dissertations are all released as ETDs, the number of works per year may be around the number of journal articles published by university students. The number may be 20-50% of the number of journal articles prepared by the faculty. Regarding students, in most cases, an ETD will be the only publication of an author.  If the number who read ETDs is 10 or 100 times the number who read a paper thesis, then it is clear that there will be a significant increase in access to university research as a result of an ETD program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There continues to be rapid growth and development of ETD activities around the world. Whether such efforts arise spontaneously or as extensions of existing efforts, it is hoped that all will proceed in cooperative fashion so universities can help each other in a global collaboration [4], passing on lessons learned as well as useful tools and information. The mission of NDLTD is to facilitate such progress in a supportive rather than prescriptive manner.  Over 100 members joined NDLTD by 2000, including over 80 universities in addition to national and regional project efforts; international, national, and regional organizations; and interested companies and associations. The only requirement for joining NDLTD is interest in advancing ETD activities, so it is hoped this will help ensure global cooperation.

A number of groups involved in NDLTD are particularly interested in supporting efforts in developing countries. The sharing of research results through ETDs is one of the fastest ways for scholars working in developing countries to become known and have an impact on the advancement of knowledge. It also is one of the easiest and least costly ways for universities in developing countries to become involved in digital library activities and to become known for their astute deployment of relevant and helpful technologies. The Organization of American States, UNESCO, and other groups are playing a most supportive role in facilitating this process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Each student could develop a bibliography reflecting his or her work, and a collective bibliography would emerge encompassing all of a faculty member's advisees.

* A student's acquired expertise will not completely leave with that student but will remain to help bootstrap new students (and new interests of the faculty member).

* The efforts of students working with a faculty member can be known to a wider audience. This would provide publicity and enhanced visibility for the student and that student's lab and major professor.

* Students who know how to use tools, such as Microsoft Word's tracking or commenting features, are better prepared for future e-publishing; they can use these tools for future collaboration and mentoring, which should save the faculty member time with the reviews and revisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most documents created today are prepared with the aid of computers. Many universities have &quot;writing
across the curriculum&quot; programs, to ensure that students can create electronic documents that convey
their knowledge and understanding, and demonstrate their ability to participate in the scholarly
communication process.
To function as effective knowledge workers, students must go beyond word processing skills that lead
only to paper documents. They must learn to work with others, to share their findings by transmitting
their results to others. This teamwork makes it feasible to collaborate, to co-author works, and thus to
participate in research groups or teams, which are common throughout the research world (at the very
least involving a faculty advisor and graduate student author). It also makes it pertinent for students to
participate in common activities of modern researchers. Thus, they can be trained to submit a proposal
electronically (e.g., as is required by the US's National Science Foundation) and to submit a paper to a
conference (where papers are uploaded by authors, and downloaded by editors/reviewers, as part of the
collection and selection activities).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Originality is a defining feature of academic research. Using new media can empower you to conduct
research in new ways. As suggested by the Exemplary ETDs, you can incorporate streaming video,
interviews of subjects and settings, which readers can then view, which could be particularly useful for a
case study or ethnographically informed research. You can provide different reading pathways for
multiple audiences. For example, inexperienced lay audiences can have a more simplified version of your
study, whereas more technical audiences can have more detailed analysis and citations. The technology
allows you to present your work in new and different ways. For example, in your research you can
include audio, video, and animations. You can add spreadsheets, databases, and simulations. You can
even create virtual reality worlds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Having an ETD helps build your career. Your work is published in a timely manner, visible, and easily
accessible. Timely publication makes your up-to-the-minute research instantly available. Upon
publication, ETDs immediately become part of the NDLTD and are available for use by anyone having
access to the Internet. Visibility allows people inside and outside of the academic arena to see and use
your research. Just having an ETD can multiply the number of times your work is read. This exposure
increases the possibilities that your work will be cited in others' publications, which adds to your prestige
and can help your future advancement. Accessibility makes reading and using your work easy. Instead of
having to request and await the arrival of a printed copy, your work immediately displays on a computer
screen and can be printed on demand. By using today's communication tools wisely, you can save time
and produce a more influential work. You can manage your information so you know where you’ve kept
your notes; use powerful search tools to gather information and manage evaluations and revisions; and
use interpretation tools for quantitative and qualitative documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many universities have little or no involvement in digital library efforts. Yet, it is clear that most universities will have digital library efforts as part of, or in addition to, conventional library efforts. Digital libraries are of particular value when distance education is involved or when a university has a number of far flung sites. They also can promote more flexible access to information (e.g., 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, from home or office, with no blocking because another person has borrowed a work).

Establishing an ETD program automatically moves a university into the digital library era.  Free software available through NDLTD, or from NDLTD members, is available that allows a university to develop its own digital library. Setting up that digital library helps the university bring together the personnel and infrastructure required for other digital library projects, too. Though the demands are small, the digital library that emerges will force consideration of almost all of the key concerns of those who work with digital libraries. Also, since various sponsors interested in digital library technology are helping in many ETD projects, there will be a continual enhancement of the digital library services that relate to improving local infrastructure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once ETDs are collected on behalf of educational institutions, digital library technology makes it easy for
works to be found. Through http://www.theses.org/, NDLTD directly makes ETDs
available, and points to other services that facilitate such discovery. As a result, hundreds or thousands of
accesses per year per work are logged, for example, according to reports from the Virginia Tech library
regarding the ETDs it makes publicly accessible. As the collection of available ETDs grows and reaches
critical mass, it is likely that it will be frequently consulted by the millions of researchers and graduate
students interested in such detailed studies, expositions of new methodologies, reviews of the literature on
specialized topics, extensive bibliographies, illustrative figures and tables, and highly expressive
multimedia supplements. Thus, students and student works will become more visible, facilitating
advances in scholarship and leading to increased collaboration, each made possible by electronic
communication, across space and time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Graduate Education==

Around the globe, people have diverse views toward graduate students and graduate education. Some
universities have strong advocacy for graduate students, often involving a graduate school and graduate
dean. Others have no focus whatsoever on graduate students as a group, with all support thereof assumed
to come by way of faculty mentors and advisors. Regardless of the local context; however, few would
argue that graduate students should have fundamental knowledge and skills that will allow them to be
effective researchers.

==ETDs in Graduate Education==

Accordingly, the move toward ETDs aims to enhance graduate education in effective researching.
Building on the fact that students learn best by doing, this move encourages students to create and submit
their own ETDs, thus learning a bit about electronic publishing and digital libraries in the context of
preparing a work that is of importance to them. In particular, they need to gain some knowledge and skill
in electronic document preparation, understanding not only the superficial aspects of relevant tools, but
also beginning to learn about such processes as archiving, preservation, cataloging, indexing, resource
discovery, searching, and browsing.

==Aids in Communication==

Furthermore, once students become exposed to electronic documentation preparation processes, they
often become aware of aids to help them communicate. Tools can be utilized to help with figures and drawing, to assist with analysis and graphing, or to support sharing and interactive exploration of data
(e.g., through spreadsheets or database management systems). Images can be prepared as thumbnails that
go into the body of a document to help the reader, as well as in varying sizes and resolutions to promote
in-depth analysis.

==Readership and Quality==

Beyond these tools and aids, however, is the fact that authors spend more time when their likely
readership is large. Students will tend to produce higher quality work, and faculty will demand better
writing and clearer presentation of results, if the audience for a work numbers in the hundreds or
thousands, as opposed to the common current situation where a mere handful will read the document.
With ETDs leading to large numbers of accesses, many students and faculty will work hard to enhance
quality beyond that commonplace prior to the advent of ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once a student embarks upon the process of creating an ETD, this student will  be assured of a large increase in the number of readers. Such an audience emerges when ETDs are locatable because of searches using popular search engines and/or are available for other students as well as more advanced researchers to draw upon.  Many look for the large bibliographies and comprehensive literature reviews found in ETDs. Others look for in-depth discussion of research methods. Some seek data sets to use for follow-up studies. A growing number of faculty use ETD collections as reference sources, saving space on their shelves or time required to walk to a library. Some also refer to ETDs in classes or in homework assignments, especially where there are important results and/or clear expressions of concepts and ideas.

Through such ETDs, students can communicate more effectively.  Color figures are much easier to attain, in many situations, than those limited to black and white. Complex tables can be built, with sorting and subtotals incorporated, because of software tools. Spreadsheets or simulations help readers gain hands-on familiarity with data and analysis, promoting a deeper understanding. For those studying phenomena that could be characterized with color photos (using digital cameras or scanners), digital video sequences, audio files, medical images, or other digital representations. Thus, expanded and more effective communication of research results can be aided by usage of ETDs.

Once a student embarks upon the process of creating an ETD, that student can be assured of a one or more order of magnitude increase in the number of readers. Such an audience emerges when ETDs are locatable because of searches using popular search engines and/or are available for other students as well as more advanced researchers to draw upon.  Many look for the large bibliographies and comprehensive literature reviews found in ETDs. Others look for in-depth discussion of research methods. Some seek data sets to use for follow-up studies. A growing number of faculty use ETD collections as reference sources, saving space on their shelves or time required to walk to a library. Some also refer to ETDs in classes, or in homework assignments, especially where there are important results and/or clear expressions of concepts and ideas.

At Virginia Tech, for example, many popular theses and dissertations are available to the public electronically. In 1996, there were 25,829 requests for ETD abstracts and 4,600 requests for ETDs themselves; by 1999 (January-August), there were over 143,056 requests for abstracts and 244,987 requests for ETDs. As of October 1999, the most popular ETD at VT had been requested over 75,000 times (see VT's download statistics at http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/data/pdatah.htm).

      <text xml:space="preserve">As more and more ETDs become available at universities or through their agents, more and more students will draw upon the emerging digital library of ETDs. This will make it easier for students to learn of the work of other students. Contact is quite feasible since many ETDs include email addresses and other contact information, of faculty helpers/advisors at least if it is not feasible to track down a graduating student author. Once contact is made, it is possible to have further discussion of references, application of methodologies, reuse of datasets, and extension of prior work, as well as investigation of remaining open problems. This may lead to friendships, collaborations, joint publications, and other benefits. Such may expand beyond student-student relationships to also include faculty, groups, laboratory teams, and other communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The underlying purpose of ETD activities is to prepare the next generation of scholars to function
effectively as knowledge workers in the Information Age. By institutionalizing this in a worldwide
program, progress can be made toward tripartite goals of enhancing graduate education, promoting
sharing of research, and supporting university collaboration. Particular objectives include:
* students knowing how to contribute to and use digital libraries;
* universities developing digital library services and infrastructure;
* enhanced sharing of university research results; and
* ETDs having higher quality and becoming more expressive of student findings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since in most cases it is in the interest of students and universities to maximize the visibility of their research results, the general approach of NDLTD is to encourage all parties interested to facilitate access to ETDs.

As part of the education component of NDLTD, it is hoped that graduate students will become facile with searching through electronic collections, especially those in digital libraries. If we regard managing information as a basic human need, ensuring that the next generation of scholars has such skill seems an appropriate minimal objective. Most specifically, since graduate research often builds upon prior results from other graduate researchers, it seems sensible for all ETD authors to be able to search through available ETD holdings. NDLTD encourages online resources, self-study materials, individual assistance, as well as group training activities be provided so that graduate students become knowledgeable about resource discovery, searching, query construction, query refinement, citation services, and other processes – both for ETDs and for content in their discipline.

      <text xml:space="preserve">NDLTD runs the Web site http://www.theses.org/ (also under the alias http://www.dissertations.org/) as a central clearinghouse for access to ETDs.  This site points to various other locations that support portions of the worldwide holdings of ETDs. For example, the largest corporate archive, with over 1.5 million entries, is managed by UMI and has most doctoral dissertations from USA and Canada, as well as most masters’ theses from Canada, in microfilm form with metadata available as a searchable collection through Dissertation Abstracts. Since 1997 UMI has scanned new submissions (originally from microfilm, later directly from paper) and made the page images available through PDF files. With over 100,000 ETDs accessible through subscription or direct payment mechanisms, UMI hosts the largest single collection of both electronic and microfilm TDs.

Other corporations as well as local, regional, national, and international groups associated with NDLTD have Web sites too, such as http://www.cybertheses.org/[1] for the International Francophone project or http://www.dissonline.org/ for the German Dissertation online project.   In addition, a number of WWW search engines have indexed some of the ETD collections available so this genre is included in general Web searches.

Some other schemes allow access to ETD collections. Using Z39.50, the “information retrieval protocol”, for example, the Virginia Tech ETD collection can be accessed through suitable clients or from some library catalog systems. OCLC’s WorldCat service, with over 20 million catalog records, has an estimated 3.5 million entries for TDs. Perhaps most promising is that the global as well as regional and local metadata information about ETDs may become widely accessible through the Open Archives Initiative (http://www.openarchives.org/). 

The German &quot;Dissertation Online&quot; project was undertaken by the Initiative of Information and Communication of the German Learned Societies (http://www.iuk-initiative.org/index.shtml.en). This project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for 21/2 years (April 1998 - October 2000). The final conference took place in Berlin from October 30-31, 2000 (http://www.dissonline.de/abschlusstagung/index.html). The project worked at an integrative level and aimed towards a German wide initiative to bring scholarly publications, such as dissertations, diploma and master theses which are usually lost in libraries, online. Through the joint work of 6 academic disciplines (mathematics, physics, chemistry, educational sciences, computer science and libraries such as the State and University Library Lower Saxony (SUB Göttingen) and the German National Library (DDB: Die Deutsche Bibliothek)) which took place at several locations (Duisburg, Oldenburg, Erlangen, Berlin Computing Centre and School of Education, Göttingen, Frankfurt) the project was highly successful in Germany and elsewhere. A tight cooperation with the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD[2]), set up by Edward Fox from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA, was established.

The developments and the movement &quot;DissOnline.de&quot; resulted in establishing a bureau for coordination (Koordinierungsstelle DissOnline) at the German National Library (DDB). All German efforts taken are now coordinated and all developments (tools, guidelines, etc.) are collected by this bureau.

The main tasks of the original project still reflect the problem areas that have to be taken into consideration while setting up local, national or global projects on electronic theses and dissertations:

* Legal Issues
* Document formats
* Metadata
* Retrieval
* Multimedia
* Library issues
* Archiving 

The results of these different subtasks are integrated into the different sections that follow for students, universities, technical issues and trainers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Students are the most important participants in ETD activities. They are the main target of the education 
effort. They are the ones who learn by doing, and so promote access to the ETDs they prepare to help 
communicate their research results. 
This section of the Guide highlights issues of interest to students who write or refer to ETDs. It provides 
guidance on how they can proceed in these activities, as well as assistance to help them in understanding 
the context in which these activities take place. 
A wide variety of technologies and approaches are discussed. These should be considered in light of 
local policies and practices. In some cases students will want a simpler effort. In others they may wish to 
engage in more elaborate preparation of an ETD than is locally common, in order to learn, and/or in 
order to be more expressive in their scholarly communication.  It is hoped that the content in section 3, as 
well as the more detailed technical information in section 4, is helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 2001, the National Research Council of the USA produced a booklet identifying many of the 
responsibilities, opportunities, and other issues faced by young faculty as well as graduate students 
completing their theses or dissertations.  Similar groups have prepared other works. In particular, it is 
clear that there have been dramatic changes in scholarship that have resulted from the availability of 
computer tools, the shift to digital libraries, and the tremendous increase in resources available to young 
researchers (with respect to computing, networking, and content).  Such researchers should learn about 
electronic publishing, should use digital libraries, should be aware of intellectual property rights, and 
should leverage new opportunities made available through the enhancement of related technologies and 
infrastructure.  These all encourage involvement in ETD activities, and lifelong participation in the world 
of scholarly communication that in many cases was first made visible to them in connection with their 
ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Corel WordPerfect Suite provides another possibility to produce large documents. It is a system like 
Microsoft Word, but sold by another vendor: Corel Inc. (see http://www.corel.com). It contains nearly the 
same features and capabilities as Microsoft Word. For writing a complex document like a thesis or 
dissertation using WordPerfect, it is advisable to use style sheets that are provided by the system itself or by 
the university. Those style sheets are called WordPerfect templates (WPT). They allow the users to 
structure their documents using structure components like headings, tables, lists, etc. Default style sheets 
can be used by clicking on File / New / and than choose one of the templates. 
Usually there has been a native WordPerfect template produced in order to help you with additional drop- 
down menus, etc. To use the provided template for WordPerfect 8, you have to choose File / New / Options 
/ Add Project / Add New Document / Call it &quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; / Search for dissertation.WPT. This 
allows you to use the WordPerfect style sheet by choosing under the main window: File / New / Choose 
&quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; and Create. This enables the functions of the drop-down menu as in the following 
figure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why should one use FrameMaker instead of MS Word? ==
 
Framemaker provides in comparison to Microsoft Word a much more sophisticated tool for electronic 
publishing and for a cross-media publishing. 

It allows: 
*Production of real and large structured text (not just address cards) (and is stable handling those). 
*Production of semantically structured text (not just text that uses style sheets). 
*Provision of a WYSIWYG user interface to edit XML documents, instead of an XML tree editor à la Spy or Xeena. 
*Capabilities of producing a good-looking paper version of a document with all layout features that are professionally used at printing companies. 


Framemaker+SGML especially combines the power of an excellent word processor (better than MS 
Word) with a good structure editor. 

In order to produce structures documents and some sort of style sheets, one has to learn FrameMaker's 
EDD language. 

As FrameMaker belong to the product family of Adobe, it provides an add-on to produce a high quality 
PDF, as digital preprint copy of a written document. 


== Using FrameMaker+SGML6.0 for a conversion of MS Word documents into SGML instances. ==
 
Editing or converting using FrameMaker is much more complex than the previously described methods. 
FrameMaker is able to import formatted Word documents keeping the stylesheet information and 
exporting the document via an internal FrameMaker format as SGML or XML documents. 

In order to proceed with a conversion using FrameMaker, you will need the following configuration files: 
a conversion table that contains the list of the Word styles and the corresponding elements within the 
FrameMaker internal format.  This table is saved within the FrameMaker internal format (*.frm). 

A document type definition will be saved within FrameMaker internally as EDD (Element Definition). It 
is saved within the FrameMaker internal document format (*.edd). 

FrameMaker uses layout rules for the internal layouting of documents. Within this layout definition, the 
layout of documents is described just like it is within MS Word documents:  single formats and their 
appearances like text height, etc., are defined. This file is also stored as (*.frm file). 

The Read-Write Rules contain rules that define which FrameMaker format will be exported in which 
SGML / XML element. 

The SGML- or XML DTD has to be used as well, including Catalog- or Entity files, as well as Sub 
DTDs, like CALS for tables. 

To process a conversion, a new SGML application has to be defined within FrameMaker+SGML. This 
application links all files that are needed for a conversion as described above. It enables FrameMaker to 
parse the output file when exporting a document to SGML or XML. 

A workflow and a technology for conversion to ETD using FrameMaker+SGML6.0 was first developed 
at the Technical University Helsinki, within the HUTPubl project (1997-2000), see 

http://www.hut.fi/Yksikot/Kirjasto/HUTpubl. 

You can find more information about using FrameMaker+SGML for an XML Authoring at 
http://tecfa.unige.ch/guides/xml/frame-sgml/html/quick-fm-xml-guide.html. (See also Danny R. Vint “SGML at Work”, Prentice Hall, New Jersey, 1999.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally speaking, there are several possibilities for producing PDF document from a LaTeX document.

== Using Postscript and scalable fonts for PDF  ==

&quot;One of the most confusing issues in both Postscript and PDF is the handling of different types of fonts. 
A PDF-producing application can deal with a font in one of three ways: First it can take the entire font 
and embed it in the file; second it can make a subset; or third it can simply embed some summary details 
about the font (such as its name, metrics, its encoding, its type - sans serif, symbol, for example - and 
clues about its design) and rely on the display application to show something plausible. This last strategy 
is preferred for documents that are to be delivered on the Web, since it creates the smallest files. The 
display application can work again in several ways. It can try to find the named fonts on the local system; 
it can simply substitute fonts as intelligently as possible; or it can use Multiple Master fonts to mimic the 
appearance of the original font.&quot; (from Goosens; Rahtz: The LaTeX Web Companion, page 29) 

The default installation of dvips uses fonts with a fixed resolution (.pk fonts) encoded as 300dpi (dots per 
inch) bitmaps. This is unnoticeable for printing; however, the resulting PDF files are barely legible when 
scaled down to today's screen resolutions (typically 72dpi). These fonts are embedded in Postscript 
Output as Type 3 fonts. Acrobat Distiller cannot handle those fonts, because there are no font descriptors 
available. It leaves them embedded in PDF files and renders them very badly, although printing those 
documents doesn't make too many differences, if the original resolution was high enough. 

Therefore it is necessary to install Postscript Type 1 fonts (True Type) for the dvips program. Many 
commonly used fonts have been converted to Type 1 fonts, e.g.: All Computer Modern family fonts, all 
fonts from the American Mathematical Society, the St. Mary's Road symbol fonts, the RSFS script fonts, 
the TIPA phonetic fonts and the XY-pic fonts. 

The Type 1 Computer Modern fonts are provided by Virginia Tech and part of this guide (cmps.tgz / 
cmps.tar.gz). These files are about 5 MB. 
To install the fonts you have to… 

''On standard LINUX systems they are already installed:''

1.      Copy all files which are in the gz-archive under the directory pfb into the directory, in which dvips looks for fonts, e.g. /usr/local/teTex/texmf/fonts. 

2.      In the directory e.g. /usr/local/teTex/texmf/dvips/misc there is a file psfonts.map. Please add the 
content of the files cmfonts.map, cyrfonts.map, eufonts.map,and lafonts.map to that file. They are 
provided with this cmps.tgz archive. 

3.      The config.ps file is usually used for defining the resolution. This is irrelevant, because dvips now 
uses the scalable fonts instead of the bitmapped pk fonts. 

4.      The afm und pfm directory in the archive is not used by dvips. 


''To obtain a ps-file which uses Postscript fonts and is 
convertible into PDF you have to run the following 
command sequence:'' 

1.      latex mydissertation.tex. 

2.      bibtex mydissertation.aux if bibtex is used. 

3.      latex mydissertation.tex. 

4.      dvips -P cmz mydissertation.dvi:   This produces a file dissertation.ps that is printable on a printer, 
or convertible into PDF. 

5.      If Acrobat Distiller is installed on the system &quot;distill mydissertation.ps&quot; which produces a PDF file: 
mydissertation.pdf. 


== Producing Rich PDF ==


Producing a WWW-readable PDF is just the first part of a PDF production. It is more sophisticated to 
produce a PDF file that takes advantage of the hypertext features of PDF and adds links and cross- 
references to a PDF file. 

You can use the Adobe Exchange software under Windows/Macintosh to add links, etc., to a ready 
produced PDF file, or you can produce those features directly from LaTeX using the Hyperref-package. 
This package has been developed by Sebastian Rahtz and uses the outcome of the Hypertex project. 

This package extends the capabilities of the LaTeX cross-referencing commands (TOC,bibliographies, 
etc.) to produce \special commands that a driver can turn into hypertext links. It also defines new 
commands for LaTeX. 

''For using hyperref a global option can be used within the LaTeX file:'' 

\documentclass[dvips]{article} 

\usepackage{hyperref} 
 

In order to produce PDF-information, it is possible to insert title and author information that are then 
displayed in the PDF file as follows: 

''In LaTeX:'' 

\documentclass[dvips]{article} 

\usepackage[ 

pdfauthor={Susanne Dobratz}, 

pdftitle={ Test of the  pdftex Package }, 

pdfcreator={pdftex}, 

pdfsubject={electronic publishing in LaTeX}, 

pdfkeywords={keyword1,keyword2} 

]{hyperref} 
 

''This looks in PDF like this:''
 
%PDF-1.2 

%âãÏÓ 

1 0 obj 

&lt;&lt; 

/CreationDate (D:191010522170228) 

/Keywords (keyword1,keyword2) 

/Creator (pdftex) 

/Title (Test of the  pdftex Package) 

/Producer (dvips + Distiller) 

/Author (Susanne Dobratz) 

/Subject (electronic publishing in LaTeX) 

&gt;&gt; 
 

The usual \label and \autoref commands are used to produce hyperlinks. The \autoref-command replaces 
therefore the usual \ref-command in LaTeX. So the following document structures are automatically 
referenced, if a \label has been applied. This also automatically produces Adobe-PDF bookmarks and 
hyperlinks to chapters, sections, etc. if the LaTeX command \tableofcontents is used. 

Within the LaTeX file there are some additional user macros available to produce hyperlinks: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

|\href{url}{text} 

|The text is used a hyperlink to the url . This URL must be a full URL (like http://www.cybertheses.org) 

|-

|\hyperbaseurl{url} 

|A base url is established, prepended to other specified URLs to make it easier to write PDF documents. 

|-

|\hyperimage{image url}

|The image referenced by the image url is inserted. 

|-

|\hyperdef{category} 
{name}{text} 

|A target area of the document (text) is marked and given the name category.name 

|-

|\hyperref{url}{category} 
{name}{text} 

|The text is made into a link to url#category.name 

|-

|\hyperref[label]{text} 

|The text becomes a link point to a point established with a \label command (using the symbolic name label). 

|}


''It is even possible to use Acrobat specific commands, e.g.menu options to 
navigate etc., like in this example from Sebastian Rahtz:'' 

\usepackage{fancyhdr} 

\pagestyle{fancy} 

\cfoot{\NavigationBar} 

\newcommand{\Navigationbar}{% 

\Acrobatmenu{PrevPage}{previous}~ 

\Acrobatmenu{NextPage}{next}~ 

\Acrobatmenu{FirstPage}{first}~ 

\Acrobatmenu{LastPage}{last}~ 

\Acrobatmenu{GoBack}{back}~ 

\Acrobatmenu{Quit}{quit}%} 
 

For further information and help, we recommend the book by Goosens/ Rahtz: The LaTeX Web 
Companion. 

The \special commands that are added by using the LaTeX macros have to be interpreted by DVI drivers 
or viewers in order to produce PDF links. 

''The following DVI drivers are supported by the hyperref package:'' 
*hypertex 
*dvips - writes \special commands to Postscript tailored for dvips 
*dvipsone - writes \special commands to Postscript tailored for dvipsone 
*pdftex - writes commands for pdftex, and produces PDF directly 
*dvipdfm - writes \special commands to be used for Mark Wicks'  DVI to PDF driver dvipdfm 
*dviwindo - writes \special commands to be used for Y&amp;Y's Windows previewer. It interprets them as jumps within the previewer 
*vtex - writes \special commands, which are interpreted as hypertext jumps for MicroPress'HTML and PDF producing TeX variants

== Using PDFTeX ==
 
PDFTex is a variant of Tex that produces directly a PDF output. Usually a Latex or Tex system produces 
a DVI output. PDFTex can also produce DVI output. 

You may use pdfTex instead of LaTex using macro packages as context or hyperref or others to write the 
actual document. 

&quot;When producing DVI output, for which one can use pdfTex as well as any other Tex, part of the job is 
delegated to the DVI postprocessor, either by directly providing this program with commands, or by 
means of \specials. Because pdfTex directly produces the final format, it has to do everything itself, from 
handling color, graphics, hyperlink support, font-inclusion, up to page imposition and page manipulation. 
As a direct result, when on uses a high level macro package, the macros that take care of these features 
have to be set up properly. 

Currently all mainstream macro packages offer pdfTex support in on way or the other. When using such 
a package, it makes sense to turn on this support in the appropriate way, otherwise one cannot be sure if 
things are set up right.&quot; (from the pdfTex User manual at 
http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdftexman.pdf). 

''The following main macro packages support pdfTex:'' 
for LaTeX users the hyperref package by Sebastian Rahtz 
the standard LaTeX graphics and color packages have pdfTex options 
the ConTeXt macro package by Hans Hagen has extended support for pdfTex

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some students who prepare an ETD undertake this effort as an independent. That is, they prepare a paper 
document as required by their university and turn that in, but are not allowed to submit an ETD to their 
degree granting institution.  If they understand about ETDs and realize the benefits of such works, if they 
know about creation and submission, they may elect to submit an ETD, such as to a service for 
independent ETD authors which are afforded by NDLTD or other groups.  In such cases, students are 
usually &quot;on their own&quot; and will follow instructions in this Guide or at other online sites, such as those 
hosted by Virginia Tech (http://etd.vt.edu). 

In addition to learning about ETDs from this guide or other online sources (see also from 
www.theses.org), students may be helped by local staff. Typically staff at institutions that are 
members of NDLTD will have a project in place, with personnel identified who can assist. Often there 
are two types of helpers. One type involves trainers. These typically run workshops or other training 
events or programs to help students to create ETDs. In some cases there are both basic and advanced 
training efforts, depending on the level of interest of the student and/or depending on how &quot;rich&quot; (in 
terms of use of multimedia content, for example) an ETD will be. 

The other type of helper is a person who provides assistance on demand. This may be a person who 
works in a campus New Media Center (see, for example, http://www.nmc.vt.edu). These 
centers may have a wide variety of multimedia devices (to capture images, audio, or video - as well as to 
help one create such resources from scratch). Alternatively, there may be people in one's own laboratory 
or department with particular expertise in creating certain types of digital works that might be an 
important part of an ETD.  In short, students should seek out such help where appropriate and work with 
trainers and mentors as desired to hone their knowledge and skills, as well as to prepare the very best 
ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETDs are prepared to facilitate scholarly communication. They are vehicles for transmitting the research 
results of a student, in the most effective way, to each person with interest. Truly effective 
communication requires students to become facile with tools and methods of expression so their ideas 
and findings can be clearly conveyed.  At the same time, since communication takes place across gaps in 
space and time, it is important that the form chosen for an ETD be understood in different places and in 
future times, as typically occurs when standard representation schemes are used. 
Thus, at a 1994 meeting of ten universities discussing ETDs in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA, it was 
recommended that ETDs be prepared in both a rendered and a descriptive form, like PDF and SGML. 
The former ensures that a reader sees things the way the author desires, which may be of particular 
importance with regard to mathematics or artistic works. The latter instead emphasizes the logical 
structure and content (as is done with HTML pages) and makes it easier to precisely specify the target of 
a search. 
However, no authors write using tools that store their works only in PDF, and few authors directly create 
SGML documents. Rather, they employ tools they select based on cost, availability, popularity, 
familiarity, efficiency, or other criteria.  For many, the choice is a package like Microsoft Word that may 
have been bundled with their computer. For others, like mathematicians who need to work with proofs 
and equations, the main decision may be what representation to use (e.g., LaTeX), with subsidiary 
decision regarding what editor or other special tool can best manipulate LaTeX files. 
Such choices may be discipline specific, may be based on what is commonly used by faculty and 
students who are in a particular group, or who use a particular computing environment.  If there is no 
clear choice imposed, then a decision could be based on the information provided in subsequent sections 
of this Guide. These cover, in particular:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inaccessible dead media has little value. Students who are incorporating moving images, audio and live 
data streams into their ETDs should not underestimate the work involved in managing these resources. 
How these resources are created, and the form and format they are created in, will determine how your 
ETD can be managed, used, preserved, and even re-used in the future. 

When your ETD enters a networked electronic environment, it does not exist in isolation.  It becomes 
part of a boundless resource space in which descriptions of the work and its components (metadata) need 
to be in an internationally recognized form if the work is to be accessible. 

Inter-operable standards that will allow for this metadata to be understood by everyone (even machines) 
are now available. However, the application of these standards requires a new form of collaborative 
relationship between you, the creator, and indexing initiatives such as the NDLTD. 

This means that you, the creator, have to take responsibility for describing each layer or 'object' of 
content as an independent entity capable of being accessed and manipulated in its own right. From its 
conception, a compound digital resource should be seen as a composition of objects in an encoding 
architecture that expresses the spatial and temporal relationships between these objects. 

*These objects may be audio (mono or stereo) and visual (2D or 3D) or text. 
*They may also be composed from several sources. 
*They may be simultaneously acquired, processed, transmitted and used in real time. 

If, in the future, the encoding of these objects is to be decoded, the metadata must include format 
information. In the interests of interoperability, it is good practice to select formats from the list of 
'''Internet Media Types''' (MIME values) whenever possible (this list is a registry where there is a 
procedure for adding new types, if necessary). 
Available [on-line]  
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media- 
types/ 
 
An important (proposed) standard that multimedia content providers should investigate is the 
Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).  This standard will allow hypertext creators 
to define and synchronize multimedia elements (video, sound, still images) for web presentation and 
interaction.

      <comment>/* LaTeX under Windows operating systems */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientists within the natural and engineering sciences have special needs for mathematics and 
algorithmic graphics. The text formatting system LaTeX has been used for decades to mark up scientific 
documents. Even today, there is no viewable alternative to print texts containing a lot of mathematics  
without using LaTeX. This system uses a kind of semantic or typographic markup for rendering 
formulas, graphs, and so on. Within some disciplines LaTeX is nearly exclusively used to render 
complex documents. 

== TeX and LaTeX ==

TeX is a document formatting language (and the program that processes it) written by Donald Knuth for 
the professional preparation of complex publications. It excels particularly at formatting mathematical 
equations and for managing two-dimensional presentations of data (tabular and otherwise). LaTeX is a 
set of macros written by Leslie Lamport as a &quot;front-end&quot; to TeX that makes articles, reports, theses, 
dissertations, and books easy to create and manage. 

== How to get LaTeX ==

LaTeX is free to download from any CTAN archive (http://www.ctan.org ), and works on 
Macintosh, MS-DOS, Unix, and Windows 3.1/95/NT (though some commands may vary on some 
architectures). To convert your electronic thesis or dissertation in LaTeX, you must first  type your 
document completely into the ASCII editor using the LaTeX macros appropriately, then use a certain 
chain of commands that produce a layout and printable version of the document. 

== LaTeX under UNIX / LINUX systems ==

To create LaTeX files, all you need is an ASCII-based editor, like Emacs, Vi. Writing a dissertation just 
means typing the contents and the LaTeX-commands directly in an ASCII-based file and save this as 
&lt;nowiki&gt;*.tex.&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
To compile a LaTeX file and produce a printable version of the document, you have to follow the 
following steps: 
1. Run latex &quot;latex mydissertation.tex&quot; This produces the following files: 
mydissertation.dvi / mydissertation.aux, etc. 
2. Run dvips &quot;dvips mydissertation.dvi&quot; This produces a file dissertation.ps 
that is printable on a printer, or convertible into PDF. 
 
While writing your thesis in LaTeX, please keep the following rules in mind: 
As document style we advise to choose report or book, because both start with chapter as the highest 
order for section structuring. The preamble of the latex file could look like in the following example: 

\documentclass[12pt,a4,titlepage]{book} 

\usepackage{babel} 

\usepackage{longtable} 

\usepackage[dvips]{epsfig} 
 

With usepackage we import additional styles that are needed, e.g. for tables, mathematics, figures etc. In 
order to get archivable form of the latex dissertations we advise not to use or to program complex 

macros. Simple \newcommand or \renewcommand may be used, e.g. 

\newcommand{\begin{itemize}}{bi} 
 
Headings can be separated using the following commands: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

! Document Structure

!Level

|-

| \part{Heading Part I }

| -1

|-

| \chapter{Heading Chapter 1}

| 4

|-

| \subparagraph{...} 

| 5

|}
 
Levels -1 to 2 appear in the table of contents. Part is used to split the whole document into several parts. 
The chapters numbering are constantly growing. Within the document than a single page is displayed, 
that contains: Part I Introduction or Part II Method and so on. 
Chapters are numbered without taking the parts into account. The numbering is standardized:  Chapter 1 
Mathematics. 
Sections are subunits of chapters and numbered:  Basic Algorithms. 

Chapters are numbered without taking the parts into account. The numbering is standardized:  Chapter 1 
Mathematics. 
Sections are subunits of chapters and numbered:  Basic Algorithms. 
 
Sections are numbered as follows:  1.1.1 Decision Tree Algorithm A. 
For those parts like acknowledgements, dedication, and curriculum vita where authors usually don't want 
to use numbering, the following style can be used: 

\chapter*{Thank You} .  The asterisk prevents the numbering. 
 

Appendices are included using the \appendix command. Please use commands as in the following 
example if your appendix consists of several chapters: 

\appendix  or 

\appendix* not numbered headings of the appendices

Using graphics: figures and pictures should be included in LaTeX documents using the eps (encapsulated 
postscript) format. Before including them, one has to use a certain style package in the preamble: 
\usepackage[dvips]{epsfig} 
 
The parameter [h] positions the figure at the current position. 
Keep in mind, always to use a caption-environment to put the figure captions below the picture: 

\begin{figure}[h] 

\begin{center} 

\epsffile{didi.eps} 

\end{center} 

\caption[short description for the table of figures]{Long description for the text} 

\end{figure} 


The title page is the most complicated part. Most universities supply own templates for the title page and 
the whole dissertation. There is no best practice available. In order to separate the several items on a title 
page in order to be able to reuse those information pieces e.g. if the whole dissertation is converted to 
HTML or SGML/XML, we advise to use \newcommands as simplest method to apply a pseudo structure 
to a LaTeX title page. Usually LaTeX provides the following standards item for a title page: 

\date{} 

\author{} 

\title{} 
 

But as this is not enough for a thesis, most universities provide own style sheets or templates. 
Tables should be used as follows: authors are advised to use the table-environment because it provides 
the possibility to include table captions in a structured way. 

\begin{table} 

\caption{Tabellenbeispiel} 

\begin{center} 

\begin{tabular}{ccc} 

x &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\ \hline 

1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\ 

2 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\ \hline 

\end{tabular} 

\end{center} 

\end{table} 


Citations can be used as their own structured items as follows: 

1. Using the citation-environment. This is used for inline citations. 
 
\begin{citation}{label1} 

Contents 

\end{citation} 
 

2. Using the quotation-environment. This is used to structure whole paragraphs as citations. Those 
citations use an indent like usual paragraphs. 

\begin{quotation} 

contents 

\end{quotation} 
 

3. another method is the use of the quote-environment. This environment is used for whole paragraph 
citations, but those paragraphs don't have an indent. 

\begin{quote} 

content 

\end{quote} 
 

Numbered lists are typeset using the enumerate-environment. By integration new enumerate- 
environment in existing one a hierarchically nested sublist is built. 

\begin{enumerate} 

\item {Testitem1} 

\begin{enumerate} 

\item {Ebene 2 Testitem1} 

\item  {Ebene 2 Testitem2} 

\end{enumerate} 

\item Testitem2 

\end{enumerate} 
 

Bulleted lists are typeset using the itemize-environment. Here a hierarchical nesting is also possible. 

\begin{itemize} 

\item Testitem1 

\begin{itemize} 

\item Ebene 2 Testitem1 

\item Ebene 2 Testitem2 

\end{itemize} 

\item Testitem2 

\end{itemize} 
 

Definition lists contain a definition term and a definition text. 

\begin{description} 

\item[Definition term] Explanation of the definition term 

\item[Element2] Explanation  2 

\end{description} 
 

If an author wants to include source code this is best done using the \verbatim-environment. 

\begin{verbatim} 

&lt;nowiki&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl  -w&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

&lt;nowiki&gt;#+-----------------------------------+&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

&lt;nowiki&gt;#| this script has been written 1998 by&lt;/nowiki&gt; 

&lt;nowiki&gt;#+-----------------------------------+ &lt;/nowiki&gt;

\end{verbatim} 
 

Anchors, references and cross-references are typeset using the \label command, which links a key to the 
specified item of a document. 

\begin{verbatim} 

\label{keyword} 

\end{verbatim} 
 

References to these parts have to use the command \ref or \pageref in order to produce a reference to the 
object or to the page. 

ref{keyword} 

pageref{keyword} 
 

A very important part of a dissertation is the bibliography. We advise all authors to use the bibtex-system 
and graphical front ends, e.g. bibview under LINUX or UNIX systems to manage bibliographic records 
and entries. References to bibliographic entries that are held in a bibtex-database are written as in the 
example: 

\cite{schluessel} 
 

The bibtex-database can be included into the LaTeX file by the following command, where a predefined 
style like alpha, plain, apalike can be used to layout the entries: 

\bibliography{file name without .bib} 

\bibliographystyle{style, e.g. alpha, plain, apalike, etc.} 
 

Within the BibTeX-system database entries can be done using a plain ASCII editor. like emacs. There 
are several types of literature predefined: 

*Article in Conference Proceedings 
*Article in a Journal 
*Article in a Collection 
*Chapter or pages in a book 
*Conference Proceedings 
*Book 
*Booklet, but no Publisher, Institution 
*PHD Thesis 
*Masters Thesis 
*Technical Report 
*Technical Manual 
*Unpublished 
 

The following example shows how a BiBTeX-entry has to be written: 

%  Article in a Journal 

@Article{shortkey2, 

author =       {Name, Firstname}, 

title =        {Title No. 2}, 

journal =      {Journal for ETDs}, 

year =         {1999}, 

OPTkey =       {}, 

OPTvolume =    {}, 

OPTnumber =    {}, 

OPTpages =     {}, 

OPTmonth =     {}, 

OPTnote =      {}, 

OPTannote =    {} 

The following table shows those items have to be used for certain bibliographic entry types: 

[[Image:LaTeX_Table_1.jpg]]


[[Image:LaTeX_Table_2.jpg]]


To process a latex and a bibtex-file under UNIX system you have to type the following command 
sequence: 

latex mydissertation.tex 

bibtex mydissertation.aux 

latex mydissertation.tex 


This produces the following files: mydissertation.dvi / mydissertation.aux /mydissertation.bbl / 
mydissertation.blg, etc. 

Run dvips &quot;dvips mydissertation.dvi&quot; This produces a file dissertation.ps that is printable on a printer, or 
convertible into PDF. 

== LaTeX under Windows operating systems ==

Using LaTeX under MS Windows requires the TeY System, a DVI-Viewer, Ghostscript and Ghostview. 
There are several LaTeX distributions: MikTeX , a highly regarded setup for Windows 95/NT 
(http://www.miktex.org/) and emTeX , the classic DOS and OS/2 TeX setup by Eberhard 
Mattes (ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/systems/msdos/emtex/). 

There are front ends available for Latex that provide a WYSIWIG view to the user. One of the most used 
ones is Scientific Workplace by McKichan Software Inc. 
(http://www.mackichan.com/products/swp30.html). The disadvantage is 
that it is quite costly for single users.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Documents are often prepared in a similar form to that of prior documents. Students are encouraged to go 
to http://www.theses.org and follow links found there to other ETDs. Of particular interest should be 
the set of Notable ETDs found at that site.  Modeling one’s work after these may be an effective strategy 
as long as local requirements are satisfied (see above). 
In its Fall 2001 meeting, the NDLTD Steering Committee decided to pursue this strategy, giving awards 
for the best masters and for the best doctoral ETDs.  Once these are identified, they will be linked in with 
the above-mentioned Notable ETD section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inspired by the NDLTD, a group of faculty and staff joined together to create the Digital Media 
Institute at the University of South Florida.  We created our community back in 1999 with the 
following goals in mind: 

*Improving the quality of e-documents, particularly theses and dissertations. 
*Researching ways authoring tools, particularly Microsoft Office 2000, can be used to facilitate electronic theses and dissertations. 
*Researching how technologies alter graduate education, including mentoring relationships, topic selection, intellectual property, writing processes, and publishing practices 
*Working with tool developers to keep abreast of new tools for researchers and writers 
*Providing an open forum for the exchange of ideas regarding the evolutions of new media scholarship. 
*Providing training workshops, reference materials, and support for graduate students interested in contributing to the University of South Florida's digital library of electronic theses and dissertations. 

While we are excited about engaging our undergraduate students in this research and support endeavor, 
our greatest efforts have occurred at the graduate level.  Since creating our community three years ago, 
my colleagues and I have analyzed how Microsoft's Office 2000 can be used to better support students’ 
needs as writers of multimedia scholarship and faculty members' needs as mentors of electronic theses 
and dissertations.  Using case study and ethnographic methodologies, we have researched how 
communication technologies can improve graduate education, particularly academic scholarship.  
Following Walter Ong, who theorized &quot;Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior 
transformations of consciousness&quot; (82), we are researching how technologies alter graduate education, 
including mentoring relationships, topic selection, intellectual property, writing processes, and publishing 
practices.   

In the preliminary stages of our investigation, we focused on examining the Office 2000 suite, yet we 
expect to investigate related tools for writers, including bibliography, and quantitative and qualitative 
data analysis tools.  We chose to focus initially on Office 2000 because it is used by so many other 
members of the NDLTD.  Office 2000 includes all of the necessary components (word processor, 
database, spreadsheet, presentation graphics, electronic mail) necessary to author a thesis or dissertation, 
and all of these components can be used to produce HTML code, as well as native-format documents.  In 
addition, Office 2000 has powerful features for collaboration and multimedia authoring.  Outlook-- 
Microsoft's email and calendaring tool--serves as a framework for document workflow, calendaring, 
sharing and exchange. For example, regardless of their locations in time and space, faculty and students 
can use Outlook to provide students with an integrated set of reviews and links to grammar and 
punctuation references.  From any document in Office 2000, faculty and students can use NetMeeting to 
synchronously discuss documents, including audio/video-based discussions.   They can invite scholars 
outside the committee to respond to drafts.  Numerical data, as well as graphical representations of it, can 
be published out of Excel in such a fashion as to permit limited manipulation and re-analysis from a Web 
Browser.  More extensive analyses can be formed by “roundtripping” the data back into Excel. 

Throughout our research, as we work with Office 2000 tools in proposal preparation, research, and 
thesis/dissertation writing, we are asking  &quot;What tools are really useful?  What motivates or dissuades 
innovative use of tools?”  Some graduate students are maintaining a Case Study Journal where they 
reflect on how use of software tools influences our research, writing, and relationships with mentors.  In 
turn, some faculty are reflecting on ways the tools influence mentoring, scholarship, and teaching and 
learning.  Jude Edminster, a doctoral student in Rhetoric and Composition, is conducting an ethnographic 
investigation of our project; see http://dmi.usf.edu/edminster/ETDProposal/. 

Ultimately, we expect our research will reveal ways faculty and graduate students can use software tools 
and plug-ins to critique and develop theses and dissertations, including insights into necessary training 
and resources.  We believe this work is an important first step toward transforming our graduate 
programs so they better prepare students for the Knowledge Age. 

Results of our research can be viewed at our project home: http://dmi.usf.edu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ADT Program uses two simple protocols to describe – the PDF files associated with a thesis, and the 
generation of a unique ID for each thesis. 

== ADT Program filename standard ==

To facilitate access to ADT theses it is important that 
the following filename standards are followed for 
naming the PDF files prior to uploading them through 
the Deposit form: 

Please note - ADT filenames should only contain: 

*Letters from the alphabet (upper or lower case). Example: 05appendix.pdf; 05APPENDIX.pdf; 05Appendix.pdf 
*Or numbers (0-9) 
*Or any appropriate alphanumeric combination. 02Chapter1.pdf; 09Chapter10.pdf 
*The only symbols permitted are - (hyphen) or _ (underscore). Example: 06Appendix-Images.pdf; 06Appendix_Images.pdf 


Create one PDF file containing title/author information; abstract; acknowledgments; table of 
contents; introduction; preface and any other introductory text that is not part of the main body of the 
thesis. Call this file - 01front.pdf 

Create another file containing the whole of the thesis (including what is contained in the front.pdf 
file) and call this 02whole.pdf 
…alternatively… 

Break the thesis up into smaller files maintaining a relevant filename structure such as 
02chapter1.pdf; 03chapter2.pdf; 04appendix1.pdf; 05bibliography.pdf; etc. 

In order to maintain the desired file sequence the files need to be numbered using the standard 01- 
99 (or 001-999 if individual files exceed more than 99 for an individual thesis). Numbering theses is 
required no matter which filename standard is adopted. 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

|Example 1 

''01front.pdf 

02whole.pdf'' 

|Example 2 

''01front.pdf 

02chapter1.pdf 

03chapter2.pdf 

04appendix.pdf 

05bibliography.pdf''

|}

 
The 01front.pdf file is compulsory. The official ADT v1.0 or v1.1 software will create an empty front file 
automatically if a real one is not uploaded during the deposit/submission process. This is to serve as a 
memory prompt for administrators. While it is difficult to recommend exact file sizes the project team 
suggests that the whole.pdf file should be within the 2-4MB range. For larger, and hence multiple file 
theses (necessary for scanned ones) it is suggested that the file size should be in the 4-10MB range. 

This standard will allow viewers to easily identify the relevant parts of the ADT theses via a common 
filename structure. It will also allow viewers to quickly look at the table of contents and other 
introductory information without having to wait for the whole thesis to download, or to better determine 
if they want to see the whole thesis in the first place. The standard is also an effective and simple way to 
present an introductory view of a thesis at the outset. This is similar in a way to the 20-25-page view that 
UMI/Bell&amp;Howell have introduced for the DAI database. Similarly, this ADT standard will facilitate e- 
commerce transactions if participants choose this option. This would work just as the UMI/DAI model - 
the metadata/abstract and front.pdf file would be available freely, with charges kicking in to access the 
rest of the theses' pdf files. 

== ADT Program unique Ids ==
 
The combination used by all ADT members is as follows: the word &quot;adt-&quot; immediately followed by the 
unique national institution code as per the Australian Interlibrary Resource Sharing Directory, 
immediately followed by the year, month, day, hour, minute &amp; second/s the thesis was deposited to the 
local server.  As the ADT Program is a distributed national model, it is critical that the URLs are unique 
within that context. The combination above ensures this. 
 
Examples of the other institutions would be: 

../adt-ANU20010223.162256/ (Australian National University) 

../adt-WCU19991112.125812/ (Curtin University of Technology) 

../ adt-NUN20010510.153038/ (The University of New South Wales) 

….and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Details regarding a variety of approaches to use in preparing ETDs are found in subsequent parts of 
section 3.2. In all cases, there is a writing phase and a conversion phase, so that an archivable form is 
produced.  The writing phase should allow authors to efficiently and effectively capture their research 
results in a form that will be understandable by others. The conversion phase should take the written 
work and use it to create PDF and/or SGML/XML. 

Authors preparing an ETD must learn about electronic publishing to succeed in their task. In the future, 
costs may decrease on structured editors and other software that directly yields SGML/XML. 
Meanwhile, a small number may invest (their money and time) in such as SoftQuad’s Author/Editor. But 
today, most authors learn about word processing, since it is commonly used for other writing tasks, such 
as letters, reports, papers, articles, and books. Word is the most common word processor. Word Perfect is 
somewhat popular. FrameMaker is a more costly package, harder to learn, but quite powerful, and used 
in professional writing efforts. LaTeX is popular with mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who deal 
with mathematical notation, proofs, equations, etc. 

From word processing systems such as these, it is relatively easy to prepare PDF files.  It also is possible 
to prepare SGML or XML. However, this latter typically requires a good deal of pre-planning, work on 
conversion, and final editing/checking to make sure the archival form correctly conveys the author’s 
intent. 

Some of these efforts yield metadata for ETDs as a byproduct, either directly or in connection with a 
conversion effort. Thus, if “TEI-lite” (drawn from work on the Text Encoding Initiative) is employed, 
metadata can be produced from the document by analyzing the header portion. Generally, however, 
authors prepare a metadata record for their ETD by filling in some type of form, entering in suitable 
information into a database from which the desired representation can be generated as needed. The 
metadata, as well as other forms, may carry a description regarding copyright and other intellectual 
property right management issues. 

In addition to writing, authors may convey their results using multimedia devices.  Special tools are often 
employed to prepare graphic aids, animations, or musical compositions.  Other tools support conversion 
of photographs, video, music, and other formats. In some cases, multimedia content can be included with 
the rest of the work, as when images are included in a PDF file. Regardless, international standards for 
the various media types, as well as their combinations, should be followed so archivable works result; 
otherwise these parts of an ETD may become lost to interested readers in the distant future.  We aim to 
avoid such losses whenever possible, through training, following best practices, and building upon recent 
work on ETDs, as documented below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A popular page representation scheme, a published de facto standard developed by Adobe is the Portable Document Format, PDF. Adobe 
provides the Acrobat Reader free of charge (and promised it into the foreseeable future), which will read current as well as previous versions of 
PDF. It is downloadable at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html. Adobe also provides tools 
for creating, annotating, and manipulating PDF documents, through its own word processing software, printer drivers, and distilling from 
PostScript. The whole suite is called Adobe Acrobat and is actually available with version 5. Adobe’s Acrobat software, installed on a Windows 
or Macintosh platform allows most suitable documents to be converted to PDF in moments. From word processors such as Word, WordPerfect, 
and Framemaker, each document portion can be “printed” to the Distiller printer driver, yielding a PDF file. The Distiller converts PostScript 
files to PDF files. Acrobat software allows multiple PDF files to be assembled into larger PDF files by inserting documents or deleting pages in 
an existing PDF file. 

It is also possible to produce PDF documents on UNIX systems. However, the latest version of Acrobat Distiller that was available for certain 
UNIX platforms such as Solaris or HP-UX  was version 3.1. Authors writing in LaTeX can use ghostscript to produce PDF files. But in order to 
obtain readable PDF documents, issues of used fonts, used conversion scripts, etc. have to be considered. 

To avoid problems for future readers, authors should embed all fonts in their documents (when that is allowed). Otherwise, software displaying 
or printing PDF content will attempt to find a similar font and extrapolate from it, which may cause serious problems. 

Similarly, authors should use so-called “outline” fonts as opposed to bitmap fonts, so that display and printing can proceed to scale characters as 
required. Thus, when using TeX or LaTeX, the bitmap fonts commonly found in a standard installation should not be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Section [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/SGML\XML Overview|SGML/XML Overview]] defines SGML and XML. 
 
== The concept of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) ==
 
A document type definition (DTD), in the sense of XML, defines rules or templates, which are used to 
produce similarly, structured documents. A DTD describes the content model of a class of documents. It 
consists of: 

*An '''element declaration''', which is the main part of a DTD and the structural definition. Elements can contain other elements, characters or nothing. Element declarations define the name of the element and the logical content (sub elements) of an element. (See [10].) An important part of the element declaration is the content model. It is here that the document architect indicates the order and occurrence of other element or character data. 
*A '''notation declaration''', which defines a notation for external formats, e.g., for graphics (gif, jpeg), mathematics (TeX, LaTeX), 3D objects (VRML) and other formats, that cannot be coded directly in XML. 
*An '''entity declaration''', which defines character, sets and replacement objects for characters. Everything from a single character on up can be defined with a single entity. There are two basic types of entities: general and parameter. Parameter entities are only allowed in declarations, and are usually used to make a DTD more readable or to control processing. General entities are used in the document instance; the documents build upon the DTD. 
*An '''attribute list declaration''', where attributes and their values for the different element types defined in the element type declaration is listed. 

To define a DTD, a special syntax is needed, which does not conform to the usual XML syntax where a 
document contains elements which are enclosed in &quot;tags:&quot; a start tag (e.g. &lt;author&gt;) and an end tag (e.g. 
&lt;/author&gt;), producing code like this: &lt;author&gt; Joe Miller &lt;/author&gt; 


== DTDs for electronic dissertations used worldwide ==
 
The fact that currently available authoring systems for XML still have not won wide recognition has led 
to different strategies at different universities regarding XML documents. Most of these projects were 
started between 1995 and 1997, in a time when XML was alive, but where no tools or standardized 
DTDs were available. A view of those projects from today’s perspective illustrates the demand for a 
rethinking and redesign of those approaches in order to come to a standardization. 

All the presented DTDs are built upon similar principles. A classical dissertation (which can be seen as 
monograph) consists of 3 main components: an extensible '''title page''' with abstracts, declarations, etc., the 
'''dissertation corpus''', which includes text, pictures, audio, video, tables and so on, as well as the 
'''appendices''', which contain data sheets, bibliographies, acknowledgements and others. 

The following DTDs are currently in use at different institutions: 
*ETD-ML.DTD: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) 
*DiML.DTD: German Dissertationen Online Projectes 
*TDM.DTD: University of Iowa 
*HutPubl.DTD: Technical University Helsinki 
*TEI-Light.DTD: Ann Arbor und Lyon 
*ISOBook.DTD: University of Oslo 
*TEI-based DTD with extensions for natural sciences: Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences Uppsala 


All those Document Type Definitions are so-called author-DTDs. This means that they are primarily 
used to support the authoring and the conversion process and do not first of all address document 
archiving and preservation issues. One may ask why all those different DTDs have prevailed. This is 
mainly because the scientific orientation of the mentioned universities is quite varied. Lyon, Oslo and 
Michigan, which use TEI-Light.dtd, mainly serve students in the arts and humanities. Problems using 
TEI.DTD or DocBook.DTD are recognized at universities, which support a strong natural science 
community, such as Berlin, Helsinki or Uppsala. Often a dissertation is a cumulative work, e.g., in Lyon 
or Helsinki. 


== Preparing for Conversion ==
  
Converting from word processing forms to SGML or XML requires more planning in advance, different 
tools, and broader learning about document processing concepts than does working with PDF. In 
addition, the end result is a representation that is easier to preserve, more reusable, and supportive of 
more powerful and effective schemes for searching and browsing. All of these advantages, however, 
must be weighed against the facts that there are fewer people knowledgeable about these matters, that 
often tools to help are more expensive and less mature, and that the process may be complicated, 
difficult, and time consuming. In 2000, there are tens of thousands of ETDs created by scanning (mostly 
by UMI, but also at sites like MIT and the National Document Center in Greece), thousands converted 
from word processors into PDF, and hundreds in SGML or XML – illustrating the relative effort required 
of students to prepare ETDs in each of these forms. 

Simple word processing emphasizes layout or what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing. 
Emphasizing what documents look like is quite distinct from focusing on the logical structure, for which 
markup schemes are best. Shifting from word processing representations to XML, requires a different 
way of thinking, a different approach. The problem is harder than producing HTML by exporting from a 
word processor, since instead of just having a document that looks like the original, it is necessary that 
the marked-up version itself is correctly tagged. 

Some word processors have been extended to facilitate such an approach. Microsoft produced SGML 
Author for Word as an add-on package for Word 95, and new versions of WordPerfect can export 
content according to markup schemes. Eventually it is likely that most popular word processors will 
export to XML. Clearly, the resulting markup can surround document sections, headings, paragraphs, 
lists, figures, tables, citations, footnotes, hyperlinks, and other obvious constructs. In addition, regions 
with the same style can be tagged. Thus, to allow easy conversion from word processing to markup 
schemes requires choosing a target DTD and then consistently using document objects and styles so that 
there is a clear mapping from them to tags. 

Conversion from LaTeX is slightly simpler since the TeX approach involves using formatting commands 
that can be mapped to tags in XML. However, LaTeX does not require strict nesting of commands, so it 
may not be clear where to place end-tags. Further, LaTeX users may not consistently use the same 
sequences to designate changes in structure, making translation more complex. Finally, LaTeX coding of 
mathematical expressions is very difficult to translate to markup schemes for mathematics, like MathML. 

Because of the inherent complexity of converting from word processing schemes to markup 
representations, it is necessary to include steps for checking and correcting converted forms. Parsers can 
ensure syntactic correctness, so detecting problems is often simple. To ensure semantic correctness, 
however, manual inspection may be required. A further test would involve rendering the marked-up 
document, for example to a printed or PDF form, and ensuring that the result suitably matches the output 
resulting from the original word processing version. In any case, human labor is likely to be needed to 
correct conversion errors, and presupposes that students understand enough about the process and desired 
output to accomplish this with facility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protecting against plagiarism may involve specific steps as explained below, in addition to action in 
accord with the discussion above in section [[ETD Guide:Universities - Plagiarism]]. 

First, there is software available to detect plagiarism, or, in simple terms, similar copies. Stanford's 
SCAM software, and other software developed in Australia and other locations, discussed in the digital 
library literature and elsewhere, is available. This software can compare two documents, finding sections 
that are identical or similar (e.g., up to within simple substitution changes).  If such software were to be 
widely run, it could ascertain for each new work if there were an ETD previously submitted that is very 
&quot;close&quot;.  While determined authors might defeat such software, more refined software could be 
developed to highlight cases where even such protection efforts were involved. 

Second, it should be noted, as stated in section [[ETD Guide:Universities - Plagiarism]], that if a work in made widely available, it is more 
likely that someone, seeing a new ETD that involves plagiarism, would detect that situation. In effect, as 
more and more ETDs are made accessible, there is a larger community monitoring abuses. 

Third, since it is known that ETDs are often read by many more people than would read a paper 
dissertation, there is a strong psychological pressure to discourage plagiarism.  One aspect of this is that 
students are aware of dire penalties if plagiarism is detected - they may be removed from their degree 
program and forever disgraced.  Another aspect is that faculty working with students on ETDs, being 
aware that many might read the work, are likely to be more diligent than with paper works with regard to 
checking the validity and quality of results reported. In other words, it becomes more likely that faculty 
will carefully study ETDs that have their name on them as advisors or examiners. In particular, it is 
exceedingly unlikely that a student would be able to write about work they had not done, without that 
being detected. 

In summary, detection by machines or people, and the threat of severe penalties, are likely to discourage 
students from even considering plagiarism with regard to ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is nothing new about the concept of metadata. Metadata is resource description; the kind of 
information found in a library catalogue. What is new in the digital world is the essential role that you, 
the creator, now play in providing this information. Good quality metadata is easy to provide at the point 
of creation but usually difficult, expensive or impossible to discover retrospectively. 

At one level, this is because all digital resources are in some way dependent on electronic mediation by 
computers and software and it is only at the point of creation that a record of these dependencies and 
descriptions can be recorded. At another level, it is the sheer volume of creation that alters the role of the 
librarian or custodian from cataloguer to metadata repository manager. 

In an ideal world, all digital material would be created independent of proprietary hardware and software. 
In other words, everything would run on commonly available hardware using freely available (public 
domain) software such as a web browser. 

In the real world, many content creators will be producing work on-line or off-line that is either hardware 
or software dependent (or both). Unfortunately, the costs of emulation, migration and licensing increase 
if resources are generated in proprietary or platform dependent formats. If possible, try to use commonly 
available open source formats. 

Metadata is information about these applications and formats, which allows for licensed versions to be 
archived so that the material can be displayed or accessed. In order to be able to provide long-term access 
to a digital resource, the NDLTD needs the following metadata: 

*Information about the content creator (rights, contributors, publisher,); 
*Information about the content that will help it to be found or discovered (coverage, description, title, subject, relationships); 
*Information about the resource (formats, system requirements, date, identification). 


'''Storing metadata''' 

Metadata can be stored in: 

1.   The object or document being described. 

There are a growing number of audiovisual formats that allow for metadata to be embedded in the file 
itself. For example, a text format like HTML allows you to embed metadata in the header of the file and 
recent versions of image formats such as MPEG include space for metadata. This has the advantage that 
the information is self-contained and is truly transportable across systems. The major disadvantage is that 
systems accessing the object will have trouble catering for multiple views or meanings. 

2.      A separate file that can be externally accessed but is linked to the object or document. 

This has the advantage that different communities can gather the metadata for different purposes. It has 
the disadvantage of being open to misinterpretation through syntax error or unrecognised schema. 

3.   A separate file stored in a database. 

The NDLTD model encourages students to submit their metadata to a central repository for indexing in a 
database. The database will then point to the object/document. This also allows for multiple instances of 
the metadata for one document. It also provides for enhanced administrative tools (as are normally 
provided by database systems). Advanced database systems could provide a very sophisticated 
management system. This is the most expensive method to implement but it has the advantage of being 
significantly more flexible and provides administrative support from the outset. 

See:  '''European Projects such as Metadata Observatory'''. The aim of the Observatory is to maintain 
and promote a knowledge base for metadata for multimedia information to continually assess 
relationships between Dublin Core and other initiatives, especially undertaken in Europe, in order to 
assist evolution of standardised metadata schemes. 

See: '''The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative'''. This is an open forum engaged in the development of 
interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. 
DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global workshops, conferences, standards 
liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some word processing systems are extensible in different ways. One of them is the definition of macros 
written in some programming language. MS Word, for instance, uses Visual Basic for Applications as 
macro language).  Another way to extend MS Word is by add-ins, applications built in some 
programming language that are inserted into Word’s runtime (like plug-ins in web browsers).  This 
feature permits the development of added-value tools for writers. For instance, BibWord 
(http://mariachi.dsic.upv.es/bibword) is a bibliography management tool for MS 
Word 2000. The current version allows Word users to insert references from a bibliographic database and 
automatically generates the reference list at the end of a document.  Macros also could be used to attach a 
form to the ETD document, the fulfillment of which would provide the ETD metadata from the word 
processing environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preparing a word document to be converted into an archivable form using the SGML or XML standard first 
of all means using word stylesheets. Usually the university provides these style sheets, as they contain 
university specific structuring and formatting. 

In Word it is possible to distinguish between the information a document holds and the structure in which it 
is written. Style sheets provide the structure. They help you, for example, if you want to format all your 
headings for chapters with the same style. 

If you use the style sheet ''heading1'' (see picture below), than it may be possible to associate a certain 
formatting like ''text height: 14pt, text-font Arial, paragraph settings: left bound, leave 12 pt space after a 
heading, number the headings automatically with roman numbers'', etc. with the structure element 
''heading1''.


[[Image:MSWord1a.jpg]]


You can see the left row within the word window. This is the so-called structured view, which you can get 
by choosing the Normal option under View. The names of the paragraph structures are displayed if you 
choose the point Options under Extras. Within the popup menu there is a possibility to set the width of the 
style sheet view.  (see below). This is how it is displayed in German Word97, but is similar in other 
language word systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The desired situation for retrieving archivable ETDs would be the one, that authors write in an XML- 
editor, according to a Main-DTD, and choose those parts of the DTD, that are inevitable for their thesis 
or dissertation. 

Some desktop publishing systems today provide an opportunity to save as SGML or XML. Investigations 
as to whether those tools are usable for such complex documents as a thesis or a dissertation led to the 
following conclusion: 

* Writing in WordPerfect or FrameMaker+SGML enforces the author to learn new writing habits. While writing, they have to think about the structure of their documents, e.g., which part is a heading, which part is a definition list; or they have to think to add certain parts immediately to the document, like, references, table and figure captions, etc. 
*While writing according to a specified DTD, the desktop publishing system often internally checks syntax correctness by using an XML parser. Some of those internal parsers are still not stable enough and may cause the system to crash, as experienced with WordPerfect 9.0. Those parsing procedures in between the active scientific thinking and writing often disturbs the authors. 
*Most of the pure XML editors could not produce an appropriate and layouted printed copy or PDF file that would satisfy the approval of readers of the printed version of a document. Some of those editors simply fail to process large and complex documents. 
*Most of the tools are not ready yet, especially in a sense that would allow to use user or domain specific DTDs. Staroffice and other tools support their own vendor specific DTD only. 
 

Although the world of desktop publishing systems is actually changing, there are still too few tools that 
are sufficient in: 

*The support and appearance of their graphical user interface, 
*The provision of a certain amount of features normal word processors have, like automated numbering, colors, table management, link management, style sheets. 
*The platform independence or cross-platform availability, 
*The support of user specific DTDs, and standard DTDs, like TEI, Docbook, etc., 
*The export quality of produced XML: tables, tags, 
*The stability of usage, 
*Their commercial availability and price. 
 

The following systems are able to export into SGML or 
XML: 

''Export with user specific DTD'' 
*WordPerfect  Version 7.0 (Corel) http://www.corel.com 
*FrameMaker+SGML6.0 (Adobe) http://www.adobe.com 
 
''Export with system specific (vendor) DTD'' 
*Openoffice (SUN / open source) http://www.openoffice.org 
*AbiWord (AbiWord / open source) http://www.abisource.com 
*Kword (KOffice, KDE Project / open source) http://www.kde.org

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A.      Important Parts for a checking procedure ==
 
After an author has written his or her ETD, the service institutions, like the university library or computing and 
media center, have to check whether the ETD is complete, readable and correct. Therefore, a checklist is useful. 
The checklist should consider the following parts of a document and should also be open to the authors for self- 
checking: 
 
#Organizational questions 
#The WinWord, WordPerfect or LaTeX document 
#The PDF-Version of a digital dissertation 
#Metadata 
 

'''Checking organisational questions'''
 
After receiving an ETD from an author, several organisational issues have to be proofed: 

*Does the student belong to the university? 
*Has he passed his exams? 
*Has he passed the approvals?  
*Has he missed deadlines or not? 


'''Checking the WinWord / WordPerfect document''' 

For the application of style sheets the following parts of a word document are mostly critical for further usage: 

*Can the document as a whole been opened within the WinWord or WordPerfect systems at the service institutions? 
*Has the student used all style sheets correctly? 
*Has the students used the heading feature of WinWord or WordPerfect? 
*Is the title page fully styled and all information filled in? 
*Do figures and tables have own captions, and has the insert caption feature of the text formatting system been used? 
*Are lists styled as lists? 
*Are Tables produced using the table features from the text formatting system? (Sometimes authors use the tabulator to build tables) 
*Has the authors used a reference managing system for the references? This makes the automatic formatting of the bibliography much easier and enables a linking into the text parts. 
*Did the author use the automatic spell-checking features instead of applying hard coded – letters in the text? 


'''Checking the LaTeX document''' 

*Have the guidelines and rules been followed by the author? 
*Has the template or styles file been used? 
*Has the author used bibtex to collect the references? 
*Have all figures been provided in an EPS (encapsulated postscript) format? 
*Have all additional styles been provided by the author? 
*Is the whole ETD processible at a computer of the library or the computing centres? 


'''Checking the PDF document''' 
*Is the PDF document readable? Can it be opened within the actual version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader? 
*Does the PDF file contain all text pars? 
*Does it contain hyperlinks for multimedia additions? Do the hyperlinks work within an actual Internet browser? 


'''Checking the metadata''' 

*Has the author provided all Dublin Core metadata requested about himself and his thesis? 
*Are there keywords in different languages, according to different classification schemas? 
*Are there abstracts in different languages? 
*In which format has the metadata information been provided? 


== B.      Checking for an SGML/XML-based publication and archiving workflow ==


An SGML/XML-based archiving strategy today consist on a conversion workflow, as shown:

[[Image:SGMLXML_Workflow_Version_1.jpg]]


'''Workflow Version 1:''' 

The Conversion from native text formatting formats (like doc WinWord) into 
SGML/XML-compatible documents is done by a service of the university. Here checking and correcting 
basically consists of the checking of the adequate usage of the style sheets and the guidelines provided by the 
university. This procedure is in practice at Humboldt-University Berlin, at Université Lyon 2, Université de 
Montréal, … 

This checking has to be done within the word processing systems used, e.g. WinWord and can e.g. partially 
automated by Macros defined within the word processing system's macro language, e.g. Visual Basic. Then, the 
checking person of the staff runs this checking macros and can find out, whether special styles have been used 
or not. This checking procedure has to be added by a manual checking of the correct usage of the styles applied 
to the document by the author. For this reason it is very helpful to have a checklist for each document. This will 
ensure the level of strictness for the style control equivalent for every document. 


'''Workflow Version 2:''' 
The conversion from native text formats (like doc WinWord) into SGML/XML- 
compatible documents is done by the author himself or the author writes directly in SGML/XML. Here 
checking and correcting basically consists of the checking of the adequate usage of SGML/XML by an 
SGML/XML parser and concentrates especially on the correct usage of the document type definition (DTD) 
provided by the university and the guidelines. 

This procedure is e.g. in practice at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. 

[[Image:SGMLXML_Workflow_Version_2.jpg]]


This can completely automated by an SGML/XML-parser and checking scripts that produce an error list for the 
checking staff and can save a lot of time in comparison to the previously described workflow. The disadvantage 
of this model from today's perspective is that a very comprehensive author's support has to be designed and 
carried out, in order to enable authors either to perform an initial conversion from any text formatting system 
into an SGML/XML compliant document or to use an SGML/XML editor in a way that allows the author to 
understand and interpret messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Problem ==
 
If ETDs should be archived for he next 20-50 years and still be readable and usable, it in necessary, that 
equally to the approach for MS Word,  we use predefined style sheets for LaTeX. Only by standardising 
the usage of Latex, a quick and sustainable solution for a conversion into XML can be designed.  As 
LaTeX is mostly used within the natural sciences and mathematics, the encoding of complex 
mathematical symbols, formulas and expressions is one of the major problems for such a conversion. As 
there are XML document type definitions or schematics for mathematics, MathML (see 
http://www.w3.org/math ) and most math software, like Maple, Mathematica, etc. supports an export 
into MathML, this standards has to be used as an output from LaTeX as well. 

The LaTeX format should enable an easier conversion to XML, because of its structured approach to text 
processing. But the usage habits of LaTeX users, which tend to program complex macro packages in 
order to style a sophisticated print layout make it much more difficult to receive homogeneously 
structured documents in most cases. Also does the not parseability for structural and syntactical 
correctness complicates a conversion. 


Converting mathematical expressions into XML can be done using 3 different strategies: 

#Convert them into graphics that are easily interpreted and presented by common Internet 
browsers. Here a search within formulas or a further usage is excluded. 
#To convert them into MathML, 
#To leave them in a LaTeX encoding within the XML file. Then Plugins like IBM 
Techexplorer, or Math Viewer are able to interpret the LaTeX code and produce an on-the –fly rendering 
of formulas and mathematical expressions. 
 
There are semantic differences in LaTeX between the encoding of formulas. So authors have to be aware 
of the differences of LaTeX –tags or commands that are on a semantic level and on those, which are on a 
layout, level. 


''Example:'' 

Pi represents the mathematical constant, which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 
approximately 3.141592653. 

Encoding this in MathML &lt;pi&gt; 

&lt;apply&gt; 

&lt;approx/&gt; 

&lt;pi/&gt; 

:&lt;cn type = &quot;rational&quot;&gt;22&lt;sep/&gt;7&lt;/cn&gt; 
&lt;/apply&gt; 
 

This will be rendered as follows: 
 
Instead of coding it simply as letter pi, which may stay as a name for a variable: 

&lt;apply&gt; 
:&lt;approx/&gt; 
:&lt;pi/&gt; 
:&lt;cn type = &quot;rational&quot;&gt;22&lt;sep/&gt;7&lt;/cn&gt; 
&lt;/apply&gt; 

This would be rendered as: pi ≈ 22 / 7 
 

== Software and Tools: ==
 

In order to produce an XML document out of a LaTeX document there are several possibilities: 

*TeX4ht is a highly configurable TeX-based authoring system for producing hypertext. It interacts with TeX-based applications through style files and postprocessors, leaving the processing of the source files to the native TeX compiler. Consequently, TeX4ht can handle the features of TeX-based systems in general, and of the LaTeX and AMS style files in particular. (http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html ) 
*WebEQ : a Java-based collection of tools for authoring and rendering MathML, including a visual editor, a WebTeX to MathML translator, and a rendering applet for interactive mathematics on Web pages. WebEQ also provides Java Programmers with API documentation and libraries for other MathML aware applications. (http://www.dessci.com/de/features/win/default.stm#TeX or http://www.dessci.com/features/win/default.stm#TeX )

      <text xml:space="preserve">Performing a conversion from MS Word documents into instances of a specified SGML or XML DTD is a very 
complex task. What you will need for that is: 

*A SGML or XML document type definition (DTD) that serves as structure model for the output. One says that the output SGML document is valid to the specifies DTD, or it is an instance of this DTD: 
*A Word style sheet that holds paragraph and character styles according to the structures in the DTD. So if in a DTD you have defined a structure for Author (e.g. expressed in the output file as): 

:&lt;author&gt; 

:&lt;title&gt;Dr.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Peter&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;surname&gt;Fox&lt;/surname&gt; 

:&lt;/author&gt; 

:You have to find expression in Word:
 
:paragraph styles: author 

:character styles (just to be used within an author-paragraph): firstname, surname, title 

*You will need some kind of a configuration file that allows the mapping of the DTD elements into Word elements and vice versa. 
*You will need an SGML or XML parser to check the output SGML/ XML document against the DTD. 


Often a conversion is done by using a plug in to MS Word directly. But other options use the Microsoft internal 
exchange format RTF (Rich Text Format) for conversion. Those tools can interpreted the RTF file with the MS Word 
style that are still coded in this RTF file and export it into an SGML document. This process mostly happens within 
batch mode without using much graphical user interfaces. 


Within the following paragraphs we describe several approaches: 

1.  Approche of the Université de Montréal, Université de Lyon 2, Universidad de Chile 

2.  Humboldt-University Berlin and Germanwide Dissertation Online project 


 
There are other approaches in development as well, especially within Scandinavia and the University of Oslo/ 
Norway. We don't refer to their solution yet.


== Conversion method of the Cyber theses project ==

 
The process line for converting Word files into SGML documents developed within the CyberThèses project uses 
scripts written with the Omnimark language. 

The input of the process line is an RTF file with a &quot;structuring style sheet&quot; and the output is an SGML document 
encoded according to the TEI Lite DTD (see the TEI web site at http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html). 


The conversion process is constituted of three main steps : 

*a first one converts the RTF file into a flat XML file encoded according to DTD of RTF. The produced file is a linear sequence of paragraph elements having each one an explicit &quot;style name&quot; attribute corresponding to the RTF style names. 
*the second step consists in the re-generation of the hierarchical and logical structure of the document based on the analysis of style name attribute. 
*last, a SGML parser allows validating the conformity of the produced SGML document with the TEI Lite DTD. 


Some supplementary scripts then allow the export of the SGML document towards other formats (HTML, XML). 

Most of the scripts are available from the CyberTheses web site : http://www.cybertheses.org

This system is devoted to a particular DTD, but its generalization to other document models shall not raise any 
difficulty. 


== Using SGML Author for Word (Humboldt-University Berlin) ==
 

'''Why did we use the SGML Author for Word?''' 

The &quot;Dissertation Online&quot; project implemented and refined a conversion strategy that allows to convert documents 
written in MS word with a special style sheet (dissertation.dot) into an SGML instance of the DiM.dtd. 


We used this product from Microsoft, the SGML Author for Word, due to several reasons: 

*SGML Author is quite easy to configure 
*It is easy to use. 
*It is less expensive than other software producing SGML files with the same quality. 
*It supports an international standard for tables: CALS. 
*As it is a Word-Add-On it handles documents in MS-Word doc- format better than other tools. 
*As we started using this technology in 1997, it supported from the very beginning Word97, the version of word, which was the actual one that time. 
 

Unfortunately, Microsoft didn't continue the development of this tool. So there are new versions available for Office 
2000, Office XP, or Office 2007. But the internal document format from MS Word 97, MS Word 2000, Office XP, and Office 2007 are the same 
in the sense of the conversion into SGML. This means documents written in Word 2000, Office XP, or Office 2007 can be 
imported into Word97 and therefore a conversion can be done. 


'''Preconditions:'''
 
For a successful conversion from a word document into a DiML document you will need: 

*The DiML-document type definition (diml20.dtd, calstb.dtd) 
*the  SGML-Author for Word97 (may not available at Microsoft Shops any more, but NDLTD esp. Prof. Dr. Edward Fox may provide English versions of it that work with English Word) 
*The Association file for the Microsoft SGML-Author for Word (diml20.dta) 
*The converter style sheet, which consists of several macros programmed to make the preconversion process easier. 
*The perl programming language (free Software) 
*The nsgmls-Parser (free Software) 
*Several perl scripts to correct the transformation of tables. 
 

You must have the following software installed at you computer: 

*SP (NSGMLS) (Parser for SGML-Files by James Clark). (new version are available at http://openjade.sourceforge.net/doc-1.4/index.htm, but we haven’t tested that) 
*Run SP (A WYSIWYG tool for SP by Richard Light). http://www.light.demon.co.uk/runsp/index.htm 
*Perl (a scripting language for using the perl scripts). 


The converter style sheet and the author’s style sheet can be obtained from the following website: 
http://dochost.rz.hu-berlin.de/epdiss/vorlage.html 

Converter scripts and perlscripts can be obtained from http://www.educat.hu- 
berlin.de/diss_online/software/tools.exe  (Perl scriptc, DTD and converter file for MS SGML-Author for 
Word - KonverterDiML2_0.dta) 


'''Conversions''' 

The conversion from a Microsoft Word document into a SGML document, which is an instance of the DiML.dtd that 
is used at Humboldt-University, takes several steps: 


''1. Step: Preparing the conversion without using the converter Microsoft SGML Author for Word directly''
 
Check the correct usage 

Load the style sheet for conversion (NOT the one for the authors) see, see figure below. 

There is a special feature to get the page numbers out of the Word document by using certain word specific text 
anchors. Those have to be converted into hard coded information using a page number style sheet. 

Formatting that has been applied by the author without using style sheets have to be replaced by the correct style 
sheets. 

In order to get a correct display of tables later on by using CSS style sheets within common browsers, empty table 
cell have to be filled up with a single space (letter). 

Soft coded line breaks have to be preserved for the conversion. This is done by inserting special characters #BR# to 
that. This will be used to insert later a special SGML tag for soft line breaks &lt;br/&gt;.

''2. Step: Converting with Microsoft SGML Author for Word'' 

Press the button &quot;Save as SGML&quot; within the FILE menu. 

Load the converter file KonverterDiML2_0.DTA 

Check the XML/SGML output using the feedback file (fbk) see figure below. 

[[Image:InMS_Pic_2.jpg]]


''3. Step: Work through the output file (output according to the 
DiML.dtd)automatically.'' 

Load the perlskripts using the batch file preprocessor.bat 

Parse the DiML file 

Errors have to be wiped out manually 

[[Image:InMS_Pic_3.jpg]]


''4. Step: Transforming the DiML file into a HTML file'' 

Load the perl scripts by using the batch file did2html.bat 

Check the HTML Output. 

Correct possible errors manually within the SGML file and repeat the transformation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">WordPerfect supports structured writing since version 7. Most of the following text has been taken from 
a Whitepaper by Corel Inc. that appeared for WordPerfect 9 in June 1999. 

Writing XML using WordPerfect means that the author is forced to use specific structures. The software 
will parse the file by an underlying XML parser and check correctness of the written file while it is being 
written by the author. This may cause the system to slow down sometimes because the parsing process 
may take a lot of the system’s resources during that time. Generally, the writing behavior is different than 
the one for systems like Microsoft Word, where no parsing during runtime is being performed. As the 
author, you will have to think about your document structure, on how the information pieces are put 
together and follow each other (e.g. if something is supposed to be a heading or the beginning of a new 
chapter). 


Standard WordPerfect 9 templates allow users to embed XML components. These WordPerfect 
templates include the following XML components: 

#Document Type Definition (DTD) 
#Compiled version of the DTD, a Logic file (LGC) 
#Layout Specification Instance (LSI) 
#Alias File (LNM) 
 
The '''Document Type Definition (DTD)''' defines the elements and the structured relationship between the 
elements, entities and attributes. The DTD defines all valid elements; the order in which they can be used 
and how many times a particular element can appear in a document. When compiled as binary logic file 
(LGC) by the Word Perfect DTD Compiler, the DTD is integrated to a WordPerfect Template along with 
the Layout Specification Instance File and the Alias File. 

The '''Layout Specification Instance (LSI)''' specifies formatting information, such as bold, underline, 
italics etc., for the start and end tags. Layout files can associate elements with their respective 
WordPerfect styles. It is possible to insert a specific WordPerfect formatting command or a text string 
before, after or in place of a specified XML element. The .lsi file can run macros when users insert a 
specific element, so template designers can build dialog boxes, prompts and other help to the authors in 
order to support them in writing correct XML documents. It is possible to use several .lsi files with the 
same DTD. This is useful if multiple output formats have to be produced from the file, e.g. one for 
printing and one for online publishing. When compiled the .lsi file integrates to a WordPerfect template. 

An '''Alias''' file (LNM) specifies the descriptive names for elements in the DTD. This is useful when the 
tag names defined in the DTD are not appropriate for the end user. This may be because templates are 
created for end users who speak a different language or are created for a different audience. For instance 
non-technical users may relate to different tag names than technical users. 
WordPerfect also provides standards templates to the user and allows the creator to customize the user 
interface with menu items, toolbars and view of specific documents. All those elements may include and 
run macros. 


''Example:'' 
 
An example of a DTD, a LSI file and a WordPerfect template for digital dissertations used in Germany 
(Humboldt-University Berlin) is provided to the users of the guide. If you want to write a dissertation in 
XML using WordPerfect you have to work with the SGML/XML functionality. Please consult the 
information center of the installation CD-Rom of the WordPerfect suite with the keyword SGML. A 
detailed installation and usage guide will be shown. 

You will need the following files: 

*diml1_0.dtd 
*diml1_0.lgc               Logic file 
*diml.lsi                       Layout file 
*diml.lnm                     Alias file 
*dissertation.wpt        Dissertation style sheet 
 

WordPerfect provides the user also with the following programs: 
*a XML File Wizard, 
*a XML Project Designer, 
*a XML DTD Compiler, 
*a structured Tree View, 
 

In order to compile a DTD into a Logic file, you have to follow the steps: 
 
1.      copy the following files into the corel\suite8\programs\mapfiles directory: 
diml1_0.dtd; cals_tbl.dtd;hubspec.ent 
 
2.      Edit the iso8879.map file in a text editor: 

Add the lines: 

PUBLIC     &quot;-//HUBspec//ENTITIES Special Symbols//EN&quot; &quot;hubspec.ent&quot; 

PUBLIC     &quot;-//HUB//DTD Cals-Table-Model//EN&quot; &quot;cals_tbl.dtd&quot; 


Press Compile. Now the LGC file has been produced and is usable for writing an SGML/XML 
document. 

You can now open WordPerfect and choose Tools / SGML / Document types. Here point to the created 
diml1_0.LGC file and if you want to use a standard layout to the diml.LSI file. 

Your own layout can be produced using the Layout Designer program that is in the WordPerfect suite. 
Just choose open diml1_0.lsi or open a new file and start creating or manipulating your own layout style. 

Start writing a dissertation directly with SGML/XML by choosing under WordPerfect the option Tools / 
SGML / Document types. 

Usually there has been a native WordPerfect template produced in order to help you with additional drop 
down menus etc. To use the provided template for WordPerfect 8 you have to choose File / New / 
Options / Add Project / Add new document / Call it &quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; / Search for dissertation.WPT. 
This allows you now to use the WordPerfect style sheet by choosing under the main window: File / New 
/ Choose &quot;Digital Dissertation&quot; and Create.  This enables the functions of the drop down menu as in the 
following figure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ADT Program is an Australian university libraries initiative. The library at the ADT member 
institution provides local support. Support to academics and students is varied and depends on the levels 
of expertise of the individuals involved in the submission process. The levels of support offered include: 

*provision of workstation/s, including software, in the library dedicated to the submission process plus library technical support as appropriate to aid students to submit and convert files into PDF 
*provision of basic instructions and information for students wanting to submit theses independently. See example of this at The University of New South Wales: http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/theses.html#dep 
*library technical expertise to entirely do the submission &amp; conversion process on behalf of students 
*provision of information via the library's website, pamphlets, presentations, formal letters &amp; information for faculties, schools, graduate committees, academic staff and students about the local ADT Programs. The sharing of this information by the ADT member institutions as well 
*broader support at the institutional level - sharing expertise, knowledge and information as appropriate 
 
All library support is seen as part of the normal university scholarly process and is provided free of any

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Australian Digital Theses Program'''

http://adt.caul.edu.au/

ADT Program is a collaborative Australia-wide university libraries initiative. Membership is open to all Australian universities and is voluntary. National coordination of the ADT is via the Council of Australian University Librarians [CAUL; an umbrella group representing all Australian university libraries]. The ADT Steering Committee is currently investigating a proposal to further extend ADT Program &amp; software to the Australasian region.

ADT software was designed to be transportable and to be flexible enough to be 'plugged in' at each member institution with minimum modification. The ADT software was also designed to automatically generate simple core metadata which is gathered automatically to form national distributed 'metadata' database of ADT-ETDs

ADT software is based on the original Virginia Tech [VT] software. The original ADT v1.0/1999 released in April 1999, with upgrade v1.1/2000 released in October 2000.


'''ADT software basics''':

*perl scripts extended by the library cgi.pm, which uses objects to create web forms on the fly and parse their content
*facilitates file uploading and form handling by generation of html via function call and passing of the form state
*extension of variable use to make scripts more generic to facilitate local institutional setup and style
*developed a standard for generation of unique addresses [URLs] for deposited documents
*automatic generation of DC metadata from the deposited information

The distribution software package requires modification of a list of variables and some webserver-dependent adjustments so it runs in standard way for each of the local institutions. Local search software, which may be institution-mandated, is not included in the package. It is expected that each institution will use their own security accordingly.


'''ADT software overview''':

*Deposit Form : generic look and feel; includes copyright and authenticity statements; complete set up help screens; quality control using alerts when errors are made and does not allow non compliance with core ADT standards
*Administration pages: possible to edit html and change document restrictions; also possible to add, delete, rename files as well as moving files to no access directory to restrict files temporarily for copyright reasons; varying levels of restrictions possible; easy to 'un make' deposit
*Metadata: revised and updated according to latest DC Qualifiers document; generated and gathered automatically, used to create central national searchable 'metadata' database
*ADT Standards: few, simple but necessary for success of collaborative program. Core standards are - research theses only; PDF document format; PDF filename convention; unique URL; Metadata standard.


'''Summary''':

*the ADT software &amp; model is fully transportable and designed to be easily installed locally by any participating institution regardless of local IT infrastructure and architecture
*the ADT software facilitates loading digital versions of theses to the local institutions' servers where the PDF files will be housed permanently
*the theses can be fully integrated into the local access infrastructure and searched using any local database, and/or the local web based catalogue
*all ADT Program theses can also be searched nationally via the ADT Program metadata database. This database is constructed from DC metadata generated automatically during the deposit process. The metadata gathered creates rich records that allow highly flexible and specific searching, with links back to the local institutions' servers where the full digital theses are housed
*the ADT Program is a collaborative effort across the whole Australian university community and a proven model for creating a national dataset of digitised theses
*the ADT software and model is relatively inexpensive to install, integrate within local requirements and process. Once this is achieved it is virtually maintenance free, is sustainable, scalable, and very cost effective for both the institution and the student/author
*the ADT metadata and other standards conform to current internationalstandards and therefore have potential to integrate with other international open archive initiatives
*theses can be deposited from anywhere, and similarly, the metadata can be gathered from anywhere
*full details and information available from the ADT homepage

      <text xml:space="preserve">An archival infrastructure for ETD should not only consider document format or the use of digital signatures, but also a consequently run concept for mirroring and backups.

Mirrors ensure, that archives run stable, regardless of usage, bandwidth and location.

A common server concept for an ETD archive is the following one:
#Production server
#Archive Server (Storage Unit, like IBMs Tivoli Storage Management System)
#Public Archive server
#Archive Mirror at different geographical location.

The '''production server''' is the server that communicates with the users, especially the authors. Here the uploads and metadata processing is done.

The '''archive server''' ensures that a permanent incremental backup of the public archive server is done. Only system administrators have access to the archive server. This secures the access to the ETDs and their digital signatures. It prevents users from manipulating ETDs and their authenticity and integrity.

The '''public archive''' server itself is the server that is known as the document server from the outside. Here the ETDs can be access by users, the retrieval is available. We advise to secure this server with a special RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) system, that allows a security in case of a hardware failure of the disk, that might be caused by extreme usage of the server. A RAID system holds internally 2 equal copies of the server distributed on independent hard disks. So if one copy cannot be accessed due to a head crash or other hardware inconsistencies, the second copy will take over functionality and operate as the first copy. The user itself will not realize, which copy is actually in use.

Additionally to the '''archive server''' there should be another storage management system server, an archive mirror that mirrors the original archive. This is important if due to environmental accidents e.g. fire, earthquake or anything else destroys the original archive server. So a data loss, or the loss of the full archive can be prevented. This backup archive should be located at another geographical position, even at another continent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Scope of the workshop'''

The Idea behind this workshop was to bring together experts and developers working on SGML or XMLbased Document Type Definitions for electronic theses and dissertations. Within the NDLTD-initiative several document type definitions (DTDs) for dissertations have been developed. To come to a standardized or generalized searching and archiving structure, it is absolutely necessary to summarize all those developments and research and to work out correspondences between all of them. If SGML and XML are the preferred future document formats for theses and dissertations, the DTD will play a major role within the whole initiative. The following questions were discussed:
* How to get to a generalized DTD?
* Is there just one DTD necessary or is it possible to have more than one DTD, e.g., for different subjects and sciences?
* Where exactly are the current differences between the existing document type definitions?
* Which approach shall we follow to unify our DTDs?
* How to come to an agreed Dublin-Core metadata element set?
* How many markup should be done by the author, how much by machine translation?
* Evaluating several tools and ways to come to an SGML/XML-based document


'''Outcome'''

This expert workshop covering the topic of using XML for publishing theses and dissertations electronically in universities was held in May 2000 at Humboldt-University Berlin, Germany. It focused on the ways in which XML can be used in university libraries in order to deliver, process and archive scholarly high quality electronic publications. The recognition that a worldwide range of various approaches for SGML/XML-based publishing concepts exists, led to the conclusion that interoperability on an international level is inevitable. Experts from the USA, Finland, Norway, Sweden, France, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Germany discussed commonalities and differences among their models, approaches and document type definitions (DTDs).


'''An Objective of the Workshop'''

The objective of the workshop was also to exchange experiences in document conversion and author's support therein, to agree on a Dublin Core metadata set worldwide and to share tools. The potential support of authors was recognized as a very essential part within the electronic publishing workflow. Attempts to convince authors to leave their native word processing systems for systems that support structured writing and/or export to SGML or XML usually tend to fail, for several reasons. First, authors are reluctant to switch from the system they are used to. This is exacerbated by the fact that publications usually have to be written within a very short time frame, leaving little or no time for authors to learn a new system, even if they were so inclined. Until XML authoring and editing tools become as simple to use as a word processor, this approach will still be viewed as an added burden to the student. Second, current SGML/XML support systems are usually far more expensive than common ones.


'''Prearchival Format'''

Many universities follow another strategy and accept documents in a pre-archival format. This necessitates conversion of the documents by the university libraries or media center. The advantage is that authors are able to prepare their documents within their native word processing systems using style sheets especially designed for that conversion, e.g., in Microsoft Word. Some institutions that have a high focus on format are reluctant to approve this method because the SGML or XML publication may be altered from the word processing document that was deposited by the student. Even though this method seems to exact a high resource cost, it is a step toward the ideal, where authors write in XML directly, using their native word processors. We are not far from this ideal.


'''ETD Projects with XML-based Approach'''

The following electronic theses and dissertation (ETD) projects have an XML- based approach already in place or are presently in a pilot phase:
* Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) Libraries, SWEDEN,
* Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, University Libraries, USA
* Sentiers, Université Lumiére, Lyon 2, (Cytbertheses.org project), FRANCE
* University of Montreal, CANADA
* Universidad de Chilé (Santiago de Chilé), CHILE
* Humboldt-University Berlin, &quot;Dissertation Online&quot;, GERMANY
* University of Oslo, Center for Information Technology Services, NORWAY
* University of Iowa, Graduate College, USA
* University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Library, USA
* Helsinki University of Technology, Library, FINLAND

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: cataloger → cataloguer (3) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many traditional library systems exchange and store records using the MARC Format (Machine Readable Catalog), one of the realizations of the ISO 2709 Standard. The MARC Format has approximately 1,000 fields, many with subfields which can be repeated. The use of this format allows a very detailed description of the items. This format has a specific field (856) to identify of electronic objects associated with the intellectual item and its other physical instances.

The DCMES (Dublin Core Metadata Element Set - http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/) is a set of 15 attributes divided into 3 groups: content, intellectual property and instanciation. Associated to them there are the Dublin Core Qualifiers (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-qualifiers/) that enhance the identification of the items.

There is a relation between the MARC Format and the DCMES since there is an intersection between the 2 sets of attributes.

The RDF (Resource Description Framework - http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/rec-rdf-syntax-19990222/) is a foundation for processing metadata. It specifies a representation for metadata as well as the syntax for encoding and transporting this metadata. The objective is to yield interoperability of Web servers and clients, and to facilitate automation of processing of resources. It can be used to describe Web pages, sites or digital libraries.

The DCMES can be used with the RDF representation.


'''Considering the MARC Record and the Cataloging Department Work Flow'''

MARC Bibliographic Records

Catalogers may want to focus initially on what fields are currently included in the MARC bibliographic record for theses and how these would be the same or different for ETDs. The MARC record for theses is not very robust and often has a local twist, presenting valuable information in a unique format that can be seen only at the originating institution. Optimally, author, title, abstract, and other relevant bibliographic information would be programmatically adapted to the appropriate MARC fields. The extent of AACR2r compliance was another complicating factor. For example, would programming change upper-case letters to lower case?

Requiring authors of theses (in all formats) to provide keywords for use in the bibliographic record may enhance search results. Assigning Library of Congress subject headings (or other controlled vocabulary) is very time consuming, so having the authors assign the uncontrolled subject headings may be an appropriate alternative. MARC tag 653 would be appropriate for author-assigned terms. Without LC subject headings, however, these MARC records would be considered &quot;minimal level,&quot; rather than full level, cataloging. This seemed particularly unjust to because the ETD bibliographic records would actually be more robust than previous theses cataloging because additional information is included.

The catalogers on the ad hoc task force suggested including tables of contents (MARC tag 505) and abstracts (MARC tag 520) since the standard copy-and-paste features of today's word processors would make this a relatively easy process. The table of contents for dissertations, however, proved to be quite generic, usually containing only the standard dissertation topics (e.g., literature review, methodology, findings, etc.), and, therefore, not an enhancement to the information available about the work in the OPAC. The abstract, however, contains valuable information and provides valuable information about the research topic. The 520 is also an indexed field in our online catalog and, therefore, a word-searchable field for OPAC users. Adding the abstract (250-350 words) can, however, add tremendously to the length of the MARC record. See ''figure 2'' and ''figure 3''.

Cataloging conventions have not generally included the name of the thesis author's department as a standard feature of the bibliographic record. This is an opportunity to modify local cataloging practices.

Taking advantage of the opportunity to incorporate changes in theses cataloging, consider using MARC tag 502, the dissertation note field, to include the degree, institution, and year the degree was granted, expanding institution to include the name of the department. The new note would follow this example: 

502 Thesis (Ph. D. in Mechanical Engineering)--Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1955.

Evaluating the potential value of an e-thesis bibliographic record provides the opportunity to propose a substantially enhanced record of real and continuing value to OPAC users. AACR2r compliance may be an issue. In reviewing her Cataloging Internet Resources: A Manual and Practical Guide, Nancy Olson states that when cataloging Internet-accessible documents, consider them to be published documents. Therefore, publisher information belongs in field 260 of an e-thesis record. [Coming from a serials background it seems reasonable to add a 710 for this corporate body tracing.] Additional fields required for cataloging computer files include tag 256 for computer file characteristics, tag 538 for notes of system details, and tag 856 for formatted electronic location and access information. These additional fields (505, 260, 710, etc.), however, also increase the length of the record and, therefore, should be carefully considered as should the usefulness of the information provided in meeting the combined needs of OPAC users and computerized access and retrieval systems.&lt;br /&gt;

In terms of the broader topic of bibliographic control of electronic publications, focus on adding to current cataloging practices those fields that would enhance the OPAC users' access and conform to AACR2r. So many of the fields describing computer files appear to be redundant; 245 \h, 256, 516, and 538, for example; which tell the OPAC user over and over that the item is a computer file. To stay within the stringent restrictions of full-level cataloging, the members of the task force saw no way to avoid requiring catalogers to use most of the available fields. Concentrate on the MARC tags that would provide information about access. The principal fields include: 256 (computer file characteristics), 506 (restrictions on access note), 516 (type of computer file or data note), 530 (other formats available), 538 (system details note), 556 (accompanying documentation), and 856 (electronic location and access).

Current OPACs, in addition to the limitations of hardware and workstations, however, still prevent most users from accessing electronic texts or images directly and smoothly from one menu or even from a single, multi-function workstation. However, workstations are gradually becoming available that permit users to copy the URL from the bibliographic record and paste it into a World Wide Web browser for accessing an e-text from a single terminal. Knowing this was possible include MARC tag 856.

Another issue that must be addressed is using subfield u or splitting the URL into the multiple subfields. We went for simplicity and decided to format the 856 subfield u so that it could be copied and pasted into a World Wide Web browser. Again, we were not willing to wait for the programming that would be necessary to combine the separate subfields into a clickable URL.

Cataloging has greatly benefited from advances in library automation and the cataloging of e-texts is ripe for further automation. It is now possible to derive MARC cataloging from text mark-up languages, subsets of XL, SGML such as TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) headers, and possibly even HTML (hypertext markup language) tags.

In addition to considering the MARC record and the cataloging department work flow, consider a procedure for getting the files from the Graduate School (approving unit), the mechanics of making an ETD available to a cataloguer (from the secure and private environment of the server) and for moving an ethesis into public access. Have the cataloguer forward a copy as each ETD is processed to a server at UMI. If UMI would prefer batch processing, files could be accumulated (i.e., stored in a directory on the etheses server) for batched file transfer, or perhaps a UMI-access point could be established on the ETD server from which its staff could retrieve them.

With input from the University Archivist and addressing a concern of the Graduate School's, long term preservation and access of ETDs should also be factored into the procedures. A plan may include periodically writing ETDs to CD-ROMs for security back-ups and possibly longer term preservation. While this is may not be the final answer, an alternative has not been brought forward; how frequently this would be done has also not been determined.

Theses and dissertations as electronic files may be the first major source of electronic texts that many libraries encounter regularly. Seize this opportunity to enhance the OPAC users search results by expanding current theses cataloging and taking advantage of online information prepared by authors. Since authors will probably not be adding TEI, MARC, or other element tags to their documents to help cataloging in the near term, catalogers could use the information available in a variety of online sources including the document itself or from the online submission form to provide the basic descriptive MARC fields. Whether programmatic changes can be made or standard copy-and-paste features of word processors are incorporated, enhancing the ETD bibliographic record does not require a lot of extra work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''World Diversity'''

Our world is a very diverse place. We have many geographies, climates, races, cultures, and languages. Another characteristic that differentiates places of the world is the level of development. This creates various levels of access to:
* Food and water
* Housing, electricity and sanitation
* Medical care
* Education
* Jobs
* Information and knowledge


'''World Infrastructure'''

Infrastructure is different in different regions of the world too. Third world nations have characteristic social/economic gaps among groups of persons and/or regions within the countries. In one nation, developed areas, where people have access to all the items listed above and where infrastructure is good, coexist with very poor regions where living conditions are bad.

This coexistence leads to a varied range of infrastructure levels in general and in universities too. There are universities with very good campuses and with the infrastructure comparable to those in developed nations. Others have bad installation, lack equipment and do not have good networks and Internet connections. This bad fortune reflects on students, faculty and staff who may not be proficient with information technology tools.

When an ETD program is considered, some aspects of the infrastructure must be examined. They can be grouped in 3 categories, as follows.


'''Local (in the university) infrastructure'''

* The level of automation of the library in terms of cataloging of the collection, library system, equipment for the staff and for end users, etc.
* The number and quality of machines available to students
* The number and quality of machines available to the administrative staff
* The network conditions - connection to all university buildings, speed, reliability and support
* The level of computer literacy of students, faculty, library staff and administrative staff
* The number of machines connected to the Internet
* The connection of the university network to WAN's and the Internet - speed, reliability and support


'''Regional and national infrastructure'''

* The network connections - speed, reliability and support;
* The existence of other ETD and/or digital library projects to develop the culture and to seek/provide support
* The possibility of funding, from agencies and/or private companies, to ETD programs Global
* The network connections - speed, reliability and support;
* The dissemination of information on ETD and/or digital library projects to provide support to those who want to start programs
* The agreement on minimum standards for systems, technology and metadata to allow interoperability and seamless access
* The discussion and agreement on languages to identify ETDs so that they can be searched, retrieved and used

      <text xml:space="preserve">Looking at this problem, it first gives the impression that because writing in LaTeX is also a kind of structured writing, a conversion into SGML or XML compatible documents can quite easily be done.

Often people use as software Onmimark, Balise or simple Perl scripts for conversion.


'''Problems'''

Problem 1
The LaTeX format itself enables due to the structural approach an easier conversion into SGML/XML. But often the pure LaTeX approach goes hand in hand with sophisticated macro programming, so that in many cases the pure structure of a LaTeX document will be destroyed by macros or the conversion will be much harder to perform. Also the lack of a parser that checks the correct usage of structure elements like chapter, section, subsection make a conversion more complicated.

Problem 2
If an author wants to define a mathematical formula in LaTeX, he has 2 basic opportunities:
*Producing the mathematical formula as picture
*Defining them with the appropriate mathematical LaTeX features as text formulas.


'''First and Second Versions'''

The first version prevents from any secondary usage of the formula. The second version allows the reusability of a formula in different contexts. So it makes it easy to prove correctness of a statement by importing the LaTeX formula into a mathematical software package like Maple or Mathematica. Formulas coded in LaTeX can be displayed in a rendered form in an browser by software or plug-ins like &lt;u&gt;IBM Techexplorer, Math Viewer&lt;/u&gt;. As LaTeX coded formulas still have the disadvantage, that they are not encoded using so called sematic tags, the usage of MathML is highly advised &lt;u&gt;MathML&lt;/u&gt; is an XML document type definition for mathematics developed by the W3C.


'''The Letter e'''

In LaTeX authors often don't distinguish between the letter 'e', that may stand for a variable and the Euler constant. In MathML there is a huge difference whether something is encoded as variable e or as the Euler e (2,718. . . ). Therefor, the usage of layout definition in LaTeX for mathematics complicats the conversion into MathML and therefore into any SGML/XML format.


'''Possible Solutions'''

In order to prepare mathematical formulas in LaTeX for a conversion, many universities and the TeX. User Groups around the world are working soon the definition of certain macros that can be transformed into the appropriate MathML definitions.

See University of Montréal at www.theses.umontreal.ca or University of the Bundeswehr in Munich.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Performing a conversion from MS Word documents into instances of a specified SGML or XML DTD is a very complex task. What you will need for that is:
* A SGML or XML document type definition (DTD) that serves as structure model for the output. One says that the output SGML document is valid to the specifies DTD, or it is an instance of this DTD:
* A Word stylesheet that holds paragraph and character styles according to the structures in the DTD. So if in a DTD you have defined a structure for Author: e.g. expressed in the output file as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;author&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Dr.&lt;/title&gt;&lt;firstname&gt;Peter&lt;/firstname&gt;&lt;surname&gt;Fox&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/author&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You have to find expression in Word:
paragraph styles: author
character styles (just to be used within an author-paragraph): first name, surname, title
* You will need some kind of a configuration file that allows the mapping of the DTD elements into Word elements and vice versa.
* You will need an SGML or XML parser to check the output SGML/ XML document against the DTD.


'''Conversion Methods'''

Often a conversion is done by using a plug into MS Word directly, but other options use the Microsoft internal exchange format RTF (Rich Text Format) for conversion. Those tools can interpret the RTF file with the MS Word style that is still coded in this RTF file and export it into an SGML document. This process mostly happens within batch mode without using many graphical user interfaces.

Within the following paragraphs we describe several approaches:
#Approach of the Université de Montréal, Université de Lyon 2, Universidad de Chile
#Humboldt-University Berlin and Germanwide Dissertation Online project

There are other approaches in development as well, especially within Scandinavia and the University of Oslo/ Norway. We don't refer to their solution yet.


'''Conversion method of the Cybertheses project

Proposition of section (Vivi)
The process line for converting Word files into SGML documents developed within the CyberThèses project uses scripts written with the Omnimark language.

Coversion Process
The input of the process line is an RTF file with a &quot;structuring style sheet&quot; and the output is an SGML document encoded according to the TEI Lite DTD (see the TEI web site at http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html). 

The conversion process is made up of three main steps :
*first, one converts the RTF file into a flat XML file encoded according to DTD of RTF. The produced file is a linear sequence of paragraph elements each one having an explicit &quot;stylename&quot; attribute corresponding to the RTF style names.
*the second step consists of the re-generation of the hierarchical and logical structure of the document based on the analysis of stylename attribute.
*last, a SGML parser allows one to validate the conformity of the produced SGML document with the TEI Lite DTD. Some supplementary scripts then allow the export of the SGML document towards other formats (HTML, XML).

Most of the scripts will soon be available from the CyberTheses web site : http://www.cybertheses.org
This system is devoted to a particular DTD, but its generalization to other document models shall not pose any difficulty.


'''Using SGML Author for Word (Humboldt-University Berlin)'''

Why did we use the SGML Author for Word?

The &quot;Dissertation Online&quot; project implemented and refined a conversion strategy that allows writers to convert documents written in MS word with a special stylesheet (dissertation.dot) into an SGML instance of the DiM.dtd.

We used this product from Microsoft, the SGML Author for Word, for several reasons:
#SGML Author is quite easy to configure
#It is easy to use.
#It is less expensive than other software producing SGML files with the same quality.
#It support an international standard for tables: CALS.
#As it is a Word-Add-On it handles docuents in MS-Word doc- format better than other tools.
#As we started using this technology in 1997, it supported from the very beginning Word97, the version of word which was the actual one that time.

Unfortunately, Microsoft didn't continue the development of this tool. So there are no new versions available for Office 2000 or Office XP. However, the internal document format from MS Word 97, MS Word 2000 and Office XP are the same in the sense of the conversion into SGML. This means documents written in Word 2000 or Office XP can be imported into Word97 and therefore a conversion can be done.


'''Preconditions'''

For a successful conversion from a word document into a DiML document you will need:
*The DiML-document type definition (diml20.dtd, calstb.dtd)
*the SGML-Author for Word97 (may not available at Microsoft Shops any more, but NDLTD esp. Prof. Dr. Edward Fox may provide English versions of it that work with English Word)
*The Association file for the Microsoft SGML-Author for Word (diml20.dta)
*The converter stylesheet, which consists of several macros programmed to make the preconversion process easier.
*The perl programming language (free Software)
*The nsgmls-Parser (free Software)
*Several perl scripts to correct the transformation of tables.


'''Software'''

You must have the following software installed at you computer:
*SP (NSGMLS) (Parser for SGML-Files by James Clark). (new versions are availabe at http://openjade.sourceforge.net/doc-1.4/index.htm, but we haven’t tested that)
*Run SP (A WYSIWYG tool for SP by Richard Light). http://www.light.demon.co.uk/runsp/index.htm
*Perl (a scripting language for using the perl scripts).

The converter stylesheet and the authors stylesheet can be obtained from the following website: http://dochost.rz.hu-berlin.de/epdiss/vorlage.html

Converter scripts and perlscripts can be optained from http://www.educat.huberlin.de/diss_online/software/tools.exe (Perl scriptc, DTD and converter file for MS SGML-Author for Word - KonverterDiML2_0.dta)


'''Conversions'''

The conversion from a Microsoft Word document into a SGML document, which is an instance of the DiML.dtd that is used at Humboldt-University, takes several steps:

'''Step 1'''

Preparing the conversion without using the converter Microsoft SGML Author for Word directly
*Check the correct usage
*Load the stylesheet for conversion (NOT the one for the authors), see figure below.
*There is a special feature to get the page numbers out of the Word document by using certain word specific text anchors. Those have to be converted into hard coded information using a page numer stylesheet.
*Formattings that have been applied by the author without using style sheets have to be replaced by the correct style sheets.
*In order to get a correct display of tables later on by using CSS stylesheets within common browsers, empty table cell have to be filled up with a single space (letter).
*Soft coded line breaks have to be preserved for the conversion. This is done by inserting special characters &lt;nowiki&gt;#BR#&lt;/nowiki&gt; to that. This will be used to insert later a special SGML tag for soft line breaks &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

'''Step 2'''

Converting with Microsoft SGML Author for Word
*Press the button &quot;Save as SGML&quot; within the FILE menu.
*Load the converter file KonverterDiML2_0.DTA
*Check the XML/SGML output using the feedback file (fbk) see figure below.

'''Step 3'''

Work through the output file (output according to the DiML.dtd) automatically.
*Load the perlskripts using the batch file preprocessor.bat
*Parse the DiML file

'''Step 4'''

Transforming the DiML file into a HTML file
*Load the perl scripts by using the batch file did2html.bat
*Check the HTML Output.
*Correct possible errors manually within the SGML file and repeat the transformation.

A demonstration quicktime video may be found at the ETD-Guide server as well. (see http://www.educat.hu-berlin.de/diss_online/software/didi.mov)


'''Using FrameMaker+SGML6.0 for a conversion of MS Word documents into SGML instances.'''

Editing or converting using FrameMaker is much more complex than the previously described methods. FrameMaker is able to import formatted Word documents keeping the stylesheet information and exporting the document via an internal FrameMaker format as SGML or XML documents. In order to proceed with a conversion using FrameMaker you will need the following configuration files.
#A conversion table. This contains the list of the Word styles and the corresponding elements within the FrameMaker internal format. This table is saved within the FrameMaker internal format (*.frm).
#A document type definition will be saved within FrameMaker internally as EDD (Element Definition) It is saved within the FrameMaker internal document format (*.edd)
#FrameMaker uses layout rules for the internal layout of documents. Within this layout definition the layout of documents is described just like it is within MS Word documents: single formats and their appearances like text height, etc. are defined. This file is also stored as (*.frm file).
#The Read-Write Rules contain rules that define which FrameMaker format will be exported in which SGML / XML element.
#The SGML- or XML DTD has to be used as well, including Catalog- or Entity files, as well as Sub DTDs, like CALS for tables.
#To process a conversion a new SGML application has to be defined within FrameMaker+SGML. This application links all files that are needed for a conversion as described above. It enables FrameMaker to parse the output file when exporting a document to SGML or XML:

A workflow and a technology for conversion for ETD using FrameMaker+SGML6.0 was first developed at the Technical University Helsinki, within the HUTPubl project (1997-2000), see http://www.hut.fi/Yksikot/Kirjasto/HUTpubl


'''Other Tools'''

Text editors, Desktop Publishing Systems that can export SGML/XML documents&lt;br /&gt;

Tools that export using a user specified DTD:
*WordPerfect since Version 7.0 (Corel) (http://www.corel.com )
*FrameMaker+SGML6.0 (Adobe) (http://www.adobe.com )&lt;br /&gt;


Tools that export using their own native DTD:
*Openoffice (SUN/open source ) (http://www.openoffice.org )
*AbiWord (AbiWord/ open source) (http://www.abisource.com )
*Kword (KOffice, KDE Project/ open source) (http://www.kde.org )&lt;br /&gt;


Converter Tools:
*Omnimark (Omnimark) (http://www.omnimark.com )
*MarkupKit (Schema) (http://www.schema.de )
*Majix (Tetrasix) (http://www.tetrasix.com )
*TuSTEP (RZ Uni Tübingen) (http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/zdv/tustep/index.html)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The www.cybertheses.org site is the result of cooperative project that started at first between l’Université de Montréal &quot;http://www.theses.umontreal.ca/&quot; et l’Université Lumière, Lyon 2 &quot;http://www.univlyon2.fr/, supported by the Fonds Francophone des Inforoutes &quot;http://www.francophonie.org/fonds/&quot;, and dealing with the theme of the electronic publication and distribution of theses on the Web.

At first, this cooperation dealt with the conception and creation of a production line for electronic documents, using the SGML norm. It also had the objective of setting up a server to be shared by the different participating establishments so as to allow their theses to be indexed.

In a desire for openness, we decided to enlarge participation on this server to all establishments of higher education distributing full-text versions of their thesis on the Internet, without constraints based on the language used or on the chosen format of distribution.

The www.cybertheses.org site allows theses to be indexed on line using a common metadata model. Its implementation provides a structure for this growing cooperative effort by basing itself on the Internet’s own modes of functioning and of distributing skills. Our wish is that it can quickly ensure a better distribution of the research work conducted within the participating establishments and serve as an effective tool for the entire community of researchers.

From the conception of the project, the partners wanted to contribute to the distribution of software tools created for use in the university environment. These tools are available to the partners in the Cybertheses network. They permit all the partners to participate, on equal footing, in the construction of an electronic university library that functions in a dispersed manner and applies the concept of distributed intelligence.

One of the principles that motivated the implementation of this program is to favor, as much as possible, the re-appropriation of research work by the researchers themselves. Our objective is to eventually help create a new political economy of knowledge, which makes researchers the masters of their publications, beyond any economic constraints. Many aspects of our project respond to this goal:
*Placing theses freely and completely on-line on the Internet, and thus widening their distribution, means that the thesis will no longer be considered as solely the result of a research project. It will instead become a genuine work instrument integrated to a much larger system in order to satisfy the user’s demand.
*The creation of the Cybertheses database containing the metadata of the participating institutions’ theses. Cybertheses provides an efficient indexation system and rapid searching, even while significantly increasing the visibility and the distribution of the theses.
*The use of free or freely distributed software is favored at each stage of the production and distribution process.
*The sharing of research, self-created software programs, and documentation between the
Cybertheses partners, thereby creating a &quot;toolbox&quot; permitting participation in the program.

The Cybertheses partners are concerned with developing solutions that can be used by all actors, be they of the North, South or East. Our procedure in based on appropriating the skills and techniques related to the electronic production and distribution of the university community’s research results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">(This section was taken from an article by P. Potter, P. Strabala, D.Dobratz, M. Schulz about ETDs, that is due to appear in &quot;The Internet and Higher education&quot; 4/2001)


'''XML Authoring Systems'''

The fact that currently available authoring systems for XML still have not won wide recognition has led to different strategies at different universities regarding XML documents. Most of these projects were started between 1995 and 1997, in a time when XML was alive, but where tools or standardized DTDs were barely available. A view of those projects from today’s perspective illustrates the demand for a rethinking and redesign of those approaches in order to come to a standardization.


'''DTDs'''

All the presented DTDs are built upon similar principles. A classical dissertation (which can be seen as monograph) consists of 3 main components: an extensible titlepage with abstracts, declarations, etc., the dissertation corpus, which includes text, pictures, audio, video, tables and so on, and appendices, which contain data sheets, bibliographies, acknowledgements and others.

The following DTDs are currently in use at different institutions:
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:1em;&quot;&gt;
*ETD-ML.DTD: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)
*DiML.DTD: German Dissertationen Online Projectes
*UIowa2K.DTD: University of Iowa
*HutPubl.DTD: Technical University Helsinki
*TEI-Light.DTD: Ann Arbor und Lyon
*ISOBook.DTD: University of Oslo
*TEI-based DTD with extensions for natural sciences: Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences Uppsala
&lt;/div&gt;


'''Author-DTDs'''

All these Document Type Definitions are so-called author-DTDs. This means that they are primarily used to support the authoring and the conversion process and do not primarily address document archiving and preservation. One may ask why all those different DTDs have prevailed. This is mainly because the scientific orientation of the mentioned universities is quite varied. Lyon, Oslo and Michigan, which use TEI-Light.dtd, mainly serve students in the arts and humanities. Problems using TEI.DTD or DocBook.DTD are recognized at universities that support a strong natural science community, such as Berlin, Helsinki or Uppsala. Often a dissertation is a cumulative work, e.g., in Lyon or Helsinki.

Université Laval, in collaboration with the Université de Montréal, is working during 2001-2002 on the modelisation of a new DTD for ETD. The DTD and its documentation will be post at http://www.theses.umontreal.ca.


'''DTDs for multimedia content'''

&quot;Structured data,&quot; such as mathematical or chemical formulas, spreadsheets, address books, configuration parameters, financial transactions, technical drawings, etc., are usually published on the Web using layout programs such as Postscript or PDF, or by putting them into graphic formats like gif, jpeg, png, vrml, and so on. Programs that produce such data often also store it on disk, using either a binary or text format. Therefore, if someone wants to look at the data, he usually needs the program that produced it. With XML, data could be stored in text format, which allows the user to read the file without having the original program. XML can be thought of as a set of rules, guidelines, or conventions, for designing text formats for data in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and read (by computer). In addition to the older standard SGML, there are several emerging standards that use XML encoding to overcome the disadvantages common to web publishing in HTML. The following sections give an overview of standards that have been established during the last few years or which are still works in progress, but widely recognized.


'''XML DTDs and Schemas'''

For standardized knowledge management this variety of XML DTDs and Schemas seems confusing. A closer look, though, gives another perspective: every scientific subject defines and uses its own standards. The following document type definitions can roughly be classified in:
#Schemata that use semantic tags to mark real content items, e.g., MathML or CML.
#Schemata that are used for visualisation and layout purposes and to control the browser synchronization, e.g., HTML, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), SMIL(Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language).
#Schemata that are principally designed to perform the exchange of data with huge databases, e.g., cXML(commercial XML).


'''Electronic Publishing'''

Within the field of &quot;Electronic Publishing,&quot; these developments have led to new opportunities to structure scientific information, not just text-based but also so-called active contents and multimedia elements. This brings the whole field to a new level of information processing or knowledge management. The different approaches for electronic publishing at universities creates a very heterogeneous environment. The following tables show how difficult it might be to subsume all those different models under one concept in order to achieve valuable and searchable information systems based on XML. Crosswalks between all those DTDs have to be defined in order to build a distributed retrieval engine, capable of searching within internal document structures &quot;throughout the world.&quot; Not only different DTDs are used, but also different strategies to perform a conversion from usual text formatting systems into highly structured documents in SGML or XML.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The next step after identification of the items of the digital library, the ETDs, is to address storage of the cataloguing attributes and the action of searching and retrieving. Remember that the quality of retrieval is dependent both on the programming of the search and retrieve functions but, as important as this, on the quality of the information used to catalog the items of the collection.

Databases are common and suitable tools to store, search and retrieve information. Besides this, they can also be very helpful in the process of capturing the attributes since they have the general function of managing information.

Before implementing the database, the database model must be created. This will happen only after the metadata model has been defined and related to other existing identification procedures such as traditional cataloguing on an automated library system.

If the traditional OPAC is to be maintained during the ETD program, it is desirable to avoid duplicated information. Thus, the attributes that are present in the OPAC should not be repeated and a link between the OPAC record and the ETD metadata is be created.

No matter where information is stored, the user should be able to perform the types of search that are standard in library systems: author, title, keywords, subjects, ISBN, etc.

As mentioned in the section [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/Metadata models for ETDs|Metadata models for ETDs]], some information that is used to identify the items are language dependent (title, keywords, subjects, etc.). If the database holds only one language per record, search procedures are to be performed using the arguments in this language. If a multilingual database is modelled, it is recommended that search be language independent, i.e., that the argument be checked against all languages. In this last situation, after a record is found as the result of a search, all its language instances should be displayed to the user so that he/she can choose the language for retrieval.

Database extenders (text, image) may be considered to increase the number of points of access by performing the searches in the ETD's not only on the cataloguing attributes.

The relation with the legacy systems databases must be examined since information concerning the TDs may be stored on them. Some examples are the graduate program, the mentor, the examining committee, etc.

The next sections address specific aspects of this topic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Theses and dissertations are traditionally covered by the legal deposit law in Portugal. Nowadays, almost all the thesis and dissertations are created using word processors, just confirming the fact that science and technology became one of the first areas for digital publishing.

In this context, the deposit of theses and dissertations emerged as an ideal case study for a scenario concerned with a specific genre. For that, the National Library of Portugal promoted the project '''DiTeD-Digital Thesis and Dissertations''' from which a software package with the same name originated.


'''Requirements'''

Theses and dissertations carry special requirements for registration and access, since their contents are usually used to produce other genres, such as books and papers, or they can include sensitive material related with, for example. patents. This requires the management system functionality to make it possible to the authors to declare special requirements for access, which have to be registered and respected.

Universities have a long tradition of independence in their organization, culture and procedures. As a consequence, soon it was learned that it would be impossible to reach, in the short and medium term, any kind of overall agreement for common formats or standard procedures with the different administrative services. Therefore, the main objective defined for DiTeD was the development, on the top of the Internet, of a framework that would connect the National Library to the local university libraries and would make it possible to support a full digital circuit for the deposit of theses and dissertations.


'''Architecture'''

A solution for this framework was found in the DIENST technology [3], which provides a good set of core services. DIENST also has an open architecture that can be used with great flexibility, making it possible to extend its services and build new functionalities. The basic entities of this architecture are shown in Figure 1, as a class diagram in UML - Unified Modeling Language.

[[File:diensts_arch.jpg|diensts.jpg]]


'''Master Server'''

The Master Meta Server provides the centralized services, including a directory of all the local servers members of the system. Only one of these servers must exist in each system.

In DiTeD this server exists at the National Library. It was renamed Master Server, and differs substantially from the original versions developed for DIENST. The original server was designed to manage only metadata, while now it is necessary to manage also the contents of the theses or dissertations and give support to the workflow for its submission and deposit.


'''DIENST Standard Server'''

The DIENST Standard Server is the server installed at the university libraries. This server was modified in DiTeD, and renamed Local Server. The following core modules compose it:
* Repository Service: This is where the documents are stored. It manages metadata structures and multiple content formats for the same document, functions that were substantially extended in DiTeD (to support a specific metadata format, as also to recognize a thesis or dissertation as possibly composed by several files). It is also possible to define and manage different collections in the same server.
* Index Service: This service is responsible for indexing the metadata and responding to queries. Small adjustments were made in DiTeD to support diacritics in the indexes and queries, a requirement in the Portuguese writing.
* User Interface: This service is responsible for the interaction with the user. It was extended in DiTeD to support a flexible multilingual interface and a workflow for submissions using HTTP.


'''Identifiers'''

Two Local Servers are running at the National Library. One, named Deposit Server, is used to locally store the deposited theses and dissertations coming from all universities (the deposit will consist in a copy, so in the end each thesis or dissertation will exist in two places, the Local Server and the Deposit Server). A second Local Server is used as a virtual system for those university libraries that do not have the necessary technical resources or skills to maintain their own server.

Each thesis or dissertation deposited in DiTeD automatically receives a URN [4], which will be registered and managed by a namespace and resolution service. This is in fact a simple implementation of the concept of PURL - Persistent URL, with the particular property that it resolves any PURL by returning its real URL in the original Local Server, unless it is not available anymore. In this case, it resolves it by returning its URL in the Deposit Server. The entities of this final DiTeD architecture are shown in Figure 2.

The prefix of the URN has the form &quot;HTTP://PURL.PT/DITED&quot;, while the suffix is formed by an
identifier of the university library (the &quot;publisher&quot;) and by a specific identifier of the work itself, automatically assigned locally.

[[File:dited.jpg|dited.jpg]]


'''Workflow'''

The workflow comprises two main steps: submission and deposit.


'''Submission'''

The submission process comprises the following steps:

'''Delivery''': The process starts with the submission by the student of the thesis or dissertation to a local server. In this step the student fills a metadata form, where it is recorded the bibliographic information and the access conditions. All of this information is hold in a pending status, until it is checked.

'''Verification''': In a second step a librarian checks the quality of the submission (a login in the local server gives access to all the pendent submissions). This task is supposed to be assured by a local librarian, but it can be also assured remotely, such as by a professional from the National Library (in a first phase of the project, this task will be assured by the National Library, especially to assure uniformity in the criteria and test and tune the procedures).

'''Registration''': If everything is correct (metadata and contents), the thesis or dissertation is stored in the local repository, and the student receives a confirmation. Otherwise, the student is contacted to solve any problem, and the submission remains in the pending status.


'''Deposit'''

The deposit consists in the copy of the thesis or dissertation, as also of its metadata, from the Local Server to the Deposit Server. This is done in the following steps:

'''What’s new''': Periodically, the Master Server contacts the repository of a Local Server to check if there are new submissions. The Local Server replies, giving a list of the identifiers of the new submissions.

'''Delivery''': For each new submission, the Master Server sends a request to the Local Server to deposit it in the Deposit Server. Because this Deposit Server is also a Local Server, this deposit works just like a normal local submission.

'''Verification''': A librarian in the National Library checks the deposit. This double checking is important, especially in the first times of the project, to reassess the procedures and test the automatic transfer of files over the Internet -not always a reliable process).

'''Registration''': If everything is correct, the thesis or dissertation is stored in the deposit repository, the final URN (a PURL) is assigned, and both the student and the local librarian receive a confirmation. The metadata is also reused to produce a standard UNIMARC record, for the national catalogue. If it detected any problem, the local librarian is contacted and the deposit remains in the pending status.

One can argue that, if the Deposit Server is really also a Local Server, than the first step would be excused and the Local Server could perform the delivery automatically after a successful submission. This can be a future optimization, but for now the reason for this extra step is to preserve the requirement of an asynchronous system, making it possible for the Master Server, for example, to better control the moment of the deposit (such as to give preference for the night periods).


'''Metadata'''

DiTeD utilizes a metadata structure for theses and dissertations defined by the National Library and coded in XML. This structure contains descriptive bibliographic information about the work and the author, as well as information about the advisers and jury members, access conditions, etc. This metadata structure is configurable at installation time, making the software flexible for use in other countries, or even with other publication genres. Metadata may also be accessed and exported in other formats, like UNIMARC and Dublin Core.


'''Multilingual interface'''

DiTeD's user interface has multilingual capabilities, allowing the users to switch between the available languages at any time. The base configuration includes English and Portuguese.


'''Software availability'''

The software is maintained by the National Library of Portugal, and distributed freely for noncommercial use.
Access to the software package may be requested by email to dited@bn.pt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ultimately, ETDs are designed to be disseminated, to at least some audience. Aspects of this activity are considered in the next subsections.

First, each ETD must have an ID, and there must be a link between the ID and the actual work. Second, each ETD must have a metadata record attached, that can be used for resource discovery and other purposes. Third, there must be a link between the ID, the metadata, and the actual body of the ETD. Fourth, the works must be made available, typically through a Web server. Sixth, there may be summaries or full works that are provided for discovery, or for indexing that is designed to lead to discovery. For example, summary pages may be indexed by Web search engines so that they may be found as a result of a Web search.

Note that it is encouraged for all NDLTD sites to keep a log regarding dissemination of the local ETDs, as well as other related information, so statistical and other reports can be prepared both for individual sites and for sites that have aggregate information (such as NDLTD).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Encryption and Digital Signature Overview: Using digital signatures'''

Digital signatures act like conventional signatures &lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt; allowing you to &quot;sign off&quot; on anything that requires an approval. You can simply attach your &quot;signature&quot; to the document. In addition, a signature stores information, like the date and time, and allows you to track document versions and validate their authenticity.


'''To create a digital signature profile:'''

#Choose Tools &gt; Self-Sign Signatures &gt; Log In.
#In the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures - Log In dialog box, click New Profile.
#In the User Attributes area of the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures - Create New User dialog box, enter your name and whatever other information you want to include in the three optional fields.
#In the Profile File area of the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures - Create New User dialog box, enter the path name for the folder in which you want to store your signature profile or click Browse and choose a folder. Enter a password of at least six characters in the User Password and Confirm Password fields and then click OK.


'''To add a digital signature to a document:'''

#Click on the Digital Signature tool in the Tool bar and then click and drag where you want to place your signature.
#In the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures- Sign Document dialog box you can select an option from the Reason for Signing Document pop-up menu or enter a reason in the field, and you can enter a location in the Location, e.g. City Name field. Note: If you’re using a third-party signature handler, follow the instructions displayed on screen. You may be prompted to log in to the handler or enter required information.
#Enter your password in the Confirm User Password field and then click Save Document.
#If this is the first signature added to the document, the Save As dialog box is displayed. Enter a name and choose a location for the file and then click OK. Note: If the Save As dialog box is displayed when you add a digital signature, you end up with two copies of the document: one unsigned and one signed.
#From this point on, you should use the signed version.
#To display a list of a document’s signatures, click the Signatures tab in the Navigation pane. The Signatures palette’s pop-up menu contains several commands for working with digital signatures; the Properties command lets you see the attributes of a digital signature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When all of the text of an ETD is available for searching, a digital library system is said to support fulltext searching. Users can submit queries that call for documents that have particular phrases, words, categories, or word stems appearing anywhere in the text (e.g., in the middle of a paragraph, or as part of the caption of a figure).

In fulltext searching it often is possible to specify that query terms appear in the same paragraph, same sentence, or within ''n'' words of each other. These refinements may work together with support for exact or approximate phrase and/or word matching.

For fulltext searching to work, the entire document must be analyzed, and used to build an index that will speed up searching. This may require a good deal of space for the index, often around 30% of the size of the texts themselves. Further, such searching may lead to decreased precision, since a document may be located that only makes casual mention of a topic, when the bulk of the document is about other topics. On the other hand, fulltext searching may improve recall, since works can be found that are not classified to be about a certain topic. Further, fulltext searching often yields passages in a document, so one can find a possibly relevant paragraph, rather than just a pointer to a document that then must be scanned to ascertain relevance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The HARVEST system is often used for a fulltext search within the ETD archives. In Germany, most of the university libraries are using this particular software.


'''Preconditions for using Harvest'''

Before the installation, one should check whether the following technical preconditions are fulfilled.


'''Hardware''':

fast processor(e.g. Sparc5...)&lt;br /&gt;
fast I/O&lt;br /&gt;
enough RAM ( &gt; 64 MB) – and 1-2 GB free disk space (sources 25 MB)&lt;br /&gt;
Operating Systems supported&lt;br /&gt;
DEC OSF/1 ab 2.0&lt;br /&gt;
SunOS ab 4.1.x&lt;br /&gt;
SunSolaris ab 2.3&lt;br /&gt;
HPUX&lt;br /&gt;
AIX ab 3.x&lt;br /&gt;
Linux alle Kernel ab 1999 on alle Unix-Platformen&lt;br /&gt;
WindowsNT&lt;br /&gt;

Following additional software is needed to use Harvest:&lt;br /&gt;
Perl v4.0 and higher (v5.0 )&lt;br /&gt;
gzip&lt;br /&gt;
tar&lt;br /&gt;
HTTP-Server (with remote machine)&lt;br /&gt;
GNU gcc v2.5.8 and higher&lt;br /&gt;
flex v2.4.7&lt;br /&gt;
bison v1.22&lt;br /&gt;


'''Harvest Components'''

The Harvest system consists of two major components:&lt;br /&gt;
The Harvest Gatherer&lt;br /&gt;
The Harvest Broker.&lt;br /&gt;
This allows establishing a distributed retrieval and search model.&lt;br /&gt;
Installation procedure (ftp://ftp.tardis.ed.ac.uk/pub/harvest/develop/snapshots/ )


'''Gatherer'''

This program part is responsible for collecting the full text and metadata of the dissertations. The Gatherer visits several sites regularly, sometimes daily or weekly and builds an incremental index area database. The collected index data are held in a special format, called SOIF-Format (Summary Object Interchange Format). The Gatherer can be extended so that it can interpret different formats.


'''Broker'''

This part of the software is responsible to provide the indexed information by using a search interface. The broker operates as Query-Manager and does the real indexing of the data. Using a Web based interface he can reach several Gatherer and Broker simultaneously and perform several search requests.

In Germany there has been established a Germany-wide retrieval interface on the basis of the Harvest software, called The (Theses Online Broker), which is accessible via: &lt;br /&gt;http://www.iuk-initiative.org/iwi/TheO&lt;br /&gt;
Within NDLTD a special Broker has been set up to add the German sites using Harvest to the international search.

[[Image:harvest_arch.jpeg|harvest_arch.jpeg]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:harvest_network.jpeg|harvest_network.jpeg]]

Harvest is able to do a search within the following document formats:

|-
| Unrecognized 
| Extract file name, owner, and date created
|}


'''Configuration for PDF files:'''

Before the Harvest-Gatherer can collect PDF documents and transform into SOIF format it has to be configured.

Using only the standards configuration ignores the format. In order to make a format known to the Gatherer a summarizer for PDF has to be build:

Delete the following line in the file /lib/gatherer/byname.cf:&lt;br /&gt;
Pdf ^.*\.(pdf|PDF)$

Configure the PDF summarizer. Use Acrobat to transfer PDF documents into PS documents, that are used by the summarizer. A better choice provides the xpdf packages by Derek B. Noonburg (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf ). It contains a PDF-to text converter (pdftotext), that can be integrated into, the summerizer Pdf.sum:&lt;br /&gt;
/usr/local/bin/pdftotext $1&lt;br /&gt;
/tmp/$$.txt Text.sum&lt;br /&gt;
/tmp/$$.txt rm /tmp/$$.txt

'''Configuring the Gatherers for HTML-Metadata'''

The Harvest-Gatherer is by standard configured to map every HTML metatag into an SOIF attribute, e.g. &lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Title&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Test&quot;&gt; into an own SOIF attribute, that is equal to the NAME attribute of the metatag.
The configuration can be found at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;harvest home&gt;/lib/gatherer/sgmls-lib/HTML/HTML.sum.tbl

The summarizer table has entries like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;META:CONTENT&gt; $NAME
If a retrieval should be done only in the HTML metatags, meaning within certain SOIF attributes, those attributes have to put in front of the search request and put into the retrieval forms provided to the user, e.g.&lt;br /&gt;
DC.Title: Test


'''Searching Metadata encoded in HTML'''

As in Germany there is a nationwide agreed metadata set for ETDs, those are searchable within the German wide Harvest network.

The following example shows, how those Dublin Core metadata (only a small part is displayed) is encoded within the HTML front pages for ETDs:


&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Type&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Text.PhDThesis&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Title&quot; LANG=&quot;ger&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Titelseite: Ergebnisse der CT- Angiographie bei der Diagnostik von Nierenarterienstenosen&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Creator.PersonalName&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Ludewig, Stefan&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Contributor.Referee&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Prof. Dr. med. K.- J. Wolf&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Contributor.Referee&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Prof. Dr. med. B. Hamm&quot;&gt;
&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Contributor.Referee&quot; CONTENT=&quot;PD Dr. med. S. Mutze&quot;&gt;

For this agreed metadata set, there has been formulated a suggestion, on how the metadata can be produced and operated at the university libraries. The following schema shows the details:
The doctoral candidate uploads his ETD document to the library. He does this while filling in an HTML form, that collects internally metadata in Dublin Core format.
The university libraries check the metadata of correctness and the ETD of readability and correct usage of style sheets.
The university library adds some descriptive metadata to the metadata set and put a presentation version of the ETD on its server. During this procedure an HTML format page containing the Dublin Core metadata encoded as HTML

At last submits the university library the metadata to the National library, which is in charge of archiving all German language literature.

The national library copies the ETD and metadata to its own internal system.

'''Searching SGML/XML documents'''

Harvest also allows a search within SGML/XML DTD (document type definition) elements.

All that has to be done to configure the Gatherer component according to the following rules:

Within the home of the Harvest software (written as &lt;harvest-home&gt;) in /lib/gatherer/byname.cf a line has to be added: DIML ^.*\.did$. (DiML is the DTD used at Humboldt-University, did is the file names of the SGML documents accorning to the DIML-DTD). This says the Harvest-Gatherer, which Summerizer should be used, if documents ending with .did are found.

Now, the summarizer has to be build and saved as DIML.sum within the filesystem at &lt;harvest-home&gt;/lib/gatherer: (The summarizer contains the following line: #!/bin/sh exec SGML.sum ETD $*

Within the catalog file &lt;harvest-home&gt;/lib/gatherer/sgmls-lib/catalog the following entries have to be done: (They point to the public identifiers of the DIML and from DIML used DTVs)&lt;br /&gt;
DOCTYPE ETD DIML/diml2_0.dtd&lt;br /&gt;
PUBLIC &quot;-//HUB//DTD Electronic Thesis and Dissertations Version DiML 2.0//EN&quot; DIML/diml2_0.dtd&lt;br /&gt;
PUBLIC &quot;-//HUB//DTD Cals-Table-Model//EN&quot; DIML/cals_tbl.dtd&lt;br /&gt;
PUBLIC &quot;-//HUBspec//ENTITIES Special Symbols//EN&quot; DIML/dimlspec.ent&lt;br /&gt;

Now &lt;harvest-home&gt;/lib/gatherer/lib/sgmls-lib/DIML can be created (mkdir &lt;path&gt;) and four files copied into the path:&lt;br /&gt;
diml2_0.dtd, cals_tbl.dtd, dimlspec.ent und diml2_0.sum.tbl (DTD, entity file and sumarizer table). The file diml2_0.sum.tbl consists of the DTD tags that should be searcheable and the appropriate SOIF attributes

The Gatherer can be launched now.

In order to saerch within certain SOIF tags, the name of the SOIF attribute has to be put in front of the search term, e.g. searching for &quot;title: Hallo&quot;means, searching within the SOIF-attribute 'title' for the search term 'Hallo'.


At Humboldt-University Berlin, there has been installed a prototype that allows a retrieval within documents structures, so a user may search within the following parts of a document and therefore specialize the search in order to retrieve only the wanted information and hits:
*Fulltext (im Volltext)
*For authors (nach Autoren)
*In titles (in Titen)
*In abstracts (Im Abstract)
*Wthin authors keywords (in Autorenschlagwörtern)
*For Institutes/ Subjects (nach Institut/ Fachgebiet)
*For approvals (nach Gutachtern)
*Headings of chapters (Überschriften)
*Captions of figures (in Abbildungsbeschriftungen)
*In Tables (in Tabellen)
*Within the bibliography (in der Bibliographie)
*For Author names within bibliography (nach Autoren in der Bibliographie)

'''Harvest and OAI'''

With the growing enthusiasm for the approach of the open archives initiative, where a special OAI software protocol allows to send out requests to document archives and receive standardized metadata sets as answers, there are ideas on how this could be connected with the Harvest-based infrastructure that has been set up in Germany.

[[Image:oai_retrieval.jpeg|oai_retrieval.jpeg]]&lt;br /&gt;


Making a Harvest archive OAI compliant means, that the information, that the Gatherer holds, has to be normalized (same metadata usage) and that the index has temporarily saved within a database. The Institute for Science Networking at the Department of Physics at the University of Oldenburg, Germany developed the following software. This software, written in php4, uses an SQL database to perform the OAI protocol requests. The SQL database holds the normalized data from the Harvest Gatherer.


[[Image:oai_spec.jpeg|oai_spec.jpeg]]&lt;br /&gt;


Other university document servers, like the one at Humboldt-University additionally hold the Dublin core Metadata within an SQL-Database (Sybase) anyway. There a php4 script operating at the cgi-interface reads the OAI protocol requests that is transported via the HTTP protocol and puts them into SQL statements, which are than used as requests for the SQL-database. The database respond is given in an SQL syntax as well, which is than transformed into OAI protocol syntax using XML and Dublin Core.(see http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/oai)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Resources distributed on the Internet are accessible by means of a syntax which corresponds to their physical location. This syntax is defined by the RFC 1738 and is known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This way of doing things creates certain problems which we must often confront. Who has not encountered the famous HTTP error 404 Not Found, which indicates that the server cannot find the location of the requested resource? This does not mean that the resource is no longer on the server, because it may simply have been moved to another location. URLs have no means of being automatically updated when a resource is moved to another place, such that we often run up against that famous HTTP error.

While the URL identifies the address of a resource, the Uniform Resource Name (URN) identifies the actual resource, the unit of information, much like the ISBN does for books. To draw a parallel, the URL corresponds to a users’ postal address while the URN corresponds to users’ social insurance or social security number. The URN is thus attached to a resource and not to a physical address. By knowing this identifier, it is possible to find this resource even if its physical address changes. The URN ensures an institutional commitment to the preservation of access to a resource on the Internet.

In the framework of the Université de Montréal’s digital thesis pilot project, undertaken in 1999-2000, we implemented a system for producing URNs based on the model proposed by the CNRI. A global server based at the CNRI manages &quot;Naming authorities&quot; which refer to publisher’s numbers. A local server installed at the thesis distribution station in turn houses a database which manages the associations between URNs and URLs. All of this bears close resemblance to NetworkSolution’s system for managing the DNS which regulate the IP addresses of computers linked to the Internet, except that in our case it is documents being given addresses as opposed to computers.

The model proposed by CNRI is the Handle system. This system is also the cornerstone for the DOI Foundation’s system. The construction of the Handle falls in two parts. The URN’s prefix corresponds to the publisher’s number (the Université de Montréal’s publisher’s number is 1012). This number is unique and cannot be used by any other organization. &quot;Sub-names&quot; can be added following this number in order to subdivide it into more precise units. This sequence is followed by a slash (&quot;/&quot;) and a freely chosen alphanumeric sequence. Thus, a Handle-type URN for theses reads as follows:

hdl:1012.Theses/1999-Albert.Mathieu(1959)-[HTML]

We chose the year of the thesis defense, the author’s name, his/her date of birth and the format of the file as the constitutive elements of a thesis’ URN identifier. Please note that one must first download the CNRI’s plugin in order to use the Handle system. This system has the advantage of being fairly much in conformity with the requirement of RFC 1737 concerning the framework regulating a URN system. Its application is nevertheless fastidious since one absolutely requires the plugin to be able to resolve the links. After experimentation with the CNRI’s system, the Université de Montréal intends to use another system for our ongoing electronic theses project.

Another interesting avenue is the PURL system created by OCLC. Let us note that a document attached to a PURL can be modified, contrary to other norms or applications for the use of a URN. The PURL system largely follows the same principle as the Handle system except that the URNs are resolved using a URL address. This solution has the advantage of not requiring the use of a plugin. In fact, a PURL is a URL. Rather than pointing directly to an Internet resource, a PURL points to an intermediary resolution service. This service associates the PURL with the active URL, which is then provided to the client. The client then normally gives access to the resource. It is possible to register PURLs with an intermediary service (such as the OCLC’s) or to install the service on one’s own server.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Information retrieval (IR) systems have been improving since the 1950s. One of the most important areas of advance in the 1990s and in the 21st century benefits from the rapid enhancement of humancomputer interaction (HCI) that results from new types of interfaces, new methods of interaction, and new integration of those activities with IR methods. Information visualization, for example, allows faster analysis of the contents of a collection of ETDs, or of the result set from a search.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Supporting Works on Computers and Paper'''

Since the mid-1980s, the electronic publishing community has faced the issue of supporting works targeted for use on computers, or on computers and paper (i.e., for dual publishing). To achieve maximal flexibility, it is desirable to separate the description of document structure from the rendering of that structure into some paper or screen form. SGML and, later, XML, were devised with this goal in mind.


'''SGML and XML'''

SGML and XML are markup languages. In particular, they are meta-languages. One can provide a
document type definition (DTD) that conforms to the rules of SGML, and then be able to create documents of that type. The same applies to XML. However, with XML, it is possible instead to use a schema to specify the type of document considered, or to just have markup without a DTD, demonstrating that this indeed is an eXtensible Markup Language.


'''Other Markup Languages'''

In the SGML/XML family are other markup schemes, or applications of these. HyTime extends SGML with architectural forms to allow handling of rich multimedia and hypermedia content. RDL, developed by e-Numerate Solutions, Inc., allows handling of numeric content in an application of XML, while XBRL applies XML to business reporting. For many ETDs, tailored markup schemes (e.g., MathML for mathematics, or chemical markup language), also are used for particular types of content expression.

The following subsections explain further how ETDs can be produced using markup languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In addition to creating an ETD, students now need to become their own cataloguers. The tools being developed by the NDLTD will assist in the submission of a basic description of the ETD but there are skills to be developed and issues to be aware of.

Students will have already discovered that one of the greatest barriers to finding information is the difficulty of coming up with the right terminology. Lists of standardized subject heading terms, structured thesauri, and fielded searching have been created to remedy this problem.

Accurate metadata improves precision and increases the recall of the content of ETDs by using the same standardized terms or elements. However, even if common metadata elements are used, there is no guarantee that the vocabularies, the content of the elements, will be compatible between communities of interest. Students and researchers working within specialized areas sometimes forget that language and terms often have particular and precise meanings. Outside this field of interest, global searches can return too much of the wrong information.

Generating accurate metadata requires some of the basic skills of resource description and good practice in avoiding three language problems that cause poor precision:
*Polysemy: words with multiple meanings. For example, if we are searching for an article that discusses types of springs and their uses, we might retrieve articles on freshwater springs or on the season of spring, as well as on leaf springs, flat springs, or coil springs.
*Synonymy: words representing the same concept, although they may do it with different shades of meaning. Take the words 'ball,' 'sphere,' and 'orb,' or 'scuba diving' versus 'skin diving.' If we look for scuba diving, but the term used is skin diving, we will miss materials we might otherwise find. Good metadata should draw these materials together, despite their use of different synonyms.
*Ambiguity: If we return to our example of springs, we can see what differentiates these meanings is their context. It is unlikely an article on coil springs will also discuss water quality. The other words used in the article, and the processes described, will be entirely different. A search engine must understand the meaning, not just be able to match the spelling of a word, if it is going to differentiate between different meanings of the same word. A possible solution to this difficulty lies in the recent development of the notion of Application Profiles. Application Profiles provide a model for the way in which metadata might be aggregated in ‘packages’ in order to combine different element sets relating to one resource. This is a way of making sense of the differing relationship that implementers and namespace managers have towards metadata schema, and the different ways they use and develop schema. Students should investigate these developments within their community of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With the advent of ETDs, traditional catalogers can learn about cataloging online resources, or they can apply what they already know about cataloging online resources to cataloging theses. Catalogers may need to adapt existing policies and procedures, but their workstations may already have the necessary software (e.g., word processor, PDF reader, etc.). This may also be an opportunity to implement cataloging policy changes, for example, allowing authors to assign keywords in addition to or instead of continuing to assign a controlled vocabulary such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Of course, catalogers will add the necessary MARC fields required for computer files. More information can easily be added to the bibliographic record because of the ease of copy-and-paste features of word processors, so include the abstract in online catalog records and index this field to enhance findings through keyword searching.

The following table includes MARC fields included in bibliographic records for ETDs, with additional information about Dublin Core metadata, etc. For the latest information about ETD metadata, see http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/current.html

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the objectives of an ETD program is to yield easy access to TDs. Since we are dealing with digital libraries, we are implicitly dealing with libraries. One of the actions performed on a library catalog is that of search and retrieve. This is the first step towards accessing the contents of a library item; the second step is the use (read, listen, view, etc.) of the item.

In order to be efficient in the search and retrieve action, the user must search a catalog in which the items were properly identified, besides using good search functions.

This section is about the identification of ETD's, which is a very important step towards their dissemination. The identification will be accomplished through the use of the metadata elements whose set is named the metadata model of the digital library of TDs.

Before we address metadata models for ETDs, it is important that some ideas are brought to the discussion. These ideas are related to the choice of a model to be considered later on. These models must be rich and versatile to contain information of different natures and to be searched by users from all over the world.

It is obvious that the richer and more versatile the metadata model is, the more time and effort it takes to
capture (collect and record) the information into the digital library. The decision on which model to use
will have to take this into consideration. In some situations it may be necessary to adopt the simplest
possible model in order to make the metadata capture viable. Later in this chapter the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set will be introduced. It seems that it is the consensus of the minimum identification
to be used for ETD's.

The ideas for us to think about are:
*Many languages in one world
*ETDs to be read all over the world
*Metadata
*Contents and instances
*Contents, instances and metadata
*Contents, instances and languages
*Metadata models and languages
*Metadata schemes
*Specialization of the metadata models for TDs
*Conclusion - metadata models for ETDs


'''Many languages in one world'''

Our world is a very diverse linguistic place. Those who work with information and are involved in international projects know English. This is the language they use to communicate, to access the Internet, to read technical literature, etc.

At the same time, not only many other languages exist but some of them have large numbers of native speakers. The 100 most spoken languages of the world, when first language speakers are counted, can be found in http://www.sil.org/ethnologue/top100.html. In descending order, the first 10 are Chinese (Mandarin), Spanish, English, Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, German (Standard) and Chinese (Wu).

If only the other 9 languages are considered, it is not hard to imagine the numbers of texts that are written and published every year. The same happens with TDs. The number of TDs published in languages other than English must be very big.


'''ETD's to be read all over the world'''

One of the purposes and benefits of an ETD program is to yield easy access to the results presented in TDs, no matter where the reader is and where the dissertation was written.

We assume that ETD digital libraries are to be connected to the Internet so that their contents can be shared worldwide, to make sure this benefit is accomplished.


'''Metadata'''

Metadata are data about data or information about information.

The metadata elements are the attributes used to describe a digital library item just like the ones used to catalog items in a traditional library.

Many of these attributes are language dependent, as for example titles, abstracts, subjects, keywords, etc. Others obviously are not, as for example authors' names, digital format, number of bytes of the file, etc.

Since some metadata elements are language dependent and TDs are written in many languages, we can expect that most probably the metadata will use the language of the work. This can pose a problem for search and retrieve activities since most of us are not fluent in as many languages as we would like to be.


'''Contents and instances'''

The items of a digital library may be identified in 2 different levels; the same way the items of a traditional library are. The first level is the ''content'' which is equivalent to a title of a traditional library and the second is the ''instance'' which is equivalent to a volume.

A ''content'' is the logical definition of an item of the digital library and it is identified by a set of attributes. An ''instance'' is the physical realization of a content or title. It is a digital object and is identified by a set of attributes too.

The use of contents and instances allows contents to have multiple instances either in different formats or due to physical partitions. This will yield a one to many relationship among contents and instances.

The use of contents and instances also allows the access control to be performed on the partitions instead of on the content. This makes the digital library more flexible in terms of dealing with intellectual property rights.

Therefore, we can conclude that there are attributes that are particular to contents and others that refer to instances. The metadata model must contain both.


'''Contents, instances and metadata'''

Some metadata elements are common to all contents, as for example title, abstract, type, etc., while others are common to all instances, as for example electronic format, access level, etc.

On the other hand, some metadata elements are specific to some contents, as for example translation control - original content, translator, etc., and others are specific to some instances, as for example special equipment, expiration date, remote location, etc.

From this comment, we can see that the metadata model must be versatile to contain attributes that are common to all contents and to all instances and also the specific ones, in order to accommodate specialization of the digital library items.


'''Contents, instances and languages'''

Contents may be language dependent. The language of the content is the one in which it is written, spoken or sung.

Other languages may be associated with a content - the ones in which it is catalogued. It is possible to describe a content written/spoken/sung in one language in other language(s). This way, there is one catalog entry in each of the languages to be used.

The use of multilingual cataloguing yields points of access in different languages if the search is performed in all of them. This topic will be addressed in  the section [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/Database and IR|Database and IR]].


'''Metadata models and languages'''

It is possible to define the digital library to hold more than one language. A good choice would be, at least, the language(s) of the nation where TDs are developed and English.

If this is the case, the metadata model can have all attributes that are language dependent written in each language to be used in the digital library and the language code must be a part of the primary key in the database.

Attributes that are language independent would have only one representation in the database.


'''Metadata schemes'''
There are quite a few metadata schemes. Some are strictly related to library items while others have a broader scope, as for example the ones devoted to digital objects to be used in Web Based Education. Some schemes are well known and should be mentioned:
*DCMES - Dublin Core Metada Element Set&lt;br /&gt;http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec-dces-19990702.htm &lt;br /&gt; Under the responsibility of the DCMI - Dublin Core Metadata Initiative http://www.purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core/ http://purl.org/dc/ This metadata element set will be presented in the section [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/Cataloging: MARC, DC, RDF|Cataloging: MARC, DC, RDF]]
*IMS Project - Instructional Management System Project &lt;br /&gt; http://www.imsproject.org/ &lt;br /&gt;The metadata element set defined by the IMS Project has the objective of identifying digital objects used in Web based Education. It contains all the elements of the DCMES and many more.
*LOM - Learning Objects Metadata of the Learning Technology Standards Committee of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (LTSC/IEEE) &lt;br /&gt;http://ltsc.ieee.org/doc/wg12/LOM_WD4.htm/ &lt;br /&gt; The metadata element set defined by the LTSC/IEEE (http://ltsc.ieee.org/) has the objective of identifying digital objects used in Web based Education. It contains all the elements of the DCMES and many more.
*LoC - Core Metadata Elements of the Library of Congress &lt;br /&gt;http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/metadata.html &lt;br /&gt;The second and the third are used when WBE is under. Since they contain the DCMES, no conflict exists to the general digital library identification.


'''Specialization of the metadata models for TDs'''

Besides the usual data contained in general purpose metadata schemes, there are some types of information related to TDs that may be of interest to the university. For this reason, it may be useful to consider adding extra metadata elements to the traditional metadata schemes. The additional elements can be separated in 3 groups:
*Administrative information - department, date of presentation, date of acceptance, financial support, etc.
*Academic information - level, mentor, examining committee, etc.
*Traditional library information - university, library system, control number, call number, etc.

These may be useful to yield information concerning the graduate programs of the university.


'''Conclusion - metadata models for ETD's'''
The definition of the metadata model for an ETD digital library must combine:
*The needs for proper identification of ETD's for the goals of access to be achieved (national access? international access?)
*The administrative needs of the university

At the same time, the restrictions imposed by budget or operation time frames must be to taken into consideration. There is a balance between what is desired and what is possible. Some comments concerning this balance are made:
*For international access, the use of English besides the original language(s) is mandatory. This means that titles and abstracts must be translated, and that subjects headings, keywords, etc. will be multilingual catalogs to be maintained.
*For the ETD digital library to be a part of the international community, the minimum requirements in terms of ETD identification must be met. This means that at least the DCMES must be used.
*For the university to have good control of the intellectual property, the use of content / instance concept allows access specifications to be established on the digital objects. Thus, some objects may be made public while others may have different types of restrictions due to format or to intellectual content.
*In the definition of the workflow to operate the ETD program, attention must be given to the capture of the metadata elements. If non-librarians are involved in the process, there must be a good training program and a careful review process so that the attributes are catalogued right. 

The choice of the metadata model is very important and the team in charge of the implementation of the ETD program must study the possibilities before making the decision. Minimum standards must be met.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Searching through works with multimedia content requires extra support beyond what is usually provided (e.g., searching through metadata or fulltext). Content based image retrieval (CBIR), searching in files of spoken language, and searching in video collections are all supported with special methods and systems.

While most ETD collections today allow search for multimedia content based on descriptions of such content (i.e., metadata), in the future, as collections grow and have richer assortments of multimedia elements, it is likely that multimedia database and multimedia content search software will be more widely deployed. Indeed, Virginia Tech carried out some preliminary work in this regard with its ETD collection, using tools provided by IBM (e.g., QBIC, VideoCharger). Other vendors and systems exist, and can be used for searching local, regional, national, and international collections of ETDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This topic is discussed in [[ETD Guide/Students/Naming standards: file names; unique Ids|Naming standards: file names; unique Ids]]. The focus there is on naming of files and on unique identifiers. Here we consider those matters briefly, but also discuss URNs and OAI naming. 

At Virginia Tech, naming of the parts of an ETD is left to authors. Many have a single document, called etd.pdf, but there are many other selections. The entire ETD is referred to by way of a summary page.
This has an ID like:

etd-12598-10640 or (in earlier cases) etd-5941513972900

These two correspond to full URLs, respectively:
* http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/public/etd-12598-10640/etd-title.html
* http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/public/etd-5941513972900/etdtitle.html

Other but similar schemes are in use elsewhere &lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt; recall [[ETD Guide:Students - Naming standards: file names; unique Ids|Naming standards: file names; unique Ids]].

The key point is to have an ID for each work, and a way to resolve that to the actual document. In some cases, a URN is given, such as a handle or PURL, which in turn is resolved to a URL. (See [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/Identifying: URN, PURL, DOI|Identifying: URN, PURL, DOI]]) That allows users to remember the URN, and be assured that over time, as documents are moved about, there still be automatic linking from the URN to the designated document.

IDs as discussed above also are important with regard to OAI. Assuming that, as is required, each archive has a unique identifier, then as long as each record in the archive, as required, has a unique internal ID, then the combination of the two will uniquely determine a record in an archive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Networking and ETDs'''

With the spread of the Internet and the WWW, and the emergence of local area networks as well as wide area networks (LANs and WANs), network facilities have enormously expanded in many of the educational institutions of the world. To support the needs for access, and the related processes that deal with making content accessible, many universities have made networked computers available to their graduate students, as well as to faculty, staff, and undergraduate students. The ETD initiative can build on those investments, employing them to support submission and downloading of ETDs. By focusing on networked access, there can be considerable savings that result from elimination of manual handling and physical distribution. It is recommended that, except for ETDs that have enormous amounts (e.g., gigabytes) of multimedia content, authors, as well as university staff, avoid procedures that require transfer of content using diskettes, CDs, or other physical media.


'''Network Traffic and Hardware'''

Universities should consider the amount of traffic on their networks, making sure that networking hardware (Internet connection, routers, and cable plants) accommodates well the demand for uploading and downloading ETDs). This accommodation generally will not be a problem if adequate support for email, rapid access to WWW, and other types of usage is provided.


'''Software'''

Regarding software for accessing ETDs, there is not much of a special nature that is required. Web browsers, support for Java applets, and multimedia presentation tools are typically sufficient. Special aids may be needed for PDF, that Adobe provides for free at Adobe at www.adobe.com, or SGML/XML (becoming more widely available). The real need for special software is to help manage the ETD submission process, handle local workflow, make ETDs accessible, and facilitate search. NDLTD and its various parts have prepared software to help with all of these.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preparing an ETD is somewhat like preparing a book to be given to a publisher, and then distributed electronically (and perhaps on paper). There are many aspects to this process, briefly summarized in the next paragraphs.


First, there is the '''hardware''' perspective.

&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:1em;&quot;&gt;
*Computers
Authors of ETDs nowadays almost always use a computer for this activity. In many cases this means a personal computer, though in some cases a terminal, PDA, or another device might be chosen. With the continuing increase in performance and functionality, given a particular price, it is becoming more feasible for authors to have their own computers. However, in some cases, an office or laboratory or shared computer might be used, at least from time to time.
*Other Devices
In addition to a computer, authors may use other special devices to prepare parts of the ETD. In particular, in the case of multimedia content, parts might result from using a scanner, digital camera, digital camcorder, slide scanner, microphone, sound card, MIDI device, or other special equipment. Special systems might be used for audio or image or video editing, though in some cases such editing can be done on a PC.
&lt;/div&gt;


Second, consider '''software'''
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left:1em;&quot;&gt;
*Software Editors
Software that can help with ETD production may be specialized by role. Text editors like Wordpad, vi, and emacs allow creation of files of characters, often encoded in ASCII. More powerful word processors may allow handling of more extensive sets of characters, like UNICODE, and entry of character codes from large sets (e.g., for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean texts).
*Separate Editors
Separate editors may support multimedia content. Photoshop handles photos and other images, for example, while Sound Forge allows manipulation of audio files. Premiere is a tool for video editing that also can process audio, animations, and other related components. Editing tools may handle conversions as well, or accept the results of conversion. Ultimately, one may think of authoring, capture, conversion, and editing tools for all media types as all having the objective of amassing a pool of components that go into the ETD.
*Integration
Large documents thus are made of pools of content objects, and students can use special software to integrate the content into a coherent whole. A simple integration is to have a linear structure, like a book, where all the components are ordered, as in a sequence of pages, manipulated by a word processor. It is simple for images to be included in such a work, as long as sizing is adjusted. However, large images, and other multimedia content (e.g., audio), must be integrated in a different fashion.

Such integration may involve linking (as in hypermedia, found in many Web sites). Additional interactivity may require a tailored hypertext system (e.g., Toolbook, Guide), or a multimedia integration package (e.g., Director or AuthorWare). Such a system will support synchronization (e.g., using the WWW standard, SMIL), or complex performances. Ultimately, the most sophisticated integration of content with reader interaction requires a programming language. In the case of multimedia languages, this typically is called a scripting language. However, students can also use general purpose languages like Java for sophisticated handling of content along with interaction.
&lt;/div&gt;


Third, consider '''representation'''. Each content object must have a representation scheme, depending on its form. Text components are characterized by character encoding, as well as supplemental information to support presentation (e.g., font, size, style). Multimedia components are encoded in suitable forms, depending on resolution or other measure of level of detail, compression, and other attributes. For the purpose of archival preservation, the representations used for content objects (e.g., UNICODE, MPEG), as well as those used to describe the organization and rendering of content (e.g., SMIL), will be in standard forms.


Fourth, for an ETD or other large work, one can choose from '''archival forms''', and related software support.. In particular, for more detail about software, see the next subsection. For details about PDF, SGML/XML, and other matters, see the next sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since 1995, there have been plans to share work developed in connection with ETDs so as to help others. The first such effort was funded by the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA), to spread the work around the Southeast of the USA. Virginia Tech acted as the agent for this effort, creating software, documentation, training materials, and other resources. In particular, it became clear that software was needed to support student submission, staff checking, library processing, and support for access. The Virginia Tech resources were packaged in connection with these efforts and the follow-on work funded by the USA’s Department of Education. These were made available starting in 1996 through local and NDLTD sites, and updated regularly since.

The following subsections give details of the Virginia Tech solutions, as well as extensions to it, and alternatives. NDLTD offers to assist such sharing by providing a clearinghouse for whatever seems appropriate and useful to share.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Australian Digital Theses (ADT) Program software is a modified version of the original Virginia Tech ETD software and is in its second release. The ADT software modifications were to make it generic, flexible and customisable for easy integration within the local IT infrastructure. This is critical as the ADT Program is a distributed and collaborative system involving a large number of Australian universities.

The software is distributed to all ADT members free by ftp download as a .tar file. The reason for using a .tar file is that it keeps related files together, and thus facilitates the transfer of multiple files between computers. The files in a .tar archive must be extracted before they can be used.

Extracting the distribution .tar file will reveal a directory (adt) containing 2 further directories (cgi-gin &amp; public_html) plus installation instructions in a readme.txt file plus an empty adt-ADT admin site to help identify the structure of the admin side of the software.

Also included in the release package is a test site for members to look at and use to familiarise themselves on the look, structure and functionality.
Three dummy theses are used as examples of how theses can look, and how they fit into the admin structure. General software details, as well as all other information regarding the ADT Program is publicly available on the ADT Information page @: http://adt.caul.edu.au/ 

Responsibility for the ADT software and initial setup support for new members is taken by the lead institution - The University of New South Wales Library.


'''Overview of the ADT Program software'''
#Deposit Form
#*generic look and feel
#*includes both Copyright &amp; Authenticity statements
#*completely revised help screens
#*revised, as well as new alerts for errors etc..
#*does not allow non compliance with core ADT standards - e.g. filenames; illegal symbols
#*all fields &amp; processes compulsory unless otherwise indicated on the form
#Administration pages
#*possible to edit html as well as change restrictions
#*with new update function it is now possible to ADD, DELETE, RENAME files. Another feature of the update function is to be able to move files to a NOACCESS directory, as well as and to make them accessible again. This is designed primarily for certain parts of theses that cannot be made public for reasons of copyright, patents, legal reasons, and other sensitivities
#*now possible to make thesis available without any restriction (ideal), restrict to campus only, restrict whole thesis for approved caveat period, totally restrict parts of thesis. Any combination is possible with the choice, or choices made, being reflected in the local view of the thesis. That is, if thesis is restricted to campus only this is now obvious, similarly if part of thesis is restricted (noaccess) this is obvious too. Knowing if restrictions apply at the outset will not frustrate those searching the database
#*now possible to easily un-make a deposit. That is, to remove a thesis from public/restricted view and/or to take this back to the deposit directory where any editing and changes can be made before reapproving and making accessible again
#*refined URI structure using date (yyyymmdd) and time (hhmmss)
#*revised and new help &amp; alert pages
#Metadata
#*completely revised and updated according to latest Dublin Core Qualifiers document released 11th July 2000.
#*to aid search functionality keywords/phrases (i.e. DC.Subject) are each repeated as separate element strings. This has resulted in a revised look of the HotMeta database view. The brief record (default) now shows Title, Author, Date, Institution/School, with the expanded view showing all the metadata.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolution of Networks and the World Wide Web'''

The evolution of networks and the World Wide Web have profoundly affected the content and quality of communications. The complexity and visual content of documents is no longer limited by the artistic skills of the designer. Itranets and Web sites are being tapped into for creative content that is much more complex than could have been imagined. As creative expression expands to new levels, the quality of the printed output must also rise to the challenge.


'''The Internet and Printing Workflow Process'''

The Internet has changed not only the dynamics of the creative process but the entire printing workflow process. The Internet is used to transmit information electronically while CD-ROMs and servers are used for storing and accessing data. One often finds difficulty in predicting what will be printed because documents can come from many sources. And it’s equally difficult to predict where they will be printed, because documents can be distributed around the world electronically and printed locally. The printing workflow has evolved from creating, printing, copying, and distributing hard-copy documents to creating, electronically publishing, and printing documents on demand. It was clearly time to advance the imaging standard.


'''Adobe Postscript'''

With the introduction of PostScript in 1985, Adobe Systems Incorporated sparked a revolution in how we communicate on the printed page. Since its introduction, Adobe PostScript has become the printing and imaging technology of choice for corporations, publishers, and government agencies throughout the world. In fact, 75 percent of commercial publications are printed on Adobe PostScript devices, including black-and white printers, color printers, imagesetters, platesetters, and direct digital printing systems. Adobe PostScript is also the display imaging system in some of the most advanced workstations on the market today.

Adobe PostScript 3 takes the PostScript standard beyond a page description language into a fully optimized printing system that addresses the broad range of new requirements in today’s increasingly complex and distributed printing environments.


'''Adobe Postscript and PDF'''

By fully integrating Portable Document Format (PDF) - an open file format that preserves the visual fidelity of documents across applications and platforms - into Adobe PostScript 3, documents can be delivered electronically and printed directly. A PDF file delivers the single &quot;digital master&quot; for use in electronic, printed, and mixed workflows, ensuring the highest fidelity across all media.


'''Adobe Postscript Advanced Features'''

With Adobe PostScript 3, Adobe delivers advanced features for the new digital document. Today, document creators draw on a variety of sources and increasingly rely on color to convey their messages. And tomorrow, these documents will be delivered and printed on a virtually unlimited range of devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Problem'''

In the case of conversion of documents into SGML/XML, the original file must be written using a structuring style sheet (template). But students often give a lot of importance to the layout of the final document and make many personalizations and adaptations on the original structuring style sheet. It is our duty to also convert also this aspect of their work. The conversion tools devoted to the document content have to be completed by conversion tools that may generate rendering style-sheets : typically XSL files for XML documents.


'''Layout Demand'''

As SGML or XML cannot be directly read by users using today's browsers (Opera, Netscape, Internet Explorer), it is necessary either to provide layout information in the form of a stylesheet or to transform those highly structured documents into layout or printable version in HTML, PDF,PS, which can be more easily used by users to read the documents.

Generally, universities have 2 possibilities to cope with the demand for layout:
#Try to preserve all layout information the author (student) has given to the MS Word or other document. This strategy involves the author directly by the personalization of a standard style sheet for his/her work.
#Universities could decide to develop one single style sheet or a choice of certain style sheets usable for all ETDs. This would support a corporate design and solve the layout question on a more general level, leaving it to the ETD production department.


'''Style Sheets for SGML or XML documents'''

The development of such tools is being achieved in France (collaboration between Lyon 2 and Marne-la-Vallée) for documens produced in MS Word and other RTF compatible authoring tools. Theirs are based on the analysis and the extraction of the typographic characteristics associated to each used style.


'''Equivalent Tools'''

The equivalent tools shall be easy to develop for document produced with LateX, as this kind of language natively uses the notion of rendering style-sheets.

Style sheet languages for XML are:
*Cascading Style Sheets (CSS )
*Extensible Style Language (XSL) .

As CSS are not powerful enough to handle the complexity and demand for large XML documents as theses and dissertations, this is not advisable.


'''Substandards within XSL Standard'''

Within the XSL standard, one distinguishes between several sub-standards:
*Extensible Style Sheet Transformation (XSLT). This part allows the user to produce stylesheets that act like small programs. They transform the original document, that is always valid against a specified DTD, into a document that either follows another DTD (which allows an easier rendering within browsers, as HTML.dtd) or allows a transformation of the document into other document description languages such as Rich Text Format (RTF), LaTeX, PDF. From those formats the production of a printed version may be possible.
*XPath allows to authors to build expressions that link to other XML documents, but not only to the whole document. The citation of a certain subsection and the citation of e.g. section 3 to 5 might be possible once common browsers support this linking technology.
*XSL:Fo ( Formatting vocabulary, that can be applied to the nodes of an XML document)


'''Example for a Printing On Demand Service (POD) based on the use of stylesheets'''

Digital Libraries which use their document servers as long term electronic archives will not make printed information dispensable. On the contrary: for users of these information systems the desire for printed documents is increasing. In most cases this desire often focuses not on the whole document as such, but on particular parts of it like chapters, citations and so on. For that reason the Humboldt-University Berlin's printing on demand project aims toward the development of a technology which allows the users to print the only the desired part of a certain document.


'''Printing on Demand with XML'''

For the printing on demand component with XML the usage of Apache/Cocoon was chosen. This software uses an XSLT-engine to produce an HTML or PDF-Version on the fly. &quot;The Cocoon Project is an Open Source volunteer project under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), and, in harmony with the Apache webserver itself, it is released under a very open license. Even if the most common use of Cocoon is the automatic creation of HTML through the processing of statically or dynamically generated XML files, Cocoon is also able to perform more sophisticated formatting, such as XSL:FO rendering to PDF files, client-dependent transformations such as WML formatting for WAP-enabled devices, or direct XML serving to XML and XSL aware clients. &quot;


'''Cocoon'''

As Cocoon does not consist of a printing on demand component (especially a selection feature) a small workaround using different XSLT-stylesheets had to be created. The users view, containing an HTML-view onto the actual document includes check boxes which the user can use to select parts of a specific document. This view is produced by the XSLT-Broker stylesheet which calls a default stylesheet, that produces HTML (XSLT-Stylesheet with option document.xml?format=html). If the user selects certain parts of the document by clicking in the checkboxes, by clicking on the &quot;OK&quot; button a perl script (PHP-Choise) is called. This script selects the desired chapters and sections of the document by using XPath-expressions (http://dochost.rz.huberlin.de/proprint/bsp/slides.xml?CHAPTER=3 and http://dochost.rz.huberlin.de/proprint/bsp/slides.xml?CHAPTER=4 ) cuts those parts out of the document and holds them in the main memory. This procedure is carried out by the XSLT-Broker-stylesheet that has now been called with the XML-option (document.xml?format=xml). These parts are added to one single XML-document (all in the main memory!) and processed by the XSLT Broker-stylesheet either with the print option or the HTML option (document.xml?format=pdf or document.xml?format=html)

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: reasearchers → researchers, the the → the using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">SGML/XML is a multiple-targeted strategy. &quot;It allows librarians to ensure longevity of digital dissertations. Modern hardware and redundancy can keep all the bits of an electronic thesis or dissertation (ETD) intact. But electronic archives must be modernized continually as new document formats become popular.&quot; As librarians always tend to think in decades, document formats like TIFF, Postscript or PDF do not meet their requirements. If PDF is replaced by another de facto (industry, not ISO-like) standard, preserving digital documents would mean converting thousends of documents. XML can help overcome those difficulties. If an electronic document is to be of ‘archival quality, it should be liberated from the page metaphor.&quot;

A second reason for using SGML/XML is that it ensures reusability of documents by preserving raw data and content-based structuring of information pieces. Preserving data for statistics and formulas in mathematics and chemistry could allow researchers to reuse and repeat simulations, calculations and experiments, deriving the needed data directly from an archive.

Third, using structured information allows the reuse of the same information or documents in different contexts, i.e., the same digital dissertation can be used to produce an online or print version, and to produce additional information products, like monthly proceedings containing the abstracts of all dissertations produced within the university during the last month, or a citation index. Additionally, the dissertation can be displaysd for different media, so a Braille reader or an automatic voice synthesizer could be used as a back-end machine.

Another reason for using markup for encoding documents is that a wider, more qualified retrieval could be provided to the users of an archive. As university libraries are more and more challenged by the problem of handling, converting, archiving and providing electronic publications, one of the major tasks is providing a new quality for retrieval within the user interface. Using an SGML/XML-based publishing concept enables a new quality in the distribution of scientific contents via specific information and knowledge management.


'''What does SGML/XML mean?'''

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is the universal format for structured documents and data on the Web. The current W3C Recommendations are XML 1.0, Feb '98, Namespaces, Jan '99, and Associating Stylesheets, Jun '99, and XSLT/XPath, Nov '99.( http://www.w3.org/XML ) The development of XML started in 1996 and it is a W3C (http://www.w3.org/) standard since February 1998, which may make you suspect that this is rather immature technology. But in fact the technology isn't very new.

Before XML there was the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), developed in the early '80s, an ISO standard since 1986, and widely used for large documentation projects. And of course HTML, whose development started in 1990. The designers of XML simply took the best parts of SGML, guided by the experience with HTML, and produced something that is no less powerful than SGML, but vastly more regular and simpler to use. While SGML was mostly used for technical documentation and much less for other kinds of data, with XML it is the opposite.

&quot;Structured data&quot;, such as mathematical or chemical formulas, spreadsheets, address books, configuration parameters, financial transactions, technical drawings, etc. are usually put on the Web using the output of layout programs as Postscript or PDF or by putting them into graphic formats like gif, jpeg, png, vrml, and so on. Programs that produce such data often also store it on disk, for which they can use either a binary format or a text format. So, if soemebody wants to look at the data, he usually needs the program that produced it. With XML those data could be stored in a text format, which allows the user reading the file without having the original program. XML is a set of rules, guidelines, conventions, whatever you want to call them, for designing text formats for such data, in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and read (by a computer).

The eXtensible Markup Language ('''XML''') is a markup or structuring language for documents, a so-called metalanguage, that defines rules for the structural markup of documents independently from any output media. XML is a &quot;reduced&quot; version of the Structured Generalized Markup Language ('''SGML'''), which has been an ISO-certified standard since 1986. In the field of internet publishing, it never achieved wide success due to the complexity of the standard and the high cost of the tools. It prevailed only in certain areas, such as technical documentation in large enterprizes (Boeing, patent information). The main philosophy of SGML and XML is the strict separation of content, structure and layout of documents. Most ETD projects use either the SGML standard (ISO 8879 with Korregendum K vom 4.12.1997) or the definition of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML 1.0 (10.02.1998, revised 6.10.2000). The crux of all those projects was always the document type definition (DTD).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''SGML''' (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and '''XML''' (eXtensible Markup Language) are markup languages, which use tags (&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;) with names of labels inside around the sections of the documents that are thus marked or bracketed. Document Type Definition (DTD) specifies the grammar or structure for a type or a class of documents. SGML requires a DTD while XML employs DTD optionally. But given current trends it seems that XML is most likely to be used due to the following reasons.

*XML is a method for putting structured data in a text file for &quot;structured data&quot; think of such things as spreadsheets, address books, configuration parameters, financial transactions, technical drawings, etc. Programs that produce such data often also store it on disk, for which they can use either a binary format or a text format. The latter allows you, if necessary, to look at the data without the program that produced it. XML is a set of rules, guidelines, conventions, whatever you want to call them, for designing text formats for such data, in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and read (by a computer), that are unambiguous, and that avoid common pitfalls, such as lack of extensibility, lack of support for internationalization/localization, and platform dependency.
*'''XML looks a bit like HTML but isn't HTML'''&lt;br /&gt; Like HTML, XML makes use of tags and attributes (of the form name=&quot;value&quot;), but while HTML specifies what each tag and attribute means (and often how the text between them will look in a browser), XML uses the tags only to delimit pieces of data, and leaves the interpretation of the data completely to the application that reads it. In other words, if you see &quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&quot; in an XML file, don't assume it is a paragraph. Depending on the context, it may be a price, a parameter, a person. In short it allows you to develop your own mark up language specific to a particular domain.
*'''XML documents can be preserved for a long time.'''&lt;br /&gt; XML is, at a basic level an incredibly simple data format. It can write in 100 percent pure ASCII text as well as in a few other well-defined formats. ASCII text is reasonably resistant to corruption. Also XML is very well documented. The W3C’s XML 1.0 specification tells us exactly how to read XML data.
*'''XML is license-free, platform-independent and well-supported.'''&lt;br /&gt; By choosing XML as the basis for some project, you buy into a large and growing community of tools (one of which may already do what you need!) and engineers experienced in the technology. Opting for XML is a bit like choosing SQL for databases: you still have to build your own database and your own programs/procedures that manipulate it, but there are many tools available and many people that can help you. And since XML, as a W3C technology, is license-free, you can build your own software around it without paying anybody anything. The large and growing support means that you are also not tied to a single vendor. XML isn't always the best solution, but it is always worth considering.
*'''XML is a family of technologies.'''&lt;br /&gt; There is XML 1.0, the specification that defines what &quot;tags&quot; and &quot;attributes&quot; are, but around XML 1.0, there is a growing set of optional modules that provide sets of tags &amp; attributes, or guidelines for specific tasks. There is, e.g., Xlink which describes a standard way to add hyperlinks to an XML file. XPointer &amp; XFragments are syntaxes for pointing to parts of an XML document. (An Xpointer is a bit like a URL, but instead of pointing to documents on the Web, it points to pieces of data inside an XML file.) CSS, the style sheet language, is applicable to XML as it is to HTML. XSL is the advanced language for expressing style sheets. The DOM is a standard set of function calls for manipulating XML (and HTML) files from a programming language. XML Namespaces is a specification that describes how you can associate a URL with every single tag and attribute in an XML document. What that URL is used for is up to the application that reads the URL, though. XML Schemas help developers to precisely define their own XML-based formats. There are several more modules and tools available or under development.
*'''XML provides Structured and Integrated Data''' XML is ideal for large and complex data like ETD’s because data is structured. It not only lets you specify a vocabulary that defines the elements in the document; but it also allows you to specify relations between the elements.
*'''XML can encode metadata about DTD’s.'''&lt;br /&gt; Documents are often supplemented with metadata (that is data about data). If such metadata were included inside an ETD then it would make ETD self-describing. XML can encode such metadata. However on the downside XML comes with its own bag of discomforts.


#Conversion from word processing forms to XML requires more planning is advance, different tools and broader learning about processing concepts than it is required for PDF.
#There are many fewer people knowledgeable about these matters and tools that support this conversion are less mature and expensive. Also process of converting may be complicated, difficult and time consuming.
#Writing directly in XML by using XML authoring tools requires some prior knowledge of XML.
#Also XML is very strict regarding the naming and ordering of tags. It is also case sensitive illustrating the relative effort required by students to prepare ETD’s in this form.


'''Process of Creating an XML document'''

XML documents have four-stage life cycle.

XML documents are mostly created using an editor. It may be a basic text editor like notepad. or .vi. editor. We may even use WYSIWYG editors. The XML parser reads the document and converts it into a tree of elements. The parser passes the tree to the browser that displays it. It is important to know that all this processes are independent and decoupled from each other.


'''Putting XML to work for ETD’s'''
Before we jump into the XML details for ETD.s we should make certain things clear, since we would be using them on a regular basis now onwards.


'''DTD (Document Type Definition):'''

An XML document primarily consists of a strictly nested hierarchy of elements with a single root. Elements can contain character data, child elements, or a mixture of both. The structure of the XML document is described in the DTD. There are different kinds of documents like letter, poem, book, thesis, etc. Each of the documents has its own structure. This specific structure is defined in a separate document called Document Type Definition (DTD).

DTD used is based on XML and it covers most of the basic HTML formatting tags and also some specific tags from the Dublin core metadata. A DTD has been developed for ETD. The developed DTD is too generic. If someone wants to use mathematical equation or incorporate some chemical equation, it won't be sufficient. For that we can incorporate '''MathML''' (Mathematical Markup Language) and/or '''CML''' (Chemical Markup Language). There are defined DTDs for these languages that we also have to use for our documents. But research of incorporating more that one DTD for different parts of the documents is still going on.


'''CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets):'''

CSS is a flexible, cross-platform, standards-based language used to suggest stylistic or presentational features applied throughout entire websites or web pages. In their most elegant forms, CSS are specified in a separate file and called from within the XML or HTML header area when documents loads into the CSS-enabled browser. Users can always turn off the author's styles and apply their own or mix their important styles with the authors. This points to the &quot;cascading&quot; aspect of CSS.

CSS is based on rules and style sheets. A rule is a statement about one stylistic aspect of one or more elements. A style sheet is one or more rules that apply to a markup document.

An example of a simple style sheet is a sheet that consists of one rule. In the following example, we add a color to all first-level headings (H1). Here's the line of code - the rule - that we add:

H1 {color: red}


'''XSL (the eXtensible Stylesheet Language):'''

XSL is a language for expressing stylesheets. It consists of two parts:
#A language for transforming XML documents, and
#An XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics.


If you don't understand the meaning of this, think of XSL as a language that can transform XML into HTML, a language that can filter and sort XML data, a language that can address parts of an XML document, a language that can format XML data based on the data value, like displaying negative numbers in red, and a language that can output XML data to different devices, like screen, paper or voice. XSL is developed by the W3C XSL Working Group whose charter is to develop the next version of XSL.

Because XML does not use predefined tags (we can use any tags we want), the meanings of these tags are not understood: &lt;table&gt; could mean an HTML table or maybe a piece of furniture. Because of the nature of XML, the browser does not know how to display an XML document.

In order to display XML documents, it is necessary to have a mechanism to describe how the document should be displayed. One of these mechanisms is CSS as discussed above, but XSL is the preferred style sheet language of XML, and XSL is far more sophisticated and powerful than the CSS used by HTML.


'''XML Namespaces'''

The purpose of XML namespaces is to distinguish between duplicate element type and attribute names. Such duplication might occur, for example, in an XSLT stylesheet or in a document that contains element types and attributes from two different DTDs.

An XML namespace is a collection of element type and attribute names. The namespace is identified by a unique name, which is a URI. Thus, any element type or attribute name in an XML namespace can be uniquely identified by a two-part name: the name of its XML namespace and its local name. This two part naming system is the only function of XML namespaces.

*XML namespaces are declared with an xmlns attribute, which can associate a prefix with the namespace. The declaration is in scope for the element containing the attribute and all its descendants. For example code below declares two XML namespaces. Their scope is the A and B elements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;A xmlns:foo=&quot;http://www.foo.org/&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.bar.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;abcd&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
*If an XML namespace declaration contains a prefix, you refer to element type and attribute names in that namespace with the prefix. For example code below declare A and B in http://www.foo.org namespace, which is associated with the foo prefix:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;foo:A xmlns:foo=&quot;http://www.foo.org/&quot;&gt; &lt;foo:B&gt;abcd&lt;/foo:B&gt; &lt;/foo:A&gt;
*If an XML namespace declaration does not contain a prefix, the namespace is the default XML namespace and you refer to element type names in that namespace without a prefix. For example, code below is same as previous example but uses a default namespace instead of foo prefix:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;A xmlns=&quot;http://www.foo.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;B&gt;abcd&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/A&gt;


'''Glossary'''&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;'''attribute'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. A name-value pair within a tagged element that modifies certain features of the element. For XML, all values must be enclosed in quotation marks.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''cascading style sheets (CSS)'''&lt;br /&gt;

Formatting descriptions that provide augmented control over presentation and layout of HTML and XML elements. CSS can be used for describing the formatting behavior of simply structured XML documents, but does not provide a display structure that deviates from the structure of the source data.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''CDATA section'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. CDATA sections can be used to mark tags or reserved characters with quotation marks and thus prevent them from being interpreted. For this reason, the CDATA section is especially useful for escaping markup and script. The syntax for CDATA sections in XML is &lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''character data'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. The text content of an element or attribute. XML differentiates this plain text from markup.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''character set'''&lt;br /&gt;

A mapping of a set of characters to their numeric values. For example, Unicode is a 16- bit character set capable of encoding all known characters; it is used as a worldwide character-encoding standard.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''component'''&lt;br /&gt;

An object that encapsulates both data and code, and provides a well-specified set of publicly available services.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''data type'''&lt;br /&gt;

The type of content that an element contains: a number, a date, and so on. In XML, an author can specify an element's data type, for example, with a tokenized attribute type. Microsoft is working with the W3C to define a set of standard types that anyone can freely use.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''document element'''&lt;br /&gt;

The top-level element of an XML document; only one top-level element is allowed. The document element is a child of the document root.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Document Object Model (DOM)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The standard maintained by the W3C that specifies how the content, structure, and appearance of Web documents can be updated programmatically with scripts or other programs. The proposed object model for XML matches the Document Object Model for HTML so that script writers can easily learn XML programming. The XML DOM will provide a simple means of reading and writing data to and from an XML tree structure.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''document root'''&lt;br /&gt;

The top-level node of an XML document; its descendants branch out from it to form the XML tree for that document. The document root contains the document element and can also contain a set of processing instructions and comments.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''document type declaration'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. A production within an XML document that contains or points to markup declarations that provide a grammar for a class of documents. This grammar is known as a Document Type Definition. The document type declaration can point to an external subset (a special kind of external entity) containing markup declarations, or can contain the markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or both. The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken together. The syntax of the document type declaration is &lt;!DOCTYPE content &gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Document Type Definition (DTD)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The markup declarations that describe a grammar for a class of documents. The DTD is declared within the document type declaration production of the XML file. The markup declarations can be in an external subset (a special kind of external entity), in an internal subset directly within the XML file, or both. The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken together.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)'''&lt;br /&gt;

An existing format used to exchange data and support transactions. EDI transactions can be conducted only between sites that have been specifically set up with compatible systems.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''element'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. An XML element consists of a start tag, and end tag, and the information between the tags, which is often referred to as the contents. Elements used in an XML file are described by a DTD or schema, either of which can provide a description of the structure of the data.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''entity'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. A character sequence or well-formed XML hierarchy associated with a name. The entity can be referred to by an entity reference to insert the entity's contents into the tree at that point. The function of an XML entity is similar to that of a macro definition. Entity declarations occur in the DTD.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''entity reference'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. Refers to the content of a named entity. The name is delimited by the ampersand and semicolon characters; for example, &amp;bookname; and &amp;#x3C;. It is used in much the same way as a macro.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Extensible Linking Language (XLL)'''&lt;br /&gt;

An XML vocabulary that provides links in XML similar to those in HTML but with more functionality. Linking could be multidirectional, and links could exist at the object level rather than just at a page level.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Extensible Markup Language (XML)'''&lt;br /&gt;

A subset of SGML that provides a uniform method for describing and exchanging structured data in an open, text-based format, and delivers this data by use of the standard HTTP protocol. At the time of this writing, XML 1.0 is a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation, which means that it is in the final stage of the approval process.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)'''&lt;br /&gt;

A language used to transform XML-based data into HTML or other presentation formats, for display in a Web browser. Differs from cascading style sheets in that it can present information in an order different from that in which it was received. XSL will also be able to generate CSS along with HTML. XSL consists of two parts, a vocabulary for transformation and the XSL Formatting Objects.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''ID'''&lt;br /&gt;

A special attribute type within the XML language. The ID attribute on the XML element provides a unique name, enabling links to that element using the IDREF attribute type. The value associated with the ID attribute must be unique within that XML document. IDs are currently declared with a DTD or schema.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''markup'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. Text in an XML document that does not represent character data: start tags, end tags, empty-element tags, entity references, character references, comments, CDATA section delimiters, DTDs, and processing instructions. 

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''mixed content'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. An element type has mixed content when elements of that type can contain character data, optionally interspersed with child elements. In this case, the types of the child elements can be constrained, but not their order or their number of occurrences.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''namespace'''&lt;br /&gt;

A mechanism to resolve naming conflicts between elements in an XML document when each comes from a different vocabulary; it allows the commingling of like tag names from different namespaces. A namespace identifies an XML vocabulary defined within a URN. An attribute on an element, attribute, or entity reference associates a short name with the URN that defines the namespace; that short name is then used as a prefix to the element, attribute, or entity reference name to uniquely identify the namespace. Namespace references have scope. All child nodes beneath the node that specifies the namespace inherit that namespace. This allows nonqualified names to use the default namespace.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''NDATA'''&lt;br /&gt;

The literal string &quot;NDATA&quot; is used as part of a notation declaration. See also notation.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''notation'''&lt;br /&gt;

Usually refers to a data format, such as BMP. A notation identifies by name the format of unparsed entities, the format of elements that bear a notation attribute, or the application to which a processing instruction is addressed.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''notation declaration'''&lt;br /&gt;

A notation declaration provides a name and an external identifier for a notation. The name is used in entity and attribute-list declarations and in attribute specifications. The external identifier is used for the notation, which can allow an XML processor or its client application to locate a helper application capable of processing data in the given notation.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''processing instruction (PI)'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML structural construct. Instructions that are passed through to the application. The target is specified as part of the PI. The syntax for a PI is &lt;?pi-name content?&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Resource Definition Framework (RDF)'''&lt;br /&gt;

An object model similar in function to an application programming interface (API), RDF can be used by developers to access the logical meaning of designated content in XML documents.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''root element'''&lt;br /&gt;

Sometimes this term is used to refer to the document element but this is misleading, since the top-level element and the document root are not the same. Because of this ambiguity, use of the term &quot;root element&quot; is discouraged.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''schema'''&lt;br /&gt;

A formal specification of element names that indicates which elements are allowed in an XML document, and in which combinations. A schema is functionally equivalent to a DTD, but is written in XML; a schema also provides for extended functionality such as data typing, inheritance, and presentation rules.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The international standard for defining descriptions of structure and content of electronic documents. XML is a subset of SGML designed to deliver SGML-type information over the Web.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''target'''&lt;br /&gt;

The application to which a processing instruction is directed. The target names beginning with &quot;XML&quot; and &quot;xml&quot; are reserved. The target appears as the first token in the PI. For example, in the XML declaration &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;, the target is &quot;xml&quot;.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''text markup'''&lt;br /&gt;

Inserting tags into the middle of an element's text flow, to mark certain parts of the element with additional meta-information.

&lt;br /&gt;'''tokenized attribute type'''&lt;br /&gt;

Each attribute has an attribute type. Seven attribute types are characterized as tokenized: ID, IDREF, IDREFS, ENTITY, ENTITIES, NMTOKEN, and NMTOKENS.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The generic set of all names and addresses that refer to resources, including URLs and URNs. Defined in Berners-Lee, T., R. Fielding, and L. Masinter, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax and Semantics. 1997. See updates to the W3C document RFC1738. The Layman-Bray proposal for namespaces makes every element name subordinate to a URI, which would ensure that element names are always unambiguous.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Uniform Resource Locator (URL)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The set of URI schemes that have explicit instructions on how to access the resource on the Internet.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''Uniform Resource Name (URN)'''&lt;br /&gt;

A Uniform Resource Name identifies a persistent Internet resource.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''valid XML'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML that conforms to the vocabulary specified in a DTD or schema.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''W3C'''&lt;br /&gt;

World Wide Web Consortium

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''well-formed XML'''&lt;br /&gt;

XML that meets the requirements listed in the W3C Recommendation for XML 1.0: It contains one or more elements; it has a single document element, with any other elements properly nested under it; each of the parsed entities referenced directly or indirectly within the document is well-formed. A well-formed XML document does not necessarily include a DTD.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'''&lt;br /&gt;

The international consortium founded in 1994 to develop standards for the Web. See

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''XLL'''&lt;br /&gt;

Extensible Linking Language

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''XML'''&lt;br /&gt;

Extensible Markup Language

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''XML declaration'''&lt;br /&gt;

The first line of an XML file can optionally contain the &quot;xml&quot; processing instruction, which is known as the XML declaration. The XML declaration can contain pseudoattributes to indicate the XML language version, the character set, and whether the document can be used as a standalone entity.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''XML document'''&lt;br /&gt;

A data object that is well-formed, according to the XML recommendation, and that might (or might not) be valid. The XML document has a logical structure (composed of declarations, elements, comments, character references, and processing instructions) and a physical structure (composed of entities, starting with the root, or document entity).

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'''XML parser'''&lt;br /&gt;

A generalized XML parser reads XML files and generates a hierarchically structured tree, then hands off data to viewers and other applications for processing. A validating XML parser also checks the XML syntax and reports errors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Access to ETDs that are produced by students around the globe requires some mechanism for connecting with the many computers that house those ETDs. There are two basic approaches.


'''Federated Research'''

In federated search, a user’s information need, expressed in the form of a query, is sent by the federated search system to all the sites that support the searching over local ETD collections. Then, when the sites have completed their searching and generated results, either the user can view each site that might have some relevant content (see Powell &amp; Fox, 1998), or some type of fusion of results leads to a single merged list (as with Dienst, see Lagoze &amp; Davis, 1995). While federated search yields up-to-the-moment results, such currency is usually not of high priority in the ETD world (where daily updates should suffice). At the same time, federated search may involve complex timeout and backup site management, if some remote sites are down or slow to respond. At best, federated search is often slow (due to network delays) and suffers from having to manage a wide diversity of representations of data at remote sites, leading in some cases to low data quality. Nevertheless, see such a service for ETDs from www.theses.org.


'''Harvesting'''

Harvesting is the second basic approach. As is explained in section [[ETD Guide/Technical Issues/Harvest usage in Germany, France|Harvest usage in Germany, France]], the Harvest system first clearly demonstrated this solution, and is still in use in Germany and other locations. However, this is being superseded by the Open Archives Initiative (www.openarchives.org, see Lagoze &amp; Van de Sompel 2001). NDLTD has developed a harvesting-based OAI access scheme for handling the global collection of ETDs; see Suleman et al., 2001 (parts 1 and 2). The basic outline of the approach is as follows:
* Each ETD is described (with metadata) using MARC21 or ETD-MS (http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/ETD-ms-v1.00.html).
* Each ETD site runs an open archive, which responds to OAI requests for metadata by providing Dublin Core records, as well as either (or both) MARC21 and ETD-MS. For example, the software for ETD management developed by Virginia Tech has such a capability (http://www.dlib.vt.edu/projects/OAI/software/ndltd/ndltd.html).
* State, provincial, national, regional or other organizations may harvest from these sites, and run their own open archives and related services.
* Virginia Tech harvests from all sites (or group sites that have harvested for university sites) to develop a union collection (http://oai.dlib.vt.edu/~etdunion).
* VTLS Inc., as a service to NDLTD, provides search access to the union collection (http://www.vtls.com/ndltd).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This topic is discussed briefly in [[ETD Guide/Students/Overview: writing with word processors and structured editors|Overview: writing with word processors and structured editors]] and in more detail in [[ETD Guide/Students/Writing directly in SGML\XML|Writing directly in SGML/XML]].

The following extends that discussion by focusing on tools to help students to write directly in XML.


'''XML Tools'''

To author and view documents written in XML, different kinds of tools are required. They are:
*Editor
*Parser/Validator
*Browser


'''Editor'''

There are quite a large number of XML editors, for different platforms are
available. Most of them costs less than $100. A lot of them have free
evaluation version that can be downloaded. the following list gives link to
some such editors.
* XML Spy http://www.xmlspy.com
* XMLWriter http://www.megginson.com/Software/
* XED http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~ht/xed.html
* Xeena http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xeena
* Morphon XML Editor http://www.morphon.com/
* Emile for MAC http://www.in-progress.com/emile/


'''Parser/Validator'''

When a XML document is created, it is parsed/validated to see if it is syntactically correct and well formed. To accomplish this task, we need a XML parser/validator. There are a lot of XML parser available. Most of the XML editors mentioned above is also a XML parser. For example, XML Spy provides a IDE for XML, i.e. it is both editor and parser.

To view a XML documents, we need a browser that supports XML. Many browsers now support XML, such as:
*Internet explorer 5 and newer http://www.microsoft.com
*Mozilla Firefox 0.9 and newer http://www.mozilla.org/
*Netscape 5 and newer http://browser.netscape.com/
*DocZilla http://www.doczilla.com/
*HyBrick is an SGML/XML browser from Fujitsu. 

Most newer browsers support XML in a way that lets it fully integrated with HTML. A stylesheet is required to view the XML documents. For ETD a cascading stylesheet has been developed for that. That stylesheet can be downloaded from http://www.etdguide.org/.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations is an interconnected system of digital archives. After NDLTD became a reality, the logical next step was to give users the means to search and browse the entire collection of theses and dissertations. Much research went in to deciding how best to do this, and a couple of proto-solutions were examined. In the end, by adopting the Metadata Harvesting Protocol of the Open Archives Initiative to gather metadata in the ETDMS format, NDLTD was able to make the collection of ETDs accessible via a central portal. VTLS Inc., using their Virtua--Integrated Library System (Virtua ILS), is hosting this portal, providing a Web interface to the ETD Union Catalog. This portal gives users a simple and intuitive way to search and browse through the merged collection of theses and dissertations. Once relevant items are discovered via a browse, keyword, or Boolean search, users can follow links that go directly to the source archives or to an alphabetical index that allows for further searching.

VTLS’ flagship product, Virtua ILS, is especially suited to the needs of NDLTD. For starters, it is inherently a distributed system and adheres to emerging standards, such as the Unicode® standard, for encoding metadata. Secondly, VTLS’ Web portal, called Chameleon Gateway to emphasize its changeability, is not only straightforward and easy to use, but highly customizable and translatable, giving global users the ability to retrieve information and enter searches in a multitude of languages. Currently, versions of the NDLTD portal interface exist in 14 languages, including Arabic, Korean, and Russian, and plans call for support of all languages used by NDLTD members.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describe the hardware and software requirements involved in setting up your own ETD database.


'''Hardware'''

To use this software, you must have a web server available. At Virginia Tech we use a UNIX-based server platform. You should allocate enough disk space on your machine for at least a year's worth of submissions. Our site averages 2.5 Megabytes per submission. Keep in mind that it's better to have more space early on, as the scripts are not designed to deal with a collection which spans multiple drives. You should also have enough memory to handle the web server, the database server, and whatever other tasks you have in mind. As an example, our site uses a dual-processor Sun Enterprise 250 with 384 Mb of RAM, running Solaris 2.7. Our machine has an 18Gb drive allocated solely for the ETD collection.


'''Software'''

Before you can make use of the scripts provided here, you must have the following installed:

'''Mysql'''

Mysql is a database server and client which partially implements the SQL 9.2 standard. It is many ways similar to other SQL databases, such as Oracle, Postgres, and miniSQL. UNIX versions of Mysql are made available without charge to education institutions at http://www.mysql.com/. A version of Mysql for Windows NT is available as well for an additional charge, although the scripts are not designed for use with Windows NT.

'''Perl'''

All of the scripts included with this distribution are written using perl. Perl is also freely available (under the GNU public license) from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/. It is recommended that you download, install, and test the latest version available for your operating environment.

'''CGI.pm'''

The CGI module for perl is one of the most widely used and best supported libraries of CGI oriented routines in existence. Virtually all of the query handling performed in these scripts relies heavily on CGI.pm. CGI.pm is available from http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/bymodule/CGI/.

'''The DBI and DBD:Mysql modules for perl'''

The DBI module for perl is a generic set of database calls designed to interface with a wide range of different database technologies in a powerful, reliable, and easy to understand way.

To make use of the DBI module, you need a DBD module for the particular database you intend to use. The DBD:Mysql module (also known as the DBD:Msql module) allows you to easily perform all types of database operations on a Mysql database from within perl.

Both modules are available from http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/dbperl/.

'''The Tie-IxHash module for perl'''

The Tie-IxHash module is a very small add-in that allows you to reliably output hashes in the order they are defined in. Without this module, none of the global hashes that contain department names, degree information, etc. would appear in the order we'd like them to. This module is available at http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/Tie/

'''Web Server Software'''

The perl scripts provided are designed for the most part to be used through a CGI interface, meaning that you must have a compatible web server installed. The freely available Apache Web Server is our recommendation, although any web server capable of seamlessly handling html output from perl scripts should be acceptable. Apache is available from http://www.apache.org/.

Once you have all the preceding items installed and tested, you should be ready to download (http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ETD-db/developer/download/) and install(http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ETD-db/developer/install.html) the scripts

While a proportion of this information is published in other forms much of the detail is not, and research emanating from lesser-known institutions, particularly in the developing countries, may be less likely to be published in mainstream journals. Creation of this information in electronic form making it readily accessible via the Web through standard, ubiquitous and free software programs provides the key to dissemination of this information independent of the source of the research. The ETD initiatives to date have proven that electronic theses and dissertations can be created using relatively low technology at a cost, which would be within the reach of most institutions. Portable packages have been developed which eliminate the majority of the developmental work required. The point has been reached where all research institutions can technically establish their own ETD program.

Traditionally, theses and dissertations have been extremely underutilized sources of information due to their lack of physical availability. The development of ETDs provides the opportunity for theses and dissertations to be recognized as a basic channel for the dissemination of research findings and an essential resource in the discovery process. Therefore, the focus for the future needs to be to ensure optimal access to ETDs by information seekers. This in essence means ensuring that ETD metadata records are accessible through as many channels as possible and are retrieved as integral components of searches without the researcher necessarily specifying an ETD. Some ways of achieving this could be:
*Creation of a virtual union catalogue of ETD metadata through frequent regular harvesting of data from ETD sites which could be individual, regional or national
*Integration of ETD metadata into general metadata repositories for electronic scholarly information
*Ensuring search engines being established for other electronic scholarly information initiatives such as the Open Archives Initiative also search the ETD metadata repositories
*Inclusion of ETD metadata in local library catalogues
*Inclusion of ETD metadata in subject or form oriented databases

The development of ETD programs worldwide and the implementation of access structures have the potential to significantly enhance the opportunity for all researchers, independent of geographic and economic constraints, to make their contribution to the global research effort.

Work in all of these areas continues under development by NDLTD. Acting as agent for NDLTD, Virginia Tech is running a union catalog, drawing upon sites that support OAI. The result is accessible through Virginia Tech software as well as VTLS’s Virtua software.

With support from the USA’s National Science Foundation, Virginia Tech also is engaged in a number of research activities related to ETDs. These include matching efforts funded by DFG in Germany (in collection with Oldenburg U.) and by CONACyT in Mexico (with Puebla and Monterrey). These aim to promote mirroring (of metadata as well as regular data), high performance access, effective searching and browsing, visualization of results and of sites, and other advanced schemes.

It is hoped that all involved in the ETD efforts will assist, with a global perspective, so that all universities become involved, and ultimately all students submit an ETD, thus becoming better prepared to be a leader in the Information Age.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETD initiatives will spread in many ways. Word of mouth, from universities with successful programs, is one of the most effective means. Word of mouth, from graduates of universities with ETD programs, will spread the idea further.

Further, as the worldwide collection of ETDs grows, more and more researchers, including graduate students, will make use of the valuable content. As use expands, others will be convinced to include their works in the collection, so it approaches full coverage.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: heterogenious → heterogeneous, worlwide → worldwide using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">At our various locations, document servers for electronic theses and dissertations have been set up independently from each other. The aim is to build a network of sites, which would allow for worldwide retrieval within a heterogeneous knowledge base, independently from the physical location of the data provided. The users should not have to navigate and search the various servers separately. They should be provided with one retrieval interface that can link to all the different nodes of the network of ETDs sites. This is the horizontal level on which retrieval could take place.

Another level, which we call the vertical level of the information portal, would be the one, which configures the retrieval interface in a manner allowing the user to retrieve only the relevant and desired information rather than receiving all of the information that can be possibly provided. We wish to avoid the &quot;Altavista effect&quot; of information overload. The user should be able to search within specific subjects and for specific information structures. For example, they should be able to undertake searches just within the author field or the title field, for certain keywords or institutions or just within the abstracts field. A highly sophisticated retrieval facility would allow a worldwide search within certain internal document structures, such as the bibliography.

For the scientific use of theses in the humanities and social sciences, as well as in the natural and technical sciences, it is necessary to offer not only bibliographical metadata and full text but also structural information for retrieval purposes, such as:
*the table of contents;
*captions of tables and graphs;
*special index terms such as name or person indexes or location indexes etc.);
*references (links) to external sources (printed resources as well as Web sources);
*the bibliography;
*references or footnotes within the work;
*definitions;
*mathematical / chemical formulas;
*theses / hypotheses

These structural metadata are an integral part of the document and have to be defined by the author. At present, this predominantly takes place while formatting the text (e.g. headings, footnotes etc.). In order to also use these structural data for retrieval, they must be tagged as such by the author, by using either a structured language like LaTeX, or &quot;style sheets&quot; as with WinWord.


'''What could be the lowest common denominator for interoperability?'''

The first step within the above mentioned development is to reach agreement on a common metadata set for theses and dissertations and to formulate guidelines on how to use it for ETD projects. See http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/ for the Dublin Core metadata set proposed by the NDLTD. Those guidelines could be supported by additional free software tools, which would allow library staff to create the necessary metadata set without needing a technical knowledge of the actual encoding in HTML or XML/RDF. Such a &quot;metamaker&quot; has been developed for the German ETD projects and could be translated into English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. MySQL or other free software can be used as the underlying database system.


'''The Open Archives Specification: A chance for metadata interoperability'''

During the last 2 years one initiative has effected the discussions about interoperability in digital libraries and the digital lbrary community enormously.

The development of
*a protocol, that can easily be implemented at archive servers and
*a metadata set based upon the Dublin Core metadata set

Allow archives, like ETD servers, preprint archives as well as museums and other institutions to provide
their local catalogues to a worldwide community without having to implement specialised and
complicated interfaces.

So the Open Archives Framework (see http://www.openarchives.org) allow an interoperability f heterogeneous and distributed ETD archives and servers in a very low interoperability level.

For the ETD initiatives and projects the OAI compliance has to be seen as chance to connect ETD servers worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ease of distributed access accompanying the digital revolution has a darker side. Technological obsolescence and ephemeral formats have left little firm ground upon which to build the infrastructure necessary for the effective management and preservation of digital resources. An infrastructure supporting long-term access needs to be able to accommodate the continuous evolution of the technology as well as continuous streams of data. This means that a durable record of such work now includes a flexible and adaptable approach to maintaining live access.

Devices and processes used to record, store and retrieve digital information now have a life cycle of between 2 - 5 years, far less than some of the most fragile physical materials they are seeking to preserve. The practice known as 'refreshing' digital information by copying it onto new media is particularly vulnerable to problems of 'backward compatibility' and 'interoperability'. Software capable of emulating obsolete systems currently relies on the goodwill and enthusiasm of talented programmers but has little basis in economic reality.

The foundation of effective management of an ETD as digital resource occurs at the point of creation. How a digital resource is created and the form and format it is created in will determine how it can be managed, used, preserved and re-used at some future date. Authors/creators and migrators of all digital resources need to be aware of their importance to the life span or term of access of a digital resource.

Simple but practical strategies that might increase the life span of an ETD are as follows:
*do not assume any stability in hardware or software and try to record all the dependencies that support your ETD.
*Use non-proprietary formats such as (ASCII, Unicode or plain text) as much as possible (e.g. Notepad or Simple Text)
*Use widely available formats such as Word or PDF that can be easily converted into plain text
*Use widely available non-proprietary image formats such as JPEG or PNG rather than GIF (proprietary format)
*If you must use custom or proprietary software, make such you keep a record of the version number (e.g. Real Media 7) and all the hardware dependencies (e.g. MAC system 7).

This information can be stored within the metadata associated with your ETD. For example, you could use the Dublin Core metadata element, 'DC.Relation.Requires'. As technologies evolve, the use of preservation metadata to record this kind of information is increasing. Check with your library to see what standard is currently in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We believe that all universities should have ETD programs. Clearly that will be the case, when one considers the situation in the long term (e.g., 10 years). Why not join now, so that students over the next decade can benefit? Why not participate, so that the research of universities is more widely shared? Why not develop local infrastructure, so that students are properly prepared for the Information Age, save money, and save money for the university?

Training efforts should aim to make clear the benefits of working with ETDs. They should assuage concerns, and make obvious how changes can be made in a smooth transition from current practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A quite important document must be at the users' disposal together with the various tools implemented for the electronic edition of scientific documents:
*User’s guide for the preparation of the documents
*User’s guide for the conversion itself
*Pedagogical toolkit for the training of authors...

This first edition, as complete as it may be, is nevertheless insufficient. It must be completed by the online diffusion of a database listing all the problems usually encountered and their solutions (FAQ) eventually completed with links to specific documents with examples.

Most of the time, such a database cannot be a priori completely defined and will have to be enriched as the number of users grows and their mastery of the various tools increases.

The collection of the questions and problems are done very efficiently thanks to the creation of discussion lists or forums opened to the users. It is recommendable to group the frequent questions or problems by subject, to offer an easier and friendly consultation.

Then, two methods considered for the construction of the database of solutions:
*Synthesis, based on the discussion list, prepared by some &quot;experts&quot; used to supply the database with questions and answers. The information available for the users is validated.
*The content of the forum indexed directly; the information is not validated, and it is thus the users themselves who will have to make a sort in the list of answers they get for their request. If this second method is lighter in terms of administration and management, its efficiency depends on the quality of the posted messages (questions and answers): precise and clear subject, good presentation of the problem, argumentation of the answer, etc.

Whichever the adopted solution may be, its implementation may rest on usual free software classical list and database servers.

The online diffusion of the so constructed FAQ must still have the name and e-mail of a member of the technical staff or a visible link to the discussion list in order to answer the questions not taken into account in the database.

''As an example, CyberThèses proposes a forum construct with a MySql database and interfaced with Php, and will develop a second database from validated information.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many technological choices such as encoding formats, computing tools, dissemination tools, and copyrights, have an important impact on the ETD project’s success. It is necessary an overview of the different aspects of producing, disseminating, archiving theses in electronic formats, implementation and management of ETD projects.

At the present time several universities have initiated individual or cooperative projects for publishing and distributing theses, with different strategies approach : NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations) with 103 member universities, Cyberthèses (Université de Montrèal, Université de Lyon, Universidad de Chile, Université de Genève with about 10 member universities) , Digital Australian Theses Program (8 Australian universities) and Dissertationen Online (5 German universities).

      <text xml:space="preserve">An effective mechanism for providing support is to identify centers of expertise, which are prepared to assist others in setting up their ETD system. These centers of expertise can be regional, national or within an international geographic or linguistic region. The benefits flowing from these centers of expertise include assistance with designing processes, assistance with implementing software, especially if a common software product is used, assistance in use of metadata and continuing support as systems evolve. Another very important function of a center of expertise is provision of a focus around which a group can develop which can offer a self-support function and an environment taking into account local or regional conditions for continuing discussion and development of ETD programs as the technology continues to evolve. This latter is essential if ETD programs are to prosper.

The centre of expertise concept also has the great advantage of reducing significantly the learning curve in starting up an ETD program and consequently the timeframe and cost of new programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The core of the ADT Program was developed at The University of New South Wales Library (UNSW Library) as the lead institution. The team at UNSW Library included the overall coordinator &amp; designer; technical manager &amp; programmer; metadata consultant as well as the web coordinator &amp; designer. This team developed the model from the conceptual to reality. The most important thing was not to lose focus, to keep the model as close to the original project description proposal as possible and to not overly complicate processes - in fact keep them as simple as possible. It was seen as critical to develop a workable model for the project partners to test and further refine.

During the development and testing process, all 7 original partners were consulted and had input at all stages. Two workshops for all 7 members were held approximately 12 months apart. These were used to discuss all aspects of the ADT model as well as to agree on the standards and protocols used. The agreed standards are at the core of the distributed model of the ADT Program. Without the involvement of an effective team to lead the process, and the effective input of the broader team, arriving at the desired outcome would have been very difficult.

The ADT Program is now effectively working across all 7 original member sites. Membership to the ADT has now been opened up to all Australian universities. It is anticipated that all Australian universities will become members and thus form a comprehensive national program. The benefits of a broad membership team are many: shared infrastructure, shared software development, shared metadata, shared documentation and training as well the shared satisfaction that comes with effective collaboration for the common good. The membership to the ADT may in time also include others in the region such as New Zealand and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The training offered to doctoral students registered at the Université de Montréal, entitled &quot;Helpful tools for writing a thesis&quot; (''&quot;Outils d’aide à la rédaction d’une thèse&quot;''). is part of that institution’s programme for electronically distributing theses. The training seeks to respond to two sorts of needs: 1- the needs related to the processing of theses (greatly aided by the adequate use of a normalized document template); 2- the needs of the doctoral students (who want to increase their capabilities in using writing tools, and, in the process, their level of productivity and the quality of their production).

The implementation of a programme of electronic thesis distribution affects the entire institution. At the Université de Montréal, three units are actively involved: the Faculty of Graduate Studies, the Library , and the Information technology services (''Direction générale des technologies de l’information et de la communication'' -- DGTIC, which holds the mandate to process and distribute theses in electronic formats). The training of doctoral students is planned and provided by individuals drawn from these three units. In terms of the sessions held in September 2001, four people acted as trainers (one from Graduate Studies, one from the Libraries and two from the DGTIC).

The content of the training is as follows:
#Welcome and general presentation of the Programme for the electronic publication and distribution of theses (DGTIC)
#Presentation of the Université de Montréal’s Style Guide for masters and doctoral theses (Graduate Studies).
#On-campus services offered to thesis-writing students: equipment rentals, self-service digitizer, digital camera, etc. (DGTIC).
#Presentation of the capabilities of the EndNote software for managing bibliographic referencing (Library)
#Practical exercises with the Word document template to be used by the students.

Points 1 to 4 in this general plan involved presentations given by trainers, while point five directly involved participants in concrete exercises, accompanied by several demonstrations. For these exercises, the students used a working text (a Word document containing the principal editorial elements of a thesis, but without a proper layout), a Word document template developed for theses, and a list of instructions.. The exercises essentially consisted of applying the template’s styles to the working text, of producing and inserting an image captured on the screen into the text, and of automatically producing a table of contents and an index of tables.

As well, several documents were provided to participants at the sessions: the instructions, the document template (Word style sheets) as well as training guides and informative documents of interest to the students. All these documents are available on-line at www.theses.umontreal.ca.

The workshops are offered to all doctoral students, whether they are at the beginning of their research or near the end of their writing. To reach the largest possible number of students, we used a multidimensional communications plans: posters, advertising, messages to student associations, and letters from the Dean of Graduate studies to the heads of departments and research centres. The number of seats in the training laboratory is limited to 15 to 20 students per session, depending on the laboratory used. Students are invited to register in advance, either by telephoning one of the DGTIC’s administrative assistants, or, in an autonomous manner, by using an interactive Web form managed using a CGI scripts. This latter form tells students how many participants have already registered for each session and the maximum number of seats available. When the maximum number of registrations is reached, the script no longer allows registrations. Nevertheless, an invitation to register on a &quot;waiting list&quot; allows students to signal their interest and to be rapidly informed when new workshops are held. This also allowed us to note the pertinence of the training: the available spaces were quickly filled and the waiting list allowed us to reach interested students for the next sessions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Abstract:''' This section focuses on the outreach work of the Ibero-American Science &amp; Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC) and selected other organizations in developing EDT projects in Latin America. Training for librarians and for EDT trainers are described.

Many Latin American universities have digital library projects, some of which include electronic theses. However, standards and consistency may be lacking in local EDT initiatives. The Ibero-American Science &amp; Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC) and its partners have been creating learning opportunities and instigating local projects in digital libraries and EDT’s. This section describes ISTEC’s outreach process and progress in regards to EDT projects for the science and technology libraries that are members of the organization.


'''Overview of ISTEC'''

ISTEC is a non-profit organization comprised of educational, research, and industrial institutions throughout the Americas and the Iberian Peninsula. The Consortium was established in September 1990 to foster scientific, engineering, and technology education, joint international research and development efforts among its members and to provide a cost-effective vehicle for the application of technology.

With start-up funding from the State of New Mexico and selected IT companies, the ISTEC board created four initiatives to address obstacles to IT developments and to encourage IT manpower development. These are:
# The ACE Initiative champions continuing engineering and computer sciences education projects. The most important goals are to upgrade human resources and curriculum development through training and non-traditional exchange programs. The methodology involves on-site training, web-based education, video courses, satellite delivery, and &quot;sandwich&quot; graduate programs. The latter brings graduate students from Ibero-America together with experts from ISTEC member organizations to ensure excellence.
# The Research and Development (R&amp;D) Initiative focuses on the development and enhancement of laboratory infrastructure at member organizations. The major goal is the design and installation of modular, flexible, and expandable laboratory facilities for education, training, and R&amp;D with links to the private sector.
# The Los Libertadores Initiative champions networks of excellence in the region.The main goal is to network Centers of Excellence equipped with the latest telecommunications and computer technology to provide real-time access to a world-wide system of expertise and knowledge. This requires partnerships among industries and governments to create an Ibero-American academic and R&amp;D Internet backbone.
# The Library Linkages Initiative (LibLINK) is ISTEC’s information creation, management and sharing project. Below is a description of LibLINK efforts in developing digital library projects in Latin America, especially in the area of EDT’s.


'''Overview of the Library Linkages (LibLINK) project of ISTEC'''

The major goal of LibLINK is to design and implement innovative, international Science and Technology (S&amp;T) information-sharing services. The annual compound growth rate of the Rapid Document Delivery (RDD) project has been hovering around 200% since 1995. Over 27 libraries in 19 countries are connected in real-time and documents are provided using the Ariel® software. The RDD project, although the most popular service, is a foundation for the more important digital library initiatives which were started in 1998. The projects within LibLINK can be categorized as follows:
* Connecting libraries for information transfer. This is accomplished through opening S&amp;T library collections - especially Latin American collections - for scholars through regional networks created to compliment the LiBLINK document delivery services. Currently these include LigDoc in Brazil, PrEBi in Argentina, REBIDIMEX in Mexico, and most recently, a cooperative group of libraries in Colombia.
* Training librarians and researchers in digital library concepts.
* Working with the Networked Dissertation/Thesis Library (NDTL) initiative at Virginia Tech to expand the concept in Latin America. The LibLink initiative seeks to promote easy access to scientific information in the region, especially to thesis and dissertations of master's and doctoral candidates as this is our member organizations’ most important intellectual property.
* Advancing and piloting new types of scholarly communication by actively supporting new publishing efforts such as the NDLTD and the Open Archives initiatives.

LibLINK volunteers plan and carry out workshops and mini-conferences to facilitate the above. Funding generally come from grants provided by organizations such as the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other national science councils such as CONACyT in Mexico, and regional organizations such as the OAS and UNESCO.


'''LibLINK and''' ''''EDT’s in Latin America''''

We have refined a process for involving librarians and computer scientists in digital library projects that has proven successful. The principles on which ISTEC and LibLINK base their outreach efforts are:
* to establish the capacity of libraries and library staff for participating in digital projects.
* Site visits Participation in regional or local IT and computer science workshops to identify computer scientists working on digital library projects or components thereof. We are especially interested in initiatives created in isolation from each other and from their local libraries.
* In this way digital library initiatives and researchers are identified and a DL group can be established from the above findings that consist of librarians and computer scientists/engineers. Outcome: Critical mass of computer scientists and librarians linked to each other and to ISTEC.
* With this groundwork done, we plan and find funding sources for a Digital Library Workshop that generally have two major aims:
** To share information about current DL initiatives in that specific country or region
** To provide training in EDT’s as the preferred first DL project
* In some cases, this is also an opportunity to create strategic plans for coordinated national projects

This process has resulted in the following EDT and DL workshops:
* A NSF/CONACyT digital library workshop that included NDLTD training by Ed Fox, in Albuquerque, NM. Funding was obtained from various sources, mainly the National Science Foundation, CONACyT (the Mexican Science Council) and the Organization of American States. July 7-9, 1999
* A successful DL conference in Costa Rica for Central American countries (Seminario / Taller Subregional sobre Bibliotecas Digitales). A full day EDT workshop was delivered by Ed Fox, followed by a day of digital leadership training and planning for local EDT projects. Funding was provided by the Organization of American States(OAS), the US Ambassador to Costa Rica and ISTEC. San Jose, Costa Rica, November 1999 (more detail below).
* 1st Course for the Training for Project Directors for Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Projects. The course was organized by UNESCO, the VII CYTED, Universidad de los Andes, and ISTEC’s Library Linkages Initiative and held in conjunction with the VII Jornadas Iberoamericanas de Informatica, Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from August 30 to September 1, 2000. This is an example of how EDT training can be piggy-backed on a significant regional event that is synergistic and that provide more value for the money spent to attend.
* A 2nd Training Course for Directors of EDT Projects was funded by UNESCO (Montevideo), the Asociación de Universidades Grupo Montevideo (AUGM), and ISTEC. This &quot;Train the Trainer&quot; course was held in Montevideo, December 7- 9, 2000. The main goals for this series of courses are to create a group of specialists responsible for the dissemination and management of electronic dissertations and theses. The trainer for both these sessions was Ana Pavani from the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro.
* REBIDIMEX is the Mexican operations for ISTEC Library Linkages. This group has had a number of meetings to develop coordinated digital library and EDT projects in Mexico. The digital theses project at the library of the Universidad de las Américas- Puebla is an excellent example, http://biblio.udlap.mx/tesis/, and forms the basis for a national Mexican EDT project.


'''Case Study:'''

The Primer Seminario-Taller Subregional sobre Bibliotecas Digitales, sponsored by the OAS and ISTEC at the Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica, mentioned above, provides a good case study of EDT outreach events. Each participating Central American country was asked to identify universities with sufficient technological infrastructure to support a digital library/ EDT project. Then each organization was funded to send representatives from each of their computer systems and library groups. The agenda focussed on providing one whole day of basic training by Ed Fox (a co-author of this Guide) in digital library and EDT concepts, followed by another day of leadership training for digital environments and a planning session.

During this portion the groups identified a project that all could participate in. They chose the digitization of their organization’s theses and dissertations and making it available through the Open Archives system using the processes developed by Virginia Tech and others described in other sections of the Guide. Regional working groups were assigned. The most important outcomes, however, were the creation of a network of librarians and computer scientists that understand EDT technological, operational and political issues and that now have contacts for joint projects in the region.


'''What next?'''

The model of creating synergism and connections between librarians and computer scientists and focusing their energies on basic digital library/EDT projects will continue to be replicated in other parts of Latin America. Ana Pavani (a section author of the Guide) continues to deliver EDT courses with the help of ISTEC, such as one in Pernambucu, Brasil, in the spring of 2001. Members from ISTEC’s regional and executive offices regularly speak at conferences regarding EDT’s and are available to help arrange EDT events. Organizing training events and developing joint funding arrangements takes a lot of time, expertise, local contacts, and effort, but is critical for creating opportunities in under-served countries.

ISTEC and its partner organizations, the OAS, International Development Bank, UNESCO, etc., continue to work together to offer regional digital library workshops in Latin America. UNESCO is formulating an international strategy for creating and disseminating electronic theses and dissertations that will support Latin American outreach efforts (UNESCO, 1999). As well, we are assisting governments to draft suitable policies to improve access to information, especially in making their universities’ intellectual property (theses and dissertations) widely available to publicize the universities’ research strengths. ISTEC is also sponsoring the Spanish translation of the Guide and will disseminate it through the ISTEC Science &amp; Technology Portal.


'''Other Latin American Projects'''

The Latin American Network Information Center (LANIC) at the University of Texas at Austin is the most comprehensive resource for academic and economic information on Latin America (http://lanic.utexas.edu/), but not specifically for EDT projects. Some beginning and mature EDT projects can be found at:
* The Library System of the Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (Chile). http://biblioteca.ucv.cl/tesis_digitales/
* The Digital Technology Research and Development Center (CITEDI) of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Tijuana, México. http://www.citedi.net/docs/tesis.htm
* The UNESP site at the Universidade Estadual Paulista in Brazil. http://www.cgb.unesp.br/etheses/
* The digital theses project at the library of the Universidad de las Américas-Puebla, Mexico. http://biblio.udlap.mx/tesis/
* University of Antioquia (Medellin, Colombia)
* University of São Paulo (Brazil). http://www.usp.teses.br/
* In Chile the Universidad de Chile has been developing Cyberthesis, since November 1999. This is an electronic theses production project with support from Unesco and the cooperation of the Universit de Lyon and the Universit de Montreal. The Information Service and Library System, SISIB, is coordinating the Electronic Theses and Dissertations Project (Cybertesis), applying the production process developed by the Universite de Montreal, based on the conversion of texts to SGML/XML. In 2002, the Universidad de Chile will organize training workshops in the production of ETD (structured documents) for other Chilean universities.


'''Associations'''

The Transborder Library Forum/FORO Transfronterizo de Bibliotecas share many of the aims of ISTEC’s Library Linkages initiative. Their meetings have been held annually since 1991 to work on ways to improve communications relating to border issues and to foster professional networking among librarians from Mexico and the United States. Recently, Canadians and representatives from Latin American libraries also interested in NAFTA and border issues began to have a presence. At the 10th Transborder Library FORO held in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 23-25, 2000, attendance of several representatives from Latin American libraries were sponsored and ISTEC’s LibLink project provided a training session and talks about the REBIDIMEX initiative in Mexico.

The Association of Latin American and Caribbean Academic Libraries ( Bibliotecas Universitarias da America Latina e do Caribe)) sponsored a LibLINK workshop that included EDT discussions and talks at the annual meeting in Florianopolis, Brazil, in April 2000. ISTEC continues to have a presence at their conferences. And are involved with the Brazilian EDT initiatives.


'''The impact of Bandwidth and Infrastructure issues on EDT outreach in Latin America'''

Bandwidth and IT infrastructure are important factors for digital EDT project developers in Latin America. IT policy development is another. More aggressive action is needed in both the governmental and industrial sectors. ISTEC emphasize these issues at the &quot;IT Challenge&quot; conferences by bringing industrial and academic members together with regional decision makers, such as ministers of education and technology and representatives from national science councils.

The first high-performance Internet link between North and South America for research and education was inaugurated in Santiago, Chile on September 12, 2000. Chili and the USA connected their respective high performance networks, REUNA&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; and Internet2, enabling collaboration among researchers and educators at universities in the two countries. Such high-performance network links are critical to ensure the bandwidth required for future format-enriched EDT projects. ISTEC and its partners are strongly committed to advance this cause. &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Reuna is a collaboration between the National Universities of Chili that introduced the Internet in Chile in 1992. Reuna´s high-speed network, REUNA2, is an ATM network of 155 Mbps. across the country. The National University Network is a non-profit consortium of 19 leading Chilean universities plus the National Commission for Science and Technology. Its mission is the creation and development of networks and services in IT aimed at supporting participation in the Information Society.


'''Conclusion:'''

The Library Linkage initiative of ISTEC has found a methodology for encouraging and supporting EDT developments in Latin America that has proven successful. The most important step is to identify local players in digital library initiatives in both libraries and computer science and computer engineering departments. The next step then brings these players together at events that provide opportunities for training, information sharing and national/regional EDT project planning. ISTEC monitors subsequent developments and provide support to keep projects going as appropriate. The most important strategic outcome we are aiming for is to create an open archive structure that will provide access to all science and technology theses and dissertations of member organizations through the ISTEC Portal. We believe that this will be a rich source of innovation, manpower identification and development, and an opportunity to highlight the intellectual property of our member universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An effective mechanism for providing support is to identify centres of expertise which are prepared to assist others in setting up their ETD system. These centres of expertise can be regional, national or within an international geographic or linguistic region. The benefits flowing from these centres of expertise include assistance with designing processes, assistance with implementing software, especially if a common software product is being used, assistance in use of metadata and continuing support as systems evolve. Another very important function of a centre of expertise is provision of a focus around which a group can develop which can offer a self-support function and an environment taking into account local or regional conditions for continuing discussion and development of ETD programs as the technology continues to evolve. This latter is essential if ETD programs are to prosper.

The centre of expertise concept also has the great advantage of reducing significantly the learning curve in starting up an ETD program and consequently the timeframe and cost of new programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While each institution will have differences as to the way in which its procedures are implemented and ETDs presented to satisfy local needs, for the potential of optimal global dissemination of ETDs to be achieved, adherence to basic standards is essential. These standards relate to document format and settings, filename protocols and metadata. Agreement on use of a small set of standard metadata elements can facilitate harvesting for creation of collaborative databases. While individual institutions can apply additional metadata including subject or format schemas as desired, if a minimum level of metadata is established, particularly if this metadata can be automatically generated, then any institution can access the document regardless of its resources and expertise. This provides an entry point for retrieval of an ETD from any institution without compromising the ability of other institutions to provide very rich metadata for their ETDs.

Cooperation and collaboration between institutions in the creation and dissemination of ETDs has a number of benefits. From the point of view of creating ETDs, the benefits include the utilization of software and procedures developed and tested by others, sharing generic training tools, sharing of expertise in problem solving and developmental work and the provision of mutual support. In the dissemination of information about research findings contained in ETDs, collaborative approaches can be particularly effective in small or developing countries where the total volume of ETDs may not be large. In these situations a national or regional approach can provide increased visibility, economies of scale and sharing of resources required to mount and maintain ETDs.

There are a number of models for cooperation and collaboration in creation, dissemination and preservation of ETDs. While the models can vary in detail, major elements are:
*'''Shared infrastructure'''&lt;br /&gt;In this model, a central agency provides the infrastructure for publication, dissemination, maintenance and preservation of ETDs. The central agency provides the server and the network access to a central repository of ETDs. Other institutions cooperate with the central agency by supplying copies of theses or dissertations. These copies could be supplied in digital form, conforming to the basic standards, or the central agency can be responsible for ensuring a suitable digital version is created and made available. The central agency has the responsibility for maintaining archival versions. This model could operate at a supranational, national or regional level, or could be used by a group of universities with similar interests.
*'''Shared software development'''&lt;br /&gt;Sharing of generic software, which is easily installed and maintained, can be a cost effective way of establishing an ETD program. This can be of particular benefit for institutions where staff with highly developed IT skills are in short supply. Collaborative development or modification of new versions of software can also be very cost-effective.
*'''Shared metadata'''&lt;br /&gt;In this model, institutions publish and maintain digital theses on their own institutional servers but the metadata is harvested to produce a central database of details of the theses from the collaborating institutions. The metadata is linked to the full text of the ETD wherever it resides. The home institution retains the responsibility for the preservation of the ETD.
*'''Shared documentation and training tools'''&lt;br /&gt;Sharing of detailed documentation on all aspects of operating an ETD program is a very cost effective method of collaboration. The development of generic procedures and training programs, which can be customized for local conditions, can facilitate the participation of institutions in an ETD program. Sharing of documentation is also likely to reinforce the use of standards, which will ensure the ETDs are readily discoverable

      <text xml:space="preserve">By the end of 2007, the number of universities involved in NDLTD was well over 100. Scores of other 
universities were considering work with ETDs, and hundreds of universities were aware of the concept. 
NDLTD hopes that forthwith there will be ETD efforts in every country and then in every state/province, 
eventually in every leading university, soon serving every language group, and ultimately in every 
college and university. Since NDLTD aims to help, and there are no costs to join, it is hoped that 
membership will rise to closely match the number that are interested in ETDs. 
 
It is not clear why any university should not become involved in ETD efforts.  Once an ETD program on 
a campus has evolved to the point that ETD submission is a requirement, the effort saves money for the 
university as well as the students, while providing many important benefits. And, reaching such a point is 
not hard, if there is a local team, with effective leadership, that has a clear understanding of ETDs and 
what is occurring elsewhere in terms of support, cooperation, and collaborative efforts. 
 
This section of the Guide explains why and how universities can establish ETD programs, and helps 
those involved in an ETD program to address concerns and problems that may be voiced.  It appears on 
the one hand that an ETD program has the healthy effect of helping a university to engage in a rich 
dialog on a wide variety of issues related to scholarly communication. This is important, since we are in 
the midst of a revolution in these processes, and both students and players must be aware of the situation 
if they are to manage effectively (and economically, while working in accord with the core values of 
scholars). On the other hand, ETD efforts have advanced to the point that proceeding with an ETD 
program, while not as &quot;sexy&quot; as some of the more vigorously funded digital library efforts, does work 
well, providing real solutions to real concerns, leading to sustainable and beneficial practices. In short, 
launching an ETD program is a &quot;no brainer&quot; that can quickly advance almost any university to the happy 
position of having an effective and economical digital library initiative in place, which also can serve as a 
model for other efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I shall consider assessment to include the gathering of information concerning the functioning of 
students, staff, and institutions of higher education.  The information may or may not be in numerical 
form, but the basic motive for gathering it is to improve the functioning of the institution and its people.   
I used functioning to refer to the broad social purposes of a college or university: to facilitate student 
learning and development, to advance the frontiers of knowledge, and to contribute to the community, 
and the society. 

&lt;center&gt;''(Alexander W.  Astin, Assessment for Excellence, 1991, p. 2)''&lt;/center&gt;
 

Electronic theses and dissertations are not only products of student research, but also marks of the 
students’ preparation to become scholars in the information society. In pursuit of this broader social 
purpose, this section of the Guide focuses on two separate but related topics: assessment and 
measurement. Both are important components of an institutional ETD program. The role of assessment in 
an ETD program is to understand whether the goals and objectives of the program are being met, while 
issues of measurement focus on the production and use of an institution’s ETDs. 
 
Assessment of a program’s goals and objectives yields information that may be of great value to 
policymakers and administrators. Higher education institutions are increasingly asked by their boards, by 
state legislators, and by federal government agencies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their programs, 
which has led to the development of many assessment programs on campuses.  Assessment is often used 
to provide trend data or to assist in resource allocation, with data helping to make a case for the viability 
of an ETD program or to determine which parts of the program require the most (or least) resources. 
Ideally, an ETD assessment program will have ties to overall campus assessment activities. 

However, whether or not accountability to administration or government is a driving factor in developing 
assessment for an ETD program, any new effort can benefit from a systematic way of measuring what it 
is achieving. Such measures as the number of ETDs produced at an institution each year or the number of 
times a dissertation has been downloaded from the institution’s web site are frequently cited to 
demonstrate the success of an ETD program. 
 

The goals of this section of the Guide are: 
 
1.      to encourage those involved in developing and implementing ETD programs to think at early 
stages about broad questions of assessment, and 
 
2.      to familiarize individuals working on measurement of ETDs with developing national and 
international initiatives that are developing standard ways of measuring the use of electronic 
information resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The estimated cost of a project to electronically produce and distribute theses 
varies based on a number of factors such as:  the expertise and competence of 
your team; the technology used; the volume of documents to process; and the cost 
of living in your country (human resources, computer equipment, 
communications, etc.).  In these circumstances, it is impossible to provide any 
budgetary estimates, at least without knowing the operating conditions and 
elements of a particular situation.  Giving an estimate, even in the broad sense of 
an order of magnitude, would be of no use.  Nonetheless, this section will allow 
you to determine your expenditure budget by providing a list of budgetary items 
that must be foreseen. 

The expenditure budget of an electronic theses project involves four principal 
modules.  These are:  the start-up; the implementation of thesis production and 
distribution services; communications; and student training. 


== Start-up ==

Start-up costs are related to what you require to begin a project to electronically 
produce and distribute theses.  Besides the personnel, who constitute the most 
important element in any electronic thesis distribution project, the start-up costs 
principally relate to infrastructure and training.  Since the network infrastructure 
is usually provided by the host institution, this expense is omitted from the 
following table. 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

! Human Resources

|-

| Professionals

| 
*Adoption/creation of a procedure for processing theses
*Development of tools, programmes and scripts 
*The number of professionals required is linked to the volume of theses to be processed and to the variety of disciplines taught at your institution 

|-

| Technicians

| 
*Production of theses, assisting students, and routine tasks 
* The number of technicians required is linked to the volume of theses to be processed

|-

| Management

| 
*Supervision 
*Communication with the university’s administration, and with external partners 
*Day-to-day management

|-

! Infrastructure

|-

| Server 

| 
*Materials (the actual server, UPS, back-up unit, etc.) 
*Software (operating system, search tool, etc.) 

|-

| Server site

| 
*This is usually provided by the University

|-

| Computer equipment for processing and for management

| 
*Materials (PC, printer, etc.) for all members of the team
*A workstation (PC) to test different software and to receive students’ files (by ftp) in a secure manner 
*Software chosen to suit the chosen technology and assembly line (Office suite, Adobe, XML software, HTML editor, etc.) 

|-

!Training

|-

| Training team members

| 
*Organized training or self-instruction 
*Manuals and documentation

|}
&lt;center&gt;''Table 1– Start-up for an electronic thesis production and distribution project''&lt;/center&gt;


== Implementation of production and distribution services ==

The resources required to create an assembly line for producing theses are related 
to the technologies used as well as the expertise and experience of team 
members.  For instance, the choice to create valid XML documents from the files 
submitted by students, even if many useful XML tools are now available at 
reasonable prices, necessarily implies larger investments.  Nonetheless, it is 
important to remember that more costly technological solutions may provide 
significant benefits to other electronic publication projects within the same 
institution.  For instance, they might be useful for publishing electronic journals 
or for digitizing other types of collections.  Table XXX lists the general stages 
needing attention when establishing a budget, regardless of the technologies 
chosen.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

! Implementing production and distribution services

|-

| Production

| 
*Analysis of needs 
*Choice of a metadata model (including a permanent referencing system) 
*Integration of the metadata creation or generation process 
*Testing different software 
*Planning and testing of the production assembly line 
*Creation or adoption of a follow-up tool for production work 
*Formal implementation of the service 

|-

| Distribution

| 
*Install and set parameters for the search tool (full-text and metadata) 
*Create and manage the Web site 
*Create the site’s architecture 
**Compose the site’s information and home page 
**Conceive and create the site’s graphic signature 
**Create the navigation interface 
*Ensure Web referencing (Web search tools, indexes, other ETD sites, etc.). 
*Create mechanisms for managing access 
*Install a tool to measure visits to, and usage of, the site 

|}
''Table 2 – Implementing production and distribution services''


== Communication ==

The communications plan often makes the difference between successful projects 
and aborted ones.  A communications plan must be drafted when the technical 
processes are in place and the university’s governors approve the project.  
Worktime and other resources must be budgeted for the creation and 
implementation of a communications plan.  The principal tasks usually required 
to this end are listed in Table XXX.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;

|-

! Communication Plan

|-

| Human Resources

| 
*Drafting the Communications plan
*Organizing and holding information sessions with the university’s professors, researchers and students 
*Writing the content of information documents 
*Meeting with journalists from the university or from the city’s newspapers.

|-

| Tools for communicating and promoting the project

| 
*Posters, brochures and other documents
*E-mails to professors and students
*Putting information on-line on the project’s Website

|}
''Table 3 – Communication Plan''



== Training Students ==
 

Distributing theses on the Web is in itself an effective means of valuing an 
institution’s students and research.  Nevertheless, emphasis must be placed on 
training students so that they can master the tools of document creation that allow 
them to circulate their research results.  The use of new information technologies 
has become essential for university studies.  Whether it involves searching 
databases and the Internet, or using software to help manage and assess data and 
present findings, the ability to work easily with these tools will be of daily use for 
students throughout their future careers.  Many universities undertaking electronic 
theses projects have uncovered serious skills gaps in terms of creating tables, of 
integrating figures and images, and of using functions that automatically generate 
tables of contents or lists.  It is clear that basic training must be offered to better 
prepare students for the process of writing important documents like theses. 

Student training must be offered through many forms such as workshops, on-line 
tutorials and personal consultations.  One can decide to offer one or another or all 
of these forms of training.  In many institutions, the preparation and offer of 
training to students results from the collaboration of many different units:  the 
faculty of graduate studies, the libraries and the information technologies 
services.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evaluation of Costs at Virginia Tech''' 
 
Libraries usually have some of the infrastructure already in place to handle ETDs, especially if they are 
already providing access to electronic journals or digital images. However, many administrators like to 
have data about costs associated with an initial budget, and for this reason the following costs for 
personnel, hardware, and software were established by Virginia Tech’s Digital Library and Archives. 
Keep in mind that existing personnel and hardware can be commandeered for the ETD prototype and that 
frequently software is available on the Internet as shareware. This is how the Virginia Tech initiative 
began in 1995 and continued into the first year of required ETDs, 1997. 
 
[taken from http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/data/setup.html] 
 
These estimates assume that the university/library would adapt existing programs, scripts, Web pages, software, etc. that has been developed by the VT ETD Team. No additional equipment, software, or staff was necessary for the VT library to begin or to maintain the ETD system and services.


$24,000	     STAFF

$13,500	     EQUIPMENT

$12,000	     SOFTWARE

&lt;nowiki&gt;================&lt;/nowiki&gt;

$49,500      TOTAL


The estimated costs below show that for about $49,500 a library could replicate the Scholarly Communications Project ETD library if it adapts what VT has already developed for the NDLTD. If another university/library must also provide support to students like the New Media Center does, then the costs are greater for training, equipment and software.


'''STAFFING: $24,000'''

System's Administrator: .25 FTE at $6000-$6,600/yr

In Virginia, pay band 5: $30,000/annual; $14/hr
We estimate the our Sys Admin spends .5 - 1 hr/day during non-peak times on maintenance and development. During peak periods he may spend 8 hrs/day on problems, development, and system improvements.

Student assistant: .25 FTE at $2900.00-$4500.00/yr

*knowledge of pdf and html desirable; train to use ftp and telnet if necessary
*desirable: programming experience.
*salary depending on skill level at VT would be $6.00 - $10.00/hr

We estimate that our student (who knows programming) spends a maximum of 2 hrs/wk during non-peak times, and up to 10 hrs/wk during the periodic peaks.

Faculty liaison: .25 FTE @ $50,000 = $12,500

*Supervise staff; draft policies; prepare budgets; collaborate with system maintenance and developers; monitor workflow.
*Work with faculty, staff, students, departments, colleges to become familiar with the processing, accessing, and archiving of ETDs.
*Conduct workshops, write articles, participate in graduate student seminars, prepare handouts and Web pages. collaborate with other universities and libraries.


'''EQUIPMENT--SERVING ETDS: $13,5000'''

server: $5,000
dual 3 GHZ processor, 2gb RAM,  at least 20 to 80 GB hard drive

Originally, we did not purchase special equipment for ETDs, but incorporated this additional responsibility into the original server, a NeXt3.3 running HP. In Sept. 1997 we purchased a Sun Netra.  
tape drive for back-ups : $3500 ( At VT we use our Computing Center's backup service)

increase of 4-5 Gb disk space per year   Each ETD requires an average of 4.5Mb

2 workstations : $5,000


'''SOFTWARE--SERVING ETDS: $250-$12,000'''

$50	Red Hat 3 advanced Server (free download for software and $50 education entitlement cost)

$10,000	InfoSeek

$1000/yr	Server Equipment Maintenance fee

$40 x 2	Acrobat*

$50 x 2	Word Processor*

$150 x 2	Photoshop* * Educational pricing available for this software

At VT we have a New Media Center with staff, software, and equipment that can help students with every stage of ETD preparation and submission. If you don't have such a facility, consider:


''STUDENT SUPPORT: EQUIPMENT''

$1000	Desktop with monitor; CD-RW/DVD; (internet access)

$150	scanner

$3000	2 printers: LaserJet and ColorPrinter

$300	digital camera


''STUDENT SUPPORT: SOFTWARE''

$40 x 2	Acrobat*

$50 x 2	Word Processor*

$150 x 2	Photoshop* * Educational pricing available for this software


''STUDENT SUPPORT: STAFF''

*Training and assistance for equipment and software
*Maintenance of training materials: Web pages: instructions and handouts


''Cataloging Costs'' 

These may not change from the costs of cataloging traditional theses and dissertations. One advantage is 
that for the same costs, more information can easily be added to the bibliographic record because of the 
ease of copy-and-paste features of word processors. For example, include the abstract in online catalog 
records for ETDs and index this MARC field to enhance findings through keyword searching. Another 
advantage of ETDs is that there are no longer the fees associated with binding, security stripping, 
labeling, shelving ($.10/vol. estimated), circulating ($.07/vol. estimated), etc. The Virginia Tech Library 
saved about 66% of the processing costs because of the greatly reduced handling of ETDs; costs dropped 
from $12 per TD to $3.20 per ETD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ADT Program has developed a simple e-commerce option for members to use should they choose. 
The file format for the ADT is to always include a front.pdf file. This file contains author, title, abstract, 
contents pages, acknowledgements, etc. It is designed to give an expanded view of the theses' contents 
before deciding to view the whole thesis. Viewing the whole thesis can then either be unrestricted and 
free or at cost using the local institution's online payment system. Currently no members of the ADT have 
used this option.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://www.cni.org Coalition for Networked Information (CNI)] sponsored a 
project, [http://www.cni.org/projects/assessing “Assessing the Academic Networked Environment,”] 
in which institutional teams developed and implemented 
assessment projects related to a variety of areas, including 
teaching and learning, electronic reserves, computer skills, and 
electronic library resources. From the project reports and informal 
feedback from the participants, CNI developed a set of guidelines 
for institutions engaging in assessment activities related to 
networks or networked information. The guidelines focus on the 
process of doing assessment in higher education. The suggestions 
can be applied directly to assessment projects for ETDs. 
 
*Bring together an assessment team of individuals from various units on campus that can add useful perspectives and expertise; include, if possible, someone who specializes in assessment. 
*Align the overall goals of the assessment initiative with the institution’s goals and priorities. 
*Gain support from the administration at as many levels as possible. 
*Make a realistic determination of the resources (staff, time, equipment, and money) that are available for the assessment. 
*Choose a manageable portion of the assessment project as the first implementation. Do not attempt to do a comprehensive assessment of campus networking on the first try. 
*Consider using more than one assessment technique to measure the aspect of networking that you have chosen; particularly consider combining quantitative and qualitative approaches as complementary techniques. 
*Identify carefully who are the audiences for the assessment reports. 
*Examine what you might do with the information you collect, including improving services, seeking additional funding and determine whether your data will provide what you need for that objective. 
*Refine assessment instruments on a periodic basis and incrementally add new components. 
*Monitor the work of national groups such as [http://www.arl.org ARL], [http://www.educause.edu EDUCAUSE], [http://www.cni.org CNI], and the [http://www.tltgroup.org/flashlightP.htm Flashlight Project] to see whether materials they develop and guidelines they produce can provide a framework for your project.

      <comment>[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], typos fixed: commited → committed, etc; → etc.; using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Some points must be considered before starting an ETD program 
because they impact on: 
 
*        The stage where the project starts; 
*        The type of training to be provided; 
*        The technology to be adopted; 
*        The personnel to be hired, if needed; 
*        The time frame for the program to be operative; 
*        The total cost of implementation. 
 
The team implementing the ETD program must be aware that decisions 
must be made based on legislation, culture, financial conditions, 
infrastruture and political aspects of their area. So, they must be 
prepared to analyze the important issues, suggest solutions and have 
them approved by the propoer authorities. Only when these aspects are 
considered can the program start. 

Many of the following points may not apply to developed nations but 
can be crucial to developing countries. 



'''The points are grouped into four categories:'''

Analysis of the stage of the automation of the library system: 

*Is there an OPAC?  
*Does it support the MARC format? 
*Does it support digital objects? What types? Can the  contents of objects be searched? 
*Does it have a Web interface? 
*Is it compliant with Protocol Z39.50? 
*Is there a project to automate the catalog? Does the  system to be used support the MARC format? What is  the time frame for the catalog to be automated?
*Can the system to be used can hold a digital library (types of digital objects, Web interface, Z39.50)? 
*Number of TDs per year and to date (both on paper and on digital files): 


Per year - this number is important because it influences: 

*The number of persons in the help desk; 
*The decision on how to start - by some areas to proof concept or all programs; 
*The planning of the growth of infrastructure/equipment. 


To date - this number is important because it influences: 

*The decision to make the retrospective capture in some areas and/or dates or all TDs; 
*The decision to use scanner + OCR in some areas and/or dates or all TDs (on paper);
*The planning of the types and numbers of equipment;   
*The planning of the team;   
*The planning of the growth of infrastructure/equipment. 


Format presentation of TDs: 

*One or many formats? The number of DTDs, templates and viewing filters depends on this; 
*Is an update of format needed or desired? The process must be defined - topdown, consensus, etc.; 
*Is there legislation to comply with? 


Authors' rights and publishing conditions: 

*Is there legislation to comply with? 
*Is a document of authorization required? If so, define terms and approve with legal department; 
*Establish conditions? For black out period, for on campus publishing only, for partial publishing, etc.


The width of the scope of the topics above shows that an ETD program involves many areas of the universisty and all of them must be committed to it. After these points have been addressed, the project of the ETD program may begin. 

An ETD program, like any other project, requires that the roles of each player be well defined. All the people involved must be aware of the importance of their work individually and of the interaction that 
makes up a team. There must be a commitment in all levels, from the highest administration to the graduate students. 



'''In terms of the university, the 3 main players are:'''

*The Graduate Office
*The IT/Computer Group
*The Library



'''They will lead the university in deciding upon:'''

*The formats for ETDs; 

*The way to deal with authors' rights and publishing procedures; 

*The workflow for the new dissertations; 

*The strategy and workflow for retrospective capture; 

*The style sheets and filters for visualization; 

*The preservation format(s) and procedures; 

*The digital library system to be used; 

*The identification of the digital documents; 

*The relation of the ETD digital library with legacy systems (library, administrative, etc.); 

*The support team to be used; 

*The training program. 



'''At the beginning of the project, they must have the support of the highest administration to:'''

*Change the TDs’ formats, if necessary; 

*Change the culture of mentors, students and administrative staff; 

*Solve the problems related to authors' rights; 

*Assure preservation and information security of the digital collection (ETD); 

*Make sure funds are provided for equipment (HW &amp; SW), personnel and training programs. 



A good way to start the discussion in the university is by writing a pre- 
project to be submitted by the 3 players to the high administrative officers. 
The main topics of the pre-project should include but not be limited to:
*        The objectives: 
*        Main objective 
*        Secondary objectives 
*        The benefits to: 
*        Students 
*        The institution 
*        The region/country/society 
*        The characteristics of the ETD program and of digital library: 
*        Functional characteristics 
*        Technical characteristics 
*        The results to be achieved  
*        A brief and focused description of the program and the project 
*        A description of the main steps of the project 
*        An estimate of the resources (human and material) needed to implement the program 
*        An estimate of the annual resources (human and material) needed to keep the program in operation 
*        An estimate of the time frame to implement each step of the project and to have the program operable 
*        The commitment, responsibilities and actions of each participant involved 
*        The relation of the program to other programs in: 
*        The national scenario 
*        The international scenario 
 

The writing of this pre-project will help the team organize and 
ascertain everyone’s involvement. In addition, the higher 
administration will be able to decide based on more reliable 
information, increasing the degree of commitment of all involved in 
the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While each university’s situation with regard to personnel will vary, it has been shown that ETD 
programs do not require a large contingency of expert professionals to initiate the program or to maintain 
it. With a portion of the time of one librarian and one programmer, the Virginia Tech library established 
the ETD Web site and documented the sequence of events that lead to the computer programs for each 
stage of acceptance, storage, and access, and implemented the procedures for the university. 

One step that should not be overlooked is to involve every person that had a role in traditional theses and 
dissertation handling. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to. 

*Graduate School personnel who, for example, receive the TDs as well as the various forms and payments, and who may be responsible for approving the final document 

*Library personnel such as the University Archivist, reference librarian, cataloging librarian, binding clerk, and business services personnel who, for example, are responsible for the long term preservation and access as well as those responsible for processing the microfilming invoices 


'''LIBRARY STAFFING: programmer, student assistant, faculty liaison''' 

A programmer may spend one-half to one hour per day during non-peak periods on maintenance and 
development. During peak periods this person may spend eight hours per day on problems, development, 
and system improvements. 

One or two student assistants are helpful. One student who knows programming may spend a maximum 
of two hours per week during non-peak times, and up to ten hours per during the periodic 
submission/approval peaks. Another student assistant would work face-to-face with graduate student 
authors to train them and to provide assistance with word processing and PDF software. This assistant 
might also maintain the training materials, handouts, and Web pages, including instructions for preparing 
and submitting ETDs. 

A faculty member from the library would supervise staff; draft policies; prepare budgets; collaborate 
with system maintenance and developers; and monitor workflow. This person would also be a liaison to 
faculty, staff, students, departments, and colleges to help them to become familiar with the processing, 
accessing, and archiving of ETDs. The faculty liaison from the library would also conduct workshops, 
write articles, participate in graduate student seminars, prepare handouts and Web pages, as well as 
collaborate with other universities and libraries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whether an author is creating an electronic or paper thesis or dissertation, it does not change their rights 
and obligations under the law. While university policies vary, it is the custom that the person who creates 
a work is the owner of the copyright. Therefore, the author of an electronic thesis or dissertation is the 
copyright holder and owns the intellectual property, their ETD. Within the United States, authors have 
rights protected by law particularly US Code, Title 17, especially section 106. Authors get to decide how 
their works will be reproduced, modified, distributed, performed in public and displayed in public. An 
author may use another’s work with certain restrictions known as “fair use” (US Code, Title 17, sect. 
107). The four factors of fair use that must be considered equally are: (1) purpose and character of use; 
(2) nature of the copyrighted work; amount and substantiality; and (4) effect. In the United States, 
libraries are also considered in the same copyright law under section 108. [For further explanations, see 
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/ch1.html] 
  
The owner of an ETD, as explained above usually the student, must take direct action if an ETD service 
is to be provided.  The wording that is agreed to in writing, by student authors as well as the faculty 
working with them, must make clear how ETDs are handled. The wording used at Virginia Tech is one 
model.  In the approval form used for this purpose, the following is agreed: 
 
The student certifies that the work submitted is the one approved by the faculty they work with. The university is given authority, directly or through third party agents, to archive the work and to 
make it accessible, in accord with any access restrictions also specified on the form.  This right is in 
perpetuity, and in all forms and technologies that may apply.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Another important type of post-processing is the extraction of statistical information from metadata sets. 
For administrative purposes, institutions may be interested in the number of ETDs supervised by each 
professor, the keywords most used, the month(s) in which more ETDs are submitted, etc. Usually, 
relevant metadata are extracted from the ETD database and processed using specialized tools like 
Microsoft Excel. The access to the database can be done using either ODBC drivers or specialized 
middleware utilities. 
 
For a broad view of ''counting information'', two projects are widely regarded as providing interesting 
models and data. 
                                     
*Peter Lyman and Hal R. Varian’s [http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003 How Much Information] project at the University of California, Berkeley is an attempt to measure how much information is produced in the world each year. 
*The [http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/archive/wcp OCLC Web Characterization Project] conducts an annual web sample of publicly available web sites to analyze trends in the size and content of the web. 

Some programs that provide guidance or models for ''collecting institutional data in higher education'' are 
also available.  These projects can provide definitions for data, survey questions, and descriptions of data 
collection that can be adapted for one’s own institution. 

*K. C. Green has been conducting the [http://www.campuscomputing.net Campus Computing Project] since 1990. His work charts the increasing use of technology on campuses. 
*The TLT Group’s [http://www.tltgroup.org/flashlightP.htm Flashlight Program], under the direction of Steve Ehrmann, has developed a subscription-based tool kit that provides a large, structured set of assessment techniques and data collection models that can be adapted by individual campuses that want to study and improve the educational uses of technology.  The Flashlight Program web site also includes valuable overviews of assessment issues and provides advice on deciding what to assess and how to develop questions. 
*The Coalition for Networked Information’s [http://www.cni.org/projects/assessing Assessing the Academic Networked Environment] project provides case studies of campuses that implemented assessment projects. 
*One of the participants in the CNI project, the University of Washington, has a rich set of assessment instruments and reports on its web site, [http://www.lib.washington.edu UW Libraries Assessment].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In addition to assessing some of the programmatic goals of the 
ETD program, institutions will want to have some basic assessment 
measures in place to document the production and use of their 
ETDs. The work done at Virginia Tech’s [http://etd.vt.edu Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Initiative] can provide a model for other institutions. Using 
web statistics reporting software, Virginia Tech monitors a number 
of measures for their ETDs, including: 
 
*the availability of campus ETDs 
*multimedia in ETDs 
*which domains within the United States and abroad are requesting ETDs 
*requests for PDF and HTML files 
*distinct files requested 
*distinct hosts served 
*average data transferred daily 
 
In compiling its counts, Virginia Tech eliminates everyone working 
on ETDs at the institution, including the Graduate School. They try 
to eliminate repetitive activity from robots and other sources of that 
type as well. Virginia Tech is also working on the compilation of an 
international count of ETDs produced in universities. 
 
Institutions must decide whether they will report their ETD 
collections and usage separately, in conjunction with other campus 
web site usage, or in conjunction with other electronic resources 
managed by the library. Now, when practices and standards for 
gathering these statistics are evolving, institutions may need to 
collect the information and report it in conjunction with more than 
one type of related collection. In any case, institutions should keep 
abreast of national and international initiatives that are seeking to 
define and standardize statistical reporting of the number and use 
of electronic information resources. 
 
Several projects currently focus on collection of statistics related to 
information resources: 

*The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) collects statistics from libraries of large research universities in North America and has been working on several initiatives that explore data collection related to digital information. In particular, one of its [http://www.arl.org/stats/initiatives New Measures] initiatives, the [http://www.arl.org/stats/initiatives/emetrics/index.shtml E-Metrics Project], is recommending a particular set of measures and defining their collection. 

*The International Coalition of Library Consortia’s (ICOLC) has created [http://www.library.yale.edu/consortia/webstats.html Guidelines for Statistical Measures of Usage of Web-Based Indexed, Abstracted, and Full-Text Resources]. They encourage vendors of electronic information products to build into their software statistical report generation that will meet the ICOLC Guidelines, promoting comparability of products. 

*In Europe, the [http://equinox.dcu.ie EQUINOX Project], funded under the Telematics for Libraries Programme of the European Commission, addresses the need to develop methods for measuring performance in the electronic environment within a framework of quality management. Their products include a consolidated list of data sets and definitions of terms. 

*[http://web.syr.edu/~jryan/infopro/stats.html Library Statistics and Measures], a web site maintained by Joe Ryan of Syracuse University, also provides a useful set of links to resources on library statistics and measures. 
 
Another important type of post-processing is the extraction of 
statistical information from metadata sets. For administrative 
purposes, institutions may be interested in the number of ETDs 
supervised by each professor, the keywords most used , the 
month(s) in which more ETDs are submitted, etc. Usually, relevant 
metadata are extracted from the ETD database and processed 
using specialized tools like Microsoft Excel. The access to the 
database can be done using either ODBC drivers or specialized 
middleware utilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In France, policies concerning the electronic distribution of theses 
derive from two different sources:    
 
*the public power, represented by the Ministry of Higher Education which, through the intermediaries of the Research Division (Direction de la Recherche) and the Library Division (Direction des Bibliothèques), has to date held the responsibility for the description and physical archiving of  theses. 
*the university establishments possessing the ability to grant doctorates, be they universities or the major schools. 
 

The regulatory framework was set by decree on 25 September, 1985.  The decree laid out the procedures 
for the submission, description and reproduction of theses or other works presented to obtain a doctorate.
The current initiatives for the electronic distribution of theses are numerous and extremely varied, as 
much in their technical details as in their political ones.  Over the past several months, there has been a 
tendency towards the coordination and grouping of initiatives.  This has involved the creation of linkages 
and networks around establishments that have instituted technical archiving and distribution solutions. 
 

The French system is currently structured on three levels: 
 
*A local level, based on the initiatives of certain producer institutions 
*A regional level, where a number of research institutions have aggregated at a regional or thematic level 
*A national level, based on the creation of a ministerial working group, following a circulated letter written by the Minister in October 2000.  This working group must define a new regulatory framework. 
 
 
'''''The Local Level:  the policy for the electronic distribution of theses at the Université Lumière Lyon2'''''

The basic principle of the programme for the electronic distribution of theses, which was developed by 
the Université Lyon2 in partnership with the Université de Montréal, is to employ standardized formats 
which provide the conditions for perennial archiving and which permit distribution that guarantees 
effective and total interoperability.  In most cases this involves formatting, so as to structure all the 
documents.  This formatting is performed with computerized tools, and is necessary for widescale 
distribution over the internet. 
he Université Lumière Lyon2 changed the conditions for the electronic production, submission and 
distribution of theses when it introduced its Thesis Charter.  This Charter spells out official conditions 
doctoral students must accept.  In return, the students can receive supervision and training in the use of 
text processing tools within their research group. 
 
This document guarantees the University’s commitment to support young scholars, so that they benefit 
from the best conditions for creating, archiving and distributing their work when defending their thesis 
and after. 
 

The UNIVERSITÉ DE LUMIÈRE LYON2’s THESIS CHARTER 
 
The Université de Lumière Lyon2’s Thesis Charter is proposed in conformity with the decree of 3 
September 1998.  Its preamble restates the appendix of this decree (Model Charter) and fills out the text 
with the following conditions: 
 
1) Every thesis is prepared within a research group linked to a Doctoral School.  The doctoral school’s 
particular role is: 

:a)  to give a student applying for admission to the doctorate all pertinent information on the following two subjects:  first, the functioning of doctoral studies, the research supervisors and pertinent teams for his/her project as well as the follow-up he/she can expect; and second, the possibility for student aid, scholarships, bursaries, and partnerships with a company likely to provide him/her with the means to completer his/her project; 
 
:b) to approve the agreement between the student and the supervisor for the preparation of a thesis; 

:c) to coordinate the academic training dispensed in order to obtain the DEA as well as during the years of doctoral studies; 

:d) to offer doctoral students a larger academic environment than their thesis specialization, for instance by organizing transversal seminars, methodology courses, exchanges with other laboratories (especially European ones), by favoring discussion forums, and by making all useful documents available on a server, etc...; 
 
:e) to consult annually with the thesis supervisor about the progress of work and to give an assessment of exemptions from extensions.  The thesis supervisor’s follow-up, like that of the doctoral school’s director, can be conducted by e-mail when the student in undertaking activities far from the university; 
 
:f) to inform doctoral students about the question of professional insertion throughout their doctoral studies, notably by organizing internships and information sessions with professionals, but also by organizing where possible a course of study involving rotation, with periods in firms, in national education etc.; 
 
:g) to track this insertion after the thesis defense or after a post-doctoral period in an external laboratory. 
 

2)  A doctoral thesis is a contribution to the knowledge produced within a research team.  In order to 
ensure the best possible distribution of these contributions within the scientific community, the 
University recommends that doctoral students prepare their thesis using a computer.  To this end, it 
provides training courses for doctoral students to help them with the composition of their thesis:  word 
processing, use of style sheets, software tools necessary for their project, formal structuration etc.  The 
research teams and/or the Research Division at the SIR (Computer Research Support) provide doctoral 
students with workstations.  Except in exceptional cases, they must submit their thesis in computerized 
form, from which they have produced printed copies.  The SCD (Common Documentation Service) 
ensures the respect for the norms of indexation and more generally for the recommendations of the 
ABES (Higher Education Bibliographic Agency). 


3)  A thesis is accessible:

:a) at the SCD, under the conditions set out by the decree of 25 September 1985 that applies Law no. 84-52 of 26 January 1984; 
 
:b) from the University’s server, once the author and the jury have agreed to its electronic distribution. 
 
The rules of usage concerning the necessity of the jury’s authorization before distribution and the 
confidentiality clauses that can apply to parts of the thesis, apply to the electronic version in the same 
manner as they do to the paper version. 
 

4)  Doctoral students are represented on the scientific committee of each doctoral school.  In the case of 
conflict between a student and his/her thesis supervisor, the Director of the thesis school plays the role of 
the first mediator foreseen by the Model Charter.  If the conflict persists, the President must ask the 
Scientific Council to nominate a mediator from outside the doctoral school and/or the Establishment.  
The mediator reports to the President, who is the arbiter of last instance.  In the case of joint supervision, 
the Director of the doctoral school plays the role of mediator for all conflicts between the student and the 
French thesis supervisor, or between the two thesis supervisors.  If the conflict persists, the Presidents of 
the two universities will decide in the last instance.  When the Director of the doctoral school is also the 
thesis supervisor, he or she is replaced in the role of mediator by the vice president in charge of research. 
 

5)  The doctoral schools have the responsibility for distributing this charter to the DEA and doctoral 
students under their supervision. 


'''Approved unanimously by the Scientific Council of 7 December 1998 '''

The Edition Electronique de SeNTIERS cell is responsible for the electronic archiving and distribution of 
theses defended at Lyon 2.  In this role, the cell is involved in the legal deposit of the thesis.  With time, 
the legal deposit of paper copies, as in current practice, is likely to fall out of use.  This will imply 
relatively significant changes in the mode of producing documents.  As well, in order to allow doctoral 
students to pursue their work without too many perturbations, two systems for submission coexist at 
Lyon 2:  '''electronic submission''' and '''mixed submission.''' 


'''Organization of the thesis’ administrative circuit'''

The establishment of an electronic archiving and distribution system assumes that the administration 
possesses an electronic version of the research work;  this translates into the creation of a mode of thesis 
submission that includes an electronic submission. 
 
Electronic submission should be organized in an automatic fashion, on a server able to support anywhere 
between a mailbox-type submission system to a more complete system permitting the recording of the 
submission, of metadata, etc. 
 
This submission will naturally be integrated within the traditional administrative circuit of the thesis and 
can take several forms (independently of the software used or the discipline in question): 
 
*the mixed submission, 
 
*the electronic submission. 


'''The mixed submission''' 
 
This form of submission should be seen as a step towards the completely electronic submission, but it is 
also a satisfactory solution for establishments lacking the infrastructure and personnel needed for 
electronic submission. 
 
 
'''The organization of the system''' 
 
It is organized in several stages: 
 
1)     The student submits paper copies and an electronic copy at the thesis service, and attests to the 
conformity of the two versions.  At this point, he/she authorizes (or refuses) the distribution of this work 
on the Internet. 
2)     The electronic publishing service validates the submission.  It is a question of verifying the 
readability of the files, the presence or absence of particular characters, as well as the presence in 
electronic or paper form of all the non-textual elements (images, sounds,...). 
3)     After the defense, one of the following cases is likely: 

*the jury authorized distribution of the thesis in its current state.  In this case, the doctoral student has one month to make minor corrections (spelling) to the thesis, in the form of erratum.  There is no new submission.  The thesis is converted into SGML (archiving format) and then into HTML and XML (distribution formats).  The thesis is place on the University’s intranet (equivalent to consultation in the library) and, if authorized by the student, on the Internet.  The description of the thesis is broadcast. 
*the jury demanded corrections.  In this case, a new electronic submission and validation is necessary.  Once the president of the jury validates the corrections, the thesis follows the normal treatment process. 
*Non-corrected theses, or those subject to a confidentiality clause, are archived in SGML and are only distributed on the intranet, according to the case.  Their description is broadcast, but with mention of their confidentiality. 
 
 
'''Electronic submission''' 
 
This second system removes the risk of non-conformity inherent in the mixed submission.  The legal 
deposit of the thesis thus consists of an electronic submission.  The printed copies of the thesis required 
for the defense and for deposit in the library are printed from the electronic submission. 
 
If this system is more satisfactory, it nevertheless requires a supplementary infrastructure.  In order to 
guarantee that the printed copies are truly drawn from the electronic version submitted, the University 
must offer the authors the means to effectuate a complete electronic submission and must undertake the 
task of printing the copies needed for the defense. 
 
This system thus requires the support of many different types of structures.  These include the traditional 
thesis service, a relatively heavy computer infrastructure made available to doctoral students (digitization 
of illustrations, video acquisition, sound, user assistance) and a copy service capable of providing 
irregular output on short notice (the frequency of thesis defenses varying in function of the university 
calendar). 

Starting from the files produced by the student, a “single file” printing (PostScript and/or PDF) will be 
undertaken by the University, under the student’s control (lay-out, rendering of illustrations, etc...). 
*the source files as well as the PostScript file will be engraved and transmitted to the electronic publishing service for archiving while awaiting the defense. 
*Only the PostScript file will be transferred to the copy service’s print station. 


'''The resources necessary for the implementation of a thesis treatment platform in an establishment 
or group of university establishments''' 
 
Two functioning architectures can be considered: 
 
*'''a client-server system'''.  Here, a server site ensures the management of computing resources while client sites ensure production (from a distance) and distribution (locally).  A web interface manages the communication between the different client sites and the server site. 
Associations of institutions can develop as a result of geographic or disciplinary proximity, by creating synergies and by combining skills and competencies. 
*'''an autonomous system'''.  Here, each production site undertakes, in an autonomous manner,  the entire operation of processing, archiving and distribution.  This would apply to sites possessing the necessary human resources, or treating a volume of documents justifying such a system. 
 

'''Human resources''': 
 
The existing system requires diverse skills, both in computer engineering and in engineering documents, 
which correspond to different tasks: 
 
*managing information systems:  updating programs, managing both archiving and putting information on-line, user assistance, linking users to the group(s) in charge of developing and updating the system; 
 
*processing the documents:  formatting documents for processing, digitizing illustrations, sounds, video, etc., verification of the processing and capture of metadata. 
 

The presence of the two types of human resources is not necessary in each production center. 
 
*processing the documents:  1 full time equivalent d’IE (?) for an annual volume of 100 theses per year. 
 
*information management:  Needs vary depending on whether the local configuration or the client-server configuration is used. 
 

'''Training in the use and administration of the software platform for processing theses''' 
 
The training activities are targeted at two types of agents with specific skills: 
 
*recognized computer skills allowing the agents in question to act on several levels.  At the local level, in order to assist those using the software platform, these skills are the maintenance and adaptation of the software platform.  They must also be given skills at the network level, where they will serve as relays between users and the group piloting the evolution of the platform, as well as participate in the activities of this piloting group (computing decisions and developments). 

*electronic publishing skills:  electronic submission of theses; training doctoral students in the use of generic document forms; preparation and formatting of documents according to the rules determined by the chosen software platform.  This is a new domain, and defining its profile with exiting qualifications is a delicate process:  mastery of electronic document production tools, knowledge of the different types of academic production, and pedagogical ability to transfer this knowledge to a public composed of doctoral students and researchers. 


'''The role of Doctoral Schools and the training of doctoral students''' 
 
The implementation of these new processes requires the participation of the principal actors involved
doctoral students and their supervisors.  The training of authors, thesis supervisors, and research 
structures must occur within the Doctoral schools.  These school constitute the ideal frame of reference 
for several reasons: 
 
*the training provided to the student will be adapted to their discipline and thus to the specific computing tools that they may have need to use; 
 
*the supervisors will be implicated in the process; 
 
*the sharing of this knowledge between the different actors of a Doctoral school will provide a supplementary factor of internal cohesion. 
 
With time, the Doctoral Schools should become support centers for the use of the new tools of scientific 
production and publication.  In the course of thesis writing, doctoral students will receive the tools and 
the help required to write their document in an effective manner, and will acquire all the skills needed for 
its processing. 
 
Tools such as generic document forms and technical specifications will be provided by the Ministry.  The 
Doctoral Schools will be charged with adapting them to the particular practices of a discipline or of the 
establishment (in the case of the style sheet).  A generic training program in using generic document 
forms will be available and adaptable according to local needs.  In light of past experience, six hours of 
training per doctoral student seems sufficient for training students in the advanced use of text 
processing.  One might expect that, within several years, students will be trained in text processing 
before starting the doctorate and that training costs during the doctorate will be increasingly minimal. 
 
A permanent link should be established between the electronic production and distribution services and 
the Doctoral Schools so as to create synergies between the users and the electronic publishing 
specialists.  This relationship should be based on permanent cooperation, and initiated in the training 
sessions through a presentation of the service and of its results. 
 
 
'''Regional and Disciplinary Policies''': 
 
 
The implementation and publication of the Université Lumière Lyon2’s policy, and the computerized 
means of processing that the University established, have allowed for the creation and structuration of a 
network of university and scientific establishments.   The universities of the Rhône-Alpes region, united 
within the context of a University Conference, have decided to implement the principle recommendations 
enunciated by the Université Lyon2.  Subsequently, at the level of the French territory, as well around its 
borders, one notes a tendency to regroup, on the one hand universities (Lyon, Marne la Vallée, Paris-Sud, 
Grenoble, Genève), and on the other hand scientific establishments (CNRS, Inra, Inserm).  One equally 
finds disciplinary groups like the “Mathdoc” network which unites the mathematical laboratories, and 
which is in turn linked to a European network.  This network’s work involves collecting the metadata 
produced by each researcher which are necessary for the description and announcement of theses.  These 
metadata are then archived and made accessible either on the site of the laboratory or on the researcher’s 
own site.  The approach is less institutional, and thus less enduring, in the sense that its conservation is 
left to the appraisal of the researchers and of the laboratories. 

Not all of these institutions have adopted the Lyon2 model (RTF=&gt;SGML/XML).  Some have preferred 
the generic document form produced by Adobe, while others produce documents using Latex and
distribute them in “postscript” format.  Nevertheless, reflection about these choices is carried out in 
public, thanks notably to the work undertaken by the Ministerial group. 


'''French Public Policy:  The Minister’s circular''' 
 
To conclude the work led by a reflection group, the Minister responsible for Higher Education released a 
circular in October 2000 which defined the major axes of the futre policy concerning the electronic 
archiving and distribution of theses. 
 

'''Electronic Distribution of Theses''' 

'''''Text addressed to University presidents, and to presidents or directors of institutions of higher 
education'''''
 
''Theses defended in universities and other institutions of higher education constitute documents of the 
highest value.  Looking after their promotion serves both the interests of the young doctors and the 
institutions, as well as the end of increasing the international visibility of French research. 
 
The deep transformations which have for some time characterized information technology have clearly 
rendered the existing system for valorizing theses (defined by the decree of 25 September 1985 dealing 
with the submission, description, reproduction and distribution of theses) obsolete. 
 
It is on the basis of this observation and in recognition that: 
 
*theses are henceforth produced “naturally” in computerized form, 
*the equipment and networks in institutions of higher education have been greatly developed, 
*the majority of universities are currently positioning themselves as producers and distributors of electronic information, 
 
that a  group associating the services of the Ministry of National Education and the Ministry of 
Research, the conference of university presidents, the association of university library directors, and 
numerous experts having undertaken experiments in this domain, submitted a report to me on the 
electronic distribution of theses.  This report, whose principal conclusions I have validated, can be 
consulted on the Ministry’s server at the following address: 
 
'''http://www.sup.adc.education.fr/bib/''' 
 
The proposed new system foresees the distribution of theses on the Internet once a certain number of 
conditions are met: 
 
*authorization of the head of the institution, following the advice of the jury and the authorization of the author, while respecting intellectual property regulations, 
*respect by the doctoral student of minimum technical specifications, 
*conversion of the thesis, using automated assembly lines, into adequate archiving and distribution formats for storage and for placing on-line. 
 
The intervention of numerous actors above and beyond the doctoral student will be required: 
 
*that of the establishment where the thesis is defended, by way of: 
**the doctoral schools, who are responsible for providing the student with training and technical assistance, 
**the common documentation services, responsible for describing the thesis and providing the document’s electronic address in collective and local catalogues, 
**the service charged with converting and putting theses on-line, using the software provided to them. 
*that of the state or of a national operator, by means of 
**elaborating technical specifications and training supports, 
**guaranteeing or providing  processing chains, 
**providing secure archiving. 
 
On these bases, in agreement with the Minister of Research, and after consultation with the CPU, I have 
decided: 
 
*to put a project group in place, 
*to elaborate a new decree concerning the submission, description, archiving and distribution of theses, 
*to organize training activities for the institutions, or the groups of institutions, who wish to rapidly enter into this new system, 
*to put into place the collective functions necessary to give overall coherence to the process, taking into account the acquired skills of the National Thesis Reproduction Workshops [atelier nationaux de reproduction des thèses] (ANRT), the Higher Education Bibliographic Workshop [atelier bibliographique de l’enseignement supérieur] (ABES), and the National Computing Centre for Higher Education [centre informatique national de l’enseignement supérieur] (CINES).'' 
 
This new scheme will obviously take time to put into place, progressing as the institutions introduce 
adequate assembly lines.  It goes without saying that the old system defined by the decree of 1985 will 
continue to apply to the theses defended in institutions which have not yet taken the corresponding 
measures.
 
'''''The Minister of National Education 
 
Jack LANG''''' 
 
 
A certain number of principles underpin this political interest in the electronic distribution of theses: 
 
*To increase the visibility and to valorize French scientific production at the international level 
*To favor a new approach to the thesis so that it is considered as a dynamic database rather than a static body of knowledge.  The electronic version of the thesis becomes a genuine work instrument which meets the demands of users, starting from the user’s own agenda of research and investigation. 
*To develop training for student-researchers in the use of information technology and electronic publishing.  Student-researcher will find themselves in the role of scientific information producers since they will be able to master these mechanisms and thus increase their autonomy.  They will personally acquire the status of being information producers and distributors. 
*This should gather together the elements permitting scientists to produce, archive and distribute all their research work by themselves.  Let us remember that France’s approach to the electronic distribution of theses is integrated into a vaster francophone project of putting the results of public research online.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many universities that have paper submissions of theses and dissertations collect funds for processing 
these works.  Usually the funds are collected from students. In some cases they might be collected from 
grants, or from a sponsor (e.g., from the National Library, with regard to works in Canada). 

These funds commonly are called &quot;binding fees&quot; or are given other names designating their use for 
processing.  A typical fee might be $20 or $30 per work. 

In the case of transition to ETDs at Virginia Tech, there were changes to these fees. First, in 1996, when 
submission of ETDs was encouraged but voluntary, the processing fee was waived for those students 
submitting an ETD instead of a paper document.  This provided a monetary incentive to move toward 
ETDs. 

However, in 1997, with a requirement in place, the processing fee was re-instituted. However, it was 
renamed &quot;archiving fee&quot;.  Thus, funds were collected from students: 
 
*to help defray the costs of the ETD program; 
*to provide a pool of funds to archive and preserve works throughout their lifetime, allowing for migration to new media types (e.g., automatic copying to newer types of storage media, such as from one online disk to a more modern disk), as well as conversion to new formats (e.g., moving from SGML to XML, or from one version of PDF to a newer version).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A continuing topic of discussion in the ETD community, including Graduate School administrators, research 
faculty, and librarians, is the question of “prior publication.” That is, whether publishers and editors of scholarly 
journals view electronic theses and dissertations that are available on the Internet and through convenient Web 
browsers as being published because they are so readily and widely available. 

John Eaton, Dean at Virginia Tech’s Graduate School, surveyed graduate student alumni in 1998 and 1999 and 
he asked about publishing articles derived from their ETDs. One hundred percent of those who had successfully 
published had not had any problems getting published because their theses or dissertations were online and 
readily available on the Internet.  By looking at the results Joan Dalton’s 1999 survey of publishers and Nan 
Seaman’s 2000 survey as well as at Eaton’s surveys of graduate student alumni, the ready availability of ETDs 
on the Internet does not deter the vast majority of publishers from publishing articles derived from graduate 
research already available on the Internet. [See &quot;Do ETDs Deter Publishers? Coverage from the 4th 
International Symposium on ETDs,&quot; Gail McMillan. College and Research Libraries News, v. 62, no. 6 (June 
2001): 620-621. 
http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/staff/gailmac/publications/pubrsETD2001.html] 

Several publishers have also attested to this and these statements are available in a variety of sources such as 
http://www.ndltd.org/publshrs/index.html. (others?) At the Cal Tech ETD 2001 
conference, Keith Jones from Elsevier stated emphatically that his company encourages its authors to link their 
articles in Elsevier journals to their personal Web sites and also authorizes faculty members’ departments to 
provide such links. Jones reported that Elsevier understands the importance of getting new authors such as 
graduate students to publish in his journals early in their careers because they are then likely to continue to 
publish with the same journal. He also pointed out the publishing in an Elsevier Science journal is an important 
source of validation for academics so that the subsequent availability of those articles from other non-profit and 
educational sources is not a threat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1.      ETDs make the results of graduate programs widely known.

17. Access to information enhances the quality of TDs.

19. ETDs are way of sharing intellectual production. 

20. Wide knowledge of good quality TDs strengthens the faculty, the graduate programs and the 
university. 

21. Widely known results allow copies to be identified in an easier way. 

22. Universities will be able to share knowledge on digital libraries. 

23. Access to information enhances the quality of TDs. 


The reasons are purposely listed in the order they were presented during the discussion and, no doubt, 
seem to be quite scattered. 

Thus, let's imagine 3 categories of reasons: benefits to students, benefits to  universities and benefits to 
regions/countries/society. The reasons that were listed above can be reorganized and assigned to these 
categories. 
 
First, there are benefits to students which reflect on the university and on society too. Of the 23 reasons 
above, 15 are beneficial to students: 
 

24. Access to information enhances the quality of TDs. 

25. An ETD program introduces digital libraries in the universities allowing other projects to 
bloom. 

26. Electronically published TDs yield easier and faster access to information. 

27. ETDs are way of sharing intellectual production. 

28. ETDs can identify and connect national and international research groups. 

29. ETDs make the results of graduate programs widely known. 

30. Graduate programs may be evaluated by the number of theses and dissertations (TDs) and by 
the number of accessible ETDs. 

31. TDs allow extensions to be identified and undertaken. 

32. TDs contain bibliographical reviews. 

33. TDs hold information that will help avoid duplication of efforts. 

34. TDs present the methods used during research, thus allowing these methods to be used by 
others. 

35. To electronically publish TDs makes it less expensive to students who do not have to print as 
many copies. 

36. To electronically publish TDs makes the results known nationally and internationally. 

37. Wide knowledge of good quality TDs strengthens the faculty, the graduate programs and the 
university. 

38. Widely known results allow copies to be identified more easily. 
 

Next, the universities are the focus and some reasons that were listed under benefits to students will 
appear again: 
 

39. Access to information enhances the quality of TDs. 

40. An ETD program introduces digital libraries in the universities allowing other projects to 
bloom. 

41. Graduate programs may be evaluated by the number of theses and dissertations (TDs) and by 
the number of accessible ETDs.
 
42. ETDs can identify and connect national and international research groups. 

43. ETDs make the results of graduate programs widely known. 

44. ETDs require less storage space. 

45. TDs are part of the assets and of the history of the universities. 

46. To electronically publish TDs makes the results known nationally and internationally. 

47. Universities will be able to share knowledge in digital libraries. 

48. Wide knowledge of good quality TDs strengthens the faculty, the graduate programs and the 
university. 

49. Widely known results allow copies to be identified more easily. 
 

Benefits that appeared under the previous 2 categories will be listed again in this last category, devoted to 
regions/countries/society:  
 

50. Access to information enhances the quality of TDs. 

51. ETDs can identify and connect national and international research groups. 

52. In many countries, when financed with public funds, it is expected that TDs will be made 
public. ETDs are the easiest way to accomplish this. 

53. To publish TDs funded with public money is a way of returning the results to society. 

54. Universities will be able to share knowledge in digital libraries. 

55. Widely known results allow copies to be identified in an easier way. 

Finally, two other reasons for ETDs are: 

56. TDs exist and are published on paper, so why not publish them electronically? 

57. TDs are referred by examining committees, a warranty of quality to be published. 


There were 23 reasons when they were first listed. When they were classified, we got 34. The 
explanation is simple - many reasons bring benefits to more than one category. 

It is not hard to come to the conclusion that ETD's are beneficial to all, and that ETD programs are good 
and should be considered by universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETDs have a very positive impact on libraries because they are an easy way to expand services and 
resources. With ETDs libraries can evolve into digital libraries and online libraries. Because authors 
create and submit the digital documents and yet others validate them (i.e., graduate school approval), all 
the library has to do is receive, store, and provide access. This is not a radical departure from what 
libraries do normally; only these documents are electronic. Today, many libraries are already handling 
electronic journals, so ETDs can extend the multimedia resources to the online environment and give 
every library something unique in their digital resources.
 
The library can do more, such as improving workflow, reducing the time from receipt to public access, 
and, of course, one ETD can have multiple simultaneous users. ETDs can be submitted directly to the 
library server so that as soon as they are approved, they can become available to users, eliminating the 
need to move the documents from the Graduate School to the Library. This change in workflow can also 
eliminate the time delay previously caused by bounding and cataloging them prior to providing access. 
The most tenuous and highly emotional service libraries provide to ETDs is archiving. Because not 
enough time has elapsed to prove that digital documents can live for decades in publicly accessible 
digital libraries, the uncertainty of online archives causes great unease to many. Libraries must, therefore, 
be careful about security and back-ups. 

Another role that the library plays can be to put a prototype in place.  While the Graduate School is 
nurturing the policy evolution among the academic community, there is a model developing to meet the 
needs of the academy.  Establishing an ETD project Web site that documents the evolving initiative, 
listing active participants, providing a sample submission form and potential policy statements can do 
this. These statements might address levels of access, copyright statements, and link to existing ETD 
initiatives. 

When a university is adopting policies about ETDs it is helpful to have a place where its students, faculty, and administrators can see what an electronic library of digital theses and dissertations might be. 
Many graduate students are anxious to participate in an ETD initiative and the library’s Web site can take 
advantage of their enthusiasm. Invite students who have complete their TDs to submit them 
electronically. This will build the initial ETD database and test the submission form as well as give the 
Graduate School personnel opportunities to compare the old and the new processes with somewhat 
familiar TDs. 

The library is also in a position to offer graduate students the incentive to participate. Most libraries 
collect binding fees so that theses and dissertations can be bound uniformly. Archiving fees can replace 
binding fees when ETDs replace paper TDs. However, the library may wish to offer to eliminate this fee 
for the first (limited number of students) who submit ETDs instead of TDs. 


=Archiving Electronic Theses Dissertations=

The best chance electronic information has of being preserved is when it is used online regularly and 
continually. As soon as it is not used, there will be trouble remembering the media that produced it and 
that made it accessible. 
 
As ETDs begin to join the library’s traditional theses and dissertations, it is a good time to align the 
commitment and the resources to maintain these online information resources over time. A library’s 
Special Collections Department and/or its University Archives are often responsible for storing and 
preserving theses and dissertations. Document parallel standards, policies, and procedures for electronic 
theses and dissertations (ETDs). 
 
The academic departments determine the quality of the work of their students, while the individual 
thesis/dissertation committees approve the student's work on its own merits. The Graduate School 
primarily oversees mechanical considerations, the purpose of which is to provide a degree of uniformity, 
to assure that each thesis or dissertation is in a form suitable for reading and/or viewing online and that it 
can be preserved. The University Archives ensures long-term preservation and access to this record of 
graduate students’ research. 

With digital materials libraries give access and simultaneously prolong the life of the work, ensure the 
durability of the present through stability of the means of mediation. 


=Factors Effecting Archiving=

'''1) Access''' 
 
The first goal is to have all ETDs online and available all the time from a stable server. If necessary 
(depending on the capabilities of the server), some ETDs could be moved to a secondary server. 
Considerations for moving ETDs to a secondary server are usage (ETDs with fewest accesses) or age 
(oldest ETDs). Formats and file sizes probably would not be a factor in employing a secondary server, 
though extremely large ETDs may be prime candidates for separate online storage and access. 
If it becomes necessary to move some ETDs to a secondary server, programs would be written to trigger 
migration. Currently &quot;age&quot; would be easier to program, but in the future &quot;usage&quot; (actually, lack of use or 
few downloads) would be preferable characteristics for migrating ETDs to a secondary server for 
archiving. 
URNs would link migrated ETDs. URNs could be mapped to PURLs at some future date. 
 
'''2) Security''' 
 
''Data''

ETDs that been submitted but not yet approved should be frequently backed-up 
(e.g., hourly) if changes have occurred since the last back up; otherwise, generate 
a back-up programmatically every few hours. Make a weekly back up of ETDs in 
all directories (i.e., all levels of access). Make copies programmatically and 
transfer them to another server; make weekly back-ups to tape for off-line 
storage. Retain copies in quarterly cycles and annually archive to a CD-ROM. 
 
''Content''

Authors cannot modify their ETDs once approved. Exceptions are made with proper approval. 
Viewers/readers cannot modify or replace any ETDs. Only in extreme circumstances would the system 
administrator make modifications to an ETD (e.g., when requested by the Graduate School to change the 
access restrictions or to activate or change email addresses). 
 
'''3) Format Migration''' 
 
The library should share with the university the responsibility to guarantee that ETDs will be available 
both within and outside the scholarly community indefinitely. To keep ETDs reader-friendly and to 
retain full access will mean migrating current formats to new standard formats not yet known. This will 
be done through the cooperative efforts of the library (who maintains the submission software, the 
database of ETDs, and the secure archive) and university computing expertise. 
Standard formats should be the only acceptable files approved. Formats recommended for ETDs that 
may need to be converted to new standards in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A common workflow at a campus involved in NDLTD is as follows.  Each student will use a home 
computer, or computer in a lab, to submit his or her ETD.  His or her work will have been created on the 
computer he or she is working with, or will have been moved there using some media format, such as 
diskette or CD-RW.  The student will go to a well-known URL (e.g., at Virginia Tech, will start at 
http://etd.vt.edu and then follow links). 

First, students will provide an ID and password that authenticates them.  Next, they will enter in metadata 
about their ETD. When that is complete and checked, they will use their browser to locate each of the 
files that make up the ETD, so uploading can proceed.  Eventually, the entire ETD will be uploaded. 

Later, a person in the graduate school will find that a new ETD has been uploaded. He or she will check 
the submission. If there are problems, he or she will use email to contact the student so that 
changes/corrections can be made, and the process repeated up through this step.  Once a proper ETD is 
submitted, a cataloguer in the Library will be notified. He or she will catalog the work, adding in 
additional categories, and checking the metadata. Eventually he or she will release the work to allow 
proper access, according to the student/faculty preferences. 

More refined workflow models can be applied. Let us suppose that at the Polytechnic University of 
Valencia, Spain the process starts from a catalog of ETD proposals, published by faculty members filling 
in the appropriate form; each proposal may include the title, keywords, abstract, level of expertise 
required, and other useful information. A student can apply for a number of proposals (specifying an 
order of preference) filling a form including his/her personal data. A faculty committee makes the final 
assignment of proposals to candidates. At this point, most of the ETD metadata have been collected, and there is no need to introduce them during the submission process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aim of the ADT (Australian Digital Theses) Program is to establish a distributed database of digital versions of theses produced 
by the postgraduate research students at Australian universities. The theses are available worldwide via 
the web. The ideal behind the program is to provide access to and promote Australian research to the 
international community. 

The ADT concept was an initiative of 7 Australian university’s libraries in association with the Council 
of Australian University Librarians (CAUL ). 

The ADT model was developed by the 7 original project partners during 1998-1999. The program was 
then opened up to all CAUL members (all Australian universities) in July 2000. The original 7 partners 
will continue to guide and advise the national group in their role as the ADT Steering Committee. 

The initial project was funded by an Australian Research Council (ARC) - Research Infrastructure 
Equipment and Facilities (RIEF) Scheme grant (1997/1998). The ARC is the peak Australian 
government research funding body and the grant to establish the ADT was a result of a successful 
application made by the group of 7 above. It was recognised at the outset that recurrent funding was 
going to be problematic, and that the model to be developed had to take this into consideration. The 
model developed is essentially self sustaining, with only a small commitment of resources required. The 
original funds were used to create such a self supporting  distributed and collaborative system. 

The software used is generic, and designed to be easily integrated at ADT member sites. Once installed, 
students can either self submit, or seek support free from the library. Theses are mounted on local servers 
and require a minimum of maintenance. The central ADT metadata repository is searchable and is 
created automatically from rich DC metadata generated from the submission/deposit form. The metadata 
is gathered automatically using a metadata gatherer robot. The idea behind the ADT is that producing 
research theses is normal business for universities and a commitment to include a digital copy to the 
ADT requires minimal resources. In fact, digital copies are much cheaper to produce that the traditional paper bound versions. 

It must be noted that institutional membership and individual contributions to the ADT are voluntary, and 
will remain so for some time to come. 

Each NDLTD member has to apply to its own national, regional and community funding agencies. 
However, recurrent funding will probably be an ongoing issue unless a commitment is made at the 
government level to support such initiatives. In the broader context, ongoing funding for an international 
community body, which the NDLTD now is, will be difficult to achieve. A possible solution would be 
for the NDLTD to seek Non-Government Organization [NGO] status and thus secure ongoing funding 
from UN instrumentalities such as UNESCO. Such funding is critical to ensure the good work already 
achieved by the NDLTD in bringing together a large and disparate number of institutions from across the 
globe bound by an ideal to promote, support and facilitate open unrestricted access to worldwide research 
contained in theses, and to share without cost/commercial barriers experiences, support and guidelines 
with the world community in an open, transparent way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gathering data about ETDs can be done through online surveys and log file analysis. Online surveys can 
also be used to gather data from graduate student authors submitting ETDs and from ETD readers 
accessing them. An easy to use online survey system is available to NDLTD members at 
http://lumiere.lib.vt.edu/surveys/ Ask graduate student ETD authors a variety of 
questions about the process as well as about support services and use this data to improve resources and 
services. Query readers to discover their reasons for accessing ETDs, the results of their use of ETDs, as 
well as to improve digital library resources and services. 
 
Questions for student authors may be designed to improve the process of preparing and submitting 
electronic documents. Sample questions might include: 
 
*While preparing your ETD, where did you find answers to your questions? 
*If you consulted the VT ETD Web site, please indicate if the site was useful. 
*If you attended an ETD workshop, please indicate if you found the workshop useful. 
*If you used a [particular] computer lab, please indicate if the staff was helpful. 
*How many ETDs did you consult while preparing your ETD? 
*Compared to what you expected, how difficult was it to create a PDF file? 
*My computer is a [PC, Mac, Unix, other]. 
*Where were you when you submitted your ETD? 
*Compared to what you expected, how difficult was it to submit your thesis/dissertation electronically? 
*Within the next 1-2 years, what do you intend to publish from your ETD? 
*If you restricted access to your VT ETD, on what did you base your decision? 
*Please include any comments or questions that you have about ETDs. 
 

'''Usage''' 
 
In the online environment, usage is similar to but not equal to library circulation and re shelving 
statistics. Nevertheless, to report usage, institutions should also report numbers of available ETDs so that 
downloads can be viewed in the context of what was available at a given point in time. 
 
It would be beneficial if all libraries providing access to ETDs would capture and 
report similar data about usage, but at this time we are not doing this. Gail 
McMillan has periodically surveyed and reported numbers of ETDs available 
from the NDLTD. Her data is based on institutions reporting numbers of ETDs 
available through their institutions, but the NDLTD has not begun to report 
institutional use of or access to their ETD collections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter of the Guide is intended for those who have responsibility for implementing an institutional 
or departmental ETD program.  The process of creating a successful assessment and measurement 
requires ''planning, creating goals and objectives, choosing types of measures, and deciding what type of 
data to collect.'' 
 

== Planning ==
 
 
Some campuses form an ETD committee or team, consisting of representatives from the Graduate 
School, the faculty, the library, the computing center, and other relevant units on campus.  As part of 
their overall planning for the development of an ETD program, the committee should make explicit their 
goals for assessment and measurement of the program and put in place mechanisms to collect data 
related to the goals.  The data collection could be gathered from web statistics packages, from student 
surveys, or from interviews, depending on what type of information meets the assessment’s goals. 
 
Several units of the university—including academic departments, the graduate school, information 
technology services, and the library—are involved in any ETD program. In developing an assessment 
plan, it is useful to think convergent.  Are there particular things that would be useful for several of these 
constituents to know?  This will leverage the value of the assessment and may allow for joint funding and
implementation, thereby spreading the costs and the work. 
 
During the planning process, the ETD committee may focus on a variety of issues, including: 
 
*the impact that the ETD program is having on the institution’s reputation; 
*the degree to which the ETD program is assisting the institution in developing a digital library; and 
*the benefits to and concerns of  students and advisors participating in the ETD program. 
 
Once the focus of the assessment and measurement activities is identified, the ETD committee should 
assign responsibility for development and implementation to another team.  This team should include 
assessment and measurement experts from institutional units such as an institutional planning office, a 
survey research institute, or an instructional assessment office. 


== Creating Goals and Objectives ==
 
 
A necessary prerequisite to assessment is a clear understanding of the ETD project’s goals. Each 
institution’s assessment plan should match the goals and objectives of the institutional ETD program, 
which may have a broader scope than the simple production of electronic content. 

If an ETD program does not have clearly defined goals, an excellent resource is the [http://www.ndltd.org NDLTD web site]. This site includes the goals of the NDLTD, which can be adapted to local needs. These 
goals include: 
 
*Improving graduate education 
*Increasing availability of student research
*Lowering costs of submission and handling of theses and dissertations 
*Empowering students 
*Empowering universities 
*Advancing digital library technology

Within each of these broad areas, many types of measures can be developed to help evaluate whether the 
ETD program is succeeding. 


== Choosing Types of Measures ==
 
 
Institutions have many choices in what they measure in an ETD program.  After aligning the assessment 
goals with the institution’s goals, the assessment plan must describe what types of measures are needed 
for various aspects of the program.  McClure describes a number of categories of measures, including 
those that focus on extensiveness, efficiency, effectiveness, service quality, impact, and usefulness. 
(Charles R. McClure and Cynthia L. Lopata, ''Assessing the Academic Networked Environment'', 1996, p. 
6) 
 
An ''extensiveness measure'' collects data on such questions as how many departments within the university 
are requiring ETDs or how many ETD submissions are made each year.  This type of data lends itself to 
comparison, both as trend data for the individual institution and in comparisons to peer institutions. 
 
An ''efficiency measure'' collects data to compare how life cycle costs of ETDs compare to those of print 
theses and dissertations.  For example, Virginia Tech includes such a comparison on its [http://etd.vt.edu Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Initiative] web site.

''Effectiveness measures'' examine the degree to which the objectives of a program have been met.  For 
example, if an objective of the institution’s ETD program is to empower students to convey a richer 
message through the use of multimedia and hypermedia, data can be collected that displays the 
proportion and number of ETDs employing such techniques by year.  If an objective of the program is to 
improve students’ understanding of electronic publishing issues, the institution can measure such 
understanding prior to and after the student produces an ETD. 
 
''Measures of service quality'' examine whether students are receiving the training and follow-up assistance 
they need. 


== Deciding What Data to Collect ==
 
 
Frequently, discussions of how to assess electronic information resources are limited to defining ways of 
counting such things as searches, downloads, and hits.  These measures are certainly useful, but they 
provide a limited view of the overall value of electronic information resources. 
 
Many vital questions cannot be answered with statistics about searches, downloads, and hits: Can users 
access more information than in the past due to availability of information resources online?  Has the 
availability of electronic information resources improved individuals’ productivity and quality of 
research?  Has the availability saved them time?  
 
Collection of data for assessment should be designed to answer some of these questions, to address the 
educational goals embedded in an ETD program, and to gauge whether or not those goals have been 
achieved. 
 
Decisions about data collection are also informed by the institutional mission and goals. For example, if 
the institution is interested in increased visibility both nationally and internationally, then statistics on 
downloads of ETDs by country and institutional IP address could be useful. Examining who is using an 
institution’s ETDs by country and by amount of use would also be a valuable gauge of impact.  As 
recommended systems develop, this area may grow in importance. 
 

There are a number of questions related to users that are possible targets for assessment.  These include: 
 
*Are students achieving the objectives of the ETD program? 
*Are students using tools such as Acrobat appropriately and efficiently? 
*Has the availability of student work increased? 
*Do students have an increased understanding of publishing issues, such as intellectual property concerns? 
 

In addition, a number of questions related to student satisfaction could be addressed in data collection 
plans.  These may include: 
 
*Were students satisfied with the training or guidance they received to assist them with producing an ETD? 
*Did the availability of their dissertation on the web assist them in getting a job? 
*Are they using the technology and electronic authoring skills they learned in their current work? 


Usefulness to students may be a factor of the availability of their ETD on the web, assisting employers in 
gauging their area of research and the quality of their output.  Availability may also lead employers to 
contact students for openings that require a particular skill set.  And students may find that the skills of 
preparing an ETD and the framework of issues associated with the ETD, such as intellectual property 
issues, is useful in their places of employment after graduation. 

The usefulness of an ETD program to students, faculty, and others may be an important factor to measure 
in order to gather data that can be conveyed to administrators and funding agencies.  This data might best 
be collected six months to a year after the completion of the ETD. 
 
Finally, the ability for faculty and students around the world to easily examine the dissertation and thesis 
output of a particular department may provide a new dimension to rankings and ratings of graduate 
departments.  Monitoring national ratings in the years pre- and post-implementation of an ETD program 
could be useful, although may be only one factor in any change in ranking or rating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assessment takes two basic forms, based on the point at which the 
evaluation is done: 
 
*Formative evaluation takes place during the development of a program.  It is used to help refocus activities, revise or fine tune a program, or to validate the success of particular activities.  Formative assessment in an ETD program may help diagnose whether training sessions are useful to students, whether the submission process worked efficiently, whether the students learned about electronic scholarly communication issues, or whether the students find what they learned in order to produce an ETD helpful in their employment. 
 
*Summative evaluation is used to examine the program at its completion or at the end of a stage.  Since an ETD program is ongoing, summative evaluation can be used on an annual basis to yield statistics that can be compared from year to year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The quality of a university is reflected by the quality of its students’ intellectual products.  Theses and 
dissertations reflect an institution’s ability to lead students and support original work.  In time, as digital 
libraries of ETDs become more commonplace, students and faculty will make judgments regarding the 
quality of a university by reviewing its digital library.  Universities that incorporate new literacy tools, 
such as streaming multimedia, will attract students who hope to produce innovative work. 

Starting an ETD program is like starting any other project:  a need for the results must exist so all those 
involved will be motivated and committed through all the steps to the end--the moment when ETD's have 
become a regular and consolidated activity in the graduate programs of the University. 

ETD's are based on the joint work of graduate students, mentors, graduate deans, administrative staff, 
library staff and the IT team. The success of the implementation of the ETD program requires the 
commitment of all these players plus that of the university’s higher administrative officers.

This was suggested to get moved to Wikisource. I can barely make sense of this. It seems that Nasrudin is a fictional character, used here to create little stories that teach a lesson, which is briefly interpreted for each one. I don't see how this is a textbook, nor how this isn't original research. Wikisource doesn't want it because &quot;It is unclear how much of the Sufism material is is the work of Nasrudin, and how much is commentary. The author of material here needs to be clearly identified, and previously published. Eclecticology 09:18, 20 March 2008 (UTC)&quot; Apparently this has survived a VFD, but I've missed it in the archives. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:35, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

:{{keep}} (wow).  These really should be compared with parables or fables as far as Sufism is concerned.  Certainly Nasrudin' stories as seen as quite valid by many &amp; from time to time get quite wide coverage.  It is '''definitely not''' original research (I have a copy of a Nasrudin book from many years ago!) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:38, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
::{{comment}} - reading the stories I ''think'' some may be inventions.  I'll dig out my book &amp; check when I get a chance.  The &quot;interpretations&quot; are &quot;interesting&quot; - maybe they need some work but equally [[Talk:Sufism/Nasrudin#Interpretations.3F|maybe not!]]  Nasrudin stories (as I understand it) are intended to be rather Zen like --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:52, 1 April 2008 (UTC)

::::: A brief scan suggests to me, as someone whose never heard of any of these, that the difference between this and books like Harry Potter is context. Its not made reasonably clear what is the proverbs/fable/whatever being used and what is the interpretations being provided. This is probably why others who have commented on it, have said it looks like original research or works of fiction which neither belong here. If your suggesting this is Annotated Text as I suspect you are, than that is not quickly apparent, so either someone should clean it up or ought to be deleted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:17, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

Some read more as jokes I've read in e-mails, but they are still enjoyable and somewhat educational. If kept, it would need considerable cleanup (like removing the interpretations) and ideally more information about Nasrudin and how the fables came into existence. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 09:51, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

: Also, can we refrain from call these lame or silly. Someone thought these were worth their time. I'd encourage everyone to be bold and modify what they consider interesting &amp;mdash; and leave well alone what they don't.

=== Wikisource transwiki ===
Does this really belong on Wikisource? I was under the impression that they only took published text. I had a look around at [[s:Wikisource:What_Wikisource_includes]] and [[s:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?]] but couldn't find anything that explicitly determined this.

Basically, Nasrudin tales are folk tales that will exist in various forms. Some have been published, but can't be attributed to one author nor is there a single authorative version. It might seem that we can only contribute Nasrudin tales from previously published books.

Taking a lean stand, one might say that the stories are somewhat established, have been published (though possibly in a slightly different version, these being folk-tales after all) and not original works of the contributor.

Basically, if the material belongs at Wikisource, I'm fine with deleting. The community, however, leans to keep, so we shouldn't get rid of this until we get Wikisource confirmation that this is acceptable material. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:16, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

: I've [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium#Sufism.2FNasrudin|contacted]] the Wikisource project for their comments. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:27, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

:: According to [[s:User:User:BirgitteSB]] we need &quot;an idenfiable source for the English version with an acceptable copyright status to keep these [at Wikisource].&quot; --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:45, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== Confirmation of the name of this dialect ==

Can someone clarify the discreptency between [[w:Japanese_dialects#Hokuriku_Dialect]] and this module. Ishikawa-ben is stated to be spoken throughout Ishikawa, but the Wikipedia article places three dialects in the prefecture; Kaga-ben (Southern of Ishikawa), Kanazawa-ben (Around of Kawanazawa city) and Noto-ben (Northern of Ishikawa). Can anyone elaborate? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:13, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Hokuriku has it's own flavor of speech, and Kanazawa-ben is definitely a subset.  The only differences is words for a few things between 金沢弁 and the others.  For instance, in Noto I hear &quot;anjin&quot; for boat captain and in kanazawa-ben, I do not hear the fishermen use it. --[[User:Degs|Degs]]</text>

why aeren`t any answer for friends diary ? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:75.34.85.14|75.34.85.14]] ([[User talk:75.34.85.14|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/75.34.85.14|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;


:The short answer is &quot;because these are AY ''Honor'' answers.  I have thought about adding an Instructor's guide for the AY classes, but I don't think most of that would be acceptable content for Wikibooks.  Here we're bound to maintain a Neutral Point of View ([[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|NPOV]]), and it would be difficult to do that and still have an effective teacher's guide for each AY class.  Also you should note that there are no &quot;answers&quot; to the Friend's diary - only activities to do and to report on.

== Re:Thank you ==

It's no problem, I'm happy to help and I'm happy to see new books being written. Uploading images is typically very easy, and the amount of information that we require is small. The upload form has a box to select the license of the image, and a summary section. If the image is free (GFDL, CC-BY-SA, etc) you don't really need to include a lot of information besides the license itself. However, if your images are fair-use (which would likely be the case for screenshots of copyrighted software) you do need to provide a little bit more information about the source of the image and the reason why you can't use a free alternative (because you have to show images of this software in a book about the software).

If you have a lot of images, and the images are similarly-licensed, you might consider looking at a program called [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Tools/Commonist Commonist]. It's an image uploading program that does much of the work automatically, and can copy+paste the necessary licensing information on each new image for you. I've never seen it used here, but I've heard it's supposed to be able to upload images to Wikibooks too. Some time tomorrow you should be autoconfirmed (log says you created the account on the 10th), so if you get the software figured out by then you can upload all the images in one quick click. 

I hope this is helpful to you, let me know if you need anything else. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:25, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

I have downloaded the Commonist software and so far so good.... will see what happens tomorrow.

== Re: Watch every page ==

There are a few ways to do this. The easiest way is to use [[Special:RecentChangesLinked]], which shows you all the recent changes to pages which are linked from a given page. In the case of a book, you can do this to the main TOC, which should link all or most of the pages in the book. Here's a link you should copy for your own use:

* Wiki link: [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Question Writer 3 Manual]]
* HTTP link: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Question_Writer_3_Manual

Just as a side note, it's okay to watch changes and to be &quot;hands-on&quot;. It's not alright to try to control the book or to restrict access to it. Wikibooks is open and collaborative, and the best results come from books which allow many volunteers to participate, and get many points of view. The same freedom that you've had in authoring this book must be afforded to other people who want to contribute to it now. I'm certainly not accusing you of anything, just trying to point out a fine line that many editors are not aware of. 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Otherwise, good luck with your project, and congratulations on writing such a nice book. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:51, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

== Re:PDF Version ==

Unfortunately, you aren't doing anything wrong. We've had a problem with uploaded PDF files for some time now, and nobody seems to know what's causing it. I would use an Image: link instead of a Media: link, to see if that approach works better.

On a side note, we are going to be getting a PDF extension for the website here that will allow us to make and download PDFs directly from the website. I dont know when it will be installed here, but the WMF is currently testing it on other websites. Once that happens, your problem should be solved. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:06, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

== Deleting pages ==

Thanks for your contributions, but please don't blank pages. Tag pages that qualify for [[WB:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]] with {{tlx|delete|&lt;reason&gt;}} or nominate the book at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. See [[Special:ShortPages]] for a few pages that you blanked. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:14, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think these are pages that I blanked but rather pages that I created in error during my first bungling days on Wikibooks and then couldn't find them again.....  I will mark them for deletion.  When you say &quot;a few pages&quot; does that mean that there are more lurking somewhere?  If so, how do I find them? [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 10:22, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

Hi,
I'm relative new to en.wikibooks, but I have collected experience at enwp and at commons. I saw that you still contributing more or less regular, do you still need the files (only the ones you uploaded) listed at [[Special:UnusedFiles]]? All files uploaded by you are using a fair use banner and thus should either be transcluded on any page or should get deleted... &lt;small style=&quot;font: 12px Courier New;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mabdul|mabdul]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:29, 6 June 2012 (UTC)

Hallo - I usually upload and use files in a page in one of the manuals... sometimes I have uploaded a new image (software update) so the old image will now be unused and can be deleted.  Do you want me to delete them or will you? [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hskeet|contribs]]) 10:37, 7 June 2012 (UTC)

I don't think we need two of these.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Question Writer''' is a quiz authoring tool for Microsoft Windows.  It allows the user to:

*create online quizzes with a variety of question formats, 
*publish the quizzes online (or in a range of other formats) 
*receive results by email and
*review quiz results in a results database

Three versions of the software are available:

'''Basic''': available free but limited to multiple choice questions only&lt;br&gt;
'''Standard''': all you need to create quizzes complete with 7 question types – Multiple Choice; Multiple Response; True or False; Fill in the Blank; Matching; Sequencing; Essay&lt;br&gt;
'''Professional''': fullest version of the software with added features including the partial credit question type, the plugin question type (which in effect gives you the opportunity to create almost any question type you need) – and the facility to create sections and explanation pages; add your own background and loader images and adjust image quality.

===How Help Works===

This manual contains a '''[[../Quick Start Tutorial/]]''' which should help you create your first quiz but there are also 5 chapters which describe how to use the software in more detail.  The '''[[../Extras/]]''' chapter outlines some new or different ways to use the software.  If you experiencing some difficulties you might find some useful information in the '''[[Question Writer Manual/Frequently Asked Questions|Frequently Asked Questions]]''' chapter. 

You can print this manual if you prefer.  There is an on-demand PDF and HTML version on [[../|the front page]]. Both versions are fully up to date and we recommend using the PDF version if you're printing the whole manual.

In addition you can: 

* visit the support pages of Question Writer online at http://www.questionwriter.com/support.html

* ask your own question in the Question Writer Forum at http://www.questionwriter.com/qwforum/

* check for the latest developments at the Question Writer blog at http://www.questionwriter.com/blog/

===Before you start===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Academics stand on a precipice separating our past, when genres of communication evolved slowly, and our future, when new genres emerge overnight. Our concepts of research, the authority of knowledge, and the shape of content are being radically challenged. We have difficulty imagining what dissertations or academic digital libraries will look like ten years from now. The shape of a dissertation is evolving from the first six-page, handwritten thesis at Yale University in 1860 into a form we cannot yet predict. Today's researchers and scholars are challenging the conventions of linear texts, one-inch margins, and texts written for extremely narrow audiences. They are integrating video, audio, animation, and graphics into their works. They are creating interactive elements, including real-time video, pivot tables, and online writing spaces.

The power of ETDs is rooted in access. No longer are theses and dissertations just an academic hurdle, a last step in the arduous process of graduate education. Instead, ETDs are a meaningful connection with significant readers. Collaborative author tools enable faculty to serve on dissertation committees at universities distant from their home campuses and using tools such as NetMeeting to mentor students from a distance. Rather than accepting their research and scholarship will be read only by a select few (i.e., their committees), graduate students can now expect many readers.

Predicting the future of academic scholarship is a little like predicting the stock market: both are volatile and unpredictable. Given this fact, however, it appears that there are a number of emerging trends that will affect our enterprise:
*Dissertations will matter more than they have in the past. Thanks to digital libraries, which increase access (http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/data/somefacts.html) from one or two readers to sometimes more than 60,000, students and universities will pay greater attention to the quality of students' research and writing.
*Given this increased access, both students and universities may begin to pay greater attention to the quality of scholarly writing.
*Progressive universities will use their digital libraries of ETDs to market their programs, and universities will provide the resources students need to write multimedia research.
*Multimedia documents will transform author-reader relations. Authors will interact synchronously with readers, create different reading paths for different readers, and use visuals, animation, and pivot tables.
*Students will increasingly search the worldwide digital libraries of ETDs, resulting in research that is more collaborative and more current.
*Across disciplines, students will provide links that clarify the significance, methodology, and findings of their work to a broader range of readers, including lay audiences, thereby helping the general public better understand the value of academic scholarship. As an example, students in the social sciences can incorporate video of cultures and primary subjects; they can create polyvocal case studies and ethnographies - that is, studies with alternative interpretations.
*Faculty members will work more collaboratively with students, resulting in more complete bibliographies and saved time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ETDs are intimately connected with libraries. The first key automation of libraries, launched in the 1980s, involved computerization of the card catalogs. Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) were
developed, and supported search through records describing library holdings.

Many library catalogs have their holdings encoded according to the MARC (machine readable cataloging) standard. Managed by the US Library of Congress, the MARC standard in the USA has been applied in many other contexts, leading to broader standards like UNIMARC. The latest standard as of 2001 is MARC 21.

VTLS, Inc. (http://www.vtls.com), is one company that sells software (e.g., their Virtual system, which works with MARC) and services to support catalog search and other related library requirements. OPACs in many cases have evolved into sophisticated digital libraries, and can be used to help manage ETD collections. Indeed, ETDs at most universities can be found by searching in the local catalog system, as long as one can distinguish this genre or type of work from other holdings (e.g., books, journals, maps).

VTLS has volunteered equipment, software, staff, and services to help NDLTD. From http://www.vtls.com/ndltd one can gain access to a system affording search and browse support to the union catalog of all ETDs that can be harvested using the mechanisms supported in the Open Archives Initiative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Apart from the ADT Program support processes described above, local workflow and policies within the 
ADT membership will vary. Typically, what is most common across all members is that the libraries are 
driving the ADT Program through their respective institutions, providing all levels of support and 
provision of information, and that only research theses are acceptable - i.e. PhD or Masters by research.  
What is less common is the local procedures insofar as how theses are deposited to the local server, who 
has the authority to approve/make public and administer the program and how the ADT theses are 
integrated within the local IT infrastructure. Access to theses also varies between institutions. While most 
encourage and actively support free and unrestricted access, some take a much more conservative 
approach and restrict all theses to the local domain. Obviously, all institutions will apply some temporary 
restrictions to access if required, for reasons of patents pending, copyright and upcoming publications. 
 
An example of workflow, policies &amp; procedures at The University of New South Wales [UNSW] 
Library is as follows: 
*UNSW Library provide support as required, see 3.4.1. above. 
*When theses are deposited, auto alerts are sent to the student, supervisor, the ADT coordinator and the cataloguers 
*The cataloguers are responsible for checking the theses are original and have been awarded. They edit the metadata to include appropriate thesaurus terms/subject headings. The cataloguers are also responsible for approving the theses and making them public. They also catalogue the theses into the local OPAC and the National Bibliographic Database.  These ETDs are then available via the national distributed ADT database, the local view of the ADT database [i.e. UNSW-ETDs only], the local OPAC and the National Bibliographic database.  Most are available unrestricted with a few restricted to the local domain due to copyright reasons 
*Two separate units are responsible for the ADT Program at UNSW Library. The General Services Department's Learning Support Unit provides all support, promotion and associated information. The cataloguing department is responsible for administration of the ETDs when deposited to the server. The ADT coordinator at UNSW is also the overall coordinator and is responsible for liaising and guiding the program at the national level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== National ==
 
For universities, it seems most practical to participate in national ETD 
initiatives. For those initiatives it is advisable that the National Library, 
which is often in charge of archiving the country’s literature, takes a 
leading role. We see those approaches in Germany within the Dissertation 
Online Initiative or in Canada. The national library as a central point, 
organising not only the archive structure but also the cooperation between 
universities may serve as a central entry point to the ETD initiative for 
interested parties. 
 
Principal tasks of a so called central coordination bureau for national ETD 
initiatives are: 
*providing a coordination structure for the cooperation of universities for political, organisational, technological and educational issues and developments 
*providing an organizational concept for funding local or regional initiatives, therefore negotiating and cooperating with national funding agencies 
*defining special interest and working groups in which representatives from universities can participate 
*organizing workshops for participating universities covering special topics in order to discuss and solve particular problems 
*cooperating with the international initiatives, e.g. NDLTD, Cybertheses, MathDissInternational or PhysDiss. 
 

In France, a national program for ETDs has been initiated by the Ministry 
of Education. The electronic deposit shall be compulsory within the end of 
the year. The organisational scheme adopted is defined as follows:
*each university will be in charge of the conversion of its theses and dissertation into an archiving format (SGML/XML). 
*associations of institutions may allow the mutualization of human and technical resources. 
*a national institution, the Association des Bibliothèques de l'Enseignement Supérieur (ABES) (approximative translation: Association of Universitary Libraries) has been designated as the national central bureau. 
 

The following text was taken from Prof. Peter Diepold (Sourcebook for 
ETDs) 
 
In 1996 four German learned societies - comprising the fields of 
chemistry, informatics, mathematics, and physics - signed a formal 
agreement to collaborate in developing and using digital information and 
communication technologies (ICT) for their members, scientific authors 
and readers. The objectives of this collaboration were 
*'''on a local level''': to bring together the activities of individual - and often isolated - university researchers and teachers in the various academic fields
*'''nation wide''': to join forces in voicing the interests and needs of scientific authors and readers toward the educational administration, granting agencies, research libraries, documenting agencies, publishing houses and media enterprises
*'''globally''': to use the widespread international contacts of the learned societies to exchange concepts, development and solutions and adopt them to the specific needs within one's own field
 

The initiative soon caught public attention, leading to the enlargement of 
the group. Since then, the learned societies in the fields of education, 
sociology, psychology, biology, and electronic engineering have also 
committed themselves to the advancement of the goals of the ``IuK- 
Initiative''. (IuK stands for ``Information und Kommunikation'' in German). 

Funds were granted for three years by the Federal Ministry of Education 
and Research, `Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) 
(www.bmbf.de). 
 
One major project within this initiative was the Dissertation Online project, 
undertaken from April 1998 until October 2000. The activities of one of the 
workgroups led to a proposal to the German Research Foundation (DFG) 
to fund an interdisciplinary project to present dissertations online on the 
Internet, involving five universities (Berlin, Duisburg, Erlangen, Karlsruhe, 
and Oldenburg), and five academic fields, chemistry, education, 
informatics, mathematics, and physics.. DFG stands for ``Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (http://www.dfg.de/) and is Germany's National 
Science Foundation. Funding was initially restricted to one year. 
 
The first phase started in the spring of 1998 and was terminated in March 
1999 with a conference held in Jena, Germany, provoking much attention 
among librarians and academics. Though an infrastructure had been set 
up and a number of problems were solved, much remained to be done. 
Therefore a subsequent proposal to DFG was drafted. DFG funds were 
awarded for a second year, this time with a heavy emphasis on the 
collaboration with libraries and university computing centers. The project's 
research and development extended from May 1999 to October 2000. 
The overall volume of both grants was some US \$ 700,000.  New 
participants in the second proposal are computing centers and German 
National Library, ``Die Deutsche Bibliothek'' (DDB) (http://www.ddb.de/) . 
The project was directed by Prof. Peter Diepold, professor of computer 
uses in education at Humboldt University, Berlin. 
(Email:peter@diepold.de) 

Later, this project was made into a national initiative with the German 
National Library as leading partner, who established a buereau for 
coordination.

== Regional ==


South America??


== Discipline Specific ==


Discipline specific initiatives focus on bringing researchers and scholars 
from single research fields together. In the past this has been a very 
successful way to establish active communities.  These initiatives give 
members of those communities the benefit of making problems such as 
those that arise within global or national or generally spoken 
interdisciplinary approaches or even very small discipline specific 
problems easier to solve. Therefore discipline specific approaches may 
reach results faster and more easily than broader projects. 


PhysNet 

The PhysNet Service exists within the Physnet initiative. PhysNet - the 
worldwide Network of Physics Departments and Documents - provides a 
set of information services for physicists. PhysNet is a distributed 
information service. It uses the information found on the web-servers of 
the worldwide distributed physics institutions and departments of 
universities as a distributed database. The restriction to those professional 
institutions which are accepted by the learned societies ensure the quality 
and relevance of the offered information. PhysNet serves only 
professional specific information posted by the scientists themselves. 
Therefore PhysNet complements the services of commercial providers. All information of PhysNet is kept, stored and maintained by its creators at 
their local institution’s server or individual homepage. The creators retain 
all rights to their data. PhysNet only gathers and processes the locally 
available information of physics institutions to make them globally 
accessible. PhysNet is a noncommercial service. The access to 
information offered by PhysNet is free to anyone. The aim of PhysNet is to 
provide a longtime stable and distributed information service for physics 
with the collaboration of many national and international societies and 
physics organisations. 
 
The PhysNet-Services are: 
*'''PhysDep''' offers a set of lists of links to nearly all Physics Institutions worldwide ordered by continent, country and town. In addition, it offers a HARVEST-based search engine to search across the listed Institutions. 
*'''PhysNet''' provides lists of links to document sources of the distributed Physics Institutions. Such document sources are, for example, preprints, research reports, annual reports, and lists of publications of local research groups and individual scientists. The service is also completed with a HARVEST-based search engine. 
*'''Journals''' lists Physics-related Journals, which are available with free fulltext on the web. A list of 'EPS Recognized Journals' is given as well. 
*'''Conferences, Workshops and Summer Schools''' offers a list of servers with Conference Lists in different fields of Physics. 
*'''PhysJobs''' offers a list of links to various physics-related job sites on the web. It also implements a search facility to search for information on these sites. 
*'''Education''' provides online educational resources for physics (e.g. Lecture Notes, Seminar Talks, Visualization and Demonstration Applets), listed by subject areas. 
*'''Links''' lists further sources of physics information on the web and information services of other fields and disciplines. 
*'''Services''' provides various related tools e.g. to enrich and improve homepages and document sources by adding correct MetaData according the international Dublin-Core standard. 

             
More specifically on the subspace PhysDoc of PhysNet: it is serving 
documents distributed around the world at Physics University 
departments. [http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/PhysNet/physdoc.html PhysDoc]. 
It comes with link lists sorted by country and town/state and institution.  
The present content is about 100.000 documents or document lists 
(publication lists). 
 
A search engine is attached http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/PhysNet/physdoc.html which went into full 
operation in early 2002, which allows to search for metadata of the 
documents (author, title, fulltext, keyword).  A specific tool of it is to search 
both in PhysDoc and in MPRESS, the respective distributed document 
system of Mathematics of the International 
Mathematical Union.  The special appeal of Physdoc is that it serves a 
ranking, and allows to find the match of a keyword to PACS classification 
numbers and its respective counterpart in MSC, the respective 
mathematical classification scheme. This matching is not by trying to find 
the same words but by serving articles of the mathematics, which a 
physicist working in the respective field would search for. 
This is a major outcome of the research programme CARMEN.

MathDissInternational 
The MathDissInternational project developed as a service within the 
MathNet initiative, set up in Germany at the Konrad Zuse institute for 
iinformation technology. Within the scope of the project MathDiss 
International, a permanent international online full-text document server 
for mathematical dissertations will be established. In this connection, 
questions concerning online presentation of the documents and the 
problems of long-term archiving (from TeX resp. LaTeX documents) will 
be considered. They include the question of how to homogenize such files 
in order to enable their later conversion into programming languages 
following XML. Furthermore, the expansion of research possibilities using 
online documents is being planned. Providing access to the tables of
contents, lists of tables and illustrations and bibliographies on the LaTeX 
level is of top priority. Because of the structure of mathematical 
documents written in LaTeX we have a lot of high quality information 
which gathers dust in the archives without being used for the retrieval of 
scientific documents. This situation should and could be changed because 
LaTeX has become a widely accepted tool in mathematical literature. 
 
The project MathDiss International will be sponsored by the DFG: 
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Foundation) 
for one year. At the end of that year, the results will be turned over to the 
State and University Library of Lower Saxony in Göttingen which has 
offered to provide the long-term support for the new Math-Net Services. 
 

The Project Program includes: 
* Complete inclusion of the dissertations through metadata and the expansion of the research possibilities using the source code. 
*Standardization of the input files in consideration of mathematical contextual structuring. 
*Integration of the services in the Math-Net by the adaptation of the project results to the standards used there. 
*The creation of forms of organization for the long-term safeguarding of the service. 
*International marketing for the worldwide opening of the service. 
*Tests on the conversion of mathematical dissertations into new mark-up languages, e.g. MathML.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The issue of plagiarism often arises among the arguments used to express skepticism with regard to 
putting theses online. In short, many people tend to think that because a digitized thesis is easily copied 
in part or in whole, it can be easily plagiarized. Consequently -so goes the reasoning - it is better to keep 
theses offline. 
 
The argument is largely false and can be refuted fairly easily. To begin with, it is easy to recall that the 
invention of the '''Philosophical Transactions''' (1665) by Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary to the Royal 
Society in London, was motivated by the issue of intellectual property. Oldenburg reasoned that if the 
research results of Scientist X. were printed in a journal (after being certified as being of good quality 
and original) and that journal was made widely available through the multiplication of copies, then 
Scientist. X would have a better chance to lie ownership claims than if he/she held back these results. By 
apparently giving away the results of his/her work, a scientist ensures his/her intellectual property most 
effectively. The ability to compare new results to already published work makes plagiarism a very risky 
business at best. 
 
Theses are not so well protected at present. Widely dispersed across many institutions in many countries 
(and languages), they are so poorly catalogued on a national or international basis that they often 
disappear from sight. This means that someone taking the time to read a thesis in a remote university in a 
country where the cataloguing is poorly organized may well be able simply to use that thesis and make it 
pass for one's own. Occasionally, such cases emerge in the literature, even in the United States despite 
the fact that the cataloguing of theses is most advanced in that country. 

The paradox of placing theses on line, especially if these theses can be harvested through some technique 
that involves full text searching can help identify analogous texts rather easily. As a result, far from 
placing the digitized theses at risk, putting them on line in a manner that optimizes their access, 
irretrievability and, therefore, visibility, offers a very efficient way to protect intellectual property and 
prevent plagiarism. In fact, it would probably be relatively easy to design software that could make 
periodic sweeps through inter-operable theses collections according to ever more sophisticated 
algorithms in order to ferret out such possible forms of plagiarism. With many languages involved, it is 
clear that no perfect solution will ever appear; however, those theses available online will be more 
protected than theses that remain poorly catalogued and are not readily available outside the institution 
from which they are issued. 
 
In effect, putting theses on-line amounts to rediscovering Oldenburg's wisdom when it comes to 
scientific intellectual property. It provides what could arguably turn out to be the best deterrent to 
plagiarism, wherever it may arise. The more theses appear on line, the fewer will be the chances of 
carrying on successful plagiarism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section looks at how electronic publication of theses and dissertations will enhance graduate education. 
Topics discussed include: improved knowledge of electronic publication technologies, greater access to 
scholarly information, wider distribution of an author's work, and student and faculty concerns. 


==Introduction==

The move by Graduate Schools to allow or even require students to submit theses and dissertations as 
electronic or digital documents (ETDs) creates much excitement, both positive and negative, among the 
students and faculty who will be affected by this initiative to digitize these important documents. These 
positive and negative views will no doubt be tempered by increased knowledge of the ETD process and 
through increased experience in creating and archiving ETDs. At this time in the development of the 
ETD process, I believe the importance of an open-minded approach to this new way of expressing the outcomes of masters and doctoral research is captured very well in the following statement by Jean- 
Claude Guédon in his work, Publications électroniques (1998):  
 
When print emerged, universities failed to recognize its importance and almost managed to marginalize 
themselves into oblivion.  With a new major transition upon us, such benign neglect simply will not do.  
Yet the challenges universities face in responding to an increasingly digitized and networked world are 
staggering.  Universities need a vision allowing them to express their dearest values in new forms, rather 
than protect their present form at the expense of their most fundamental values.  
 
The ETD initiatives now under way in universities around the world are about bringing fundamental 
change to our current concept of what constitutes a thesis or a dissertation. In the U.S., this concept has 
not changed significantly since students first began to submit paper theses and dissertations in our first 
research universities over 120 years ago. By moving from a paper presentation of research results to a 
digital presentation, we make available to the ETD author a powerful array of presentation and 
distribution tools. These tools allow the author to reveal to masters and doctoral committees, to other 
scholars, and to the world, the results of their research endeavors in ways and with a level of access never 
before possible.


==Changes in Presentation==

I believe graduate schools and faculty, in the name of maintaining quality, have all too often inhibited the 
creativity of graduate students by forcing them into a mold to which they must all conform. This is 
nowhere more evident than in the thesis or dissertation where format restrictions abound. Some graduate 
schools have special paper with printed margins within which all written material must be contained. 
Some graduate schools still read and edit the entire text of every thesis or dissertation. Many have thesis 
or dissertation editors whose reputation for using fine rulers and other editorial devices for enforcing 
graduate school format are legendary. 
 
I believe that the student must submit a high quality document that is legible, readable, and that conveys 
the results of the research or scholarship in a manner that is clear and informative to other scholars. The 
document does not, however, need to be narrowly confined to a specific format if it meets the above criteria. To create a high quality ETD students must be information literate. That is, they must, at a 
minimum, have a level of knowledge of office software that will allow them to create a document that if 
printed would result in a high quality paper document. This kind of properly formatted digital document 
thus becomes the primary construct of the author, rather than a paper document. In conducting training 
workshops for Virginia Tech students, a number of which are older non-traditional students, we have 
found that this lack of office software skills is the single greatest impediment to their being able to 
produce a good &quot;vanilla&quot; ETD—that is, an ETD that has the appearance of a paper ETD, but is submitted 
as a digital document. 
 
As early 1999 about 80% of Virginia Tech's 1500 ETDs are vanilla ETDs. Accordingly, we have 
emphasized the development of these skills, which number less than ten and can be taught in an hour, in 
our student ETD workshops. Once the student has the fundamental skills to produce an ETD, they are 
ready, if they desire, to move on to more advanced topics for producing a visually and audibly enhanced 
ETD. Advanced topics include landscape pages; multimedia objects like graphs, pictures, sound, movies, 
simulations; and reader aids like internal and external links, thumbnail pages, and text notes. Students are 
not required to use these enhancement tools, but by giving them access to these tools we open creative 
opportunities for students to more clearly express the outcomes of their masters or doctoral research. 
 
To maintain quality, the student's thesis or dissertation committee must actively participate as reviewers 
in this process and must be prepared to exercise judgment concerning the suitability of material for 
inclusion in the ETD. The resulting &quot;chocolate ripple&quot; or in some cases &quot;macadamia nut fudge&quot; ETDs are 
the forerunners of a new genre of theses and dissertations which will become commonplace in the future. 
 
Whether tomorrow's graduate students are employed inside or outside the university environment, the 
ubiquitous presence and use of digital information will certainly be a major part of their future careers. 
For this reason efforts to increase the information literacy are certain to benefit graduate students long 
after they have used these skills to produce a thesis or a dissertation. 


==Valuable Content==

The traditional view is that the doctoral dissertation and less so the masters thesis provides a one time 
opportunity for the student to do an in depth study of an area of research or scholarship and to write at 
length about the topic, free of the restrictions on length imposed by book and journal editors. Such writings may contain extensive literature reviews and lengthy bibliographies. They may also contain 
results of preliminary studies or discussions of future research directions that would be very valuable to 
the researchers and scholars who follow. Primarily because of restrictions on the length of journal 
articles, such information exists only in theses and dissertations. I believe this view is correct and should 
be maintained in the digital thesis or dissertation. 


==Access and Attitudes==

The attitudes of students and faculty toward the value of theses and dissertations vary greatly. For the 
reasons given above some value them highly. Others, particularly some faculty, see them as requirements 
of graduate schools that have little value. These individuals consider the journal publication the primary 
outcome of graduate student research. I do not dispute the added value of the peer review process for 
journal articles and for books, yet I do firmly believe that so long as the scholar or researcher using ETDs 
as information sources recognizes theses and dissertations for what they are, these documents are 
valuable sources of information. 
 
Indeed, these information sources have been grossly underutilized because of the difficulty in obtaining 
widely available, free access to them either through university libraries or through organizations like 
University Microfilms.  If a comprehensive worldwide networked digital library of theses and 
dissertations existed, I believe the impact and utilization of these sources of information would rise in 
proportion to the increased access. This view is supported by experience at Virginia Tech in our ETD 
project. Research done in 1996 by the Virginia Tech library showed that the average thesis circulated 
about twice a year and the average dissertation about three times a year in the first four years they were 
in the library. These usage statistics do not include the use of copies housed in the home departments of 
the students or the usage of dissertations in the University Microfilms collection. Even so, the usage of 
the 1500 ETDs in our digital library far outpaces the use of paper documents. 
 
Growth in usage has been steady and remarkable. For the calendar year 1998 there were over 350,000 
downloads of the PDF files of the 1500 ETDs that were in the VT library. This is over 200 downloads for 
each ETD in the collection. The distribution of the interest in the ETDs is equally remarkable. The 
majority of the interest comes from the U.S with inquiries in 1998 coming from the following domains: 
250,000 from .edu, 88,000 from .com, 27,000 from .net, 6,800 from .gov, and 3400 from.mil. Inquiries 
also come from countries around the world including the 8,100 from the United Kingdom, 4,200 from 
Australia, 7,300 from Germany, 3,900 from Canada, and 2,200 from South Korea.  The most accessed 
ETDs have been accessed tens of thousands of times with many over one thousand accesses. To learn more about accesses see 
http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/data/somefacts.html 


==Publication and Plagiarism==

When the ETD project began at Virginia Tech, some students and faculty expressed great concern that 
publishers would not accept derivative manuscripts or book manuscripts from ETDs. For some 
publishers this concern is legitimate and the ETD project has put into place a system for students and 
advisors to restrict access to ETDs until after journal articles appear. This system seems to satisfy faculty, 
students and publishers. Publishers that have discussed this matter with us usually have not expressed 
concern with the release of the ETD after the journal article is published. One exception may be small 
scholarly presses that publish books derived from ETDs. These presses view the book as having a sales 
life of several years after the initial date of publication. In these cases, it may be necessary to extend the 
period of restricted access well beyond the publication date of the book. 

For the longer term, however, it is important that researchers and scholars regain control of their work by 
becoming more knowledgeable about their rights as original creators and as holders of the copyrights to 
the work. This requires universities to have active programs to educate their faculty and students about 
copyright. Publishers also need to be educated to be less concerned about ETDs interfering with the 
marketability of their journals. This can be done, in part, by an effort on the part of researchers and 
scholars to educate publishers of their professional journals. They need to help persuade journal editors 
that ETDs most often are not the same as the journal articles derived from them, and that there is a 
serious difference because they have not been subject to the stamp of approval that is the result of peer 
review. As such they should not be considered a threat to the news value or to the sales potential of the 
journal. It is interesting to note that a Virginia Tech survey of students who had released their ETDs 
worldwide showed that twenty students had published derivative manuscripts from the ETDs with no 
publisher resistance to accepting the manuscripts. 

It is also noteworthy that the American Physical Society has a practice of sharing electronic copies of 
preprints of manuscripts undergoing peer review (http://xxx.lanl.gov/).  Those that successfully pass 
peer review are published in the Society's journals. This practice is essentially the same as the practice 
being proposed for ETDs above. 

The risk of plagiarism is next on the list of concerns of students and faculty. We do not yet have enough 
experience with ETDs to speak authoritatively about this issue. If one thinks a bit about it though, it 
seems that the risks of exposure of plagiarism will deter such activity.  Most researchers and scholars still work in fields where a fairly small group of workers have detailed knowledge of their work. It follows that because of the size of the field and because of the ease of detecting plagiarized passages in electronic 
documents, the risks of detection will make wide spread plagiarism unlikely. 

More disconcerting to me is the closely related concern of researchers and scholars that by reading their 
students ETDs, other researchers and scholars will achieve a competitive edge in the contest for grants 
and contracts. Most research in U.S. universities is done in the name of supporting the well being of the 
nation and is being sponsored directly or indirectly with public tax dollars.  There is something wrong 
with a view that research and scholarship should not be shared among other researchers and scholars for 
the above reasons. Yet the concern is understandable in today's financially stretched research universities 
where the competition for promotion and tenure among young faculty is fierce. Similarly, faculty are 
encouraged to develop intellectual property in which the university claims a share. I'm not sure if we 
have gone too far down this road, but I am concerned that our obligation as scholars to make our work 
known to other scholars is being compromised. A result of this compromise is that the goal of scholars to 
advance knowledge through sharing knowledge may also be slowed. 


==How Virginia Tech implemented the ETD Requirement==

ETD discussions with the Graduate Dean, the Library, and Ed Fox, a faculty member conducting 
research on digital libraries, began in 1991. At that time we were exploring the possibilities of optional 
submission. Shortly thereafter Adobe Acrobat® software for creating and editing Portable Document 
Format (PDF) files came on the market. This software for the first time provided a tool that was easy to 
use and allowed documents to be moved between computer operating systems and platforms while 
retaining the original document formatting. This was a great step forward in increasing worldwide access 
to information while retaining the original author's formatting style. At this time we began a pilot study 
to determine if the Acrobat® met our needs. We determined rather quickly that it was the most suitable 
product for our needs at that time. In my opinion that conclusion holds true today.
 
We continued discussions with the Graduate School and the Library and in the Fall of 1995 concluded 
that we would seek to make the submission of ETDs a requirement of the Graduate School. We took a 
proposal to the Commission on Graduate Studies and Policies for discussion. A degree standards 
subcommittee discussed the proposal amongst themselves then with ETD team members, Ed Fox from 
Computer Science, Gail McMillan from the Library, and John Eaton from the Graduate School. In these 
discussions the expressed concerns dealt with archiving and preservation, the burden to the students and 
the burden to the faculty and departments. After full discussion, the subcommittee recommended 
approval of the proposal. The commission discussed and approved the proposal, subject to the following 
provisions. 

*That a student training process be conducted to show students how to produce an ETD. 
*That necessary software (Adobe Acrobat®) be made available to students in campus computer labs. 
*That the faculty not be burdened by this process. 
*That a faculty/graduate student advisory committee be established to  advise the Commission on Graduate Studies and Policies on the ETD project. 
 
With these provisions agreed to, the Commission approved a one year voluntary submission period to be 
used for beginning the student ETD workshops, informing the university community, and development 
of the infrastructure needed to move to requiring ETDs, after which ETDs would become a requirement 
in the spring semester of 1997. All went very smoothly while the process was voluntary. Workshops 
were started, software was placed in campus computer labs, visits were made to departments, articles 
were published in the campus newspaper, and the advisory committee was formed. 
 
Late in the spring semester of 1997, after the mandatory requirement began, a small but vocal group of 
faculty, mostly from the life sciences and chemistry expressed a serious concerns about compromising 
the publication of derivative manuscripts from ETDs made available world wide. While we had a 
provision for withholding release of ETDs pending publication of manuscripts, the time period of six 
months was thought to be short.  The ETD team responded to this concern by giving the student and the 
advisor greater control of the access to the ETD through the ETD approval form which can be found at 
http://etd.vt.edu/.   The modifications made to the ETD approval form seem to have satisfied faculty 
concerns about publication, and since that date the ETD project has operated very smoothly at Virginia 
Tech and is now rapidly becoming and integral part of graduate education. 


==Conclusion==

The ETD project has provided the opportunity for fundamental change in the expression of and access to 
the results and scholarship done by students in research universities around the world. These tools also 
can easily be extended to the expression of and access to research done by faculty. As scholars, we 
should not let this opportunity slip by. As Jean-Claude Guédon said &quot;Benign neglect simply will not do&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One benefit of ETDs is a reduction in the needless repetition of investigations that
are carried out because people are unaware of the findings of other students who
have completed a TD. Except in unusual cases, masters’ theses are rarely reported
in databases (e.g., very few, except those from Canada, appear in UMI services
like Dissertation Abstracts). Few dissertations prepared outside North America
are reported either. With a globally accessible collection of ETDs, students can
quickly search for works related to their interest from anywhere in the world, and
in most cases examine and learn from those studies without incurring any cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The quality of a university is reflected by the quality of its students’ intellectual products.  Theses and 
dissertations reflect an institution’s ability to lead students and support original work.  In time, as digital 
libraries of ETDs become more commonplace, students and faculty will make judgments regarding the 
quality of a university by reviewing its digital library.  Universities that incorporate new literacy tools, 
such as streaming multimedia, will attract students who hope to produce innovative work. 

Starting an ETD program is like starting any other project:  a need for the results must exist so all those 
involved will be motivated and committed through all the steps to the end--the moment when ETDs have 
become a regular and consolidated activity in the graduate programs of the University. 

ETDs are based on the joint work of graduate students, mentors, graduate deans, administrative staff, 
library staff and the IT team. The success of the implementation of the ETD program requires the 
commitment of all these players plus that of the university’s higher administrative officers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Joining and participating in the Networked Digital Library of Theses 
and Dissertations, NDLTD is one of the best ways to understand 
the concepts regarding digital libraries. It directly involves students 
pursuing graduate education by having them develop their theses 
or dissertations (TDs) as electronic documents, that is, as electronic 
theses or dissertations (ETDs). 
 
There are two main types of ETDs. One type, strongly preferred 
since students learn (by doing) as they create them, are author- 
created and submitted works. In other words, these are documents 
that are prepared by the (student) author (as is typical in almost all 
cases) using some electronic tools (e.g., Microsoft Word, LaTeX.), 
and then are submitted in their approved and final electronic form 
(to their university or agent thereof). Typically, the raw form of the 
document (e.g., in Word's &quot;.doc&quot; format) is converted into a form 
that is easy to preserve, archive, and make accessible for future 
readers (e.g., that follows standards, such as PDF or XML). That 
form is submitted, typically over a network connection, usually with 
related metadata (i.e., &quot;data about data&quot;, often cataloging 
information as one might find in a library catalog, including title, 
year, author, abstract, and descriptors). Once submitted, such 
ETDs can be &quot;discovered&quot; by those interested, as a result of 
searching or browsing through the metadata, or by full text 
searching through the full document (text, and maybe even multimedia components, like images, video, or music). 
 
The second type of ETD is typically an electronic file that is created 
(usually by university or service company staff) by scanning in the 
pages of a paper thesis or dissertation. The resulting ETDs are 
much less desirable than the abovementioned type: they require 
much more storage space, they do not easily support full text 
searching, they cannot be flexibly manipulated (e.g., cannot be 
zoomed in on by those with poor vision), and they don't lead to the 
student authors learning about electronic publishing (to prepare 
them for electronic submission of papers, proposals, or other works 
now commonly required).  Nevertheless, such page images can be 
made accessible at low cost so that those afar can print and read a 
facsimile of the original paper pages. 
 
In the subsequent discussion, most of the focus is on the first type 
of ETD mentioned above. However, the second type is 
commonplace in projects where a retrospective capture of old 
works is desired, or where a university wishes to share its research, 
is willing to go to considerable expense in that regard, and is not 
very concerned with educating or empowering students in electronic 
publishing methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the beginning of time, our innate nature creates a desire for convenience and a desire to find new ways to create convenience. The business world is especially guilty of this characteristic as efficient operations are necessary in order to provide a profitable book of business. Over the past few decades the internet has made a grand entrance and a lasting impression on the business world. Since then, it seems, that the internet, and furthermore email, has made an even larger impression on the way business is conducted. While, seemingly enough all effects are positive, there are reasons that a company should &quot;second-guess&quot; its decision to utilize email in such heavy and reliant ways. 

While email is convenient and efficient to send a message, whether it be to someone in your clientele base, a sister company across the nation or to someone in the cubicle next to you, email can also create communication barriers that could have an everlasting effect on your business, especially concerning customer service. Email creates a way to send bills, eliminate phone calls and provide services to your customers without ever having contact with that customer. Eliminating your &quot;one-on-one&quot; contact with everyone involved in your business creates hazards such as dishonesty, miscommunication in unerstanding company policies, etc. Below are a few more adverse effects that email could have on a business as reported by Paul McFredrie, (http://www.mcfedries.com/Ramblings/email-pros-cons.asp):

     Creates an impersonal environment
     Excessive involvement (can require more attention than you can give)
     Lax in security
     &quot;Text-only&quot; (can create massive and detrimental misunderstandings)

As duly noted, email has its obvious positive effects on our business world and definitely plays a large role in its success. However, we should always be aware of the problems that can be caused as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Navigation==

The normal screen view has 4 parts:

1.	At the top there is the '''menu bar''' with drop down menus and&lt;br&gt; 
2.	a '''tool bar''' with buttons for a selection of the most frequent actions from the menu.  

The rest of the screen is split in two  -

3.	on the left is the '''action panel'''  where you can see the questions you have added in a tree structure and &lt;br&gt;
4.	on the right is the '''preview panel''' where the quiz will be displayed if preview is selected.

[[Image:QW3Basic_Navigation.png]]
 
As you take actions, eg adding a question, a properties window will pop up and you can tick boxes or enter text as required.

When you click on '''Preview''' you will get a preview of whatever you have selected so if have first clicked on the Quiz icon (in the left hand pane or Action Panel) you will be given a preview of the whole quiz.  If you have selected a particular question in the Action Panel when you click on Preview you will see a preview of that question only.  

You can also right click on either the quiz icon or the individual questions in the tree structure and you will be able to choose an action from a drop down menu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using Trigger to Add BBcode or Other Text to Input or Textarea Controls ==

Here is a simple way to use a button (trigger) to add commonly used text to your xforms-input or xforms-textarea controls. This could be many things such as BBcode (bold/unbold codes), date-time stamps, frequently used formatted text such as a letterhead, signature blocks, special codes that aren't easy to remember-- all depending on the purpose of your form and your specific needs.

== Link to working XForms Application ==

[http://ztags4xforms.com/misc/testInsert.xhtml  Load Example XForms Application]


A more advanced example for inserting at the beginning or end of text (with some additional code inserts such as links and images)

[http://ztags4xforms.com/misc/testInsert1.xhtml  Load Example XForms Application]

== Program Structure ==
For simplification, we are using a single &lt;text/&gt; element in our model/instance to hold our example input. The style is not really necessary other than to give one a larger text area to test with.

The real power, and simplicity, of the form is in the value attribute of the xforms-setvalue element which itself is placed inside an xforms-trigger:

   value=&quot;concat(//text,'whatever you desire goes here')&quot;

== Sample Program ==
&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;html 
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; 
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot; 
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot;&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Insert BB code&lt;/title&gt;
         &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;  &lt;!--mozilla specific style--&gt;
         @namespace xf url('http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms');
         xf|textarea .xf-value{ width:25em; height:20ex; }
         &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;xf:model&gt;
         &lt;xf:instance&gt;
            &lt;data xmlns=&quot;&quot;&gt;    
               &lt;text/&gt;
            &lt;/data&gt;
         &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
      &lt;/xf:model&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;xf:trigger&gt;&lt;xf:label&gt;Bold&lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;DOMActivate&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;//text&quot; value=&quot;concat(//text,'[b][/b] ')&quot;/&gt; 
            &lt;xf:setfocus control=&quot;textArea&quot;/&gt;     
         &lt;/xf:action&gt;
      &lt;/xf:trigger&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;xf:textarea id=&quot;textArea&quot; ref=&quot;//text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;xf:label&gt;Post:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
      &lt;/xf:textarea&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Discussion ==
This solution will only append the inserted code/text to the end of the current text in the text box. To have it always at the beginning, simply change the order of the arguments in your concat function (see the second example link above).

Limitation: This solution cannot insert code/text into the middle of the current text in the text box.



You can use html entities to do complex formats like a letterhead (if you need to preserve space or bold etc..)
(!!note: the ampersand-&amp; is replaced by the percent-% as I couldn't figure out how to escape html   entities in this wikibook)
&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;//text&quot; value=&quot;concat(//text,'
      %lt;div xmlns=%quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml%quot;%gt;
         %lt;p%gt;%lt;b%gt;Testing insert with HTMLentities%lt;/b%gt;
         %lt;/p%gt;
         %lt;p%gt;%lt;i%gt;Testing Insertwith HTMLenitites%lt;/i%gt;
         %lt;/p%gt;
         %lt;pre%gt;     Indent Here%lt;/pre%gt; 
      %lt;/div%gt;')&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In such a case, make sure your xforms-output has a mediatype attribute like so:

&lt;code&gt;
   &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;//text&quot; mediatype=&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Quick Start Tutorial==
This Quick Start Tutorial takes you through the 5 basic steps you need to take to create a new quiz.  Once you have created your quiz you can go back over the menu options and add whatever refinements you want.

[[Image:QW3five_stages.jpg|center]]
 
At any point in your work you can preview how your quiz will look by clicking on the '''Preview''' button.&lt;br&gt;


 [[Image:QW3Preview.png|center]]


----


===Step 1 – Set up a new quiz===

When you first open Question Writer you will see the following screen:
 
 [[Image:QW3first_screen.png|center]]


Most of the screen appears blank but at the top there is the '''title bar''' (which tells you that you have opened Question Writer and which version); a '''menu bar''' with 3 menu options and below that a '''tool bar''' with 2 buttons.  

To start creating your first quiz, click on the button '''New Quiz'''.  

 [[Image:QW3New_quiz_icon.png|center]]

----

===Step 2 - Add Questions===

Simply click on the '''add question''' button on the menu bar 

 [[Image:QW3Add_question.png|center]]

and select the type of question you want to use.

[[Image:QW3add question fullscreen.jpg|center]]


Or click on the relevant question button on the tool bar


 [[Image:QW3Question_buttons.png|center]]


When you select the question type a '''properties''' window will open.  As well as entering the specific details of the question and answer, the properties window for each question type gives you the option to add an image, set the score and decide on the appropriate feedback for that particular question.


[[Image:QW3 Multiple choice2.jpg|center]]


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

----

===Step 3 – Choose a Theme===

Both the '''Standard''' and '''Professional''' version of Question Writer come with a range of themes.  To add or change the theme of your quiz you just select '''Theme''' from the menu bar or click the '''Switch Themes''' button.   A list of themes will appear and you can select whatever seems appropriate to you.  If you double click on the theme a dialogue box will appear telling you that the theme has been changed.  

[[Image:QW3Themes.png|center]]


You can then '''Preview''' the quiz to see how it looks.


[[Image:Preview fairy tales.png|center]]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

----

===Step 4 – Save your Quiz===

As with all Windows software to save your file simply select '''File''' and '''Save''' (or '''Save As''' if you wish to change the name) from the menu bar or click on the '''Save Quiz''' button on the tool bar.  All quizzes are saved with a .qwz extension.

[[Image:QW3Save.png|center]]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

----

===Step 5 – Publish your Quiz===
To publish your quiz online select '''Publish''' from the menu bar.  You are given a variety of options:  

If you select '''Publish for the Web''', Question Writer will create HTML files for you to publish your quiz.

If you select '''Publish to Question Writer Tracker''', your quiz will be available online immediately and you will be given a link to post on your website or to send to your quiz takers.

If you select '''Publish for Printing''' Question Writer will create a set of HTML documents showing the quiz and the feedback for you to print.

If you select '''SCORM1 .2''', Question Writer will create a file for export to SCORM

If you select '''Questions in Text Format''', Question Writer will create a text file containing all of your questions in text format.  You can amend this file (as long as you respect the formatting) and then [[../Extras/Importing Questions/text format|re-import]] it to Question Writer. This option is only available if you are using Question Writer Professional.

If you select '''Inside PDF''' your quiz will be published to a pdf file.  This option is only available if you are using Question Writer Professional.

If you select '''QTI 1.2''' Question Writer will create a set of files specially formatted to be compatible with QTI 1.2 which can then be used in other systems.  This option is only available if you are using Question Writer Professional.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

There is more information on all of these options in the [[../Save and Publish|Save and Publish Chapter]].

How do we feel about having a template like [[User:Mike.lifeguard/Sandbox 4]] instead of this page - users add the template to their userpage, which categorizes it. Once it's done (or not) the template just gets moved from their userpage to an archive somewhere. I imagine if that's at all a good idea the template would need tweaking - perhaps more/other tools should be linked? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:23, 12 June 2008 (UTC)
:I'm not necessarily against this idea. However, the problem for me is that I tend to check my watchlist for these requests, and they aren't going to show up at all on the watchlist if we're using templates and categories. It is a pretty template, however. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:26, 12 June 2008 (UTC)
::Well, you can do a DPL page and/or add the category to [[WB:ACW]].
::BTW, where are we archiving these to? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:52, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

::::OK, I'm archiving them to the appropriate month for [[WB:AA]] (ie [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance/Archives/2008/June]] for the last set I archived]]).

== The rename link ==

This link will bring you to a filled [[Special:RenameUser]] form with the fields filled. The reason will be &quot;[[WB:RENAME]]: http://en.wikibooks.org/?diff=prev&amp;oldid=123456&quot; - to make this work, just do {{tlx|done}} or whatever on the request, ''then'' hit the rename link (the diff will be that edit where you added {{tlx|done}} so it is easy to find the request).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOC right}}
In CME, chapter 8, SPT discusses how Newton used a dot over
a variable to indicate differentiation while Liebniz used
the notation in this book: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.
The advantage to Liebniz's notation is that it explicitly
states which independent variable is to be considered when
differentiation occurs (in case there is more than one independent
variable).&lt;ref&gt;
As SPT points out, the dot notation is used with the assumtion that
differentiation is performed with respect to time ''t''. Hence, the
name of this chapter.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if 

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3x^2 - 5 &lt;/math&gt;

then

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, differentiating with respect to ''t'' instead of
''x'' gives:

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 5&lt;/math&gt; is considered a constant with respect to the independent
variable ''t''. That is to say, no matter how much you change the value
of ''t'', the value of &lt;math&gt;3x^2 - 5&lt;/math&gt; doesn't change (since you are not changing ''x'', just ''t'').

We have been assuming, up until now, that the independent variable and
the variable with respect to which we take derivatives are one and the
same.

Let's investigate what our code might look like if we did not
make that assumption.

==An unassuming differentiation system==

Based upon our visualization for the term constructor, we have
been assuming the independent variable is ''x'', because we
end up with visualization like:

    3x^2

If we don't hard-wire the independent variable, we will need
to pass it in. Here is a skeleton of a version of ''term'' where
the name of the independent variable is to be passed in:

    function term(a,iv,n)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function toString() { ... }
        function diff(wrtv) { ... }
        this;
        }

The first major difference between the new version of ''term''
and the old version is that the new ''term'' has three formal parameters,
instead of two. The second formal parameter, ''iv'', which stands
for the '''i'''ndependent '''v'''ariable, represents the
independent variable. We presume it will be
be bound to symbols such as ''x'', ''t'', and the like.
We see this in the basic ''toString'' method (the one with no simplifications)
which changes from:

    function toString() { &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;x^&quot; + n; }

to:
     
    function toString() { &quot;&quot; + a + iv + &quot;^&quot; + n; }

Note that ''x'' in the original version was part of a string
and thus fixed. In the second, ''iv'' is a variable that
is (or rather will be) bound to a symbol. Looking at a
visualization will help us sort things out:

    var t = term(5,:w,3);
     
    sway&gt; t . toString();
    STRING: 5w^3

The second major change is that the differentiation method, ''diff'',
now takes an argument, ''wrtv'', which stands for the
'''w'''ith-'''r'''espect-'''t'''o '''v'''ariable. This is the
variable with respect to which
differentiation should proceed. If the independent variable 
and the with-respect-to variable
are the same, differentiation proceeds as before. If not,
a constant zero is generated:

    function diff(wrtv)
        {
        if (wrtv == iv)
            {
            if(n == 0,term(0,iv,0),term(a * n,iv,n - 1));
            }
        else
            {
            constant(0); 
            }
        }

Now let's test:

    var a = t . diff(:w);   //iv and wrtv match
    var b = t . diff(:x);   //iv and wrtv do not match
     
    sway&gt; t . toString();
    STRING: 5w^3
    sway&gt; a . toString();
    STRING: 15w^2
    sway&gt; b . toString();
    STRING: 0

This output assumes the ''toString'' method of ''term'' performs
the simplifications discussed in the previous chapter.

==What about the ''value'' method?==

We do not need to change the ''value'' method for terms. This is because
a ''value'' for the independent variable is used, rather than its ''name''.
In other words, the ''value'' method performs a numeric calculation,
while
the ''diff'' method performs a symbolic calculation.
Thus, ''value'' needs
a number and ''diff'' needs a name.

Since both ''toString'' and ''diff'' use the name of a term variable
rather than a value, they both needed modification because names
are not longer hard-wired.

==Questions==

'''1'''.
What happens if we rename the formal parameter ''iv'' to be ''x'' and replace every occurrence of ''iv'' with ''x''. Explain.

'''2'''.
Redefine the simplifying ''term'' constructor so that it does not assume the independent variable to be ''x''.

'''3'''.
Redefine the simplifying ''sum'' constructor so that it does not assume the independent variable to be ''x''.

'''4'''.
Complete the unassuming differentiation system (''minus'', ''times'', and ''div'').

'''5'''.
Using sway do 2 on p. 92.

'''6'''.
Using sway do 4 and 5 on p. 92.

'''7'''.
We are doing a game to throw a beanbag into a trash can and we want
to model the physics correctly. The horizontal displacement is
&lt;math&gt; x = x_0 + v_{x_0} t &lt;/math&gt;
and the vertical displacement is
&lt;math&gt; z = z_0 + v_{z_0} t - 1/2 g t^2 &lt;/math&gt;. 
What is change of both ''x'' and ''z'' with ''t''?
Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;v_{x_0} = 3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;z_0 = 5&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;v_{z_0} = 3&lt;/math&gt;.
Plot ''x'' and ''z'',
and the velocity in ''x'' and ''z'' directions versus time from 0 to 10.

      <comment>created a basic list of maintenance tasks around here. There are more, but I can't think of them.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{User:Whiteknight/Nav}}

This page is going to contain a short and informal list of basic maintenance tasks that new volunteers can tackle if they want to get involved. This is not a complete list, and if you can find other jobs around here, let me know about them so I can add them here. A long list of resources is available at [[WB:WM]]

== Content: Authoring and Editing ==

;Start a new book: Find a subject where we don't have good coverage? Know a subject that we don't have a book for? [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|Start a new book]] and share your knowledge with the world.
;Adopt a book: We have lots of books which have been abandoned by their original authors. Find a book that nobody else is editing, and adopt it! Take over, make improvements, write new content, and try to turn an old book into a [[WB:FB|featured book]].
;Editing and Reviewing: Books need editing
;Publication: Books need print versions and PDF versions, cover pages, licensing statements, and all sorts of other things.
;Illustrate: Books need images, so pull out your graphics software and try to throw a few together. Even a bad image is better then no image at all, and we can always improve them later. A good illustration is worth a thousand words.
;Long pages: Very long pages should be broken up into subpages for ease of loading, navigation, and editing. Find the longest pages at [[Special:LongPages]] and shorten them up. Don't delete stuff, reorganize it!
;Short pages and stubs: Go through the list at [[Special:ShortPages]], and expand topics that need a little help.

== Organizing ==

;Watch [[Template:New]]: This list should only contain about 25 books at a time. When the number gets larger, remove books from the end of the list. To remove a book, take away the {{tlx|New book}} template, properly categorize the book, and add any necessary maintenance templates to keep the book in active development.
;Adopt Orphans: Go through the list of [[Special:LonelyPages|orphaned pages]]. These are pages which are not linked from anywhere else on wikibooks. Evaluate these pages, see if you can merge them into an existing book, form them into a new book, or nominate them for deletion.
;Categorization: Make sure all books are properly categorized with [[Template:Subject|subject]] and [[Template:Alphabetical|alphabetical]] templates. Use the lists at [[Special:UncategorizedPages]] to help find them. Also, consider using {{tlx|Reading level}} and {{tlx|Prerequisite}}, where appropriate.
;Subject pages: The [[WB:AS|subject pages]] are young and need all sorts of help. This can be formatting, categorizing, creating new subject pages, etc.
;Maintenance templates: Find books that need help, and add the [[User:Whiteknight/Template Cheatsheet|necessary maintenance templates]] to them. Also, if you find a maintenance template that needs rewording or redesign, start a discussion to have those changes made.

== Technical Maintenance ==

;Move images to Commons: Images that are under a free license are good candidates to be moved to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. Once an image is moved to Commons, they can be deleted here. 
;Delete duplicate images: Images that are located both here ''and'' at Wikimedia Commons can be deleted here. Find duplicate images and mark them with {{tlx|nowcommons}}
;Double-Redirects: A double-redirect is when a redirect page points to another redirect page. This can be fixed, if you can find them first. Check the list at [[Special:DoubleRedirects]], and clean out problems you find.
;Broken Redirects: Sometimes, old redirects don't point to anything at all! Find these and mark them for deletion. Use the list at [[Special:BrokenRedirects]] to help.
;Unused templates: Templates which aren't being used anymore can probably be deleted. Follow the list at [[Special:UnusedTemplates]], and mark unneeded ones for deletion.
;Unused images: Images which aren't being used need to be evaluated. If the image is free, it can be moved to Commons for use on other projects. If the image is fair use, it needs to be marked for deletion. Check the list at [[Special:UnusedImages]].
;Forgotten transwikis: Go through the pages in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&amp;from=&amp;namespace=108 transwiki namespace], and merge these stubs into existing books. Remove the unnecessary formatting, and turn them into proper Wikibooks books or pages.

== Recent Changes Patrolling ==

;RC Patrolling: Watch the list at [[Special:Recentchanges]] for suspicious edits. Alternatively, you can watch the live edit feed on IRC at irc://irc.wikimedia.org/en.wikibooks.
;Fight spam or vandalism: When you find bad edits, mark them with {{tlx|delete}}, and inform the admins at [[WB:AN]]. If you do this a lot, you should request [[WB:RFP|+rollbacker rights]] from the community.
;Welcome new users: New users who just started editing need to be properly welcomed. Send them a [[Template:welcome|nice message]] on their user talk page.
;Invite anonymous users: Anonymous users who are making productive edits should be invited to create a new account here. Use {{tlx|joinus}} if you want an easy way to do this.
;New page patrol: When a page is first created is the time when it needs the most help. Look through the logs at [[Special:NewPages]], and check for nonsense. If you do this alot, you should request [[WB:RFP|+patroller rights]] from the community.
;New images: Images are a big deal because of all the potential copyright problems. Look through the list at [[Special:NewImages]] to make sure all images are properly licensed.

== Community ==

;Answer questions: You've asked questions when you were new, now you can help answer them for other new users. You can participate in discussions in the [[WB:RR|reading rooms]], or you can put your knowledge to use by contributing to our help books: [[Using Wikibooks]], [[Wikibooks Community]], and [[Editing Wikitext]]. 
;Evaluate good books: Good books are nominated to be featured at [[WB:FBN]]. Find books to nominate, and participate in the discussions too. 
;Discuss promotions: Many long-time community members are well-trusted and can be nominated for various permissions. You can discuss these nominations at [[WB:RFP]]
;Votes for deletion: Participate in discussions at [[WB:VFD]]. Make sure you know all our [[WB:WIW|inclusion criteria]] first.</text>

      <comment>/* Anaerobic respiration */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Energy and Work=

Energy and organic molecules are required by every living organism, and are used in two ways;

:Building blocks for making other organic molecules that the organism needs.
:Chemical potential energy which can be released by breaking down the molecules in respiration.

This chemical potential energy is used in the following ways;

:Muscle contraction and other cellular movements
:Active transport of substances
:Synthesis of complex substances (anabolic reactions) from simple ones.

Energy yielding reactions in all organisms generally produce an intermediary energy molecule, ATP.

=ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)=

ATP consists of adenine (organic base) and ribose (pentose sugar), making adenosine (a nucleotide), which is then combined with three phosphate groups to make ATP, a nucleotide. It is a small water-soluble molecule, allowing easy transport. When a phosphate group is removed, [''known as Hydrolysis']' ADP is formed and it produces 30.6kJ of energy, and is a reversible reaction that allows for interconversion between ATP and ADP - the formula is below: known as phosphorylation.

:ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ↔ ADP +H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;       ΔG = ± 30.6kJ

===Energy Currency===

The cells energy yielding reactions synthesise ATP, and ATP is used by the cell in all forms of work. and the cell trades in ATP rather than using intermediates. Energy lost during energy transfers is converted to thermal energy, as well as any excess energy, if too much is produced to create ATP for example. Energy currency is immediate donor of energy to cell's energy-requiring reaction, and a storage molecule is a short-term (glucose) or long term (glycogen) store of chemical energy. ATP losses a phosphate group and forms ADP

===Synthesis===

Most ATP is synthesised using electrical potential energy, the energy from the transfers of electrons by electron carriers in mitochondria and chloroplasts. It's stored as a difference in hydrogen ion concentration across the membrane (the membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts are basically impermeable to hydrogen ions). Hydrogen ions are then allowed to flow down their concentration gradient through a transport protein, and part of this protein is ATP synthase, an enzyme that, surprisingly, synthesises ATP. The transfer of three hydrogen ions results in the production of one ATP molecule provided that ADP and a phosphate group is present inside the organelle.

==Roles==

ATP is required for various biological processes in animals including; Active Transport, Secretion, Endocytosis, Synthesis and Replication of DNA and Movement.

===Active Transport===

[[A-level_Biology/Biology_Foundation/cell_membranes_and_transport#Active_Transport|Active Transport]] is the movement of molecules defined as the energy-consuming transport of molecules or ions across a membrane against a concentration gradient, made possible by transferring energy from ATP. Most cells have sodium/potassium pumps and these are maintained by ATP, for many many things.

===Muscle Contraction===

Muscle contraction goes as such;

A sarcomere contracts by sliding the thin actin filaments over the thick myosin filaments (molecules with a flexible head, an ATPase molecule, hydrolyses ATP to ADP and phosphate)

:1. Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the myosin head to bind to the portion of actin filament next to it.
:2. This head then tilts at 45 degrees, moving the actin filament about 10nm in relation to the myosin towards the centre of the sarcomere
:3. Millions of fibres doing this at the same time makes the muscle contract, releasing ADP and phosphate
:4. Another ATP binds to the head and is again hydrolysed, and the head tilts back to it's original position
:5. When contraction ends, ATP is used to pump calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

During contraction, ATP is continually regenerated using creatine phosphate, which provides a phosphate group to ADP, allowing it to become ATP and creatine. The limited supply of creatine phosphate must be replinished via ATP from respiration. The muscle may not be able to keep up with it and a lactate pathway is used to allow continued formation of ATP, but the cells incur an oxygen debt.

=Respiration=
===Glycolysis===

This is the splitting of glucose, that eventually results in two molecules of pyruvate. ATP is used in the first stage, where glucose is phosphorylated using ATP, which allows the reaction to be easier. Glucose breaks down to hexose phosphate, which breaks down to hexose biphosphate, which breaks down to 2 molecules of triose phosphate. Hydrogen is then removed and transferred to NAD, producing two molecules of reduced NAD for each glucose molecule. The process produces 4 ATP molecules in total, in addition to the two molecules of reduced NAD, but requires 2 ATP molecules.

In summary.
Glucose &gt; Glucose-6-phosphate &gt; Fructose-1-phosphate &gt; Hexose-1,6-bi(s)phosphate &gt; 2x Triose Phosphate &gt; 2x Intermediate Compound &gt; 2x Pyruvate.

Pyruvate is then actively transported to the mitrochrondrial matrix for the link reaction.
Thus ultimately producing; 

* 2 ATP Molecules
* 2 Pyruvate Molecules
*  2 Molecules of Reduced NAD [NADH]

===Link reaction===

Pyruvate and NAD enter the link cycle which takes place  in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is decarboxylated, dehydrogenated and combined with Coenzyme A to give acetyl coenzyme A. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is produced and NAD is reduced. Acetyl coenzyme A acts as a carrier of acetyl groups to the krebs cycle.
The hydrogen removed from pyruvate is now transferred to NAD.

Thus ultimately; [as 2 molecules of Pyruvate]
* 2NADH produced
* 2 Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced

===Krebs cycle===

The krebs cycle(also known as Citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle)is a closed pathway of enzyme-controlled reactions;

:1. Acetate [from Acetyl CoA] combines with a four-carbon compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate)
:2. Citrate is decarboxylated and dehydrogenated (the hydrogens reduce both NAD and FAD), yielding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NADH and FADH.
:3. ATP is produced via SLP [Substrate Level Phosphorylation]
:4. Oxaloacetate is regenerated to combine with another acetyl coenzyme A from the link reaction.

For each turn of the krebs cycle, three NAD molecules and one FAD are reduced,2 carbon dioxide molecules are produced and one ATP molecule is generated via an intermediate compound. The hydrogen released is used in oxidative phosphorylation to provide energy to make ATP.The reactions of Krebs cycle do not make use of oxygen.However,Oxygen is required in the final stage(i.e. Oxidative phosphorylation).

===Oxidative phosphorylation===

The electron transport chain provides the energy for the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, and this takes place in the mitochondrial membranes. Reduced NAD/FAD are passed to the electron transport chain where hydrogens are removed from the two hydrogen carriers and is split into hydrogen ions and an electron. The electron is passed to a series of electron carriers whilst the hydrogen ion remains in the mitochondrial matrix. Once the electron is tranferred to oxygen, a hydrogen ion will be draw from the solution to reduce the oxygen to water.

The transfer of electrons along the series of electron carriers, passing from a higher carrier to a lower one, releasing energy, making it available to convert ADP + Phosphate to ATP. Each reduced NAD molecule produces 2.5 molecules of ATP (an average) and each reduced FAD produces 1.5 molecules of ATP (on average).               

====Chemiosmosis====

The energy from the electron transport chain is used to pump hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the area between the plasma membrane and the cristae - the concentration of hydrogen ions becomes higher than that in the matrix, a concentration gradient exists. Hydrogen ions are then allowed to pass that through protein channels that have the enzyme ATP synthase on the end, as the ions pass through their electrical energy is used to synthesise ATP. The energy of three hydrogen ions are used to phosporylate one ADP to ATP.

=Anaerobic respiration=

=== In Mammals ===

Pyruvate &gt; Lactic Acid

Pyruvate is dehydrogenated via Lactate Dehydrogenase producing Lactic Acid.
Pyruvate accepts 2H, allowing NADH &gt; NAD + 2H. This is '''very''' useful biologically for mammals, as during anaerobic respiration, the Link Reaction, Krebs Cycle and Oxidiative Phosphorylation cannot occur; as they all rely on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the products of a process that does. The biological use is that NAD is reoxidised which means it now can accept 2H in Glycolysis, this allows for 2ATP's to be released via glycolysis allowing the mammal to continue to respire and produce ATP without the presence of oxygen.

=== In Yeast ===

Pyruvate &gt; Ethanal &gt; Ethanol 
# Pyruvate is decarboxylated via Pyruvate decarboxylase to produce Ethanal [CO2 as a biproduct]
# Ethanal accepts 2H atoms from NADH thus going to Ethanol and reoxidising NAD.

Yeast is a 'facultative anaerobe' it can survive without oxygen although it is killed if the ethanol conc. exceeds 15%

=Respiratory Substrates=

The main respiratory substrates for all cells are carbohydrate usually in the form of hexose sugars such as glucose. Although glucose is not essential for all cells - a lot of cells can oxidise lipids and amino acids.

===Energy Values===

The energy liberated in aerobic respiration usually comes from the oxidation of hydrogen to water when reduced NAD and reduced FAD are passed into the electron transport chain. So the more hydrogen bonds to break, the more energy - lipids have a energy density more than double that of carbohydrates, because of their long fatty acid tails.

===Respiratory quotient===

The overall equation for aerobic respiration shows that oxygen used = carbon dioxide produced, and so they are in a 1:1 ratio. Other substrates do not do this, and it is possible to show what is being used for energy by using the respiratory quotient, which is;

&lt;math&gt;Respiratory\,Quotient = \frac{volume\,of\,carbon\,dioxide\,per\,unit\,time}{volume\,of\,oxygen\,per\,unit\,time}&lt;/math&gt;

High RQ values usually indicate that anaerobic respiration is taking place.

Well, I would be more than happy to give my permission, but I was not the original person to do this. Look for &quot;AdamisAdam&quot; on here. He did it first, I did it second and improved on his idea. I posted a much more detailed how to for it also.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to understand what is possible in human language, it is important
to look at examples from languages that are quite different from your first
language.
In this book most of the examples will come from nine languages, selected
to some extent because they are important in the modern world (English, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese) but mainly because they illustrate a wide range of possibilities.
The word (or sign) for 'language' in each of these nine languages
appears on the left side of the banner at the top of the
[[How Language Works|Table of Contents page]] of this book.
In the banners at the top of other pages, such as this one, you will see these examples as well as others from nine other languages (Hindi, Hungarian, Navajo, Persian, Russian, Samoan, Tamil, Thai, and Yoruba).
As you see examples from these nine languages later on in the book, some of them
may seem quite exotic to you, but keep in mind
that your language probably also seems equally
exotic to speakers of those languages.
Each language is introduced briefly in this section.
Some of the terms used to describe the languages will probably
not be familiar to you if you have not read the relevant sections in the book.


== Mandarin Chinese ==

In terms of both number of native speakers (about 875,000,000)
and number of first and second language speakers (about 1,050,000,000),
Mandarin Chinese is easily the most widely spoken language in the world.
The great majority of these speakers live in the People's Republic of China
(mainland China), but many others also live in the Republic of China (Taiwan)
as well as other countries where Chinese speakers have settled.
Mandarin Chinese is the official language of both mainland China and Taiwan.
The word for 'Chinese' in Mandarin, transcribed into Roman using the
''pinyin'' system, is ''zhong&amp;macr;guo&amp;rsquo; hua''&amp;lsquo;

(the marks after the syllables, usually placed directly over the vowel symbols. indicate tones).


Mandarin Chinese is one of about 10 languages or dialects that are called &quot;Chinese&quot;.
Calling them &quot;dialects&quot; emphasizes that they are all spoken in China
and that they all have a single written standard (closest to Mandarin);
Calling them &quot;languages&quot; emphasizes the large differences in pronunciation, vocabulary,
and grammar among them; I will follow this usage here.
The Chinese languages belong to the Sino-Tibetan language family, which also
includes Burmese, Tibetan, and about several hundred other languages spoken in China, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.


Like other Sino-Tibetan languages, Mandarin Chinese is a [[How Language Works/Syllables|tone language]]; it uses
pitch to distinguish words.
In Mandarin, each syllable has one of four tones: high level, mid rising, low falling-rising, and high falling.
Because Mandarin and other Chinese languages have so many one-syllable words and
because the number of possible syllables is relatively small,
many words are distinguished only by their tone.
Mandarin syllable structure is relatively simple.
The only consonants syllable can end in are /n/ and /N/, and there are no consonant clusters at the beginnings of syllables.
But Chinese pronunciation is still complicated for second-language learners because of
the tones and because there are two separate sets of consonants similar to the English
[[How Language Works/consonants1|postalveolar consonants]],
that is, the final consonants in the words ''reach'', ''ridge'', and ''rash''.



Mandarin and other Chinese languages have little or no bound morphology.
Each word has a fixed form: verbs do not take prefixes or suffixes
showing the tense or the person, number, or gender of the subject.
Nouns do not take prefixes or suffixes showing their number or their case.
This does not mean that Chinese has no grammar of course; what it means is
that Chinese grammar is mainly concerned with how words are arranged to
form meaningful sentences.
For the second language learner, it also means that ther are no grammatical
paradigms to memorize as there are for languages such as Spanish, Hindi, and
Amharic.


Chinese and its ancestor languages have been written for over 4000 years, giving
them the longest continuous
writing tradition of any group of languages in the world.
The Chinese writing system uses a complex system of characters
that is quite unlike any other writing system.
Originally all of the characters were simplifications of pictures designed to
represent the meanings of words directly.
Later, characters were created that have parts representing elements of meaning
or sound.
Each character in the modern system represents a single meaningful syllable.
To read Chinese, you need to know several thousand of these.
If you have Chinese characters on your computer, you can see the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Chinese
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/chn.htm here].


== English ==


In terms of number of native speakers (about 340,000,000),
English is among the four most widely spoken 
languages in the world (English, Spanish, and Hindi are very close in
number of native speakers).
About 510,000,000 people speak it as a first or second language (second
in the world).
In terms of its role as a language of international communication, 
science, and business, English is probably the most important
language in the world.
Most first-language speakers live in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Canada, 
Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa, but English is an 
official language of many other countries, especially in Africa and the 
Caribbean.



English is a member of the Germanic group (like German, Dutch, Swedish, 
Norwegian, Danish, and Icelandic) of the Indo-European language family.
A good deal is known about
[http://ebbs.english.vt.edu/hel/hel.html the history of the language].
The earliest period of the language, up to about 1100,
is called '''Old English'''].
Old English is so different from Modern English that we find it almost
completely uninterpretable;
it is best to treat it as a different language from Modern English.
A number of dramatic changes in vocabulary and grammar were initiated by
the conquest of England by French-speaking Normans in 1066.
The period known as '''Middle English'''] begins
soon after that and continues roughly till the year 1500, as English long
vowels were undergoing the changes known as the
[[How Language Works/Change|Great Vowel Shift]].
'''Modern English'''] is what we speak now.


English has less
bound morphology, that is, suffixes and prefixes on words, and more
rigid word order
than most other Indo-European languages.
English has a large number of
vowels, about twelve, depending on the dialect, 
and the vowel system is relatively unstable, changing frequently in the 
history of the language.
The complex phonology makes English a relatively difficult language
for adult second-language learners to learn to pronounce.



Each of the major countries in which English is spoken has its own 
(unofficial) standard dialect, though the standard dialects of the United 
States and Canada are very similar, and the standard 
dialects of Australia and New Zealand are also very similar.
England and the United States also have a number of regional or social
dialects which differ considerably from the standards.
Examples in the United States include
Southern (spoken in most of the Southeast), Northern Cities
(spoken in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee), New York, and 
African-American Vernacular English (AAVE).
American English dialects differ from each other mainly in pronunciation, but
the grammar of some varieties of AAVE is quite distinct.

== Spanish ==

In terms of number of native speakers (about 350,000,000),
Spanish is among the four most widely spoken languages in the world.
About 420,000,000 people speak it as a first or second language
(fourth in the world).
Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, including Spain
and 20 countries in the Western Hemisphere.
Mexico is the country with the most Spanish speakers.
Many first-language speakers of American Indian languages speak Spanish
as a second language.
In Spanish the language is called ''espa&amp;ntilde;ol''.


Spanish is a member of the Romance group (like French, Italian, 
Portuguese, Catalan, and Romanian) of the Indo-European family.
The Romance languages all descended from Latin.
They all have more
bound morphology, that is, prefixes and suffixes,
than English, especially on verbs.
Spanish verbs indicate tense as well as the
subjects of the verbs with suffixes.
Like most other Indo-European languages, Spanish has
grammatical gender: nouns are either masculine or feminine,
and words that modify them 
must agree with them in gender.
The dominant
word order of Spanish is
subject-verb-object, but Spanish is much more flexible than English
in this regard, and it is not
unusual for the verb to appear before the subject.


Spanish has a simpler phonological system than the other Romance languages,
including only five vowels.
This makes Spanish a relatively easy language for adult second-language 
learners to learn to pronounce.

 

The standard dialects in Spain and in the Americas differ in a number of 
ways, in much the same way as the standard English of England and the United 
States differs.
Within Spain and within the Americas, there are also many regional 
dialects; some of these, such as Mexican and Argentine Spanish, are quite 
distinct and are treated as (informal) national standards.


Spanish is written using the Roman alphabet, included accented vowel 
characters to mark stress and distinguish some words from one another.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/spn.htm Here] is the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in Spanish.


&lt;!--
== Hindi ==

In terms of number of native speakers (about 370,000,000),
Hindi is the among the four most widely spoken
languages in the world.
About 490,000,000 people speak it as a first or second language (third
in the world).
Along with English, Hindi is an official language of India.
In India, states also have official languages, and Hindi is the language of
six of these.


Hindi belongs to the Indo-Aryan group of languages within the Indo-European family,
the same family that English and Spanish belong to.
Hindi is closely related to Urdu, spoken as a native language by about 60,000,000 people
in India and Pakistan and an official language of Pakistan, and it is possible
to consider Hindi and Urdu as dialects of a single language.
Unlike Hindi, Urdu is written in a script based on the Arabic script, and more of
its vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic and Persian.


Compared to English, Hindi has a relatively complicated set of consonants.
For a given [[How Language Works/Consonants1|place of articulation]], for example, bilabial, English has two stops, a voiceless (/p/) and
a voiced one (/b/), whereas Hindi has four, voiceless unaspirated (/p/), voiceless aspirated (/ph/), voiced unaspirated (/b/) and voiced aspirated (/bh/).
In addition, Hindi has two different places of articulation in the neighborhood of
the alveolar place of articulation of English, dental and retroflex.
Hindi has ten vowels, and vowels can also be nasalized.


Like many other languages, including Japanese and Amharic, the basic word order of
Hindi puts the verb in final position.
Like most other verb-final languages, Hindi has postpositions instead of
prepositions.
Like Spanish nouns, Hindi nouns are either masculine or feminine.
Noun suffixes also mark number (singular or plural) and as many as three different
cases.
Also as in Spanish, adjectives must agree with the nouns they modify.
Hindi verbs usually consist of a verb stem followed by an auxiliary verb,
analogous to English ''is going'', except that the order is reversed.
In these cases both the stem and the auxiliary must agree with some noun in the 
sentence in gender, number, and sometimes person.


Hindi, like most of the other major written languages of South and Southeast Asia,
is written in one of the scripts descending from the ancient Brahmi script.
In these writing systems, each consonant has a particular symbol that represents
that consonant alone or followed by the vowel /a/ or a similar vowel.
To represent other syllables beginning with this consonant, the symbol is embellished
with vowel symbols that may come before, after, above, or below the consonant symbol.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/jpn.pdf Here] is the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in Hindi.

--&gt;

== Japanese ==

In terms of numbers of native speakers (about 125,000,000),
Japanese is about the eighth most widely spoken language in the world.
The great majority of the speakers live in Japan, where almost everyone 
speaks Japanese.
In Japanese the language is called ''nihongo''.



There is disagreement on which languages Japanese is related to.
It is only clear that its closest relatives are the Ryukyuan languages 
spoken in the very south of Japan.
Some believe Japanese is related to Korean; some believe it and Korean 
are related to the Altaic language family (Turkish, Mongolian, etc.).


Japanese has extensive
bound morphology on its verbs, almost all of it 
suffixes, though, unlike in Indo-European languages, the subject is not marked
on the verb.
Japanese is a
verb-final language and shares many syntactic properties
with other verb-final languages.
Japanese is also known for the many devices for expressing level of 
formality in the language (both vocabulary and grammar) and for the
differences between
men's and women's speech.


Japanese has a relatively small set of
phonemes, so
second-language learners usually find it relatively easy to
learn to pronounce, but it makes use of pitch to distinguish
words from one another, and this system is often not mastered, or even attempted,
by second-language learners.


Alongside Standard Japanese, which all children learn in school, there are 
many regional dialects, differing very greatly from one another (much more 
than the dialects of American English, for example).


Japanese is written using a combination of Chinese characters (''kanji'') and
two related syllabic systems (''hiragana'' and ''katakana'').
Despite this complexity, the Japanese are among the most literate 
people in the world.

[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/jpn.pdf Here] is the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in Japanese.


== Amharic ==

In terms of numbers of native speakers (about 18,000,000), Amharic
is approximately the 
fiftieth most widely spoken language in the world.
Almost all of the native speakers live in Ethiopia, where they make up 
about 1/3 of the population.
Because Amharic is the official language of Ethiopia, taught in all 
schools, it is also spoken as a second language by many other Ethiopians.
In Amharic the language is called ''amarinya''.


Amharic has seven vowels, and its consonants include a set of
[[How Language Works/consonants2|ejectives]], unlike anything in a language such as English.
For example, the consonants /t/, /d/, and /t'/ need to be distinguished.
This makes it a somewhat difficult language for second-language
speakers to pronounce.



Amharic belongs to the Semitic group (like Arabic and Hebrew) within the 
Afro-Asiatic family of languages.
About 50 other Semitic and non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic languages are spoken 
in Ethiopia alongside Amharic.


Like other Semitic languages, Amharic has a very elaborate verb morphology.
An Amharic verb
root consists of a set of (usually three) consonants.
Depending on the
tense, and other grammatical features, the consonants may 
be separated by particular vowels and possibly geminated (doubled).
A verb form normally also has one or more
suffixes and possibly one or more 
prefixes as well,
agreeing with the subject and sometimes the direct or indirect object
of the verb.
Complicating things further (at least for the adult second-language learner),
there are at least ten different classes of verbs, each modifying its
stem in a different way for the different forms.
Like Japanese, Hindi, and many other languages, Amharic is a
verb-final language.
Amharic nouns are relatively simple by comparison, though they may take
suffixes indicating possession ('my', 'his', etc.), plural, and a few other
grammatical functions.


Unlike most African languages, Amharic has been a written language
for many years, at least 500.
It is written using a syllabic writing system that is unique to Ethiopian 
Semitic languages.
Compared to other African languages, Amharic has a fairly sizable
written literature.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/amh.pdf Here] is the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Amharic.


== Lingala ==

Lingala is the first language of about 300,000 people in the two neighboring
countries called Congo in central Africa, but is a second language for many more,
at least 7,000,000 people, making it one of the most important languages
in central Africa.
In Lingala, the name of the language is ''ling&amp;aacute;la'' (the accent
mark indicates a high tone on that syllable).



Lingala belongs to the Bantu group of languages, like most of the languages of
central and southern Africa.
Other important Bantu languages include Swahili, Zulu, and Shona.
The Bantu languages belong in turn to the Niger-Kordofanian language
family, which includes
most of the more than 2000 languages spoken in Africa.
Lingala is a very recent language, an example of a
'''contact language''', a language which emerges out of the contact between
people speaking different languages.
Lingala began along the Congo River,
first as a trade language, later, when
Congo was colonized by Belgium, as a way for the colonists and their intermediaries
to communicate with the local people.
As usually happens in such situations, the resulting language borrowed words
and grammatical features from a number of existing languages, in this case
Bantu languages of the region.
At first it was not the first language of anybody, but with the growth of cities
and marriage between speakers of different first languages, it soon became
a language learned by children as a first language.
In recent years, the language has spread rapidly, partly because of its role
in government, partly because it is the usual language in which the enormously
popular Congolese music is sung.
&lt;!--
(Since I'm a big fan of this sort of music, I couldn't resist including a
[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B00000DDBN001003/103-2732777-5395812 sound clip] from
[http://www.amazon.com Amazon.com]
of my favorite Congolese band, Quatre &amp;Eacute;toiles.)
--&gt;


Lingala has relatively few phonemes and simple CV syllable structure.
Like most other Bantu languages, it is a tone language, using pitch both
to distinguish words from each other and to mark grammatical categories.


When a contact language emerges, the grammar (at least the morphology)
of the source languages is normally simplified.
This is true for Lingala too, though it preserves many of the features
of Bantu morphology.
Like other Bantu languages, Lingala divides nouns into about 14 classes,
similar to the genders of European languages, each with its own characteristic
prefix.
Verbs have prefixes, suffixes, and particular tone patterns,
to indicate the subject and the tense,
and to derive a range of other forms from each verb.
The basic word order is subject-verb-object.


Lingala is written in the Roman alphabet, but there is not yet an extensive
literature.
Most educated Congolese still use French for writing.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/lin.htm Here]

is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Lingala.


== Tzeltal ==


Tzeltal is spoken by about 215,000 people in Chiapas state in Mexico.
Many of the people are bilingual in Spanish.
Unlike many other
American Indian languages, Tzeltal seems to have a chance of 
surviving, but this will depend on Mexican language policies, which
in the past have not favored languages other than Spanish.


Tzeltal is a member of the Mayan family of languages, currently spoken by
several million people in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.
These people are the descendants of the the great Maya civilization that 
flourished in this region 1000 years ago.


Like Amharic, Tzeltal phonology includes a set of
[[How Language Works/consonants2|ejective consonants]].
Tzeltal syllables are relatively simple, except that
clusters like /hp/ can occur at the beginnings and ends of words.



Tzeltal is known for its elaborate system of
classifiers, morphemes
which must follow numerals when objects or actions are counted.
The choice of classifier usually depends on the shape or structure of the 
counted objects.
One researcher has counted more than 500 classifiers in one Tzeltal dialect.
Tzeltal is also known for the way it expresses spatial relations
('on', 'under', 'left of', etc.).
It makes use of body part terms ('head', 'back', 'rump', etc.)
and a set of spatial orientation verbs for close relations and
absolute frame of reference (roughly 'east', 'west', etc.) for more distant
relations.
The most common
word order is verb-object-subject.


The dialects of Tzeltal differ considerably from one another, and
there is no commonly accepted standard dialect.


Ancient Mayan was written using a hieroglyphic system, but Tzeltal had no 
writing system till very recently.
It is written today using the Roman alphabet.
There are few materials written in it, however; Spanish is the
usual written language for literate Tzeltales.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/tzc1.htm Here] is
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Tzeltal.


== Inuktitut ==

Inuktitut is spoken by about 14,000 people in northeastern Canada,
mainly in the newly formed territory of Nunavut, for which it is
one of the official languages.
Inuktitut is one of about eight languages in the Eskimo group of languages
within the Eskimo-Aleut family.
Eskimo languages are spoken in a large, sparsely populated region extending from the far eastern end of Siberia in Russia, across Alaska and northern Canada to Greenland.
Unlike most other indigenous languages of North America, Inuktitut seems to have
a good chance of surviving.



Inuktitut has a relatively simple set of phonemes.
For a given
[[How Language Works/consonants1|place of articulation]],
for example, velar, the language makes no distinction between voiceless (English /k/) and
voiced (English /g/) stops.
However, Inuktitut has a place of articulation not used at all in English but also used in Tzeltal and other Mayan languages:
'''uvular''' consonants are produced with the tongue making contact or approaching
the top of the mouth even further back than for velar consonants.


Inuktitut and other Eskimo languages have some of the most elaborate morphology
of any languages in the world.
A single Inuktitut word often corresponds to an entire sentence in English.
Here is an example of a word consisting of eight morphemes:
''Pariliarumaniralauqsimanngittunga'' 'I never said I wanted to go to Paris'.
While Inuktitut does not distinguish gender anywhere in its grammar, it distinguishes
three numbers, singular, dual, and plural.
Each noun can have scores of forms because it must be marked for number and for
case.
Most verbs can have hundreds of forms because they must be marked for their subject
and their direct object, if there is one, as well as for their tense.
In some cases, verbs have a special set of suffixes when a question is being asked.
In addition to the three persons that other languages of the world distinguish,
Inuktitut has a &quot;fourth person&quot; for cases when two third person clauses within
the same sentence have a different subject.

Inuktitut is usually written using a modification
of a script that was originally designed by missionaries for the Cree language.
In this writing system, each simple consonant-vowel
syllable is represented by a single symbol.
[http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/esb.htm Here] is the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights in Inuktitut written in the syllabic script.



== American Sign Language ==


American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language of between 100,000 and
500,000 people out of the approximately 2,000,000 deaf people in the
United States and Canada, but many other deaf people, and some hearing
people, have some competence in the language.


ASL is one of hundreds of deaf sign languages in the world, none of them
related to spoken languages, but some recent research has shown that
sign languages may share some properties with one another even when they are not
genetically related.
British Sign Language is a separate language, not mutually intelligible with
ASL.
ASL developed in the schools for the deaf in the US begun in the early part
of the 19th century.
Because the teaching in these schools was influenced by early
French methods of educating the deaf, many ASL signs derive originally from
French Sign Language.
However, ASL and French Sign Language are quite different languages today.


ASL is to be distinguished from Signed English, 
which uses English word order, replacing
the English words with signs.
The grammar of ASL is very different from that of English.
Like Tzeltal and Japanese, but not English or Spanish, ASL makes use of
classifiers,
morphemes that are added to signs to agree with the shape or other
physical property of some object.
For example, expressions showing location ('be at')
take a handshape that conveys something
about the thing that is in the location (that is, whether it is a vehicle, an
animal, etc.).
As in other sign languages, there is a strong tendency for signs in
ASL to be
[[How Language Works/iconicity|iconic]], that is, to be motivated
by their meanings rather than completely arbitrary.
This iconicity extends into the grammar.
For example, in ASL participants in a discourse are usually assigned
places in the signing space and then pointed to later on when they
are referred to, that is, where pronouns would appear in a spoken language.



There is currently no agreed on way of writing ASL,
but ASL does have its own literature, including poetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Accent:the conventions of pronunciation associated with some speech community. 
;Appropriate:not only grammatical and meaningful but suitable for the context in which it occurs. Inappropriate utterances may be too casual, formal, direct, indirect;uninterpretable by the hearer; or in violation of the conventions of conversation,  
;Category:a grouping of individual things or situations by people on the basis of similarity. Individuals '''belong''' to categories, but a category should not be seen as the set of all of its individual members, or &amp;rarr;instances, but rather the abstract concept that they share. Categories are often thought of as having &amp;rarr;prototypes, that is, typical members;individuals can then be relatively &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; members of a category based on how far they are from the prototype. Categories may also result in &amp;rarr;categorical perception. 
;Common noun:a word which labels a category of '''thing''' and shares morphological or syntactic properties with other such words. In English common nouns include words such as ''racket'', ''cheese'', and ''road''. All English common nouns share several morphological and syntactic properties; for example, all can be modified by the article ''the''. 
;Concept:a unit of cognitive experience, a way people have of abstracting over their experiences in the world.  
;Conceptual relation:a relation between two concepts that is based on some sort of similarity or association between them. Conceptual relations include &amp;rarr;specialization-generalization, part-whole, and physical similarity. 
;Constraint:a limitation on what is possible. For language, constraints come from the body, from cognition, and from the nature of human communication. 
;Convention:a behavior that is accepted by some group of people as appropriate for performing some function. For example, the community of English speakers agrees on the convention that the word ''horse'' refers to a particular kind of animal. Conventions are usually at least somewhat &amp;rarr;arbitrary;that is, they are in effect because they have been agreed on, not because they &quot;make sense&quot; in any way. For example, English speakers could just as well have settled on a totally different word form to refer to the category horse. 
;Dialect:the linguistic conventions shared by a speech community. 
;Deixis:use of language whose meaning depends at least in part on some element (role) of the utterance or discourse context. Deictic expressions in English include pronouns like ''I'' and ''you'', adverbs such as ''here'' and ''now'', and verbs such as ''come'' and ''go''.  
;Dimension:a scale along which concepts can vary. Each individual or category for which the dimension is relevant has a particular value on the dimension. For example, color is a dimension which is relevant for physical objects and masses, and some possible color values are red, green, and  blue. However, color is not a relevant dimension for actions; it would be unspecified for an instance of eating, say. 
;First person: See &amp;rarr;person. 
;Form:how a linguistic expression sounds (for spoken language) or looks (for written or signed language) or how it is produced.  
;Formality:a &amp;rarr;semantic dimension in some languages, distinguishing situations or relationships between utterance participants on the basis of the familiarity of the participants with one another, the social distance between the participants, the relative status of the participants, and the cultural significance of the interaction. 
;Function:(1) a use that people put language to, for example, asserting, commanding, or getting information. (2) the use that a particular word or pattern has within a stretch of language, for example, marking tense or marking the gender and number of the subject. 
;Gender:a grammatical &amp;rarr;dimension which divides nouns into a small set of classes (also called &quot;genders&quot;). The members of the classes normally tend to share some semantic properties. However, membership in one of the classes is often somewhat arbitrary and may be based on characteristics of the forms of nouns rather than their meanings. Therefore, gender is not usually considered to be a semantic dimension. In many languages, for example, Spanish, there is a correlation between biological gender and membership in the classes, which are called &quot;feminine&quot; and &quot;masculine&quot; for this reason. However, there seems to be little semantic motivation for the assignment of inanimate objects to the genders. 
;Generalize:to go beyond the available data, applying a word or a rule to a novel situation. 
;Generalization-specialization:the conceptual relation between a super-category and a sub-category. All of the properties of the super-category are shared by members of the sub-category, but the sub-category has properties not shared by all members of the super-category. For example, apple specializes  fruit (or fruit generalizes apple). Different kinds of fruit are edible and sweet and contain seeds; these are all properties of apples. But apples have a core surrounding the seeds, which is not true for some kinds of fruit, such as strawberries. 
;Grammatical:describing a phrase or sentence which could be produced by a speaker of a given dialect or language and does not contain a &amp;rarr;speech error. 
;Hearer:the receiver of a linguistic act, the one who is expected to perceive and interpret the act, often referred to as the &quot;addressee&quot;. For spoken language, a hearer; for signed language, an observer; for written language, a reader. (The word will be capitalized in this book to remind you that it's more general than &quot;hearer&quot;.) 
;Individual:a particular thing or situation, as opposed to a set of things or situations, or a category of things or situations. The noun phrases ''Clark'', ''the linguistics class I'm taking'', and ''the milk in that glass'' refer to individual things. The sentence ''there's a mouse under the bed'' describes an individual situation.  
;Innate:genetically specified, available to the person or animal more or less automatically because it belongs to a particular species, not because of experience and learning. Thus in this sense we might call the liver innate;unless something is drastically wrong in our environment, we all get one. One view of language learning sees many of the properties of language as innate. 
;Instance:an individual belonging to some category. 
;Language:a set of dialects, grouped together usually on the basis of a relatively high degree of &amp;rarr;mutual intelligibility  but also possibly because the speakers are members of a single political unit. 
;Language death:a situation arising in the history of a language when children stop learning it as a first language. Although is is possible to preserve recordings and linguistic descriptions of such a language, these can only be seen as a very incomplete record of the living language, which is now effectively irretrievable. 
;Language family:a group of languages that are genetically related, that is, having a single common ancestor language. 
;Lexical gap:a category without a word in a language, dialect, or idiolect in a domain in which most other categories have associated words. For example, most English speakers have no word for  sibling, though they do have a word for parent. 
;Lexicon:the mental dictionary of a person, &quot;listing&quot; all of the words the person knows, their meanings, forms, and grammatical properties. 
;Mass:a thing with relatively stable properties but no clearly definable boundary, that is, not an object. Examples are some smoke, some sand, some oatmeal. Some things may be difficult to classify as being objects or masses, for example, a lump of clay or a piece of cheese. 
;Meaning:the concepts that linguistic words and grammatical patterns are about. 
;Metaphoric extension:extension of the meaning of a word on the basis of the similarity of the original meaning to the new meaning. For example, ''wing'' came to be used for a structure on an airplane by analogy with the similar structure on a bird. 
;Metonymic extension:extension of the meaning of a word on the basis of a strong association between the orginal meaning and the new meaning;in some sense the two &quot;go together&quot;. For example, ''wing'' came to be used for a structure on an airplane by analogy with the similar structure on a bird. 
;Mutual intelligibility:the extent to which speakers of two or more different dialects or languages can understand each other. 
;Negative evidence:in learning, information about when a particular form does not apply. For example, in word learning, negative evidence could take the form of correcting a child's mistaken use of a word: &quot;No, that's not a chicken;it's a duck.&quot; To be contrasted with  &amp;rarr;positive evidence. 
;Number:a &amp;rarr;semantic dimension which distinguishes individual objects ('''singular''') multiple objects ('''plural''') and in some languages from two or three objects as well. 
;Object:something that is perceived as having a clear boundary around it and a set of stable properties such as size, color, shape, and consistency, for example, an apple, a bridge, or a snake. 
;Over-generalization, under-generalization:errors made by first or second language learners in which the meaning of a word in the target language is either generalized (for example, ''dog'' for sheep as well as dogs) or specialized (for example, ''dog'' only for terriers). 
;Personal pronoun:a word referring to an object in terms of whether it is (or includes) the Speaker or the Hearer. 
;Person:a grammatical category expressing whether a referent is (or includes) the Speaker ('''first person'''), the Hearer ('''second person'''), or neither the Speaker nor the Hearer ('''third person''').  
;Plural: See &amp;rarr;number. 
;Positive evidence:in learning, information about when a particular form applies. For example, in word learning, positive evidence could take the form of the presentation of a referent together with an appropriate word. To be contrasted with &amp;rarr;negative evidence. 
;Prescription:specifying what sorts of behavior are desirable, acceptable, preferred. To be contrasted with description. Linguists are concerned with describing, not prescribing, language. 
;Proper noun:a word used to refer to an individual object, for example, ''Clark'', ''Indiana''.  One kind of name.  (Other names includes expressions like ''the Grand Canyon'' and ''the White House''.)  
;Prototype:the central or typical member of a category; the basis on which individuals are evaluated as belonging to the category. One view of categories is that they are prototypes. 
;Regularity:a pattern that tends to recur in some data. For example, the co-occurrence of the word ''apple'' with an object with a particular shape, consistency, and taste is one sort of regularity, and the general tendency for the meanings of nouns referring to solid objects to be organized by shape is another sort of regularity.  
;Role:a concept defined with respect to the part it plays in a larger (surrounding, defining) concept. For example, the speaker role within an utterance, the pitcher role within a baseball team, the nose role within a face, the subject role within a sentence. 
;Second person: See &amp;rarr;person. 
;Semantic category:a category that is the meaning of a word. 
;Semantic dimension:a &amp;rarr;dimension which distinguishes things or situations from one another and which corresponds to distinctions in linguistic form. Examples are &amp;rarr;person, &amp;rarr;number, mass-count, and tense. 
;Semantic extension:addition of new &amp;rarr;sense to a word on the basis of some conceptual relation. For example, the noun ''mouse'' came to be used for a computer pointing device because of the physical similarity between the device and the animal. 
;Shape bias:the tendency for language to assume that the categories labeled by  words for solid objects are organized by shape, that is, that shape matters more for these categories than color or texture. 
;Singular: See &amp;rarr;number. 
;Systematicity:the tendency for languages to be consistent in the dimensions that matter, the number of values along dimensions, and the applicability of particular rules or patterns to a variety of words. For example, if a particular dimension is relevant for consonants in one place of articulation, it is likely to be relevant in other places of articulation, and the possibility of referring to a transitive event with a passive construction tends to be applicable to all transitive verbs and to all sorts of arguments of those verbs. 
;Speaker:the producer of a linguistic act. For spoken language, a speaker; for signed language, a signer; for written language, a writer. (The word will be capitalized in this book to remind you that it's more general than &quot;speaker&quot;.)  
;Speech error:a deviation from the conventions of a dialect or language caused by interference between words, a temporary memory lapse (perhaps due to fatigue or stress), or an ill-formed speech plan. 
;Standard dialect:within a language, the dialect that is accepted as being the most prestigious, often the only dialect that is written and the dialect that is used in education and the media. 
;Standardization:the process of settling on a standard, a set of conventions to be followed by everyone in a particular community.  
;Taxonomy:a set of concepts related to one another in a hierarchy by the &amp;rarr;generalization-specialization relation. 
;Thing:a set of co-occurring and relatively stable features, typically an '''object'''  but also possibly a '''mass: 
;Third person: See &amp;rarr;person. 
;Utterance:an instance of language; a word, phrase, or sentence produced by somebody at a given time and place with somebody as Hearer 
;Utterance context:the Speaker, Hearer, location, and time associated with a particular instance of language. 
;Value: See &amp;rarr;dimension. 
;Word sense:one of the related meanings of a word. For example, the word ''sponge'' is used to refer both to a kind of sea animal and to an object or material used for cleaning, originally made from the internal skeleton of one of these animals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This is supposed to be a challenging section and will test the reader's understanding of the previous material'''. 

Perfect maps are specific maps that have useful applications in point-set topology. A perfect map is a map which preseves 'inverse-like' properties. Like the continuous image of a connected space is always connected, if the perfect image (image under a perfect map) of a certain space, X, is connected, then X must be connected. Perfect maps are good in this sense as they are weaker than a homeomorphism, but strong enough to behave like homeomorphisms. We will give the formal definition in the next section.

==Formal definition==

Let X and Y be topological spaces and let p be a map from X to Y that is continuous, closed, surjective and such that p^(-1) {y} is compact relative to X for each y in Y. Then p is known as a perfect map. 

==Examples and Properties==

The reader may wish to note that f is an open map if and only if the inverse of f is continuous.


1. If p: X-&gt;Y is a perfect map and if Y is compact, then X is compact.


2. If p: X-&gt;Y is a perfect map and if X is regular, then Y is regular (note that: if p is merely continuous, then if X is regular, Y need not be regular. An example of this is if X is a regular space and Y is an infinite set in the indiscrete topology)


3. If p: X-&gt;Y is a perfect map and if X is locally compact, then Y is locally compact.


4. If p: X-&gt;Y is a perfect map and if X is second countable, then Y is second countable.


5. Every injective perfect map is a homeomorphism. This follows from the fact that a bijective closed map has a continuous inverse.


6. If p: X-&gt;Y is a perfect map and if Y is connected, then X need not be connected. An example is when we let X be a compact disconnected space and Y be a single point topological space and p be the constant map.


7. A perfect map need not be open as the following map shows:

p(x) = x     if x belongs to [1,2]

p(x) = x-1   if x belongs to [3,4]

This map is closed, continuous (by the pasting lemma) and surjective and therefore is a perfect map (the other condition is trivially satisfied). However, p is not open for the image of [1,2] under p is [1,2] which is not open relative to [1,3] (the range of p). Note that this map is a quotient map and the quotient operation is ‘gluing’ two intervals together.


8. Notice how, to pereserve properties such as local connectedness, second countability, local compactness etc… we require that the map be not only continuous but also open. A perfect map need not be open (see previous example), but these properties are still preserved under perfect maps.


9. Every homeomorphism is a perfect map. This follows from the fact that a bijective open map is closed and that since a homeomorphism is injective, the inverse of each element of the range must be finite in the domain (in fact, the inverse must have precisely one element).

==Exercises==

1.a) Prove that compactness is preserved under homeomorphisms; that is, if Y is homeomorphic to X and X is compact, then so is Y
   
b) Prove property 1

2. a) Prove that regularity is preserved under homeomorphisms
    
b) Prove property 2 (Hint: First prove the weaker result that if Y is Hausdorff so is X)

3. a) Prove that local compactness is preserved under homeomorphisms
     
b) Prove property 3

4. a) Prove that second countability is preserved under homeomorphisms

b) Prove property 4

5. Determine whether or not the following theorem is valid. If you think that the theorem is valid, prove it. If not, find a counterexample:

Let X and Y be topological spaces and let p be a map from X to Y that is continuous, closed, surjective and such that p^(-1) {y} is CONNECTED relative to X for each y in Y. If Y is connected, then X is connected.

6. After studying the next section on quotient spaces, prove the following theorem:

Let q be a quotient map from X to Y such that q^(-1) {y} is connected for each y in Y. If Y is connected, then X is connected.

Question Writer allows you to randomly select the questions asked in a quiz from a question pool. You can have a very large number of questions in a pool (tested up to 10,000) from which to create a random quiz. However, you should limit the number of questions actually asked in a quiz to 200 questions without question feedback, or 100 with feedback.

If you need your quiz to have more questions, it is best to create multiple quizzes of around 100/200 questions and link them together using the [[../Quiz Options/Web Settings/After Quiz|After Quiz]] option.  

Another way to include a large number of questions is to use Pages. Where you are using pages, the above limit applies to the number of pages, not to the number of questions. For example, you could have a 100 page quiz, with 5 questions per page and full feedback.

'''Cullen Skink'''

A soup from Cullen in Morayshire using smoked haddock for a rich flavour. 

==Ingredients==

* 1 large smoked haddock of around 2 lb
* 1 medium onion, chopped fine.
* 1 and a half pints (900ml) milk
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 8 oz mashed potato
* Salt and pepper
* 1 bay leaf
* Chopped parsley
* Water
* Toast as accompaniment when serving


==Procedure==

# Cover the haddock with water in a shallow pan with skin side down. 
# Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes turning once. 
# Take the fish from the pan and remove the skin and bones. 
# Flake the fish and return to the stock. 
# Add chopped onion, bay leaf, salt and pepper. 
# Simmer for a further 10 minutes. 
# Strain off the stock and keep it ready - discard the bay leaf and keep the fish warm. 
# Add the milk to the fish stock and bring to the boil. 
# Add mashed potato to make a rich and thick soup. 
# Add the fish and check the seasoning - add more if needed. 
# When serving, add the butter in small pieces so it runs through the soup. 
# Serve with chopped parsley on top, and toast by the side.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Propagation of Force and Torque==
This section deals with solving for the joint torques of serial manipulator, needed to keep it in equilibrium. This will require writing down the force and torque equations for each link.

[[Image:Statics.svg|frame|right|The forces and torques acting on a single manipulator link.]]

For link &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, as depicted in the figure on the right, this results in:
:&lt;math&gt;
_i f_i - _i f_{i + 1} = 0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;
_i n_i - \, _i n_{i + 1} - \, _i P_{i + 1} \times \, _{i + 1} f_{i + 1} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
In this last equation, &lt;math&gt;P_{i + 1}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector pointing from the origin of frame &lt;math&gt;{i}&lt;/math&gt; to that of frame &lt;math&gt;{i + 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
_i f_i = \, ^{i + 1} _i R \,\, _{i + 1} f_{i + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;
and:
:&lt;math&gt;
_i n_i = \, ^{i + 1} _i R  \,\, _{i + 1} n_{i + 1} + \, _i P_{i + 1} \times \, _{i + 1} f_{i + 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

The above formulas form the expressions of static force propagation from link to link.
For the system to be in equilibrum, the component of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; along the Z-axis &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, \hat{k}_i)&lt;/math&gt; must equal the joint torque &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the expression for the joint torque:
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau_i = \,_i n_i^T \, _i \hat{k}_i
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example: the Two-Link Planar Manipulator===
[[Image:Planar-manipulator.svg|frame|right|The two-link planar manipulator.]]
Suppose a force vector &lt;math&gt;(F_x, F_y)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the end-effector of the manipulator on the right. A joint torque is taken positive if it increases the joint angle and negative otherwise. Applying the above equations leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
_2 F_2 =

\begin{pmatrix} F_x \\ F_y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
_2 n_2 = L_2 \hat{i}_2 \times \begin{pmatrix} F_x \\ F_y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ L_2 F_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
_1 F_1 = \begin{pmatrix} c_2 &amp; -s_2 &amp; 0 \\ s_2 &amp; c_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} F_x \\ F_y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} c_2 F_x - s_2 F_y \\ s_2 F_x + c_2 F_y \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
_1 n_1 = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 &amp; -s_1 &amp; 0 \\ s_1 &amp; c_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ L_2 F_y \end{pmatrix} + L_1 \hat{i}_1 \times \, _1 F_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ L_1 s_2 F_x + (L_1 c_2 + L_2) F_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the joint torques required for the system to be in equilibrium are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} \tau_1 \\ \tau_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} L_1 s_2 &amp; L_1 c_2 + L_2 \\ 0 &amp; L_2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} F_x \\ F_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Virtual Work and Jacobians==
In general, work is the dot-product of a force or torque and a displacement, or angular displacement. According to the principle of virtual work, let these displacements become infinitesimally small:
:&lt;math&gt;
F \cdot \delta x = \tau \cdot \delta \theta
&lt;/math&gt;,
where the left-hand side of the equation expresses the virtual work in the Cartesian, end-effector workspace, and the right-hand side corresponds with the virtual work in the joint displacements. The both of them must, of course, be the same.

The same expression may also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
F^T \delta x = \tau^T \delta \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

As the definition of the Jacobian is &lt;math&gt;\delta x = J \delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;, the above equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;
F^T J \delta \theta = \tau^T \delta \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

This must be true for all &lt;math&gt;\delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;, so:
:&lt;math&gt;
F^T J  = \tau^T
&lt;/math&gt;,
or:
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = J^T F
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example about the two-link planar manipulator, the matrix is indeed the transpose of the Jacobian, expressed with respect to frame &lt;math&gt;\{3\}&lt;/math&gt;. With respect to the base frame &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, the following expression is valid:
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \, _0 J^T \, _0 F
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The key source of our information about Greek mythology is the poem called &quot;Esiodou Theogonia&quot;, Hesiod's Theogony. As it has come down to us it appears to have been added to here and there is the    usual question about whether Hesiod, defined as the author of &quot;Esiodou Erga kai Emerai&quot;, Hesiod's Works and Day's, is also the Theogony. In any case it is poem from the times of Hesiod - a few years before 700 BCE. The Hesiod of Works and Days lived at Ascra near Thespiai in Boeotia in Greece but traveled as far away as Khalkis on Euboia. 

A great deal of what has come down to us of the Greek mythology is an expansion of or a comment on the Theogony. But there is also a considerable amount of material independent of and sometimes contradictory to the Theogony. Much of this is preserved in much later sources.
