      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book of the Month Award Template ==

I created a simple template to put onto the &quot;winning&quot; book that could show an &quot;award&quot; or special distinction has been granted to that book.  This is just something to get started, and feel free to [[:Template:Book of the Month|edit the template]] if you think some more work should be there.  I was trying to do something like the picture of the day or the article of the day on Wikipedia, and added a trophy picture I found on commons to show it was something special.  For now, this is just quick and dirty.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:08, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

We sure are running out of good wikibooks to host on the front page aren't we, ey? --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 23:42, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Is a &quot;Book of the Year&quot; award planned? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 8 July 2005 09:01 (UTC)

== BotM completeness ==

Out of curiosity, what characteristics do you look for when voting? How important is completeness? Many past BsotM are relatively complete, but many books that are less developed are nominated every month. The [[German]] book, for example, is far from complete, but seems to be coming along nicely. The extra attention received by an award would be beneficial for any developing book -- but I also understand the argument that developing books may not represent the &quot;best&quot; of Wikibooks to new or casual visitors. [[User:Vault|Vault]] 20:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

:I litterally try to vote on the best that is currently available on Wikibooks at the moment, and hasn't yet won the Book of the Month title.  Sometimes this does become a book that is not yet complete, mainly because Wikibooks is still a relatively new project.  It takes some time to complete a book and a lot of effort, usually from many people.  IMHO some books have &quot;won&quot; in the past due to the percieved benefit (and there is some) of getting a prominent place on the front page, which has resulted unfortunately in some &quot;sock puppet&quot; votes, or at least by relative newcommers to Wikibooks voting only for their favorite book because it is a topic they are interested in, not because it is necessarily the best on Wikibooks at the moment.  Some lower quality books have therefore won the monthly vote.  In the case of the [[German]] Wikibook, I think it has been developing quite nicely, and I don't have a personal objection to it becoming a Book of the month, although I think there are some better books out there.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:07, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

== Inflation ==

Is it too much to hand out an award (and icon) for a wikibook every month?  It seems like nearly everything on the main page now has an award next to it.  Maybe it'd be better to save the awards for the projects which are *really* producing something substantial and useful.  Otherwise the awards start to become a little meaningless or even counterproductive (all wikibooks with an award are not equal but it doesn't seem that way at first sight). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:195.72.169.116|195.72.169.116]] ([[User talk:195.72.169.116|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/195.72.169.116|contribs]]) 14:15, 20 March 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: The reason why so many books on the main page have an award to them is quite simple: Only bookshelves of the month books winners are shown on [[Template:Main Page navigation]]. Apart from BOTM winners, books with PDFs, Wikijunior Books, the 10 newest books, and so called [[Template:Highlighted|hot picks]] are shown. That is a pretty select group. Prehaps you want to participate in [[Template talk:Highlighted]] as well if you are concerned about the main page. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:10, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

::I'm not entirely sure that we even need to have the book of the month winners listed on the front page in this manner, as it is going to get us back to the original situation we had earlier with a huge pile of listings of random books.  Still, they are going to be somewhat higher quality than the [[Wikibooks:All Books|list of all Wikibooks]] was before on the front page.  On average, I would say that about 5-10 serious books are started on Wikibooks each month, so handing out an award every month is not going to run out of a supply of possible book titles.  The real trick is to dig up the gems that are buried in Wikibooks at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:13, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

== Voting Rules ==

If the rules is - just vote - why were 2 users deleted because they have less than 20 edits?&lt;BR&gt;
You can have arule saying one should have at least 50/100 edits. But at the moment there is no such rule - so the votes shouldn't be disregarded.

== Mailing list ==

*Anyway to get a monthly email telling us the book of the month?--[[User:203.214.95.227|203.214.95.227]] 13:50, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

I have added a couple of templates for marking keys as being specific to “Pre-Blender-2.5” or “Blender 2.5”. If you have a look on the Object Mode HotKeys page, you can see these being used in the definitions of CTRL+NKEY, CTRL+SKEY, CTRL+WKEY and CTRL+XKEY as examples. Let me know if you think this is (or isn’t) the right way to do it.

== Tutorial Authors Wanted on Official Blender MediaWiki! ==
The main Blender documentation and tutorial authors are now working on the [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Main_Page Official Blender MediaWiki]. If you're considering helping write Blender tutorials or documentation, please consider helping us at the official wiki instead.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

I would like to remove that note about merging this into the Noob to Pro book. That’s a tutorial book, this is a quick reference, the two serve quite different purposes, so they shouldn’t be merged. — [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 04:57, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:I agree with Ldo.  I will remove the merge template. --[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 00:55, 11 October 2010 (UTC)

Hello, I've set up the new system for this wikibook.  It makes very heavy use of templates.  I'd like to write an explanation here about how one should go about adding to this reference, but that will have to wait for another day.  If you take a look around you should be able to see very quickly how it's all set up yourself (note you'll have to press the &quot;edit this page&quot; link on each page to see it's setup).  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 17:05, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

: This looks nice, but how can I find, let's say, locking X axis after I press GKEY? In previous HotKeys version was easy, I just pressed CTRL-F (find) in my browser and wrote ''lock'' in find window.--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 06:53, 3 Jul 2005 (UTC)

I'll get that added :) --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 5 July 2005 13:01 (UTC)

Ok Popski I added those shortcuts to the book, plus a couple more.  Take a look at these pages as well:

[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Edit_Mode_HotKeys_Review]]

[[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Object_Mode_HotKeys_Review]]

These templates can easily be added to other Blender books, and individual hotkey descriptions can also be added to tutorials because everything's templatized :)  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 5 July 2005 15:12 (UTC)

: I just wanted to say that in this template needs to be included [[Blender 3D: HotKeys/old|All]] HotKeys. I didn't want to mess this templates without previous discussion with you. BTW, HotKeys for locking axis in your upper links are wrong. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 5 July 2005 17:26 (UTC)

: I added All HotHeys in [[Template:Blender_3D:_HotKeys/Navigation]], maybe need this module different front page now... I'm so busy with IK right now that I don't have time to fill all HotKeys stuff in ''[[redlinks]]'' :) --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 18:52, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Maya-lighter-with-materials.jpg|350px|thumbnail|right|This is how your render will look if you follow this how-to and use the example-files I use.]]
How to import and render your SolidWorks model in Maya using the built in mental ray.

== Introduction ==
[[w:SolidWorks|SolidWorks]] is one of the main product design solid modellers. It has a built in render engine called PhotoWorks. With the release of PhotoWorks 2, rendering within SolidWorks has become more realistic and easier. In a lot of cases PhotoWorks will be the most convenient way to render your model, because you don't have to leave SolidWorks.
However, in some cases you will find the need to make renders that are more realistic (or even photo-realistic), and PhotoWorks is not sufficient anymore. This is when you might consider using an external program for rendering. In this how-to, I will describe how to do this using [[w:Maya_(software)|Alias Maya]] with [[w:Mental_ray|mental ray]].
I will be doing this with SolidWorks 2005 and Maya 6.5, but it will probably work in most other (recent) versions aswell.

== Exporting from SolidWorks ==
I will be working with a model (Created by '''Marko.M.Markovic''' [mailto:mmmarko@neobee.net mmmarko@neobee.net]) of a lighter that I downloaded from the [http://www.swugn.org/ SolidWorks Users Group Network (SWUGN)] at the bottom of the &quot;FREE SolidWorks models&quot; section.

Before you can import your model into Maya, you need to export it to the [[w:IGES|IGES]] format first.
In this how-to I will describe how to do this with an assembly, but it is essentially the same for a separate part.
* Open your assembly.
* If you don't want to export all the objects, select the objects that you DO want to export first. If you want to export the complete assembly, don't select anything.
* Go to File &gt; Save As...
* Select IGES as your file-type and click on the &quot;Options...&quot; button.
* Use the settings in the image below and click OK.
[[Image:Iges-settings.png]]
* If you had selected any objects in your assembly, SolidWorks will ask you if you want to export only the selected objects.
* You may also get the question if you want to resolve hidden, suppressed or lightweight objects first. Usually your answer will be &quot;Yes&quot;, unless you do not want to export certain parts.

== Importing in Maya ==
It is recommended that you now close SolidWorks for better performance. We'll now import the exported IGES data into Maya. It will probably look like a mess, but don't worry, we'll get to that.
* Start Maya.
* Go to File &gt; Open Scene..., locate your IGES file and hit Open. Note: large assemblies can take Maya a while to convert, so be patient!
Note: If Opening an IGES file is not available, you need to enable the plug in as follows.

Select Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Plug-in Manager 
to display the list of all known plug-ins. Click the loaded or auto load check box to load one of the ge2Export.mll, or ge2Export.so, or ge2Export.lib  and igesadd.mll  plug-ins. 

=== Cleaning up the scene ===
As you might or might not see, Maya will have quite a lot of duplicate parts and some settings need to be changed as well. Because this can be quite a lot of work, we'll do this by using the following MEL-script:

 string $select[] = `ls &quot;transform*&quot;`;
 delete $select;
 string $currentSelection [] = `ls -geometry`;
 string $loopSelection;
 for ($loopSelection in $currentSelection)
 {
 setAttr ($loopSelection + &quot;.&quot; + &quot;visibleInReflections&quot;) 1;
* Open the Script Editor by clicking on the icon in the right bottom of the screen.
* Paste the above script into the Script Editor, select it again by pressing CTRL+A.
* Open the &quot;Custom&quot; tab on the top shelve. (If you don't have one, create a new one, Go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Shelves...)
* Now go back to the Script Editor and drag the selected script into the &quot;Custom&quot; tab area - a new button appears.
* You can (but it is not necessary) make a nice icon for this button, so you can recognize it better later, or just because it looks nice.
** Go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Shelves...
** You will see something like this: [[Image:Maya-shelves-editor.png|none|]]
** First download this icon: http://www.extrapuur.nl/SWCLEANUP.bmp [[Image:SWCLEANUP.png]] (make sure you download the bmp, not the png hosted here on wikibooks!)
** Click the &quot;Change Image...&quot; button and locate the icon you just downloaded.
** Hit close and VOILA! There you have your very own SW-cleanup button!

* Now you can finally cleanup your scene: simply press the button you just created. This button will still be there the next time you start Maya, so it'll be much faster next time. '''important note: If you imported a part model and not an assembly, you won't have duplicate geometry, and you don't have to cleanup the scene either!'''

If everything has gone well, you will now have a clean version of your SolidWorks model in Maya. Time to save!
* Go to File &gt; Save Scene As...
* Enter an appropriate name for your file and hit &quot;Save&quot;.

== Creating an HDRI environment ==
Because the aim of this how-to is to get you started on photorealistic rendering, we will be using an [[w:HDRI|HDRI]] environment. HDRI stands for High Dynamic Range Imaging, and is basically a technique to use a picture of the environment for lighting your scene. This will result in very realistic and convincing shadows, higlights and reflections. This is very important for realistic emulation of chrome for example.

First of all, you'll need an HDR image. There is a whole range at http://debevec.org/Probes/ that you can download for free. I will use the [http://debevec.org/Probes/uffizi_probe.hdr Uffizi Gallery probe], but any other HDR image will do just fine.

Since maya 6.0 there's a special IBL node that you can create within mental ray. We will use this node to create the Image Based Lighting (IBL) within the scene.
to create this node:
* Go to Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Render Globals... ('Render Settings...' in Maya 7.0)
* Select &quot;mental ray&quot; in the &quot;Render Using&quot; drop down menu.
** If there is no mental ray in that menu, you need to turn it on. To do this, go to Window &gt; Settings/Preferences &gt; Plug-in Manager.
** Scroll down to Mayatomr.mll, and tick both boxes behind it. Now Maya will load mental ray by default when you start Maya.
* Now go to the mental ray tab.
* Scroll down until you see &quot;Image Based Lighting&quot;, open it and hit the &quot;Create&quot; button.
* A new settings window will appear in the right of the main screen (this area is called the Attribute Editor).

What we'll do next will appear to be double work (selecting the same image twice), but this way you can see your environment within your scene and still be able to adjust it.
* Set the &quot;Mapping&quot; option to &quot;Angular&quot;
* Click on the folder icon next to the &quot;Image Name&quot; field and locate the HDR image you just downloaded.
* Now change the &quot;Type&quot; option to &quot;Texture&quot; and click on the checkered icon next to the &quot;Texture&quot; option.
* A new window will pop up called &quot;Create Render Node&quot;. In the &quot;2D Textures&quot;-section, select &quot;File&quot;.
* Again, click the folder icon next to the &quot;Image Name&quot; field and locate the (same) HDR image.

We're now going to make a network to be able to adjust the gamma of the image. We need to do this because most HDR images are set at 1 (or at least read that way in Maya), and it should be around 2.

* With the texture file tab still open, go to Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Hypershade...
* A new window will appear. Click twice on the [[Image:Maya-hypershade-inputoutput.png]] button.
* You will now see how the texture is connected to the mental ray IBL node in the bottom of this window: [[Image:Maya-hypershade-probe-connections.png|none|500px]]
* Now go to Create &gt; Color Utilities &gt; Gamma Correct
* Drag the gamma node to a convenient location, so that you can still see the &quot;file1&quot; node, and the &quot;mentalrayIblShape1&quot; node; preferably between these two. You can zoom / pan in the views with the standard camera controls.
* Select the &quot;out&quot;-arrow at the right bottom of the &quot;file1&quot;-node, keep pressing it and go to outColor &gt; outColor.
* Click on the &quot;in&quot;-arrow on the left bottom of the gamma node and select value. You have connected the &quot;file1&quot; and the &quot;gammaCorrect1&quot; nodes with a green line.
* Connect the outValue of the &quot;gammaCorrect1&quot; node (outValue &gt; outValue) with the color of the &quot;mentalrayIbleShape1&quot; node in the same way. If you have done everything as described, you should see something that is connected like this: [[Image:Maya-nodes-connectedexample.png|none|500px]]

Now you can adjust the gamma of the HDR image. If you don't do this, your renders will be extremely bright in most cases.
* Click on the gamma node to select it. The properties open in the Attribute Editor (in the main Maya screen).
* Set all three gamma values to 2.2

Normally a gamma of 2.2 will do fine, but if you still think it is too bright (or even too dark) after you render the scene (we'll get to that later) you can always go back to this node and adjust the values: a higher value means &quot;darker&quot;, and a lower value means &quot;lighter&quot;.

As a final step in this part, you need to turn off the default light. This is because Maya places a light in the scene if there isn't already one. Apparently Maya doesn't recognize our IBL-node as a light, so you have to turn it off manually - otherwise your scene will be overexposed.
* Go to the Render Globals window
* Select the &quot;Common&quot; tab.
* Turn off &quot;Enable Default Light&quot; at the bottom of this window (you may need to scroll down).

== Assigning materials ==
We've now imported the SolidWorks model into Maya and set up an environment for it, so we're ready to assign materials to our model. It will not go into deep detail of how exactly you should tune your shaders - that's beyond the scope of this how-to - but it will provide you with a good basis to start from.

Right now, your model doesn't have any materials assigned to it, so when you render it, it won't be visible. Because it's more convenient if you can see the complete model when you test-render, we'll assign a temporary, bright and shiny material to the complete model. We'll also create a plane for the model to lay on.

* Make sure you're in &quot;shaded&quot; mode, by pressing 6 in the viewport.
* Go to Create &gt; NURBS primitives &gt; Plane, or click the plane button in the Surfaces tab.
* Scale this plane (by pressing r on your keyboard or clicking the scale button) to a size that fits your model.
* Open the Hypershade (Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Hypershade...)
* Press the &quot;Blinn&quot; button in the left of this window. (Make sure you are in Create Maya nodes, not mental ray nodes) You've just created a new material.
* Click on this node to open it's properties, and drag the color slider to the right to make it brighter (not completely white).
* Now select all the geometry from your model by opening the Outliner (Window &gt; Outliner...), selecting the first group of geomtry and SHIFT selecting the last group:[[Image:Maya-selected-all-geometry-outliner.png|none|150px]]
* Go back to the Hypershade and right click your Blinn material. Hold your mouse-button down and go to &quot;Assign Material To Selection&quot;.

We're now going to make a first test render, to see if everything has gone well.
* First create a resolution gate for your viewport, so you can see what area is going to be rendered. Go to View &gt; Camera Settings &gt; Resolution Gate in the viewport menu.
* Zoom in to a nice view on your model.
* Go to the Render Globals window (Window &gt; Rendering Editors &gt; Render Globals...)
* In the mental ray tab, turn on &quot;Final Gather&quot; (only the first checkbox). We'll leave these settings for what they are now.
* Now you can render! Hit the render-button, or go to Render &gt; Render Current Frame...
* This is how my render looks: [[Image:Maya-lighter-first-render.jpg|none]]

===Plastic===
The first material we'll create will be plain plastic. We'll apply this material to the middle part, the gas regulator and the push button.
Whenever you're going to create a new material, think of it in terms of how much it should reflect, how much it diffuses light, how transparant it is etc. because these are your parameters within Maya.
[[Image:Maya-blinn-black-plastic.png|right|200px]]To create the plastic material:
* Open the Hypershade window.
* Create a Blinn material just like you did before. Blinn differs from Lambert for example (which is the standard material in Maya) that it has a reflectivity parameter.
* Set the Color to black (not completely! set the slider at about 5%).
* Set the Eccentricity to 0.175
* Set the Specular Roll Off to 1.000
* Set the Specular Color to 100% white
* Set the Reflectivity to 0.400
If you're not sure about the settings, you can look at the picture beside this text on the right.
You have now created a material that is a bit reflective, but with sharp, bright highlights. I strongly encourage you to play with these settings, and those of other materials; it will learn you what parameters you need to quickly set the material/look you are after.
To apply this material to the middle part, the gas regulator and the push button, select these first. Normally these would be easy to recognise in the outliner (Window &gt; Outliner...), because they get the same name you gave them in Solidworks. In this example (the lighter), the creator of that assembly didn't give names to the parts, so you'll have to browse through the Outliner. '''Watch out!''' If you select the parts in the viewport, there's a big chance you'll miss some faces, so in most cases you should use the Outliner for selecting.
In this case it's Part020, Part017, Part013 &amp; Part015. Use CTRL click to select all of these together.
Now go back to the Hypershade, right click on your new black material and drag your mouse to &quot;Assign Material To Selection&quot;.

===Transparent plastic===
[[Image:Maya-phong-transparent-orange-plastic.png|right|200px]]For the fuel part, we'll assign a nice orange transparant material.
* Open the Hypershade window.
* Create a Phong material.
* Double click on the gray Color field in the Attribute Editor.
* A new color window opens. Select a color you like; I chose the brightest orange, but if you're more into green, just choose that!
* Set the Transparency to about 60-70%
* Set the Diffuse to 1.000
* Set the Reflectivity to 0.400
Assign the material to Part016 in the Outliner. As you can see in the viewport, the color of that part has changed.

===Chrome===
[[Image:Maya-phong-chrome.png|right|200px]]The metal part needs to be nice &amp; shiny, so we'll make a chrome-like material for that.
* Again, go to the Hypershade
* Create a Phong material.
* Set the Cosine Power to 5.000
* Set the Specular Color to 100% white
* Set the reflectivity to 1.000
Assign this material to the metal part - Part014 in the Outliner.
Chrome is quite a difficult material to make, because you're all dependent from you're environment - it's nearly &quot;all&quot; reflections. Because we have the HDR environment, that problem is not so big anymore, but to make it more convincing, it would need more reflections from things that are closer to the lighter. It could be the table it's lying on or the person that is watching it. Right now it's lying in an empty street on a completely homogenic plane. Anyway, you can check the results, I think this looks quite realistic already. You really need to experiment with the settings for each material to make it work, and if you really want realistic images, you would probably want to apply a texture to the plane it's lying on.

===Wood Texture===
As stated before, to make it make the lighter more realistic, it needs a realistic environment. We already made part of this environment with the HDR-image, but to make it even more convincing, we're going to turn the ground-plane into a realistic looking table.
We need an image of wood to apply to the plane. I'll use one from [http://www.mayang.com/textures/Nature/html/Plants%20and%20Derived%20Materials/Wood/Manufactured%20Items/index.html Mayang's Free Texture Library], called &quot;parallel wooden planks&quot;.
* In the Hypershade, select the &quot;Lambert1&quot; material
* Go to the Attribute editor and click on the checkered icon next to the &quot;Color&quot; option.
* Choose &quot;File&quot; and load your texture into the &quot;Image Name&quot; field (click on the folder icon)
* You can now see a preview of the texture in your viewport (if not, press 6 while in the viewport)
* In my case, the lighter was not really fortunate positioned, so I selected everything in the outliner and dragged the lighter a bit back

If you render now, you will see it has become quite realistic! Tune your materials a bit more and tweak your mental ray settings, and no-one will be able to tell it from real.

== Setting up mental ray ==
In general, setting mental ray's render quality to a lower quality level is appropriate while you are tweaking your materials, changing camera angles, and any other process that may require repeatedly rendering your scene.  But when you are relatively satisfied with how it looks you can then switch your mental ray settings to a level appropriate for production rendering:
* Either click the render settings button (black clapperboard icon with the two radio buttons) or go to: Render &gt; Render Current Frame &gt; []
* On the &quot;Quality&quot; tab, change the quality preset dropdown to &quot;Production&quot;
* On the &quot;Indirect Lighting&quot; tab, under the &quot;Final Gathering&quot; heading, check the box to enable Final Gathering
* The default accuracy of 100 is usually insufficient.  Raising this to 256 is usually a good place to start
* If, at 256, you are getting spotty artifacts in your render, try raising the point interpolation to 30
* If you have multiple layers of transparent geometry, it may be necessary to raise the reflection, refractions, and trace depth under &quot;Final Gathering Tracing&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rene Descartes (1596-1650)==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes Descartes] was also known as Cartesius. He had an empirical approach to consciousness and the mind, describing in his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' (1641) what it is like to be human. His idea of perception is summarised in the diagram below.

[[Image:Constuddescart3.gif]]

===Dubitability===

Descartes is probably most famous for his statement: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Descartes is clear that what he means by ''thought'' is all the things that occur in experience, whether dreams, sensations, symbols etc.:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;5. Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think [ represent to my mind ] a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God. Others, again, have certain other forms; as when I will, fear, affirm, or deny, I always, indeed, apprehend something as the object of my thought, but I also embrace in thought something more than the representation of the object; and of this class of thoughts some are called volitions or affections, and others judgments.&quot; (Meditation III).&lt;/font&gt;

He repeats this general description of thought in many places in the Meditations and elsewhere. What Descartes is saying is that his meditator has thoughts; that there are thoughts and this cannot be doubted when and where they occur (Russell (1945) makes this clear).

Needless to say the basic ''cogito'' put forward by Descartes has provoked endless debate, much of it based on the false premise that Descartes was presenting an inference or argument rather than just saying that thought certainly exists. However, the extent to which the philosopher can go beyond this certainty to concepts such as God, science or the soul is highly problematical.

===The description of thoughts and mind===

[[Image:Descartes2.jpg|thumb|left|Descartes]]Descartes uses the words &quot;ideas&quot; and &quot;imagination&quot; in a rather unusual fashion. The word &quot;idea&quot; he defines as follows:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;5. Of my thoughts some are, as it were, images of things, and to these alone properly belongs the name IDEA; as when I think [ represent to my mind ] a man, a chimera, the sky, an angel or God.&quot; (Meditation III).&lt;/font&gt; 

As will be seen later, Descartes regards his mind as an unextended thing (a point) so &quot;images of things&quot; or &quot;IDEAS&quot; require some way of being extended. In the ''Treatise on Man'' (see below) he is explicit that ideas are extended things in the brain, on the surface of the &quot;common sense&quot;. In ''Rules for the Direction of the Mind'' he notes that we &quot;receive ideas from the common sensibility&quot;, an extended part of the brain. This usage of the term &quot;ideas&quot; is very strange to the modern reader and the source of many mistaken interpretations. It should be noted that occasionally Descartes uses the term 'idea' according to its usual meaning where it is almost interchangeable with 'thought' in general but usually he means a representation laid out in the brain.

Descartes considers the imagination to be the way that the mind &quot;turns towards the body&quot; (by which Descartes means the part of the brain in the body called the senses communis):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;3. I remark, besides, that this power of imagination which I possess, in as far as it differs from the power of conceiving, is in no way necessary to my [nature or] essence, that is, to the essence of my mind; for although I did not possess it, I should still remain the same that I now am, from which it seems we may conclude that it depends on something different from the mind. And I easily understand that, if some body exists, with which my mind is so conjoined and united as to be able, as it were, to consider it when it chooses, it may thus imagine corporeal objects; so that this mode of thinking differs from pure intellection only in this respect, that the mind in conceiving turns in some way upon itself, and considers some one of the ideas it possesses within itself; but in imagining it turns toward the body, and contemplates in it some object conformed to the idea which it either of itself conceived or apprehended by sense.&quot; Meditations VI &lt;/font&gt;

So ideas, where they become imagined images of things were thought by Descartes to involve a phase of creating a form in the brain.

Descartes gives a clear description of his experience as a container that allows length, breadth, depth, continuity and time with contents arranged within it:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;2. But before considering whether such objects as I conceive exist without me, I must examine their ideas in so far as these are to be found in my consciousness, and discover which of them are distinct and which confused.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. In the first place, I distinctly imagine that quantity which the philosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth, and depth that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which it is attributed. Further, I can enumerate in it many diverse parts, and attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes, figures, situations, and local motions; and, in fine, I can assign to each of these motions all degrees of duration.&quot;(Meditation V).&lt;/font&gt;

He points out that sensation occurs by way of the brain, conceptualising the brain as the place in the body where the extended experiences are found : Meditations VI:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;20. I remark, in the next place, that the mind does not immediately receive the impression from all the parts of the body, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one small part of it, viz., that in which the common sense (senses communis) is said to be, which as often as it is affected in the same way gives rise to the same perception in the mind, although meanwhile the other parts of the body may be diversely disposed, as is proved by innumerable experiments, which it is unnecessary here to enumerate.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He finds that both imaginings and perceptions are extended things and hence in the (brain part) of the body. The area of extended things is called the ''res extensa'', it includes the brain, body and world beyond. He also considers the origin of intuitions, suggesting that they can enter the mind without being consciously created: Meditations VI, 10 :

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;10. Moreover, I find in myself diverse faculties of thinking that have each their special mode: for example, I find I possess the faculties of imagining and perceiving, without which I can indeed clearly and distinctly conceive myself as entire, but I cannot reciprocally conceive them without conceiving myself, that is to say, without an intelligent substance in which they reside, for [in the notion we have of them, or to use the terms of the schools] in their formal concept, they comprise some sort of intellection; whence I perceive that they are distinct from myself as modes are from things. I remark likewise certain other faculties, as the power of changing place, of assuming diverse figures, and the like, that cannot be conceived and cannot therefore exist, any more than the preceding, apart from a substance in which they inhere. It is very evident, however, that these faculties, if they really exist, must belong to some corporeal or extended substance, since in their clear and distinct concept there is contained some sort of extension, but no intellection at all. Further, I cannot doubt but that there is in me a certain passive faculty of perception, that is, of receiving and taking knowledge of the ideas of sensible things; but this would be useless to me, if there did not also exist in me, or in some other thing, another active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas. But this active faculty cannot be in me [in as far as I am but a thinking thing], seeing that it does not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are frequently produced in my mind without my contributing to it in any way, and even frequently contrary to my will. This faculty must therefore exist in some substance different from me, in which all the objective reality of the ideas that are produced by this faculty is contained formally or eminently, as I before remarked; and this substance is either a body, that is to say, a corporeal nature in which is contained formally [and in effect] all that is objectively [and by representation] in those ideas; or it is God himself, or some other creature, of a rank superior to body, in which the same is contained eminently. But as God is no deceiver, it is manifest that he does not of himself and immediately communicate those ideas to me, nor even by the intervention of any creature in which their objective reality is not formally, but only eminently, contained. For as he has given me no faculty whereby I can discover this to be the case, but, on the contrary, a very strong inclination to believe that those ideas arise from corporeal objects, I do not see how he could be vindicated from the charge of deceit, if in truth they proceeded from any other source, or were produced by other causes than corporeal things: and accordingly it must be concluded, that corporeal objects exist. Nevertheless, they are not perhaps exactly such as we perceive by the senses, for their comprehension by the senses is, in many instances, very obscure and confused; but it is at least necessary to admit that all which I clearly and distinctly conceive as in them, that is, generally speaking all that is comprehended in the object of speculative geometry, really exists external to me. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that the mind itself is the thing that generates thoughts and is not extended (occupies no space). This 'mind' is known as the ''res cogitans''. The mind works on the imaginings and perceptions that exist in that part of the body called the brain. This is Descartes' dualism: it is the proposition that there is an unextended place called the mind that acts upon the extended things in the brain. Meditations VI, 9:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;... And although I may, or rather, as I will shortly say, although I certainly do possess a body with which I am very closely conjoined; nevertheless, because, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in as far as I am only a thinking and unextended thing, and as, on the other hand, I possess a distinct idea of body, in as far as it is only an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, [that is, my mind, by which I am what I am], is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without it.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Notice that the intellection associated with ideas is part of an &quot;active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas&quot; that has a &quot;corporeal nature&quot; (it is in the brain). This suggests that the &quot;thinking&quot; in the passage above applies only to those thoughts that are unextended, however, it is difficult to find a definition of these particular thoughts. 

&quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot; demonstrates Descartes' dualism. He describes the brain as the part of the body that contains images or phantasies of the world but believes that there is a further, spiritual mind that processes the images in the brain:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;My fourth supposition is that the power of movement, in fact the nerves, originate in the brain, where the phantasy is seated; and that the phantasy moves them in various ways, as the external sense &lt;organ&gt; moves the &lt;organ of&gt; common sensibility, or as the whole pen is moved by its tip. This illustration also shows how it is that the phantasy can cause various movements in the nerves, although it has not images of these formed in itself, but certain other images, of which these movements are possible effects. For the pen as a whole does not move in the same way as its tip; indeed, the greater part of the pen seems to go along with an altogether different, contrary motion. This enables us to understand how the movements of all other animals are accomplished, although we suppose them to have no consciousness (rerum cognitio) but only a bodily &lt;organ of&gt; phantasy; and furthermore, how it is that in ourselves those operations are performed which occur without any aid of reason.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;My fifth and last supposition is that the power of cognition properly so called is purely spiritual, and is just as distinct from the body as a whole as blood is from bone or a hand from an eye; and that it is a single power. Sometimes it receives images from the common sensibility at the same time as the phantasy does; sometimes it applies itself to the images preserved in memory; sometimes it forms new images, and these so occupy the imagination that often it is not able at the same time to receive ideas from the common sensibility, or to pass them on to the locomotive power in the way that the body left to itself -would. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Descartes sums up his concept of a point soul seeing forms in the world via forms in the sensus communis in ''Passions of the Soul'', 35:

&quot;By this means the two images which are in the brain form but one upon the gland, which, acting immediately upon the soul, causes it to see the form in the mind&quot;.

===Anatomical and physiological ideas===

In his ''Treatise on Man'' Descartes summarises his ideas on how we perceive and react to things as well as how consciousness is achieved anatomically and physiologically. The 'Treatise' was written at a time when even galvanic electricity was unknown. The excerpt given below covers Descartes' analysis of perception and stimulus-response processing. 

[[Image:constuddescart1.gif]]

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt; &quot;Thus for example [in Fig 1], if fire A is close to foot B, the tiny parts of this fire (which, as you know, move about very rapidly) have the power also to move the area of skin which they touch. In this way they pull the tiny fibre ''cc'' which you see attached to it, and simultaneously open the entrance to the pore ''de'', located opposite the point where this fiber terminates - just as when you pull one end of a string, you cause a bell hanging at the other end to ring at the same time.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;When the entrance to the pore or small tube ''de'' is opened in this way, the animal spirits from cavity F enter and are carried through it - some to muscles which serve to pull the foot away from the fire, some to muscles which turn the eyes and head to look at it, and some to muscles which make the hands move and the whole body turn in order to protect it.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now I maintain that when God unites a rational soul to this machine (in a way that I intend to explain later) he will place its principle seat in the brain, and will make its nature such that the soul will have different sensations corresponding to the different ways in which the entrances to the pores in the internal surface of the brain are opened by means of nerves.&lt;/font&gt;

[[Image:constuddescart2.gif]]

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;In order to see clearly how ideas are formed of the objects which strike the senses, observe in this diagram [fig 2] the tiny fibres 12, 34, 56, and the like, which make up the optic nerve and stretch from the back of the eye at 1, 3, 5 to the internal surface of the brain at 2, 4, 6. Now assume that these fibres are so arranged that if the rays coming, for example, from point A of the object happen to press upon the back of the eye at point 1, they pull the whole of fibre 12 and enlarge the opening of the tiny tube marked 2. In the same way, the rays which come from point B enlarge the opening of the tiny tube 4, and likewise for the others. We have already described how, depending on the different ways in which the points 1, 3, 5 are pressed by these rays, a figure is traced on the back of the eye corresponding to that of the object ABC. Similarly it is obvious that, depending on the different ways in which the tiny tubes 2, 4, 6 are opened by the fibres 12, 34, 56 etc., a corresponding figure must also be traced on the internal surface of the brain.&lt;/font&gt;

.....

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And note that by 'figures' I mean not only things which somehow represent the position of the edges and surfaces of objects, but also anything which, as I said above, can give the soul occasion to perceive movement, size, distance, colours, sounds, smells and other such qualities. And I also include anything that can make the soul feel pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, joy, sadness and other such passions.&lt;/font&gt;

...

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now among these figures, it is not those imprinted on the external sense organs, or on the internal surface of the brain, which should be taken to be ideas - but only those which are traced in the spirits on the surface of gland H (''where the seat of the imagination and the 'common sense' is located''). That is to say, it is only the latter figures which should be taken to be the forms or images which the rational soul united to this machine will consider directly when it imagines some object or perceives it by the senses.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;And note that I say 'imagines or perceives by the senses'. For I wish to apply the term 'idea' generally to all impressions which the spirits can receive as they leave gland H. These are to be attributed to the 'common' sense when they depend on the presence of objects; but they may also proceed from many other causes (as I shall explain later), and they should then be attributed to the imagination.
&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

The ''common sense'' is referred to by philosophers as the ''senses communis''. Descartes considered this to be the place where all the sensations were bound together and proposed the pineal gland for this role. This was in the days before the concept of 'dominance' of parts of the brain had been developed so Descartes reasoned that only a single organ could host a bound representation.

Notice how Descartes is explicit about ideas being '''traced in the spirits on the surface of the gland'''. Notice also how the rational soul will consider forms on the common sense '''directly'''. 

Descartes believed that animals are not conscious because, although he thought they possessed the stimulus-response loop in the same way as humans he believed that they do not possess a soul.

==John Locke (1632-1704)==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke Locke's] most important philosophical work on the human mind was &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; written in 1689. His idea of perception is summarised in the diagram below:

[[Image:Constudlocke1.gif]]

Locke is an Indirect Realist, admitting of external objects but describing these as represented within the mind. The objects themselves are thought to have a form and properties that are the ''archetype'' of the object and these give rise in the brain and mind to derived copies called ''ektypa''.

Like Descartes, he believes that people have souls that produce thoughts. 
Locke considers that sensations make their way from the senses to the brain where they are laid out for understanding as a 'view':

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And if these organs, or the nerves which are the conduits to convey them from without to their audience in the brain,- the mind's presence-room (as I may so call it)- are any of them so disordered as not to perform their functions, they have no postern to be admitted by; no other way to bring themselves into view, and be perceived by the understanding.&quot; (Chapter III, 1).&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that what is sensed becomes a mental thing: Chapter IX: Of Perception paragraph 1: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;This is certain, that whatever alterations are made in the body, if they reach not the mind; whatever impressions are made on the outward parts, if they are not taken notice of within, there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it does a billet, unless the motion be continued to the brain, and there the sense of heat, or idea of pain, be produced in the mind; wherein consists actual perception. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

[[Image:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|Locke]]Locke calls the contents of consciousness &quot;ideas&quot; (cf: Descartes, Malebranche) and regards sensation, imagination etc. as being similar or even alike. Chapter I: Of Ideas in general, and their Original:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. Idea is the object of thinking. Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the ideas that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,- such as are those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others: it is in the first place then to be inquired, How he comes by them? &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;I know it is a received doctrine, that men have native ideas, and original characters, stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This opinion I have at large examined already; and, I suppose what I have said in the foregoing Book will be much more easily admitted, when I have shown whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has; and by what ways and degrees they may come into the mind;- for which I shall appeal to every one's own observation and experience. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;2. All ideas come from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:- How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is that which supplies our understandings with all the materials of thinking. These two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. The objects of sensation one source of ideas. First, our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. And thus we come by those ideas we have of yellow, white, heat, cold, soft, hard, bitter, sweet, and all those which we call sensible qualities; which when I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions. This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call SENSATION.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;4. The operations of our minds, the other source of them. Secondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,- the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;- which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without. And such are perception, thinking, doubting, believing, reasoning, knowing, willing, and all the different actings of our own minds;- which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves, do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the other SENSATION, so I Call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. These two, I say, viz. external material things, as the objects of SENSATION, and the operations of our own minds within, as the objects of REFLECTION, are to me the only originals from whence all our ideas take their beginnings. The term operations here I use in a large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;5. All our ideas are of the one or the other of these. The understanding seems to me not to have the least glimmering of any ideas which it doth not receive from one of these two. External objects furnish the mind with the ideas of sensible qualities, which are all those different perceptions they produce in us; and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own operations. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He calls ideas that come directly from the senses ''primary qualities'' and those that come from reflection upon these he calls ''secondary qualities'':

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;9. Primary qualities of bodies. Qualities thus considered in bodies are, 
First, such as are utterly inseparable from the body, in what state soever it be; and such as in all the alterations and changes it suffers, all the force can be used upon it, it constantly keeps; and such as sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which has bulk enough to be perceived; and the mind finds inseparable from every particle of matter, though less than to make itself singly be perceived by our senses:  .......... These I call original or primary qualities of body, which I think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us, viz. solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest, and number.
10. Secondary qualities of bodies. Secondly, such qualities which in truth are nothing in the objects themselves but power to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities.....&quot; (Chapter VIII).&lt;/font&gt;

He gives examples of secondary qualities:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;13. How secondary qualities produce their ideas. After the same manner, that the ideas of these original qualities are produced in us, we may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities are also produced, viz. by the operation of insensible particles on our senses. .....v.g. that a violet, by the impulse of such insensible particles of matter, of peculiar figures and bulks, and in different degrees and modifications of their motions, causes the ideas of the blue colour, and sweet scent of that flower to be produced in our minds. It being no more impossible to conceive that God should annex such ideas to such motions, with which they have no similitude, than that he should annex the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our flesh, with which that idea hath no resemblance.&quot; (Chapter VIII).&lt;/font&gt;

He argues against all conscious experience being in mental space (does not consider that taste might be on the tongue or a smell come from a cheese): Chapter XIII: Complex Ideas of Simple Modes:- and First, of the Simple Modes of the Idea of Space - paragraph 25:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;I shall not now argue with those men, who take the measure and possibility of all being only from their narrow and gross imaginations: but having here to do only with those who conclude the essence of body to be extension, because they say they cannot imagine any sensible quality of any body without extension,- I shall desire them to consider, that, had they reflected on their ideas of tastes and smells as much as on those of sight and touch; nay, had they examined their ideas of hunger and thirst, and several other pains, they would have found that they included in them no idea of extension at all, which is but an affection of body, as well as the rest, discoverable by our senses, which are scarce acute enough to look into the pure essences of things.&quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Locke understood the &quot;specious&quot; or extended present but conflates this with longer periods of time: Chapter XIV. Idea of Duration and its Simple Modes - paragraph 1: 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Duration is fleeting extension. There is another sort of distance, or length, the idea whereof we get not from the permanent parts of space, but from the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession. This we call duration; the simple modes whereof are any different lengths of it whereof we have distinct ideas, as hours, days, years, &amp;c., time and eternity.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

Locke is uncertain about whether extended ideas are viewed from an unextended soul.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;He that considers how hardly sensation is, in our thoughts, reconcilable to extended matter; or existence to anything that has no extension at all, will confess that he is very far from certainly knowing what his soul is. It is a point which seems to me to be put out of the reach of our knowledge: and he who will give himself leave to consider freely, and look into the dark and intricate part of each hypothesis, will scarce find his reason able to determine him fixedly for or against the soul's materiality. Since, on which side soever he views it, either as an unextended substance, or as a thinking extended matter, the difficulty to conceive either will, whilst either alone is in his thoughts, still drive him to the contrary side.&quot;(Chapter III, 6).&lt;/font&gt;

==David Hume (1711-1776)==

'''Hume (1739-40). A Treatise of Human Nature: Being An Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning Into Moral Subjects.'''
http://www.class.uidaho.edu/mickelsen/ToC/hume%20treatise%20ToC.htm

[[Image:David_Hume.jpg|thumb|left|Hume]]Hume represents a type of pure empiricism where certainty is only assigned to present experience. As we can only directly know the mind he works within this constraint. He admits that there can be consistent bodies of knowledge within experience and would probably regard himself as an Indirect Realist but with the caveat that the things that are inferred to be outside the mind, in the physical world, could be no more than inferences within the mind.

Hume has a clear concept of mental space and time that is informed by the senses:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The idea of space is convey'd to the mind by two senses, the sight and touch; nor does anything ever appear extended, that is not either visible or tangible. That compound impression, which represents extension, consists of several lesser impressions, that are indivisible to the eye or feeling, and may be call'd impressions of atoms or corpuscles endow'd with colour and solidity. But this is not all. 'Tis not only requisite, that these atoms shou'd be colour'd or tangible, in order to discover themselves to our senses; 'tis also necessary we shou'd preserve the idea of their colour or tangibility in order to comprehend them by our imagination. There is nothing but the idea of their colour or tangibility, which can render them conceivable by the mind. Upon the removal of the ideas of these sensible qualities, they are utterly annihilated to the thought or imagination.'&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;Now such as the parts are, such is the whole. If a point be not consider'd as colour'd or tangible, it can convey to us no idea; and consequently the idea of extension, which is compos'd of the ideas of these points, can never possibly exist. But if the idea of extension really can exist, as we are conscious it does, its parts must also exist; and in order to that, must be consider'd as colour'd or tangible. We have therefore no idea of space or extension, but when we regard it as an object either of our sight or feeling.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;The same reasoning will prove, that the indivisible moments of time must be fill'd with some real object or existence, whose succession forms the duration, and makes it be conceivable by the mind.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In common with Locke and Eastern Philosophy, Hume considers reflection and sensation to be similar, perhaps identical:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Thus it appears, that the belief or assent, which always attends the memory and senses, is nothing but the vivacity of those perceptions they present; and that this alone distinguishes them from the imagination. To believe is in this case to feel an immediate impression of the senses, or a repetition of that impression in the memory. 'Tis merely the force and liveliness of the perception, which constitutes the first act of the judgment, and lays the foundation of that reasoning, which we build upon it, when we trace the relation of cause and effect.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Hume considers that the origin of sensation can never be known, believing that the canvass of the mind contains our view of the world whatever the ultimate source of the images within the view and that we can construct consistent bodies of knowledge within these constraints:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;As to those impressions, which arise from the senses, their ultimate cause is, in my opinion, perfectly inexplicable by human reason, and 'twill always be impossible to decide with certainty, whether they arise immediately from the object, or are produc'd by the creative power of the mind, or are deriv'd from the author of our being. Nor is such a question any way material to our present purpose. We may draw inferences from the coherence of our perceptions, whether they be true or false; whether they represent nature justly, or be mere illusions of the senses.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

It may be possible to trace the origins of Jackson's Knowledge Argument in Hume's work:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot; Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be plac'd before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; 'tis plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, said will be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place betwixt the contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether 'tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, tho' it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I believe i here are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always derived from the correspondent impressions; tho' the instance is so particular and singular, that 'tis scarce worth our observing, and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

'''David Hume (1748) An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'''
http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/david_hume/human_understanding.html

Hume's view of Locke and Malebranche:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation: But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke shall be entirely forgotten.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is clear about relational knowledge in space and time:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;13. .. But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall find, upon a nearer examination, that it is really confined within very narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience. When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas, gold, and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

...

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;19. Though it be too obvious to escape observation, that different ideas are connected together; I do not find that any philosopher has attempted to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject, however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is also clear that, although we experience the output of processes, we do not experience the processes themselves:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;29. It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of objects; while she conceals from us those powers and principles on which the influence of those objects entirely depends. Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of bread; but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for ever in a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant conception. ..&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;58. ... All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely without any meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Our idea of process is not a direct experience but seems to originate from remembering the repetition of events:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;59 ..It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant, and to believe that it will exist.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

==Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)==

[[Image:Immanuel_Kant_2.jpg|thumb|left|kant]]Kant's greatest work on the subject of consciousness and the mind is Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Kant describes his objective in this work as discovering the axioms (&quot;a priori concepts&quot;) and then the processes of 'understanding'.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P12 &quot;This enquiry, which is somewhat deeply grounded, has two sides. The one refers to the objects of pure understanding, and is intended to expound and render intelligible the objective validity of its a priori concepts. It is therefore essential to my purposes. The other seeks to investigate the pure understanding itself, its possibility and the cognitive faculties upon which it rests; and so deals with it in its subjective aspect. Although this latter exposition is of great importance for my chief purpose, it does not form an essential part of it. For the chief question is always simply this: - what and how much can the understanding and reason know apart from all experience?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant's idea of perception and mind is summarised in the illustration below:

[[Image:Constudkant.gif]]

'Experience' is simply accepted. Kant believes that the physical world exists but is not known directly:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 24 &quot;For we are brought to the conclusion that we can never transcend the limits of possible experience, though that is precisely what this science is concerned, above all else, to achieve. This situation yields, however, just the very experiment by which, indirectly, we are enabled to prove the truth of this first estimate of our a priori knowledge of reason, namely, that such knowledge has to do only with appearances, and must leave the thing in itself as indeed real per se, but as not known by us. &quot;&lt;/font&gt; 

Kant is clear about the form and content of conscious experience. He notes that we can only experience things that have appearance and 'form' - content and geometrical arrangement.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P65-66 &quot;IN whatever manner and by whatever means a mode of knowledge may relate to objects, intuition is that through which it is in immediate relation to them, and to which all thought as a means is directed. But intuition takes place only in so far as the object is given to us. This again is only possible, to man at least, in so far as the mind is affected in a certain way. The capacity (receptivity) for receiving representations through the mode in which we are affected by objects, is entitled sensibility. Objects are given to us by means of sensibility, and it alone yields us intuitions; they are thought through the understanding, and from the understanding arise concepts. But all thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us. The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by it, is sensation. That intuition which is in relation to the object through sensation, is entitled empirical. The undetermined object of an empirical intuition is entitled appearance. That in the appearance which corresponds to sensation I term its matter; but that which so determines the manifold of appearance that it allows of being ordered in certain relations, I term the form of appearance. That in which alone the sensations can be posited and ordered in a certain form, cannot itself be sensation; and therefore, while the matter of all appearance is given to us a posteriori only, its form must lie ready for the sensations a priori in the mind, and so must allow of being considered apart from all sensation. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Furthermore he realises that experience exists without much content. That consciousness depends on form:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P66 &quot;The pure form of sensible intuitions in general, in which all the manifold of intuition is intuited in certain relations, must be found in the mind a priori. This pure form of sensibility may also itself be called pure intuition. Thus, if I take away from the representation of a body that which the understanding thinks in regard to it, substance, force, divisibility, etc. , and likewise what belongs to sensation, impenetrability, hardness, colour, etc. , something still remains over from this empirical intuition, namely, extension and figure. These belong to pure intuition, which, even without any actual object of the senses or of sensation, exists in the mind a priori as a mere form of sensibility. The science of all principles of a priori sensibility I call transcendental aesthetic.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant proposes that space exists in our experience and that experience could not exist without it (apodeictic means 'incontrovertible):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 68 &quot;1. Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer experiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to something outside me (that is, to something in another region of space from that in which I find myself), and similarly in order that I may be able to represent them as outside and alongside one another, and accordingly as not only different but as in different places, the representation of space must be presupposed. The representation of space cannot, therefore, be empirically obtained from the relations of outer appearance. On the contrary, this outer experience is itself possible at all only through that representation. 2. Space is a necessary a priori representation, which underlies all outer intuitions. We can never represent to ourselves the absence of space, though we can quite well think it as empty of objects. It must therefore be regarded as the condition of the possibility of appearances, and not as a determina- tion dependent upon them. It is an a priori representation, which necessarily underlies outer appearances. * 3. The apodeictic certainty of all geometrical propositions and the possibility of their a priori construction is grounded in this a priori necessity of space. .........&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He is equally clear about the necessity of time as part of experience but he has no clear exposition of the (specious present) extended present:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 74 &quot;1. Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not presupposed as underlying them a priori. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively). They are connected with the appearances only as effects accidentally added by the particular constitution of the sense organs. Accordingly, they are not a priori representations, but are grounded in sensation, and, indeed, in the case of taste, even upon feeling (pleasure and pain), as an effect of sensation. Further, no one can have a priori a representation of a colour or of any taste; whereas, since space concerns only the pure form of intuition, and therefore involves no sensation whatsoever, and nothing empirical, all kinds and determinations of space can and must be represented a priori, if concepts of figures and of their relations are to arise. Through space alone is it possible that things should be outer objects to us. ..2. 3.. 4.. 5...&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Kant has a model of experience as a succession of 3D instants, based on conventional 18th century thinking, allowing his reason to overcome his observation. He says of time that:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;P 79 &quot; It is nothing but the form of our inner intuition. If we take away from our inner intuition the peculiar condition of our sensibility, the concept of time likewise vanishes; it does not inhere in the objects, but merely in the subject which intuits them. I can indeed say that my representations follow one another; but this is only to say that we are conscious of them as in a time sequence, that is, in conformity with the form of inner sense. Time is not, therefore, something in itself, nor is it an objective determination inherent in things.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This analysis is strange because if uses the geometric term &quot;form&quot; but then uses the processing term &quot;succession&quot;.

==Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) ==

[[Image:Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg|thumb|left|Leibniz]]Leibniz is one of the first to notice that there is a problem with the proposition that computational machines could be conscious:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;One is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon it is inexplicable on mechanical principles, that is, by figures and motions. In imagining that there is a machine whose construction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have perception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same proportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a windmill. Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find only parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain a perception. Thus it is in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine, that one must look for perception.&quot; Monadology, 17.&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz considered that the world was composed of &quot;monads&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant 'without parts.' (Theod. 10.) &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;2. And there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.&lt;/font&gt; 

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form [figure] nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the elements of things. &quot; (Monadology 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

These monads are considered to be capable of perception through the meeting of things at a point:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;They cannot have shapes, because then they would have parts; and therefore one monad in itself, and at a moment, cannot be distinguished from another except by its internal qualities and actions; which can only be its ''perceptions'' (that is, the representations of the composite, or of what is external, in the simple), or its ''appetitions'' (its tending to move from one perception to another, that is), which are the principles of change. For the simplicity of a substance does not in any way rule out a multiplicity in the modifications which must exist together in one simple substance; and those modifications must consist in the variety of its relationships to things outside it - like the way in which in a ''centre'', or a ''point'', although it is completely simple, there are an infinity of angles formed which meet in it.&quot; (Principles of Nature and Grace 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz also describes this in his &quot;New System&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;It is only atoms of substance, that is to say real unities absolutely devoid of parts, that can be the sources of actions, and the absolute first principles of the composition of things, and as it were the ultimate elements in the analysis of substances &lt;substantial things&gt;.  They might be called ''metaphysical points''; they have ''something of the nature of life'' and a kind of ''perception'', and ''mathematical points'' are their ''point of view'' for expressing the universe.&quot;(New System (11) 1695).&lt;/font&gt;

Having identified perception with metaphysical points Leibniz realises that there is a problem connecting the points with the world (cf: epiphenomenalism):

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Having decided these things, I thought I had reached port, but when I set myself to think about the union of the soul with the body I was as it were carried back into the open sea. For I could find no way of explaining how the body can make something pass over into the soul or vice versa, or how one created substance can communicate with another.&quot;(New System (12) 1695).&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz devises a theory of &quot;pre-established harmony&quot; to overcome this epiphenomenalism. He discusses how two separate clocks could come to tell the same time and proposes that this could be due to mutual influence of one clock on the other (&quot;the way of influence&quot;), continual adjustment by a workman (&quot;the way of assistance&quot;) or by making the clocks so well that they are always in agreement (&quot;the way of pre-established agreement&quot; or harmony). He considers each of these alternatives for harmonising the perceptions with the world and concludes that only the third is viable:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Thus there remains only my theory, ''the way of pre-established harmony'', set up by a contrivance of divine foreknowledge, which formed each of these substances from the outset in so perfect, so regular, and so exact a manner, that merely by following out its own laws, which were given to it when it was brought into being, each substance is nevertheless in harmony with the other, just as if there were a mutual influence between them, or as if in addition to his general concurrence God were continually operating upon them. (Third Explanation of the New System (5), 1696).&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This means that he must explain how perceptions involving the world take place:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Because of the plenitude of the world everything is linked, and every body acts to a greater or lesser extent on every other body in proportion to distance, and is affected by it in return. It therefore follows that every monad is a living mirror, or a mirror endowed with internal activity, representing the universe in accordance with its own point of view, and as orderly as the universe itself. The perceptions of monads arise one out of another by the laws of appetite, or of the ''final causes of good and evil'' (which are prominent perceptions, orderly or disorderly), just as changes in bodies or in external phenomena arise one from another by the laws of ''efficient causes'', of motion that is. Thus there is perfect ''harmony'' between the perceptions of the monad and the motions of bodies, pre-established from the outset, between the system of efficient causes and that of final causes. And it is that harmony that the agreement or physical union between the soul and body consists, without either of them being able to change the laws of the other.&quot; (Principles of Nature and Grace (3) 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

The &quot;laws of appetite&quot; are defined as:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The action of the internal principle which brings about change, or the passage from one perception to another, can be called ''appetition''. In fact appetite cannot always attain in its entirety the whole of the perception towards which it tends, but it always obtains some part of it, and attains new perceptions. Monadology 15.&lt;/font&gt;

Leibniz thought animals had souls but not minds:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;But ''true'' reasoning depends on necessary or eternal truths like those of logic, numbers, and geometry, which make indubitable connections between ideas, and conclusions which are inevitable. Animals in which such conclusions are never perceived are called ''brutes''; but those which recognise such necessary truths are what are rightly called ''rational animals'' and their souls are called ''minds''. (Principles of Nature and Grace (5) 1714).&lt;/font&gt;

Minds allow reflection and awareness:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;And it is by the knowledge of necessary truths, and by the abstractions they involve, that we are raised to ''acts of reflection'', which make us aware of what we call ''myself'', and make us think of this or that thing as in ''ourselves''. And in this way, by thinking of ourselves, we think of being, of substance, of simples and composites, of the immaterial - and, by realising that what is limited in us is limitless in him, of God himself. And so these ''acts of reflection'' provide the principle objects of our reasonings.&quot; Monadology, 30.&lt;/font&gt;

==George Berkeley (1685 - 1753) ==
A Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowledge. 1710

http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/berkeley.html#treatise

[[Image:George_Berkeley_by_John_Smibert.jpg|thumb|left|Berkeley]]Berkeley introduces the Principles of Human Knowledge with a diatribe against abstract ideas. He uses the abstract ideas of animals as an example:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 9........The constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By body is meant body without any particular shape or figure, there being no one shape or figure common to all animals, without covering, either of hair, or feathers, or scales, &amp;c., nor yet naked: hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals, and for that reason left out of the abstract idea. Upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walking, nor flying, nor creeping; it is nevertheless a motion, but what that motion is it is not easy to conceive. &lt;/font&gt;

He then declares that such abstractions cannot be imagined. He emphasises that ideas are &quot;represented to myself&quot; and have shape and colour:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 10. Whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas, they best can tell: for myself, I find indeed I have a faculty of imagining, or representing to myself, the ideas of those particular things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing them. I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse. I can consider the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or separated from the rest of the body. But then whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some particular shape and colour. Likewise the idea of man that I frame to myself must be either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and which is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear; and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This concept of ideas as extended things, or representations,  is typical of the usage amongst philosophers in the 17th and 18th century and can cause confusion in modern readers. Berkeley considers that words that are used to describe classes of things in the abstract can only be conceived as particular cases:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 15... Thus, when I demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles, it is to be supposed that I have in view the universal idea of a triangle; which ought not to be understood as if I could frame an idea of a triangle which was neither equilateral, nor scalenon, nor equicrural; but only that the particular triangle I consider, whether of this or that sort it matters not, doth equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever, and is in that sense universal. All which seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it.&lt;/font&gt; 

Intriguingly, he considers that language is used to directly excite emotions as well as to communicate ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Introduction. 20. ... I entreat the reader to reflect with himself, and see if it doth not often happen, either in hearing or reading a discourse, that the passions of fear, love, hatred, admiration, disdain, and the like, arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words, without any ideas coming between.&lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley considers that extension is a quality of mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;11. Again, great and small, swift and slow, are allowed to exist nowhere without the mind, being entirely relative, and changing as the frame or position of the organs of sense varies. The extension therefore which exists without the mind is neither great nor small, the motion neither swift nor slow, that is, they are nothing at all. But, say you, they are extension in general, and motion in general: thus we see how much the tenet of extended movable substances existing without the mind depends on the strange doctrine of abstract ideas.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He notes that the rate at which things pass may be related to the mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;14..... Is it not as reasonable to say that motion is not without the mind, since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter, the motion, it is acknowledged, shall appear slower without any alteration in any external object? &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley raises the issue of whether objects exist without being perceived. He bases his argument on the concept of perception being the perceiving of &quot;our own ideas or sensations&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;4. It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects, have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding. But, with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertained in the world, yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may, if I mistake not, perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction. For, what are the fore-mentioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He further explains this concept in terms of some Eternal Spirit allowing continued existence. Berkeley is clear that the contents of the mind have &quot;colour, figure, motion, smell, taste etc.&quot;:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;7. From what has been said it follows there is not any other Substance than Spirit, or that which perceives. But, for the fuller proof of this point, let it be considered the sensible qualities are colour, figure, motion, smell, taste, etc., i.e. the ideas perceived by sense. Now, for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a manifest contradiction, for to have an idea is all one as to perceive; that therefore wherein colour, figure, and the like qualities exist must perceive them; hence it is clear there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He elaborates the concept that there is no unthinking substance or substratum for ideas and all is mind:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;18. But, though it were possible that solid, figured, movable substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this? Either we must know it by sense or by reason. As for our senses, by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations, ideas, or those things that are immediately perceived by sense, call them what you will: but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are perceived. This the materialists themselves acknowledge. It remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things, it must be by reason, inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense. But what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since the very patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas? I say it is granted on all hands (and what happens in dreams, phrensies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now, though there were no bodies existing without resembling them. Hence, it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas; since it is granted they are produced sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same order, we see them in at present, without their concurrence. &quot;&lt;/font&gt;

and stresses that there is no apparent connection between mind and the proposed material substrate of ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;19. But, though we might possibly have all our sensations without them, yet perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production, by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise; and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds. But neither can this be said; for, though we give the materialists their external bodies, they by their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are produced; since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit, or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind.   ..... &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley makes a crucial observation, that had also been noticed by Descartes, that ideas are passive:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;25. All our ideas, sensations, notions, or the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be distinguished, are visibly inactive- there is nothing of power or agency included in them. So that one idea or object of thought cannot produce or make any alteration in another. To be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived: but whoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles, must certainly be false. &lt;/font&gt;

He considers that &quot;the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active substance or Spirit (26)&quot;.

He summarises the concept of an Eternal Spirit that governs real things and a representational mind that copies the form of the world as follows:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;33. The ideas imprinted on the Senses by the Author of nature are called real things; and those excited in the imagination being less regular, vivid, and constant, are more properly termed ideas, or images of things, which they copy and represent. But then our sensations, be they never so vivid and distinct, are nevertheless ideas, that is, they exist in the mind, or are perceived by it, as truly as the ideas of its own framing. The ideas of Sense are allowed to have more reality in them, that is, to be more strong, orderly, and coherent than the creatures of the mind; but this is no argument that they exist without the mind. They are also less dependent on the spirit, or thinking substance which perceives them, in that they are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit; yet still they are ideas, and certainly no idea, whether faint or strong, can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it. &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley considers that the concept of distance is a concept in the mind and also that dreams can be compared directly with sensations:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;42. Thirdly, it will be objected that we see things actually without or at distance from us, and which consequently do not exist in the mind; it being absurd that those things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts. In answer to this, I desire it may be considered that in a dream we do oft perceive things as existing at a great distance off, and yet for all that, those things are acknowledged to have their existence only in the mind.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He considers that ideas can be extended without the mind being extended:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;49. Fifthly, it may perhaps be objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind, it follows that the mind is extended and figured; since extension is a mode or attribute which (to speak with the schools) is predicated of the subject in which it exists. I answer, those qualities are in the mind only as they are perceived by it- that is, not by way of mode or attribute, but only by way of idea; and it no more follows the soul or mind is extended, because extension exists in it alone, than it does that it is red or blue, because those colours are on all hands acknowledged to exist in it, and nowhere else. As to what philosophers say of subject and mode, that seems very groundless and unintelligible. For instance, in this proposition &quot;a die is hard, extended, and square,&quot; they will have it that the word die denotes a subject or substance, distinct from the hardness, extension, and figure which are predicated of it, and in which they exist. This I cannot comprehend: to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents. And, to say a die is hard, extended, and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and supporting them, but only an explication of the meaning of the word die. &lt;/font&gt;

Berkeley proposes that time is related to the succession of ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;98. For my own part, whenever I attempt to frame a simple idea of time, abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind, which flows uniformly and is participated by all beings, I am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties. I have no notion of it at all, only I hear others say it is infinitely divisible, and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain odd thoughts of my existence; since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking, either that he passes away innumerable ages without a thought, or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life, both which seem equally absurd. Time therefore being nothing, abstracted from the succession of ideas in our minds, it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind. Hence, it is a plain consequence that the soul always thinks; and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts, or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation, will, I believe, find it no easy task. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;99. So likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities, and consider them by themselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run into great extravagances. All which depend on a twofold abstraction; first, it is supposed that extension, for example, may be abstracted from all other sensible qualities; and secondly, that the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived. But, whoever shall reflect, and take care to understand what he says, will, if I mistake not, acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike sensations and alike real; that where the extension is, there is the colour, too, i.e., in his mind, and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind; and that the objects of sense are nothing but those sensations combined, blended, or (if one may so speak) concreted together; none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived.&quot; &lt;/font&gt;

He regards &quot;spirit&quot; as something separate from ideas and attempts to answer the charge that as spirit is not an idea it cannot be known:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;139. But it will be objected that, if there is no idea signified by the terms soul, spirit, and substance, they are wholly insignificant, or have no meaning in them. I answer, those words do mean or signify a real thing, which is neither an idea nor like an idea, but that which perceives ideas, and wills, and reasons about them. ....&lt;/font&gt;

==Thomas Reid (1710-1796)==

[[Image:ThomasReid.jpg|thumb|left|Reid]]Thomas Reid is generally regarded as the founder of Direct Realism. Reid was a Presbyterian minister for the living of Newmachar near Aberdeen from 1737.  He is explicit about the 'directness' of his realism:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;It is therefore acknowledged by this philosopher to be a natural instinct or prepossession, a universal and primary opinion of all men, a primary instinct of nature, that the objects which we immediately perceive by our senses are not images in our minds, but external objects, and that their existence is independent of us and our perception. (Thomas Reid Essays, 14)&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In common with Descartes and Malebranche, Reid considers that the mind itself is an unextended thing:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;.. I take it for granted, upon the testimony of common sense, that my mind is a substance-that is, a permanent subject of thought; and my reason convinces me that it is an unextended and invisible substance; and hence I infer that there cannot be in it anything that resembles extension (Inquiry)&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;

Reid is also anxious to equate the unextended mind with the soul:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The soul, without being present to the images of the things perceived, could not possibly perceive them. A living substance can only there perceive, where it is present, either to the things themselves, (as the omnipresent God is to the whole universe,) or to the images of things, as the soul is in its proper sensorium.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Reid's Direct Realism is therefore the idea that the physical objects in the world are in some way presented directly to a soul. This approach is known as &quot;Natural Dualism&quot;.

Reid's views show his knowledge of Aristotle's ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;When we perceive an object by our senses, there is, first, some impression made by the object upon the organ of sense, either immediately, or by means of some medium. By this, an impression is made upon the brain, in consequence of which we feel some sensation. &quot; (Reid 1785)&lt;/font&gt;

He differs from Aristotle because he believes that the content of phenomenal consciousness is things in themselves, not signals derived from things in the brain.  However, he has no idea how such a phenomenon could occur:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;How a sensation should instantly make us conceive and believe the existence of an external thing altogether unlike it, I do not pretend to know; and when I say that the one suggests the other, I mean not to explain the manner of their connection, but to express a fact, which everyone may be conscious of namely, that, by a law of our nature, such a conception and belief constantly and immediately follow the sensation.&quot; (Reid 1764).&lt;/font&gt;

Reid's idea of mind is almost impossible to illustrate because it lacks sufficient physical definition.  It is like naive realism but without any communication by light between object and observer.  Reid was largely ignored until the rise of modern Direct Realism.

[[Image:constudreid.gif]]

Reading between the lines, it seems that Reid is voicing the ancient intuition that the observer and the content of an observation are directly connected in some way. As will be seen later, this intuition cannot distinguish between a direct connection with the world itself and a direct connection with signals from the world beyond the body that are formed into a virtual reality in the brain.

Watering chickens is not a hard thing to do.  It is said that 20 chickens drink about as much as a cow.    Since chickens are small creatures you don't need a lot of water to keep them going.  However, you do need to give them water several times a day when it is hot.  Since watering chicks is covered in the chicks section this section will cover adult chickens.

To hold the chickens water there are a variety of devices you can use.  Anything that can hold water will do.  Halves of tires, tip-over pails, tubs, etc.  A limiting factor is that it needs to be small enough for chickens to drink out of.  A tip-over pail is a small pail that you fill with water.  When you take it into your pen you tip it over and the chickens drink out of that.

For other devices all you have to do is fill them with water.  Every once in a while you should dump out the water (if it is dirty) and rinse and refill.  Chickens will often walk in their water and also kick stuff into it.  So to keep your chickens healthy it is a good idea to keep their water clean.

For a small collection of chickens, a dog bowl can work nicely — and it is easy to clean.  You can also buy electric dog bowls for the winter, which some of the contributers to this book have had a lot of success with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Raising Chickens}}

== Basics of Caring for Baby Chickens ==

Hatcheries usually supply baby chickens in two varieties, the 'just
hatched' sort and the 'grown up' sort. 

== Just Hatched Chicks ==

They need:
# Warmth
# Drink
# Food
# Comfort



'''1.''' If they are cold, baby chickens might freeze to death. We don't want that, so we need to keep them warm. Start with 95 degrees in the first week, and then decrease the temperature by 5 degrees every week after until 6 weeks. A good way to provide said warmth is to buy a special 'Hen' lamp. It's a very big light bulb that produces much heat, as well as light. Make sure they don't have a cold floor where they will sleep. Some cardboard will do fine for insulation, but make sure the surface isn't slippery, if it should; it can lead to spraddled feet where the bones are bent to the side making the chick unable to walk.
'''2.''' It's pretty much obvious, but baby chickens need to drink. Under no circumstances give them un-boiled water. Their immune systems might not handle the germs just yet. Grain coffee (coffee made from oats or sum mat, as opposed to coffee made from coffee beans) is quite suitable for them. Make sure it's not hot. A good way to serve drink is to pour it into a jug, put a dish on top of the jug upside down, then flip the whole thing, so that the jug is upside down, standing on the dish. It should leak just enough coffee onto the dish so that the baby chickens can have a drink, and leak more when they have drunk some.

'''3.''' Baby chickens won't eat just any old thing. Milled oats are a good thing to feed them, at least initially. Hard boiled eggs (cut up into appropriate bite sized pieces, of course) go with the milled oats quite well. You may want to ask around in agriculture stores about special feed for baby chickens. They can eat some bread, but if they eat too much, it will kill them. It's good to add cut-up lettuce to the baby chickens' diet. If you're not squeamish, they love small, flightless invertebrates, and go crazy for worms.

'''4.''' Chickens are flock birds, sure, but even they don't like to be cramped. Cannibalism and trampling may ensue if they don't have enough space. Baby chickens grow quickly, so make sure you have room for them. Scatter some hay under the big light bulb so they have something to scratch in. Remember to replace the cardboard once it becomes saturated with poop, no one likes to sleep in feces.
Grown Up But Still Baby Chicks
They're bigger and usually have feathers already.


They need:
# Drink
# Food
# Warmth
# Comfort


'''1.''' Now that they're grown up a bit, they can drink just about any water. But I'd recommend boiling it, nevertheless. Forget the trick with the jug, the chickens will tip them over frequently; use a pot or something of that kind. Also they can’t be covered up they will be scared. And when they cheap, they need company and calm them down.

'''2.''' Remember those special foods for baby chickens? It's a kind of meal, only with vitamins, minerals and what not. It's good for them. Mashed potatoes mixed with that meal, are better. And the chickens like it VERY much. Cut-up lettuce, cabbage, grass is fine at this point. Insects are always welcome and they can eat big bugs.

'''3.''' With feathers, warmth is less of a concern than before, but tries to keep the temperature steady at about 20 degrees Celsius.

'''4.''' Basically the same tips as before. Make sure they have room to romp, a place to sleep, and that they have a reasonably clean environment. Oh, and you need to provide them a sandbox of sorts in which they can dust bathe.

'''Io Facts''':
* Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System.
* Io is one of the few moons to have an atmosphere although it is very thin.
* At any given time, there are approximately 9 volcanoes erupting on Io.
* Io is so close to Jupiter that Jupiter causes &quot;tides&quot; in its surface. These &quot;tides&quot; are what makes it so volcanically active. 
* Io is one of only five of Jupiter's moons that can eclipse the Sun as seen from Jupiter.
* Io is the fourth-largest moon in the solar system.
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:Io_(Jupiter_moon)_PIA02308.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A picture of Io taken by Galileo space probe in 1999]]
Io is the innermost moon to Jupiter.  Be careful not to confuse Io the moon with 85 Io, an asteroid, or with I.O., an abbreviation that can stand for a number of different things.
== How big is Io? ==

Jupiter has 66 moons, but only four are large ones comparable to our Moon.  Io is one of these four, and the third largest. Io is 3642.6 km, or 0.28 Earths, wide. It only has a mass of about 1.4% of the mass of Earth. It is a similar size to our Moon (but a lot more exciting!).

== What is its surface like? ==

Unlike most moons, Io has a &quot;young&quot; surface. Because there is so much volcanic activity, the surface is almost free of craters. Also, its volcanoes are quite unusual. Because of the low gravity of Io and the explosiveness of the volcanoes, sometimes they eject material as far as 500 km above the ground. 500 km is more than the distance from ground level on Earth to the International Space Station. Sometimes the volcanoes erupt more calmly, more like geysers on Earth.  There are also ''shield volcanoes'' on Io, formed mostly from lava flows.

The temperature of Io varies wildly. At some spots, near volcanic eruptions, the temperature is very hot. But most of Io is very cold, as it is so far away from the sun. The average temperature of Io is -143°C. This is much colder than −90°C, the coldest it gets in Antarctica.

[[Image:Io_from_Galileo_and_Voyager_missions.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A map of Io surface]]

In addition to volcanoes, Io also has many mountains, lakes of molten sulfur, '''calderas''', and flows of molten sulfur or silicate hundreds of kilometers long. The colour of the surface is due to sulfur being at different temperatures. When sulfur warms up and cools down, it changes colour. This is why the surface of Io has so many colours. Some people think it looks like a pizza!

Io has 10 named regions (regions on the Earth would be the Middle East, the Far East, the West, etc) which all end in the word ''Regio'', which means in Latin ''Region''. All of the regions are named after ancient kingdoms and empires of Earth, similarly to how most planets and stars are named after gods and other characters from mythology. For example, the largest regio, ''Colchis Regio'' correlates to Colchis Kingdom in 550-164 BC. 

Io's volcanic features are all based on various beings in mythologies other than Greek mythology and Roman mythology. For example, Masubi is a volcano, but in Japanese mythology, he is the deity of fire who is said to have caused 8 volcanoes on earth. Another example would be another volcano named Ra. Ra in Egyptian mythology was the god of the sun. 

Io's mountains are a mix of many mythologies, in the aspects of their names. They all end in several Latin words vaguely meaning mountain. Danube Planum is based on the Danube river, which runs from southwest Germany to the Black Sea, while Egypt Mons is based on Egypt. On the other hand, there are mountains such as ''Epaphus Mensa'', named after Epaphus, son of Io and Zeus; and ''Ot Mons'' &amp;mdash; in Mongolian mythology, Ot Ene (the final &quot;e&quot; is pronounced) is the goddess of marriage, who was born at the beginning of the world, when the sky and the earth separated.

[[Image:PIA02879 - A New Year for Jupiter and Io.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of Io taken by the Cassini space probe with Jupiter in the background]]

It takes 42 hours (1¾ Earth days) for Io to rotate on its axis. It also takes 42 hours for Io to complete one orbit around Jupiter. Since these numbers are the same, it means that the same side of Io always faces Jupiter. (Earth's moon is the same way, which is why you can always see the Man in the Moon.)

== Who is it named after? ==
Io (Ancient Greek ''Ἰώ'') &amp;mdash; pronounced ''eye''-oh &amp;mdash; is named after one of Zeus' (Jupiter's) 1000 lovers. She was a nymph. Nymphs are spirits of nature, associated with water, forests, and grottoes. According to the legend, Io was transformed into a cow by Zeus in order to hide her.

==How would Io's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds (45kg) on Earth would weigh about 18 pounds (8kg) on Io.

== How was it discovered? ==
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|130x100px|framed|left|Galileo, the first discoverer of the Galilean moons in 1610.]]

Io was discovered by both Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. Galileo discovered it on January 7, 1610, and Marius discovered it around the same time.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Ganymede Facts''':
* Ganymede is the only moon of Jupiter discovered by Galileo to be named after a male person.
* Ganymede, the Solar System's largest moon, is larger than either Mercury or Pluto.
* Ganymede is the only moon to have a '''magnetic field'''.
* Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
&lt;/div&gt;

== How big is Ganymede? ==
Ganymede is 5262.4 km, or 0.413 Earths wide, making it a little larger than the Earth's moon. It is the largest of Jupiter's moons &amp;mdash; in fact it is the largest moon in the solar system.

[[File:Ganymed Earth Moon Comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison in size between Earth, the Moon and Ganymede]]

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Ganymede is divided into two regions: dark regions, and light regions. The dark regions are very old and highly cratered, while the light regions are younger (but still quite old), and marked by grooves and ridges. However, craters are found on both types of terrain, and are around 3 to 3&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; billion years old.  

Ganymede's crust is made of water ice. Like Earth's crust, it is broken up into plates, which can move. Along the fracture zones, mountain ranges have formed. Because the crust can flow, craters tend to be flat. Sometimes, old craters become '''palimpsests''' because of erosion casued by the crust.

Recently, the '''Hubble Space Telescope''' found evidence of an oxygen atmosphere on Ganymede. This does not mean that there is life on Ganymede; it is believed that the oxygen is produced when '''radiation''' splits the water ice (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is lost because it has a low '''mass''', while the oxygen forms the atmosphere.

== How long is a day on Ganymede? ==
One day on Ganymede is equal to about 7.15 days on Earth.

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==
It takes Ganymede 7.15 days to orbit Jupiter. Ganymede orbits Jupiter at the same speed that it spins.

== Who is it named after? ==
Ganymede (Greek ''Γανυμήδης'') is named after a handsome Trojan boy who was made cupbearer to the gods by Jupiter (also known as Zeus).

== How was it discovered? ==
Ganymede was discovered by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius. Galileo found it on January 11, 1610, and Marius around the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Callisto.jpg|thumb|right|Callisto from the Galileo space craft]]
== How big is Callisto? ==
It is Jupiter's second largest moon, after [[../Ganymede|Ganymede]], and the third largest moon in the solar system.  It is a little more than one third the size of the earth. 

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Callisto is one of the most cratered in the Solar System. In fact, impact craters are the only features found on the surface. Because Callisto's surface is icy, large craters and mountains are slowly erased. Callisto's crust is about 4 billion years old, dating back to the formation of the Solar System.

The largest crater on the surface is Valhalla. It measures 3000 km across. The second largest crater, Asgard, measures 1600 km across. Gipul Catena, a series of craters in a straight line, was probably caused by an object that was tidally disrupted as it passed close to Jupiter.

There is no oxygen in the atmosphere. Under the rocky crust of the surface there is a salty underground sea.  

== How long is a day on Callisto? ==
One day on Callisto is equal to approximately 16.7 days on Earth.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Callisto Facts''':
* Callisto's crust dates back to the formation of the Solar System.
* A salty ocean may lay beneath the crust.
* It is the second largest of Jupiter's moons.
&lt;/div&gt;

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==
One orbit around Jupiter is also equal to 16.7 days on Earth.

== Who is it named after? ==
Callisto (Greek ''Καλλιστώ'') is named after the Greek Mythological nymph named Kallisto, which meant &quot;most beautiful&quot; in Greek. Kallisto was one of Zeus' many lovers.

== How was it discovered? ==
Callisto was discovered by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius. Galileo discovered it on January 7, 1610, and Marius observed it around the same time.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;  border:2px solid #aaaaaa; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em&quot;&gt;
'''Amalthea Facts''':
* Amalthea is the reddest object in the Solar System, even redder than Mars.
* Before 1975, Amalthea was not considered the official name (though it had extensive informal use) of the moon. Prior to the current name, it was called Jupiter V.
&lt;/div&gt;
[[File:Comparison of Amalthea to Io.jpg|300x300px|framed|right|A comparison between Io (Larger) and Amalthea (Smaller).]]
Amalthea is the third moon of Jupiter. Amalthea's oribt is very close to the Amalthea gossamer ring.

== How big is Amalthea? ==
Amalthea is not spherical like a ball, instead it looks like an asteroid. In fact, there is an asteroid in the asteroid belt named ''113 Amalthea''. However, the asteroid is completely unrelated to the moon. This moon of Jupiter has an average diameter of 172 km. The entire moon is actually a bit smaller than Ireland.

== What is its surface like? ==
The surface of Amalthea is bright crimson. The reddish colour may be from sulfur or some other non-ice material. Amalthea has multiple craters, but only two are named: Pan, named after the Greek god of the wild; and Gaia, goddess of the Earth. Amalthea also has two named mountains, both named after places in Crete, the largest island of Greece:  Lyctos Facula, named after Lyctos; and Ida Facula, named after Mount Ida. ''Facula'', in Latin, means a small torch.

== How long is a day on Amalthea? ==
One day on Amalthea is equal to about half of an Earth day. One day is 11 hours, 57 minutes, and 23 seconds, barely more time than Jupiter takes to rotate.

== How long is its orbit around Jupiter? ==

One orbit around Jupiter also takes the same time as a day on Amalthea &amp;mdash; about half of an Earth day.  Since these two times are the same, the same side of Amalthea always faces Jupiter. Earth's moon is the same way, which is why you can always see the Man in the Moon.

==How would Amalthea's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on the surface of Amalthea, you would weigh only 1/555 of what you do on Earth. A one hundred pound person would weigh only 0.18 pounds on Amalthea, which is a little more than ten 50p, or 14 quarters!  
This means that if you could lift ten kilograms on earth, you could hold three cars on Amalthea. The strongest weightlifter would be able to lift a blue whale, the heaviest animal on Earth.

== Who is it named after? ==
Amalthea (Greek ''Ἀμάλθεια'') is named after a nymph in Greek myths who nursed Zeus, which is the Greek counterpart of the god Jupiter, with goat's milk.

== How was it discovered? ==
[[File:EdwardEmersonBarnard.jpg|100x140px|framed|left|Edward Emerson Barnard, the discoverer of Amalthea.]]
Amalthea was discovered on September 22, 1892 by Edward Emerson Barnard, using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory, in California. He was the first to discover a new moon of Jupiter since Galileo discovered Io and Europa in 1610.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Raising Chickens}}

Feeding chickens is almost as easy as watering them.  In nature chickens are the garbage cleaners of the south east Asian jungle.  For everyday food you can feed your chickens either chicken food (found at feed stores) or pig food.  In Alberta the UFA Hog Grower is the same as the chick starter except the pellets are bigger, and the hog grower contains less antibiotics.  If you have access to grain then you can feed that to them.  Whenever you make food with lots of scraps (peelings and bits of vegetables that humans shouldn't eat) then feed those to them.  Chickens can be trained so well if they see a small bucket (for carrying chicken scraps) they get excited because a treat is coming.  You can feed your chickens in a trough, appropriate sized container, or by scattering the food on the ground.  You can even give your chickens bones with scraps of meat on them.  There is very little that they won't eat.  

== Information Specific to Laying Hens ==
Laying hens require calcium for egg shells. During the laying season, put a pile or box of crushed clam shells in their pen. Crushed clam shells are available at most local feed/farm stores. If you scatter the clam shells too much, you won't know when the hens need more until you see paper-thin shells. Egg shells also work for the calcium, but you run the risk of the birds learning to eat their own eggs.  To avoid this you should crush the shells so that they don't look like eggs.

! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Common food that chickens shouldn't/won't eat
|-
|'''Food'''
|'''Reason'''
|-
|Orange peels
|Too tough for chickens to chew on.  Chickens will play with them if they are bored, though. The orange itself chickens will eat.
|-
|Watermelon rinds
|Too thick/tough for chickens to chew on but they do love the actual fruit part.
|-I've seen chickens eat watermelon rind right down to the green part. They love it. Besides chickens don't chew. They swallow whole. That's the reason for the craw and gizzard. Watermelon hold a lot of water that chickens don't want too much of.
|-
|Rye kernels
|Chickens don't like them.  Some chickens do enjoy Rye, just a little.
|-
|Chicken
|Because they ''are'' chickens.  Although chickens will happily eat chicken and other meat products.  After [[Raising_Chickens/Death/Butchering|butchering]] a chicken you can leave the skeleton in the the pen and they will pick the bones clean.  If done on a large scale, making chicken feed from chickens (especially the brain and spinal cord) can lead to an outbreak of [[w:Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|encephalopathy]], similar to mad cow disease.
|-
|Carrots
|Chickens can't eat large hard chunks but they will eat carrot peels.
|-
|Curry
|They like it, but it has bad effects on their droppings.
|-
|Banana
|Some chickens like bananas while other do not. It really depends on the breed. &lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Raising Chickens/Feeding#Bananas|Disputed]]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Potato Peel
|Chickens normally don't like very many root plants, so they will not usually eat potato peels but they do like leftover mashed potato.
|-
|Tomato
|Not a problem in small quantities. In excess reduces the droppings.
|-
|Apple  
|It is fine to give one apple to four birds once every two weeks if given too regular it may give them a stomach upset.  They absolutely love the peel too. 
|-
|Baked beans
|They just don't like them- also disputed
|-
|Grapes
|Chickens really seem to love grapes - not mine! They didn´t notice nice white organic grapes for 2 days
|-
|Gooseberries
|A similar reaction to that of grapes.
|-
|Rice
|Chickens love rice
|-
|Pasta
|Same with rice, they especially love spaghetti (reminds them of worms).  Cut it down in size though.
|-
|Fish skin
|They love fish and skin, has a lot of calcium for layers.
|-
|Mice
|Dead or alive they will fight over them and chase them.
|-
|Ham
|Chickens love ham
|}
Lettuce, cauliflower and cabbage leaves
Feel free to add items that you have found chickens shouldn't or won't eat though just like people they are individuals and all have their own likes and dislikes so it cannot be justly said that they WILL or WILL NOT eat a certain food. 

Cheese: 
My chickens go mad for cheese. It is very fatty however and should not be given in abundance. 

And finally, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER feed chickens (or any other bird) avocado. 
Avocados (their peelings, the fruit itself, and the seeds) are POISONOUS TO BIRDS.</text>

== My chickens love this! ==
Post food that your chickens love here
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 22:35, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

Laying hens require calcium for egg shells.  During the laying season, put a pile or box of crushed clam shells in their pen.  Crushed clam shells are available at most local feed/farm stores.  If you scatter the clam shells too much, you won't know when the hens need more until you see paper-thin shells.  Egg shells also work for the calcium, but you run the risk of the birds learning to eat their own eggs.

The only time I pen/cage my birds is when they hatch a clutch of chicks.  (Normally, they and all the other critters on the farm run around together.)  When they're penned or caged the thing they love most is greens.  I usually throw in bunches of grasses and garden weeds.  You might be able to get someone that doesn't spray their lawn to let you rake their clippings for your birds.

I am new to chicken raising - having inherited 6 chickens from the previous owner of the house. At present i am only giving them 'Crumble' and fresh water, but from reading here it sounds like they need more! if I give them 'greens' do i need to chop them up i.e. cabbage, green beans etc? Wha about califlower stalks? Potatoe skins?
Any advice would be appreciated! 
(lfnolan@attglobal.net)

We pull up full cabbage from the neighbouring fields and give them to our chickens and they love them. They will peck at and tear off chunks of leaf and peck at the roots and soil on the roots. They struggle with the solid heart and the stalk though. They will eat cabbage and greens cooked as well. As a general rule of thumb, if its hard and solid they can't cope with it very well, try cooking it and mashing or chopping it. If its reasonably soft or leafy they will shred it themselves. They are not stupid and they know what they like. If they don't eat what you give them stop giving them it. If something makes them feel ill they quickly learn to stop eating it. (so long as it isn't so poisonous it kills them outright, but I've not come across anything like that yet.)We even have laburnum trees and the seeds go everywhere and are poisonous, they just know not to eat them. So don't worry too much about what you are giving them, they'll let you know if they don't like it.

Oatmeal, dry or prepared. Corn. Sunflower seeds (cracked open). Old Cereal. Bread. Grapes (pinch in half or they cant get a grip to peck on) Watermelon rinds.

Our chickens love baked beans, but won't eat carrots or sweet potato, so we think they possibly don't usually like orange things, as they won't eat orange peel either. They also eat leftover toast, but it helps if you soak it first, otherwise they tend to leave little bits and then you can end up getting rats. They will eat pretty much anything, but we gave them curried lentils the other day, and it made their eggs taste of curry, so we won't be doing that again!

Our chicken love cooked oatmeal. Warm too.

&quot;''Because they are chickens. Although chickens will happily eat chicken and other meat products.

This does bring up an interesting point.  Chickens being scavangers will eat meat.  Is it safe for chickens to eat a diet a meat products including but not limited to poultry?  I havn't given my chickens much meat products other than what is in UFA Hog Growers.  My dogs end up with most of the meat producsts that people don't eat.  I have even started giving moldy buns to my dogs instead of chickens.  The chickens don't seem to care too much about the buns anymore.  My dogs love them, they are almost like Dog candy.  BTW if you are intersted in Buns for Dogs what I ended up doing was given them some old Costco buns that had gone moldy. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 21:36, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

Chickens naturally eat meat. They love nothing more than a good juicy worm, in fact I virtually get mugged now when I get the spade out of the shed as they know it means digging and worms. So I don't think meat in their diet is a problem. Our chickens get left overs from all our family and neighbours and they are pretty happy and healthy on it.
 
Do snails count as meat? Because they love them and the shell would probably supply calcium.

Chocolate can be fatal for birds.

[[User:Hajhouse]] adds:

* My chickens don't like rye kernels
* Aledgedly chickens can't digest raw potatoes

They seem to love potatoes! Prefer cooked to raw, as well as prefering them mashed to whole; easier for them to eat.[[User:82.38.78.129|82.38.78.129]] 13:55, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

DO NOT feed chickens or people GREEN potato peels!!!   Since potatoes are part of the nightshade family (like tomatoes, eggplant and deadly nightshade) if the peels get green from exposure to the sun they develop vastly increased levels of solanine which is toxic in very small quantities.  Solanin is the same poison that is concentrated in deadly nightshade &amp;  tomato leaves.  That's why you peel off the skin from greened potatoes, and it's better not to eat them at all!

The presentation of this information seems very muddled up, it starts up saying that Chickens shouldnt or cant eat something and gives a reason for it and yet in the same table shows things that they love to eat. This really needs ot be broken down into two separate tables with one only showing stuff they shouldnt eat with a justification against each item and the other showing stuff they do like to eat rather than including both in one table entitled stuff that shouldnt eat.




Gave them bananas and they didn't seem to care for them. I guess it was too mushy for them??

A lot of leafy greens like bok choi and lettuce they seem to ignore. Nothing the least bit spicy, salty or peppered. 
Tried giving them pill bugs as 'meat' along with snails. They rolled the pill bugs around and gave me the look. ''You want me to eat '''WHAT?'''''

==Disputes==
===Bananas===
According to the chart chickens don't like Bananas however, I have received a message saying
 I feed my baby chicks a ripe banana as a treat, and they love it! I have 18 chicks, and I give them one banana every day, 
 by hand. You can use this or not........The adults like it, too.
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:48, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

I will second this, my chickens actually fight over banana's and will eat skin and all.
My chickens enjoyed a ripe banana today, peel and all.


I will also second this, (or third it), my chickens love bananas. A tasty treat for them.

Cautionary Note: Aren't banana skins loaded with pesticide (except organic, one assumes)?

Our chickens go crazy for bananas.

I grind up corn stalks and sun flower plants they love it.
I read somewher to give them fish raw or cooked?

my chickens won't touch any citrus fruits, love cabbage raw and bacon rinds... they love meat but i refuse to give them any poultry products. i don't think it's healthy.

My chickens love watermelon! They eat everything but the outside skin, even the green part that we don't eat. They also love tomatoes.

We nursed a very sick chook back to health, one of the things she really enjoyed was mashed banana.



MY CHICKENS DO NOT EAT CELERY OR BROCCOLI

I also feed my chickens banana, they all love them!!!

While I didn't attempt the peel, mine go nutso over really ripe bananas.

My chickens love the vegetable mash mix i make for them, I juice fruits and vegtables for myself and the pieces that are on the ends like celery, spinish stems, parsley stems, very ripe banana, grapes that on a little too soft for me to want, they all go into the blender with some juice and then i add mash to this juice mixture to make it the consitency of crumble.  I use up scraps that are very healthy for them and they love the mix.[[User:Icre8arch|Icre8arch]] ([[User talk:Icre8arch|talk]]) 23:07, 20 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[File:Planets2013.jpg|180x200px|framed|left|The eight planets of the Solar System, and the sun. Sizes are to scale, but distances are not.]]
Do you ever wonder about the things in the sky&amp;mdash;the Sun, the Moon, the stars? People have been watching the sky for a long time, trying to figure out what is out there. We keep coming up with new ways to learn more about outer space.

&lt;!-- 1 What is the Solar System? --&gt;

''Planets'' are big balls of rock or gas that move around stars. We live on one we call the Earth, which moves around a star we call the Sun. There are at least seven other planets moving around the Sun and a lot of other smaller things as well. All these things together are called a ''system''. The Latin word for the Sun is ''Sol'', so we call this system the ''Solar System''. Far beyond our own Solar System are stars, bodies like the Sun but in some cases much bigger.


&lt;!-- 2 Who discovered the solar system? --&gt;
&lt;!-- 3 How have we explored the solar system? --&gt;
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun. Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars). This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?

About 500 years ago another man named Copernicus said the same thing as Aristarchus; that all the planets moved around the Sun and the stars were fixed in space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#q21&lt;/ref&gt; This time more people agreed but there were still people who thought the opposite. Then, about 100 years later, a man called Galileo began looking at the sky with a new invention: the telescope. He showed that it was very likely that all the planets moved around the Sun. This time even more people thought Galileo may be right and that the Earth really did move around the Sun. Soon, more and more people started using telescopes to study the sky. However there were still some people who thought Galileo was wrong and he was even arrested and taken to court for lying. All the people who believed him began to learn how the planets and the other things in the Solar System moved so they could prove that he was not lying. Thousands of years after Aristarchus, people finally said &quot;Okay, the Earth does move around the Sun&quot;. Galileo couldn't be called a liar anymore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;br&gt;See also {{cite book|last=Drake|first=Stillman (translator)|date=1957|publisher=Anchor, NY|title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo (1610 Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina)|isbn=0385092393}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 4 How was it formed? --&gt;
&lt;!-- 5 What will happen to the solar system? --&gt;
We can use very large telescopes to see what has happened to other stars. We can compare pictures of distant stars with pictures of our own star, the Sun. We live in exciting times because for the first time we have sent people into space and we also have telescopes in space. These telescopes in space take thousands of pictures of the planets, our sun and the distant stars. On Earth people use the photos to learn about all the different things in the Solar System and they try to explain how the Solar System began. We even have a robot on the red planet Mars that moves around and people on Earth tell it where to go and what to photograph. We also want to know what will happen to the Earth and the Solar System in the future. 

== What is in the Solar System? == 
[[Image:Solar sys.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Solar System, showing the Sun, inner planets, asteroid belt, outer planets, an outer dwarf planet, and a comet. (Not to scale!)]]
At the center of the Solar System is the Sun. It is a star, like the billions of other stars in the sky. The other stars are very, very far away, so they look tiny.  The Sun is important to us because it gives us heat and energy that allows life. None of the life on Earth could exist without the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/sun.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the things in the Solar System ''orbit'' (travel around) the Sun. The planets are the largest of these. Each planet is a little like the Earth. But the planets are also very different from each other.

Many of the planets have ''moons''. A moon orbits a planet. Mercury has no moons&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Mercury&amp;Display=Moons&lt;/ref&gt; and nor does Venus. Earth has one. Jupiter has 63!&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&amp;Display=Moons&lt;/ref&gt;

The planets closest to the Sun are called the ''inner planets''. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Then comes a big ring of ''asteroids'', chunks of rock much smaller than planets. This ring is called the ''asteroid belt''. Within the asteroid belt, there is a dwarf planet (smaller than a normal planet) named Ceres. Then come the ''outer planets'': Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Farther out there are two dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris. 

The planets have the names of Roman gods that were worshipped by people thousands of years ago though no one believes in them now. Did you know that some days of the week are also the names of ancient gods? Saturday means &quot;Saturn Day&quot;. Thursday means &quot;Thor Day&quot;. Thor was a Viking god, the son of Odin. Monday and Sunday simply mean &quot;Moon Day&quot; and &quot;Sun Day&quot;. Some of the months are also named after Roman gods. The month of &quot;March&quot; is named after the Roman god &quot;Mars&quot; - he was the god of War!

Beyond the orbit of Neptune is another big ring of things like the asteroids, called the ''Kuiper belt''. Kuiper (said &quot;KYE-per&quot;) was the last name of the person who first wrote about it. Most of the things in the Kuiper belt are hard to see through telescopes.

After the Kuiper belt comes the ''Oort cloud''. Scientists think this is where ''comets'' come from.  It is very far away, many times farther away than Pluto is from the Sun (over a thousand times). It is near the edge of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; (Yes, &quot;Oort&quot; was the last name of the person who first wrote about it.)

&lt;!--Copyedited to here, 6 December 2005--&gt;
[[File:Zodiacal Light Seen from Paranal.jpg|200x200px|framed|left|Zodiacal light.]]
In between all the other things is dust. The pieces of dust are very far apart, but they shine in the light of the Sun. Before dawn, in September or October, they glow in the East. We call this the ''zodiacal glow'', or ''zodiacal light''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020301.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When pieces of space dust hit the Earth's atmosphere, they burn brightly. We call them shooting stars or meteors.

The Sun creates ''solar wind''&amp;mdash;a kind of gas that blows away from the Sun into space. This gas travels out past the planets into outer space. The edge, where the solar wind meets the wind from other stars, is called the ''heliopause''.  That is about 100 times as far from us as the Earth is from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020624.html&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that is a lot of empty space. The nearest star to our Sun is thousands of times farther away than the size of the entire solar system. The Universe is a really huge and empty place!&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Outside Our Solar System&quot; in http://vathena.arc.nasa.gov/curric/space/spacover.html&lt;/ref&gt;

 

===What holds it together?===
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|200x220px|framed|left|Sir Isaac Newton, the discoverer of gravity. It is said that he came up with the concept of gravity when an apple fell on his head.]]
Why do all of the planets orbit the Sun? Why do moons orbit planets? Why doesn't the Sun move off and leave the planets behind? The answer to all of these questions has to do with ''gravity''. Gravity is a force that is a property of ''mass''. It pulls things together.  

We don't notice the pull from the Sun because it also pulls on the Earth by the same amount. But the Sun's gravity is strong enough to keep the Earth from shooting away. Even though the Earth is going fast, it keeps turning to go around the Sun. It is like they were tied together with an invisible string. In the same way, moons orbit many of the planets. They are kept there by gravity. The Sun itself does not sit still in space. The entire Solar System is orbiting the center of our galaxy. The whole thing stays together because of the force of gravity&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gravity is the force responsible for keeping the Earth and other planets in our solar system in orbit around the Sun.&quot; from Cosmic Glue, http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108b.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;!-- This is too advanced! -- Each of the planets' gravity pulls not only on the Sun, but also on the other planets and moons. (and everything else too!)  This makes the shape of the orbits of all the planets and moons change a little bit. As the planets and moons keep moving, the amount the orbits change, and what way they change, also keeps changing.  These changes are called ''orbital perturbations'' by scientists. Its a lot of change to figure out, but astronomers can do a very good job of predicting where a planet will be at any time. Astronomers use careful measurements and mathematics to predict orbits.--&gt;

====About mass====
Everything is made out of matter. The amount of matter is called mass. Two apples have twice the mass of one apple. The more mass a thing has, the more gravity pulls it and the more its gravity pulls other objects. We don't notice the pull from an apple because it is so much less than the pull from the Earth. If you stand on the ground and let go of an apple, gravity will pull it down towards the center of the Earth. It will hit the ground. If you could throw the apple hard enough at the right angle, it would go into orbit around the Earth. That is how rockets put astronauts into orbit. If you threw the apple really, REALLY hard in the right direction, it would fly away from Earth and never come back; but our arms are not that strong.

The force of gravity from anything is strongest when very close to that thing, and weaker when further from it.  Scientists use ''weight'' to mean how hard gravity pulls us. Astronauts weigh less on the moon because it has less mass. It does not pull as hard. We actually weigh a tiny bit less on top of a tall mountain than we do in a lower place. This is because we are farther from most of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions of Mass, Gravity, and Weight from http://ksnn.larc.nasa.gov/webtext.cfm?unit=float&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who discovered the Solar System?==
Anyone who looks up at the sky enough can see seven bright objects. These are the Sun, our Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. People have known about them for a very long time. Ancient people thought they were related to gods. In Babylon, they named the days of the week after them. Almost everyone was sure that all these things were orbiting the Earth. They did not know we lived in a '''Solar''' System. 

In about 1500, Nicholaus Copernicus figured out that the planets orbit the Sun. Only the Moon orbits the Earth. But he was afraid to say so for most of his life and only published a full account of his ideas in 1543, the year of his death&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#q21&lt;/ref&gt;. Then Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the sky. He found moons orbiting Jupiter. He was certain Copernicus was right, and he got in trouble for saying so. It took seventy years to convince scientists that the planets orbit the Sun&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;/ref&gt;.  Now, almost everyone on Earth understands that we live in a Solar System. &lt;!-- cut down word count &quot;found moons orbiting Jupiter&quot; instead of &quot;saw moons orbiting Jupiter for the first time--&gt;

==How have we explored the Solar System?==
&lt;!-- This section is more or less chronological --&gt;
[[Image:Voyager spacecraft.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Voyager 2 space craft.]]
[[Image:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An artist's impressions of Spirit.]]
&lt;!-- exploring with our eyes and with ancient celestial observatories --&gt;
&lt;!-- time of year is solar/stellar --&gt;
Before the telescope&lt;!--was invented (is a 3-syllable word)--&gt;, people explored the sky with their eyes.  They saw how the planets seemed to &quot;wander&quot; through the sky. They learned to predict where the Sun, the moon, and planets would be in the sky. They built some ''observatories'' -- places for watching the sky. ''Observe'' is a more scientific word for ''watch''. They observed the Sun and stars to tell the time of year. In China, they even knew when the moon would block the Sun&lt;ref&gt;Eclipse2001 museum http://museumeclipse.org/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  Most people thought that ''celestial bodies'' could cause war or peace on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raman|first=Varadaraja V.|title=Glimpses of Ancient Science and Scientists|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=073881363X|date=2000}}&lt;br /&gt;page 339 &quot;The Chaldeans ... were also the first to suspect... that the Sun, the moon, the planets and the constellation of stars, all affect human life and destiny.... These beliefs gradually spread .. to Egypt, China, Greece, India, and Rome, for example ... astrology is still very popular.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- exploration via telescope--&gt;
After telescopes were first made, in the early 17th century, people kept making them better. Astronomers saw that planets are not like stars.  They are worlds, like the Earth. They could see that some planets have moons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Ssolsys.htm#galileo&lt;/ref&gt; They began to think about what these worlds were like. At first, some thought that the other planets and moons had people or animals living on them. They thought about how it would be to live on these other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://vesuvius.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/mars.html;&lt;br /&gt; {{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|title=Mars and the Mind of Man|publisher=Harper and Row|date=1973|isbn=0060104430}};&lt;br /&gt; {{cite book|last=Verne|first=Jules|title=From the Earth to the Moon|isbn=1582871035|publisher=North Books|date=1995}};&lt;br /&gt; From the Earth to the Moon on Project Gutenberg -- http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/83;&lt;/ref&gt; Then they made telescopes better, and sent spacecraft into space, and found that there were no plants or animals on the Moon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/reference/mars/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; or on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-15-4.html (bottom of page)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- manned and unmanned spacecraft send back pictures, samples, and data --&gt;
&lt;!-- Getting more detailed as we approach the present --&gt; 
Now, we can explore by going to some of the other worlds.  Twelve Astronauts walked on the Moon about 35 years ago. They brought rocks and dirt back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/apollo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Spacecraft flew by Venus, Mars, and the outer planets.  The pictures they took showed us a lot of what we know about these worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solarviews.com/eng/sc_hist.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Robots landed on Mars in 1971, 1976, and 1997.  They took thousands of pictures of the planets.  Two robots, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, are working on Mars right now.  They send photos and movies back to Earth. They also check rocks to find out what the rocks are made of.&lt;ref&gt;http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, we have not found any life except on Earth.  Maybe tiny one-celled life once lived on Mars.  Maybe there is life under the ice on Jupiter's moon Europa.  New spacecraft are being planned to look for life on these worlds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/Why_We_12.html; http://www.infoplease.com/spot/astronomy1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==How was our Solar System formed?==
Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way ''galaxy''.  Galaxies are big mixes of dust, gas, stars, and other things.  Inside our Milky Way galaxy are clouds of dust and gas where stars are born. Our Solar System was created in this kind of cloud. A part of the cloud began to get smaller and less spread out.  It formed a big, spinning disk of gas and tiny pieces of dust. This disk was thickest at the middle.  The middle slowly collapsed until it became the Sun. We are still trying to learn how the planets were formed.  Most scientists think that they were formed from the left over gas and dust.

[[File:Protoplanetary disk.jpg|200x200px|framed|left|An artist's illlustration of how the Solar System began.]]
This is how it could have happened.  The rest of the disk continued to spin around the Sun. The tiny pieces of dust hit each other and some of them stuck together, next the bits of dust slowly collected to form grains, these in turn joined to form lumps the size of gravel, then pebbles, and then rocks.  The rocks crashed together into mountains.  The mountains crashed together to make bigger things.  These big things swept up most of the rest of the disk to form the planets, moons, and asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/science/origins.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun got hotter as it collapsed.  It began to glow.  The temperature at the center reached a million degrees.  The Sun started to make a lot of light and heat. This light and heat swept away most of the leftover dust and gas between the inner planets.  This light and heat are the sunlight we see and feel every day on Earth.  &lt;ref&gt;http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_2a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==What will happen to the Solar System?==
&lt;!-- There is some dispute about whether the Sun is big enough to form a planetary nebula  See http://www.noao.edu/jacoby/pn_gallery.html for discussion and refs --&gt;
&lt;!-- Planetary nebulae are not always spherical.  See http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1997/38/ 
As well as the photo in this section --&gt;

In another five billion years, the Sun will use up most of its hydrogen fuel. It will enter the final stages of its life. The middle of the Sun will shrink down and become even hotter. The outer layer of the Sun will grow much bigger than it is now. It will form a ''red giant''.

It will be so big that Mercury and Venus, probably Earth and maybe even Mars will be inside it. These planets will burn away. Which planets get destroyed will depend on how much mass the Sun has left.&lt;ref&gt;Which planets may get destroyed http://www.public.iastate.edu/~lwillson/FuturSun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A strong solar wind will blow some of the outer layers of gas away from the Sun. The Sun will have less mass. The Sun’s gravity will be less. All of the planets will move further away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Outline of Sun's death http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Lectures/vistas97.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EtaCarinae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The massive, rapidly-aging star ''Eta Carinae'' throws off a giant cloud of gas, forming a ''planetary nebula''.]]

After it has been a red giant for a while, the Sun will start to burn ''helium''. It will shrink down and will not be a red giant any more. It will use the helium up in about a billion years. Then it will become a red giant once again. More gas will blow away for a few hundred thousand years.

A ''planetary nebula''&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;A ''planetary'' nebula was named this because through the earliest telescopes, astronomers thought that they looked like planets.  The name stuck &amp;mdash; but they really have nothing to do with planets.&lt;/ref&gt; will form.  The nebula could last for a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of years.  It will glow in the light of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Planetary nebulae http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the center, the Sun might shrink into a tiny star called a '''white dwarf'''. That kind of star is about the size of Earth. It would take about 100 of these white dwarfs, stacked end to end, to be as wide as the Sun is today. The Sun will not have any more fuel to burn. It will have lots of heat left over and will keep getting cooler and dimmer. Then its light will go out in a hundred billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;Has information on white dwarf stars http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RelWWW/tests.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Raising Chickens}}

Keeping your chickens happy is very easy to do.  If you have a big enough pen then you will already have very happy chickens.  There are also many things to can do to keep them even happier.


== Build Roosts ==
[[Image:hen_roost.jpg|left|A photo of a hen sitting on a roost]]

WARNING: Roosts should only be built in [[Raising_Chickens/shelter|shelters]] that are large enough for you to stand in comfortably.

Building roosts is easy to do. All you need are some thin poles and wire. Wooden poles work best as they are most like what a chicken would find naturally. One method that works is the use of poplar trees as poles. If you are using poplar (or similar tree) then use young saplings. Trees that are around 5 years old are best.  When selection used trees that are about the thickness of a broom handle.  In the case of poplar don't worry if you are killing the tree.  Poplar Trees reproduce by sending up shoots from their roots as well as seed.  Even if you do end up killing a poplar tree in a couple of years more will grow to replace it.  When you have your poles, make sure that they are the right size to fit in your shelter. Adjust size as needed then use your wire to tie that together so that they form a ladder that covers the width of the shelter. Your roosts should be fairly tall and strong. From experience, some of our contributors have found that chickens prefer to sleep in their roosts

== Scatter food (for them to find) ==

To do this all you have to do is scatter your chickens' food around and let them follow their natural instincts.  In the jungle, where chickens originally came from, wild chickens spent their day looking around for things to eat. Scattering their food around their pen allows them to do this in a safe (no predators and guaranteed food) setting.

If you have hay down to keep the mud away try scattering some corn in the hay. This results in the chickens spreading the hay around while being entertained (IF you do not let them out).

== Give them scraps you normally wouldn't ==

This method requires that you give your chickens scraps that aren’t unhealthy for your chickens but they still won't eat. These are scraps that, for whatever reason, your chickens would rather (or can only) play with instead of eat. A good example is Orange peels. Chickens find it difficult to eat these because they are too tough. However, if your chickens are bored then giving these to them will give them something to play with. Orange peels won't cause harm to your chickens and as such are safe. For a complete list of foods that Chickens normally don't eat see [[Raising_Chickens/Feeding|Feeding]]. 

Also, if your chickens don't have the ability to free range for their nutritional needs, you must provide them with grit (ground stone) to aid them with digestion.  Birds lack the ability to chew their food so must crush it in the gizzard, a strong muscle that uses grit to break apart the grain they consume.

== Other methods ==
For a list of methods that have worked for other people (or to post your own) go to the [[Talk:Raising_Chickens/Keeping_your_chickens_happy|discussion page]] for this chapter.
Keep a small pail under your kitchen sink and add tasty bits to feed later to your chickens.  You can save carrots, bits of celery and lettuce, etc.  If you just throw them on the ground inside their pen, they will rush over to investigate and enjoy a treat that is more interesting than their regular chicken food, but make sure the food isn't rotten or spoiled.

Feed 1 tbs. white millet per bird as a treat.


My chickens LOVE  cottage cheese

Depending on the kinds of chickens you have, you may be able to get them to come near you and you can hold them and pet them as well. Some of them just run away from you when you try to get closer to them. I missed the kind that I had when I was in Luang-Prabang, Laos. Some of them are very sportive and you can let them fight a little for exercises. Please let them fight for fun only and make sure that it's not for gambling or for serious killing of one another !


Mine seem to like me cracking sunflower seeds and chucking them in the pineneedles to find.

== Hand raising chicks ==

Handling chicks is the best way have tame friendly adult chickens. Friendly chickens are much easier to  handle and care for than shy or unfriendly chickens, however if you are raising your chickens for meat (and not as pets or for egg production) having an up-close and personal relationship with your poultry may not be a good idea. Friendly chickens don't just run up to you when you have food; they will perch on your lap or shoulder and coo sweetly to you,because their always up for a snuggle ;D.

Take into account that breeds such as Rhode Island Reds seem to be the most playful, however they are high strung, sometimes aggressive and are never as friendly and cuddly as Buff Orpingtons or Wyandottes. Roosters and cockerels are naturally more aggressive than pullets and hens.

When they are very small you can scoop the chicks up and hold them in the palm of your hand, be sure to keep them warm and always be very gentle with chicks before their feathers grow in. Do not squeeze chicks. It's best to sit on the floor and hold the chick low so that if it walks off of your hand it will land softly.

As the chicks grow larger you can play with them much more, be gentle and patient. Chicks are capable of running very fast and can cram themselves into very small spaces; be sure to play with them where they cannot run under (or into) furniture or small openings or where other animals might trap them (even the friendliest house cat can be a serious threat to a small chick.) 

In general most chickens like exercise and stimulation so you can be creative, use a bell caged in a plastic ball or dangle parakeet toys for chicks and larger cockatoo and cat toys for fully grown chickens. One fun way to give treats to your chicks is to drill small holes in a plastic ball or egg (like the kind used for Easter candy) and put a little chick starter inside, as they grow older you can put corn, carrot peelings, clean crushed shell, or left overs from your meals inside just to keep things interesting. Some chickens get quite possessive of their favorite toys so if you have more than one chicken be sure to have plenty toys to go around.

If you have too many chicks to hold then usually a handwarmer under some small towels will provide enough warmth for the rest.

== Any coop needs roosts. ==

This silly page says the following
&quot;WARNING: Roosts should only be built in for shelters that are large enough for you to stand in comfortably.&quot;

That has to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Chickens instinctively want/need to roost. The height of the coop is irrelevant to that need.

== Your Hatchery ==
Add your hatchery here
[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 06:08, 3 Jul 2005 (UTC)

=== Alturnative ===
An alternative to finding a hatchery is to find already grown hens/roosters.  Many small growers are ready to give them away (free/barter/cheap) at the end of the laying season.  Obviously your selection is limited to what's available, but this method saves the expense and trouble of dealing with chicks.  Keep an eye on the local paper or bargain sheet.  You can also ask anyone with a flock if they'd be willing to part with a few birds.  Depending on the purpose of your flock, someone else's culls might be just the right birds for you.  Be careful that you pick up healthy birds.  

When you introduce new birds to your established flock, it won't take long for new and old birds to integrate and establish their &quot;pecking order.&quot;  Not to worry, it looks nasty at first but they quickly work it out.  If two of them insist on constantly fighting, they'll be so busy with each other that you can easily pick up and move one of the birds to another part of the pen.  If you're adding a grown rooster to a flock that already has one, I recommend avoiding a new one that's been the only or head honcho at his old place.  Pick the second or third in the pecking order if you have a choice so your current head rooster can get along with him.</text>

==Introduction==
Finding the area between two curves, usually given by two explicit functions, is often useful in calculus.

In general the rule for finding the area between two curves is

&lt;math&gt; A = A_{top} - A_{bottom} \ &lt;/math&gt; or

If f(x) is the upper function and g(x) is the lower function

&lt;math&gt; A = \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

This is true whether the functions are in the first quadrant or not.

== Area between two curves ==
Suppose we are given two functions ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(x)'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(x)'' and we want to find the area between them on the interval ''[a,b]''. Also assume that ''f(x)&amp;ge; g(x)'' for all ''x'' on the interval ''[a,b]''. Begin by partitioning the interval ''[a,b]'' into ''n'' equal subintervals each having a length of ''&amp;Delta;x=(b-a)/n''. Next choose any point in each subinterval, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*''. Now we can 'create' rectangles on each interval. At the point ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*'', the height of each rectangle is ''f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)'' and the width is ''&amp;Delta;x''. Thus the area of each rectangle is ''[f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)]&amp;Delta;x''. An ''approximation'' of the area, ''A'', between the two curves is 
:&lt;math&gt; A := \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(x_{i}^{*})-g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now we take the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity and get
:&lt;math&gt;A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(x_{i}^{*})-g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; 
which gives the exact area. Recalling the definition of the definite integral we notice that 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]\,dx&lt;/math&gt;. 
This formula of finding the area between two curves is sometimes known as applying integration with respect to the ''x''-axis since the rectangles used to approximate the area have their bases lying parallel to the ''x''-axis. It will be most useful when the two functions are of the form ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(x)'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(x)''. Sometimes however, one may find it simpler to integrate with respect to the ''y''-axis. This occurs when integrating with respect to the ''x''-axis would result in more than one integral to be evaluated. These functions take the form ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=f(y)'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=g(y)'' on the interval ''[c,d]''. Note that ''[c,d]'' are values of ''y''. The derivation of this case is completely identical. Similar to before, we will assume that ''f(y)&amp;ge; g(y)'' for all ''y'' on ''[c,d]''. Now, as before we can divide the interval into ''n'' subintervals and create rectangles to approximate the area between ''f(y)'' and ''g(y)''. It may be useful to picture each rectangle having their 'width', ''&amp;Delta;y'', parallel to the ''y''-axis and 'height', ''f(y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)-g(y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*)'' at the point ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;*'', parallel to the ''x''-axis. Following from the work above we may reason that an ''approximation'' of the area, ''A'', between the two curves is 
:&lt;math&gt; A := \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(y_{i}^{*})-g(y_{i}^{*})]\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;. 
As before, we take the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity to arrive at 
:&lt;math&gt;A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [f(y_{i}^{*})-g(y_{i}^{*})]\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;, 
which is nothing more than a definite integral, so
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_c^d[f(y)-g(y)]\,dy&lt;/math&gt;. 
Regardless of the form of the functions, we basically use the same formula.

=== Harmonic Mean ===
The arithmetic mean cannot be used when we want to average quantities such as speed.

Consider the example below:

'''Example 1:''' The distance from my house to town is 40 km. I drove to town at a speed of 40 km per hour and returned home at a speed of 80 km per hour. What was my average speed for the whole trip?.

'''Solution:''' If we just took the arithmetic mean of the two speeds I drove at, we would get 60 km per hour. This isn't the correct average speed, however: it ignores the fact that I drove at 40 km per hour for twice as long as I drove at 80 km per hour. To find the correct average speed, we must instead calcuate the harmonic mean.

For two quantities A and B, the harmonic mean is given by: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be simplified by adding in the denominator and multiplying by the reciprocal:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B}} = \frac{2}{\frac{B + A}{AB}} = \frac{2AB}{A + B}&lt;/math&gt;

For N quantities: A, B, C......

Harmonic mean = &lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{\frac{1}{A} + \frac{1}{B} + \frac{1}{C} + \ldots}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us try out the formula above on our example:

Harmonic mean = &lt;math&gt;\frac{2AB}{A + B}&lt;/math&gt;

Our values are A = 40, B = 80. Therefore, harmonic mean &lt;math&gt;= \frac{2 \times 40 \times 80}{40 + 80}= \frac{6400}{120} \approx 53.333&lt;/math&gt;

Is this result correct? We can verify it. In the example above, the distance between the two towns is 40 km.  So the trip from A to B at a speed of 40 km will take 1 hour. The trip from B to A at a speed to 80 km will take 0.5 hours. The total time taken for the round distance (80 km) will be 1.5 hours. The average speed will then be &lt;math&gt;\frac{80}{1.5} \approx&lt;/math&gt; 53.33 km/hour.

The harmonic mean also has physical significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Wikibook for Calculus already covers some portion of Diffrential equations, including a rather complete ''introduction'' to ODE. I think it would save time and effort to expand on that section, and make DE a part of that book. Over a period of time, other higher level books would also be integrated into calucus (such as series, complex analysis,etc).



Sorry for not reading this sooner, I was on vacation for the 4th.  I'm not sure I agree this should be part of another book, although I'm willing to discuss it further.  DE is a rather large and complex topic, easily a college semester even with barely touching partials.  I think adding it into one giant book would be doing a disservice to both subjects-  it would make the calculus book so huge as to be daunting to readers, and make the DE part a side note when it deserves more attention.  I guess my mindset is more of the Unix philosophy as applied to books-  do one thing, and do it well.  Tieing things together into courses of study (calc, then DE, then linear algebra (or whatever order)) is the job of a higher order layer.

I took a quick glance at the DE section of the Calculus book.  Its well written and covers a lot of ground.  The problem I have with it is that it doesn't *teach* DE.  Its a problem I have with a lot of wikibooks.  Its a good reminder, if I wanted to review the subject it would work well.  But if I had never solved a DE before and was studying the subject for the first time, I would be utterly lost.  It has few examples, no practice problems and answers, little explanation of why things worked, no discussing of the theory behind the methods, nothing of the practical applications.  It reads more like an encyclopedia entry than a book.  Which makes sense, given the nature of wikibooks springing from wikipedia.  And its better than the average wikibook out there, having read many that looked like powerpoint slides.  But still of low use as a classroom or self teaching aid.

Which brings us to another issue on adding this DE to the calculus book.  I don't want the book to look like the standard wikipedia style.  I don't like the standard style, being too much encyclopedia and not enough book.  Given that I won't be using the same style, I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to assimilate the content into one book.  Within a book, IMHO, one ought to make an attempt to keep the style of the information the same.  To do otherwise is confusing.  And while I have no doubt my style will have its own deficiencies and I'm happy to listen for impovements, I doubt you'll be able to convince me to switch to standard wikibook style.

Just laying out some ideas for a brief reformation, im going to write some things on the formation of differential equations before the tackling of the concept of a solution so as to provide what I hope will be a more intuitive and understanding approach.[[User:Robert Carr|Robert Carr]] 03:38, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

It's a shame to see this book neglected -- it would be a really nice resource to have an online book on DEs. I think I'll write some content for it. I've already written Variation of Parameters (under Constant Coefficients) and maybe I'll also add something about Laplace transforms, which are really fun and powerful. Perhaps I'll even do a section on series solutions if I'm feeling bold.... [[User:N Shar|N Shar]] 05:17, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

Please do.  I'm sorry the book has become neglected as well-  I just don't have time to add to it these days.  And on top of that, I lack the confidence in some of the more advanced material-  I am not a math professor.  As the material gets more advanced I felt more like I was regurgitating source books than I was writing from my understanding of the material.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 19:22, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Relationship of this book with the Wikipedia entry on Ordinary Differential Equations==

Reading the current version of the Wikipedia entry on ordinary differential equations, it seems to me that much of that material belongs in  a textbook, rather than an encyclopedia entry. I think the encyclopedia should have definitions and motivation for studying the material. I have written a comment to that effect on the wikipedia article, and I'm in the process of writing some of that material for the wikipedia article.


Now as far as the wikibook is concerned, I think the title shhould be &quot;Ordinary Differential Equations&quot;, because that describes the content. My background is in partial differential equations, so I'd like to advance that side of the wiki enterprise, but I think ODE comes first logically. I'm now retired with some time on my hands, so I'd like to help with any or all of these enterprises. So far I haven't been able to get a wikibooks ID, but my wikipedia ID is &quot;donludwig&quot;. Email is ludwig@math.ubc.ca [[User:154.5.94.9|154.5.94.9]] 17:46, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

==Book Development==
I'm currently studying Diff EQ and would like to contribute to this book. This is the second time I've taken this course, and I feel that there are many students out there that would benifit from a free resource that could explain topics from a non-textbook-writer point of view. More importantly, I'd like to expand the example problems to cover as many examples as possible since this is the main way of learning any subject: practice. Please contact me so that we can discuss further development at curtwulf at gmail dot com. Thanks. [[User:Curtwulf|Curtwulf]] 12:23, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Definitions ==

Arnold defines an ODE as follows.
An ODE is a process evolving in time that has the following 3 characteristics:
(1) deterministic
(2) finite dimensional
(3) differentiable.
where deterministic means that the entire past and future of a process is determined by its initial value.
finite dimensional means that the set of all possible states of your process (the phase space) can locally be parametrized by 
finite many real numbers (eg.: a sphere can locally be parametrized by two real numbers, so does the plane, the real line, etc).  Differentiability means that the time evolution processes can be described by an equation that is differentible.

I like this approach to ODE's by Arnold better then the one normaly found at books because it is more conceptual.

----

Response: With all due respect to Arnold, that definition is too narrow for many practical purposes.  It focuses on &quot;processes evolving in time&quot; which is not the only situation where ODEs arise.  For example, it excludes boundary value problems in which case the description &quot;the entire past and future of a process is determined by its initial value&quot; makes no sense.

Furthermore, the requirement (3) is too restrictive.  Consider, for instance, the differential equation y'(t) + y(t) = f(t) where f is a step function.  Such equations arise all the time in electronic circuits; the step in f corresponds to throwing a switch.  The solution y is continuous but not differentiable.  Of course, to make sense of the differential equation, we need to view it as an integral equation, as in:

   y(t) = y(0) + int&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; [ f(t) - y(t) ] dt

which is what one does when proving the existence and uniqueness theorems anyway.

== Reformat ==
I'd like to create a standard layout for accessing the examples, problems, and answers, like at the end of the page explaning the topic so the confusion in the chapter on First Order Equations doesn't happen.

== Calculus category ==

Given that most universities list this course as &quot;Calculus ##&quot; (usually IV), I feel like it would make sense to include this in the Calculus category. I didn't find out about this book existing until looking at the discussion of the DE section of the Calculus textbook, and the first place I looked for it was in the Calculus section. Support? [[User:XarBiogeek|XarBiogeek]] ([[User talk:XarBiogeek|talk]]) 08:34, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

:My experience is that the topics covered at most universities in a course such as &quot;Calculus IV&quot; would not go into the depth that is aimed for in the current book.  So in general I suppose I don't think it would work to include the book in the Calculus category.  Maybe we could provide a link from the Calculus subject to the subject on Differential equations to aid in people finding this book.  Out of curiosity how did you calculus book that lead you here.  It has always been a question as to how our readers find the books they are looking for.

== Books title ==

I am interested in renaming this book, as it's current title seems a bit too broad to me.  I was thinking something along the lines of &quot;Ordinary Differential Equations&quot;, but maybe working in &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Introductory&quot;, etc. What do other people think?

== Roadmap ==

Hi, I'm new to editing this book.  It would be extremely beneficial if there were a plan regarding what to add.  That is especially true since there are a limited number of volunteers contributing, and they each have a limited amount of time to give.  Currently the &quot;Roadmap&quot; page is only a red link from the table of contents.

To move this book toward completion we should focus on finishing the essentials before adding peripheral material; consider what you would find in an elementary differential equations book for college undergraduates.

Thank you all.  I hope this book grows quickly!

== Formation of Differential Equations==
I think this section of the book should go.  It does not add to the study of the subject, and is distracting for a pedagogical prospective.  From a practical point of view it is backwards, as usually you are looking for the unknown function that solves an ODE.  Overall it just doesn't add to the text. If there are no objections I will remove it. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:49, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
: In absence of any objections, I have deleted the section. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:01, 28 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

'''Chả giò''', which can be roughly translated as &quot;minced pork roll,&quot; is a popular dish in Vietnamese cuisine and usually served as an appetizer in America and European countries, where there are large Vietnamese communities. In northern Vietnam, it is referred to as '''nem rán''' (&quot;fried minced pork&quot;).

{{recipe}} | [[:Category:Rhubarb recipes|Rhubarb Recipes]]

This pie is fairly sweet but is also quite tangy since rhubarb is its main ingredient. It is best served warm with a scoop of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|Flaky Pie Crust]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (1100g) of [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]] stalks (about 2 1/2 pounds)
* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups (360ml) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/4 cup of (60ml) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Tapioca|tapioca]] pearls
* 1/4 tsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

===Crust===
# Prepare the [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|flaky pie crust]] and refrigerate while preparing the rhubarb.

===Filling===
# Clean and trim the rhubarb stalks.
# Cut the stalks into 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5cm) sections.
# Add sugar, cornstarch or tapioca, and salt.
# Stir until rhubarb is evenly coated with dry ingredients.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Forming and cooking the pie===
# Follow the instructions in the [[Cookbook:Flaky_Pie_Crust#To_Form_a_Covered_Pie|flaky pie crust]] recipe.

Place pie on lowest rack in oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking for 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If cornstarch is used as the thickener, the pie requires a longer cooling time before the filling is gelled.

* Another variation is to use a whole egg in the mix.

* This cookbook also has a recipe for [[Cookbook:Strawberry Rhubarb Pie|strawberry rhubarb pie]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==C++==
C++ is an [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language derived from [[Software Engineers Handbook:Language Dictionary:Procedural:C|C]].

===Type===
C++ is a full, [[w:Multi-paradigm programming language|Multi-paradigmed]] programming language implementing the following paradigmen: [[w:Generic programming|generic]] ([[w:template|template]] [[w:metaprogramming|metaprogramming]]), [[w:Imperative programming|imperative]] and [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] ([[w:Class (computer science)|class-based]])

===Execution Entry Point===
An executable starts with the main() method.

===General Syntax===
The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 a = b;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Comments===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 // this is an inline comment.  Everything after the // is a comment.
&lt;/source&gt;

Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variable Declarations===
Declarations can appear anywhere in the implementation.

Declare i as an integer: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here are two ways to declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i = 0;
 int i(0);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Methods are declared by specifying the interface for the method.  It is often declared within the scope of a class.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name, 
                           default_argument_type default_arg_name = default_arg_value);
&lt;/source&gt;

Method implementation repeats much of the same information
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 return_type class_name::function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name, 
                           default_argument_type default_arg_name)
 {
     // work with arg_1_name, arg_2_name, and default_arg_name
     // depending on the argument types the variables are passed by 
     //   value, reference, or are constant
     // don't forget to return something of the return type
     return 36;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

''IMPORTANT POINT''  A beginner in C/C++ might get confused about the distinction between how pointers are declared in a function prototype vs. how the function is defined.  For example, if my_function does not return anything, but accepts one floating point input, its function prototype looks as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 void my_function(float *some_variable); 
&lt;/source&gt;

However, if the variable my_var is defined to be a pointer to a float, for example: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 float *my_var; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Then the manner in which my_function is invoked is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 my_function(my_var); 
&lt;/source&gt;

Beginners sometimes get confused about the fact that a &quot;*&quot; is used to tell the compiler in a prototype statment that a variable is a pointer, but a &quot;*&quot; is not syntactically used during invocation of a function that accepts a pointer as input.

===Scope===
Scope is defined by curly braces.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 { // this the the beginning of a scope
     // the scope is about to end
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conditional Statements===
If and only if A is equal to B assign C to D, otherwise, assign E to F.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 if( A == B )
 {
     D = C;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is equal to B
 }
 else
 {
     F = E;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is not equal to B
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

or
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 if( A == B ) 
     D = C; //more lines of code are not permitted after this statement
 else
     F = E;
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, a switch statement can be used for multiple choice operations.  This sample converts a number input to text.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 switch( number_value )
 {
     case 37:
         text = &quot;thirty-seven&quot;;
         break; // this line prevents the program from writing over this value with the
                //   following code
     case 23:
         text = &quot;twenty-three&quot;;
         break;
     default: // this is used if none of the previous cases contain the value
         text = &quot;unknown number&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Looping Statements===
This code counts from 0 to 9, adding up the contents of the array.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int i = 0;
 for( int index = 0; index &lt; 10; index = index + 1 )
 {
     i = array[index];
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This code repeats until the number 4 is found.  If this runs off of the end of the array, there could be a problem.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int index = 0;
 while( 4 != array[index] )
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This code increments the counter before the check is made, so that it starts with element 1.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 int index = 0;
 do
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
 while( 4 != array[index] );
&lt;/source&gt;

===Output Statements===
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 printf( &quot;%s&quot;,&quot;Hello world!\n&quot; );
&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello world!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Containers===
The standard template library has a variety of containers including vector, bit-set, list, map and multi-set.

===Algorithms===
The standard template library has a variety of algorithms including sort, remove_if, and find_if.

===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is manual.

===Physical Structure===
Generally the interfaces are defined in header files, often *.h.  The implementation files are often named *.cpp.  Useful collections of classes can be compiled into libraries, often *.dll, *.a, or *.so, which can be compiled into executables (statically linked) or used on the fly (dynamically linked).

===Tips===
Don't confuse these two:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 =  // assignment
 == // comparison, is equal to
&lt;/source&gt;

Often using the one you don't want will compile, and will produce results you did not expect.

A good practice is to write; if(CONSTANT == variable) rather than if(variable == CONSTANT) since the compiler will catch; if(CONSTANT = variable) but not if(variable = CONSTANT).

Arrays start with index 0.

      <comment>Deleted a word which was not a word (enforzarse), corrected several definitions which were either erroneous or incomplete, corrected a couple of spelling errors, added more reflexive verbs and their definitions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Reflexive verbs indicate that the action of the verb reflects back on the subject. In their infinitive forms, reflexive verbs end in -se.


Examples:
*'''lavarse'''- to wash oneself
*'''vestirse'''- to dress oneself

Conjugation requires removing the -se ending and conjugating normally. The reflexive pronouns are then placed before the conjugated form of the verb.

'''Lavarse'''
:yo '''me''' lavo - I wash myself
:tú '''te''' lavas - you wash yourself
:él/ella/Ud. '''se''' lava - he/she/it washes himself/herself/itself
:nosotros '''nos''' lavamos - we wash ourselves
:vosotros '''os''' laváis - you (plural) wash yourselves
:ellos/ellas/Uds. '''se''' lavan - they wash themselves

'''Vestirse'''
:yo '''me''' visto - I dress myself
:tú '''te''' vistes - you dress yourself
:él/ella/Ud. '''se''' viste - he/she/it dresses himself/herself/itself
:nosotros '''nos''' vestimos - we dress ourselves
:vosotros '''os''' vestís - you (plural) dress yourselves
:ellos/ellas/Uds. '''se''' visten - they dress themselves

Reflexive verbs often have to do with personal hygiene, grooming, and dressing:

*'''peinarse'''- to brush one's hair
*'''maquillarse'''- to make-up oneself
*'''cepillarse (los dientes)'''- to brush one's teeth
*'''bañarse'''- to bathe oneself

Remember that the reflexive pronoun (me, te, se, etc.) ''must'' be included with the verb, even if the subject pronoun (yo, tú, él, etc.) is not.

      <comment>/* Naming conventions */convert interwiki wiki: -&gt; c2:, replaced: Wiki: → c2: (3) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the wikipedia entry for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_standard coding standards].

Coding standards generally contain a set of conventions for a specific language.  Items typically covered are:
*Naming conventions including:
**how descriptive and long the names should be,
**what the capitalization scheme should be, and
**what the postfix and prefix conventions are.
*Physical organization, such as ''Definitions shall be located in the header files.'' and ''Do not include more than one class in one file.''
*Structure conventions, such as ''Opening and closing braces shall be located in the same column like this:
 {
     {
         // code in here
     }
 }''
*Style guides, such as ''Classes containing pointers shall have a virtual destructor.''  It is useful to include the reasoning and references for this type of standard.
*Legacy code guidance, such as ''When editing existing code, follow the coding naming and structure conventions of the existing code.''

==C++==
*[http://www.possibility.com/Cpp/CppCodingStandard.html www.possibility.com coding standard]

*''Effective C++:  55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs'' by Scott Meyers (ISBN 0321334876) is a reference for creating style guides.
*''More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs'' by Scott Meyers (ISBN 020163371X) is a reference for creating style guides.

==Java==

==C==

==Eiffel==
*[http://www.cs.unc.edu/~smithja/MIMS/DataModel/development/plan/eiffel_coding_standard.html ww.cs.unc.edu standard]

== Naming conventions ==

''&quot;Always, always, always use good, unabbreviated, correctly-spelled meaningful names.&quot; -- [[c2: MeaningfulName]]''

Popular naming conventions (naming formats) include:

*ALL_UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
*all_lowercase_with_underscores
*CamelCase
*uppercaseOnlyInTheMiddle
*_UnderscorePrefixedCamelCase
*Camel_Case_With_Underscores

For surprisingly long conversations about naming conventions, see
[[c2: UnderscoreVersusCapitalAndLowerCaseVariableNaming]];
[[Wikipedia: CamelCase]]; [[c2: CamelCase]]; and [http://echochamber.me/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=15752 &quot;Underscores vs CamelCase&quot;].

==The United States and The Great War==

===Why didn't the United States enter the war before [[w:1917|1917]]?===

===Why did the United States enter the war on [[w:April 6|April 6]], [[w:1917|1917]]?===

# Sympathy for Britain amongst East Coast elite (including Wilson, Robert Lansing)
#* connections, common language, massive British propaganda campaign, control of most news, purchase of UK and French bonds
# Sympathy for France
#* assistance during Revolution, fellow republicans, democratic
#* Lafayette Escadrille
# Sympathy for Belgium
#* shock at violation of neutrality, &quot;scrap of paper&quot;
#* atrocities (magnified by British propaganda)
#* Belgian Food Relief (Hoover)
# Growth of imperial and militarist sentiment
#* [[w:1898|1898]] [[w:Spanish-American War|Spanish-American War]]
#* interventions in Caribbean, especially Mexico
#* &quot;preparedness&quot; movement
#* [[w:1916|1916]] law to double size of army
# German influence in Mexico
#* defeat of Pershing Expedition
# ''[[w:RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' ([[w:May 7|May 7]], [[w:1915|1915]]) and submarine warfare
#* Lansing: &quot;our friendship with Germany is a thing of the past&quot;
# German sabotage
#* factories, depots, bridges. New Jersey Black Tom plant
#* expulsion of some German and Austrian diplomats
# Failure of Wilson's peace attempts during [[w:1917|1917]]

# Effect on battlefield
#* very limited [[w:1917|1917]], but significant latter part of defence against German offensives in [[w:1918|1918]], counterattacks
#* two million fresh troops in France by end war
#* impact on German morale
# Financial support
#* loans to Entente powers from US Government [[w:April|April]] to mid-[[w:July|July]] came to [[w:1917|1917]] $430 million

== Factors contributing to likelihood of conflict ==

# Nationalism
#* in [[w:Balkans|Balkans]], within [[w:Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]] and in major nation-states
#* fueled drive both to change and to mantain status quo—drive to become world power, fear that would lose great power status
#* resistance to actions or policies that might harm national prestige
# Imperialism
#* no evidence that capitalist interests pushed for war in accordance with Leninist argument
#* imperialism outside Europe often exaggerated as factor—settlement of imperial disputes in wider world more a feature of [[w:1900|1900]]-[[w:1914|14]] period (and previously more conflict between Britain and France, Russia)
#* resentment in Germany that denied &quot;place in the sun&quot;
#* French-German confrontation over [[w:Morocco|Morocco]] in [[w:1905|1905]] and [[w:1911|1911]] helped cement [[w:Entente Cordiale|Entente Cordiale]] (French for &quot;friendly understanding&quot;)
#* Italian attack on Turkey to seize territory ([[w:1911|1911]]-[[w:1912|12]]) weakened Turkish power further
#* Austro-Hungarian designs on Serbia a form of imperialism, supported by Germany
# Alliance System
#* ostensibly means by which Russia, Germany and France drawn into a conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia
#* importance can be exaggerated—some moral influence (and possible resulting domestic political considerations), but alliances generally embody real interests and become operative because those interests are threatened or can be advanced
#* no formal alliance between Russia and Sebia, or Britain and France
# Arms Races
#* naval competition soured relations between Britain and Germany
#* heightened tension as Russia and France built up their armies in response to Germany—temptation of latter to strike first (especially as many in government perceived that could not compete in medium term)
# Military Planning/Technological Improvements in Mobilization
#* importance of railway timetables, quick decisions
#* French-British military talks implied some commitment
# Changes in Existing Power Balance
#* unification of Germany and its rapid industrial development and population growth
#* rapid economic development of Russia
#* decline of Turkey
#* rise of Serbia
# Internal Pressures
#* definite fear in Austria-Hungary
#* problem for German Imperial Government—rise of [[w:Social democracy|Social Democrats]], rise of nationalistic anti-Socialist parties
#* fear of nationalist backlash in Russia and possibly France if backed down from confrontation
#* internal problems in Britain tended to exert pressure against involvement in war
# Misjudgement of Nature of Coming War
#* widespread belief that it would have to end quickly, presumably with a conference, after decisive war of movement
# Ideological and Moral Influences
#* glorification of war and self-sacrifice made for widespread acceptance amongst populations
#* concepts of &quot;honor&quot;
#* some perception of ideological conflict—Russian [[w:Autocracy|autocracy]], German [[w:Militarism|militarism]], French [[w:Republicanism|republicanism]]; religious divisions
#* some affected by ideologies of power and necessary conflict; concepts of [[w:Social Darwinism|Social Darwinism]], ideas of [[w:Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] *but fear stronger than &quot;will to power&quot; amongst most decisionmakers)

== Reasons for the decisions of individual governments ==

===Austria-Hungary Attacks Serbia [[w:July 28|July 28]]===
* assassination of [[w:Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] by Serbs almost certainly supported by elements in Serbian military; refusal by Serbia to accept all demands unconditionally
* more fundamental reason: desire to crush perceived growing Serbian threat by absorbing Serbia
** Austro-Hungarian nationality problem, acute in Balkans area
** close relations between Serbia and Russia, the main power threat to Austria-Hungary
** Serbia aggressively nationalistic since [[w:1903|1903]], looking to unite with Serbs and Croats in Turky and Austria-Hungary
** [[w:1905|1905]]-[[w:1909|09]] failure of &quot;[[w:Pig War|pig war]]&quot;
** [[w:1908|1908]] Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzgovina increases Serb hostility
** [[w:1912|1912]]-[[w:1913|13]] Serbia greatly increases its territory and proves militarily effective in the [[w:Balkan Wars|Balkan Wars]]
* support of Germany—[[w:July 5|July 5]] &quot;blank cheque&quot;

===Russia Mobilizes (partially [[w:July 29|July 29]], generally [[w:July 30|July 30]])===
* belief that they should not abandon Serbia
** fellow Slavs, fellow [[w:Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]
** would lose a strategic advantage against Austria-Hungary
** would suffer immense loss of prestige internationally and domestically
*** had suffered defeat in war [[w:1904|1904]]-[[w:1905|05]], [[w:1908|1908]] had not intervened when Bosnia annexed, [[w:1913|1913]] had allowed Serbia to be deprived of an [[w:Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline following Balkan Wars
* believed had chance of winning war following rapid recovery since [[w:1905|1905]]
* a successful war could lead to Russian control over the [[w:Strait|straits]] between the [[w:Black Sea|Black Sea]] and the [[w:Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (specifically, the [[w:Bosporus|Bosporus]] and the [[w:Dardanelles|Dardanelles]])—important for trade, especially grain exports
* [[w:1913|1913]] German military mission to Turky ([[w:Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]])—belief that German influence there increasing
* Tsar persuaded by military and French ambassador to carry out general mobilization on grounds that war with Germany inevitable

===Germany Declares War on Russia ([[w:August 1|August 1]])===
* Austria-Hungary Germany's only reliable ally ([[w:Dual Alliance, 1879|1879 Dual Alliance]])—believed could not afford to see it defeated or dismembered
* Russia allied with France, Germany's major opponent in western Europe
* planning for war assumed Austro-Hungarian attack on Russia
* belief that faced growing danger from Russia (building railways, industrialization, greater military effectiveness)—military in particular argue that best to strike early, before Russian reorganization and expansion of military complete ([[w:1917|1917]])
* defeat of Russia could open up economic opportunities in eastern Europe
* likely that war against &quot;autocratic&quot;, brutal Russian threat would be popular domestically

===Germany Declares War on France and Invades Belgium ([[w:August 3|August 3]])===
* superficially due to France's refusal to pledge neutrality and surrender its eastern forts
* Germany considers France an irreconcilable opponent because of German annexation of [[w:Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine]] in [[w:1871|1871]]
* France allied with Russia in [[w:1892|1892]] and had been deploying much of its capital surplus to build infrastructure (especially railways) and industry in Russia
* France moving to expand its military forces in response to German expansion, but not ready until [[w:1915|1915]]-[[w:1916|16]]
* German military plans ([[w:Schlieffen Plan|von Schlieffen Plan]]) call for a rapid attack on France before Russia can fully mobilize and attack Germany (Kaiser told cannot mobilize solely against Russia—railway timetables)
* need to secure rapid passage through neutral Belgium on a narrow front (partly because had decided in [[w:1911|1911]] not to violate neutrality of Netherlands)
* had come to accept likelihood of British intervention (formation of [[w:Entente Cordiale|Entente Cordiale]] [[w:1904|1904]], [[w:Triple Entente|Triple Entente]] [[w:1907|1907]], attitude in two Moroccan crises), but considered not significant militarily and now better prepared with completion improvement [[w:Kiel Canal|Kiel Canal]]

===Britain Declares War on Germany ([[w:August 4|August 4]])===
* since [[w:1880s|1880s]] had come to regard Germany as its likely enemy in a future European war ([[w:Kruger telegram|Kruger telegram]] [[w:1896|1896]], attitude during [[w:Boer War|South African War]] [[w:1899|1899]]-[[w:1902|1902]], [[w:First Moroccan Crisis|Tangier Crisis]] [[w:1905|1905]]-[[w:1906|06]], [[w:Agadir Crisis|Agadir Crisis]] [[w:1911|1911]], '''above all''' because of large-scale German naval construction since [[w:1898|1898]]—naval supremacy seen as basis of British power and security)
* widespread belief that defeat of France would upset balance of power in Europe and lead to possibility of German naval bases in northern France and Low Countries—intolerable threat
* British military had been cooperating with French military in planning for several years—implied commitment
* [[w:Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] ([[w:Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]) convinced that Britain had to get involved
* German attack on neutral Belgium gave additional justification and moral basis (particularly strong in influencing public opinion)

==War Enthusiasm==
Aim to give overview of social, economic, political and military issues of war
*It was an industrialised war, at the end of a long period of industrialisation for Britain and, more recently, Germany so these had an effect
*Way war remembered in 20th c., architecture, monuments, etc.
*During 90s it got &quot;vogue&quot;ish

===Middle classes===
* &quot;pals battallions&quot; were method of recruiting in Britain
* esp. linked to notion of &quot;the city&quot;
* represented by &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;

===War Enthusiasm===
* [[w:1914|1914]] - historians often speak of the &quot;rush to the colours&quot; in this year
** also general atmosphere of war enthusiasm
* is this true to all classes?
* should we question some commonly-held assumptions about war enthusiasm?
* on eve of war in [[w:1914|1914]] Britain had experienced several decades of economic growth
* when war broke out British army fairly small
** their navy was bigger than their army!
* most of the army was in India defending the &quot;Jewel of the crown&quot; as Disraeli called it
* the army wasn’t something you’d see as a career move!
** it was often home to the dregs of society in 19th c.
** English *wanted* the army posted abroad for fear of what would happen if it stayed in Britain
** there were military camps like Aldersharp/shark (sp?) but most was still kept overseas
* officers from middle of 19th c. came from upper classes; had gone thru public school education
* the army was short of 11,000 men when war broke out
** this triggered Kitchener’s desire for new army
* he produced a well-known poster where his eyes followed you around the room
** &quot;Your country needs YOU!&quot; poster art took off in WW1
** US later adapted this for Uncle Sam because it was so effective
* the army went thru big changes in WW1; the existing army, the old Contemptibles (BEF) as well as the Territorials
* but now there were 2 new armies coming thru
** those volunteers Kitchener managed to raise
** and in [[w:1916|1916]], another army made up of those forced to fight!
* Britain brought in laws to ''force'' you to fight at the Front; conscription was introduced
* highly contentious b/c liberal gov that was in power was supposed to be about freedom of choice!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word ''apocrypha'' in Bibliology refers to texts that are not considered canonical, part of the Bible, but are of roughly similar style and age as the accepted Scriptures. Protestants use the word ''apocryph'', in a narrower sense, of those books that they exclude from their canon of Scripture, but that other Churches view as canonical and venerate as divinely inspired, written under the influence of the Holy Spirit. 

Disagreement between Christian Churches is almost non-existent about the canon of the New Testament, but the inclusion of some books in the Old Testament canon is disputed. Since these books were of late composition, Protestant scholars sometimes call them ''intertestamenta'', i.e. intermediate between the Old and New Testaments, and hold that God imposed a period of silence, with no prophecy or Scripture, to prepare for the coming of Jesus.

The books that come under the description ''apocryph'' in the broad sense but not in this narrow sense are called apocrypha by Catholics and Jews, but Protestants usually call them ''Pseudepigrapha''. Many of them have apocalyptic themes.

      <comment>My views on vandalism.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is created to assist in the organization of the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism]] page. It contains information previously posted on the Specials page that is collated to give a better overview of multi-session vandalism.

= Vandalism =

The ideal behind Wikibooks (and in general Wikiprojects) is really the sharing and consolidation of human knowledge. If you look back in history, you would realise how much knowledge we take for granted.

Take for example the PC you are using. Each PC is a cummulation of human knowledge in:
:* material sciences (to know that it is possible to construct a PC from base material)
:* geology (locating the oil and silicon, plus other material such as gold)
:* mining/ drilling (to extract said material)
:* chemistry and metallurgy (to refine the material)
:* construction, electronics and robotics (to create the production facilities needed to produce the PC)
:* power generation (to power the PC)
:* mathematics, logic and computer sciences (to create OS and applications to run the PC)
:* ....

I can just go on and on, but the point is, it is impossible for any ONE person on this planet to create a PC from, say, a pool of crude oil and a lump of ore. The knowledge needed to turn ''black gold'' and raw ore into the PC you are using now has way too many specialist areas that requires dedication to master.

Thus, a critical loss of knowledge in even ONE area will mean the total loss of ability by humanity to create more PCs; without the computational muscles computing brings us, humanity cannot progress beyond where we are now.

Wikibooks, in its own way, tries to preserve some parts of the knowledge. The motivation, effort and dedication of true contributors here are all diverse, but we need not question them; that they bothered to set aside time to key in such information is already something I personally am thankful for.

So, I view vandalism with a very dim light. In many ways, vandals are not showing respect for the efforts of others -- they deserve no respect from me then. They are threatening what we as a collective whole tries to build, all for the cheap thrill of destroying the works of others. That is something unforgivable, at least in my opinion.

Wikibooks is getting more and more popular as time goes by. Now, in about half a day, we have about 500 edits; approximately 1% is vandalism, plus another 1% in newcomer mistakes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to quickly narrow down the vandals as they often hide behind the anonymity that is at the core of the Wiki ideal. It makes it necessary for other contributors to dedicate time to check the entries to make sure that no vandalism undo the works of others. 

Not only that, these contributors need to maintain an objectivity to leave coherent subjective books alone, while rooting out the true vandals; some Wikibooks are truly offensive or subjective, yet in the sum of human knowledge, these books are a ''necessary'' evil. It is however not the place of these contributors -- let's call them ''Patrollers'' to pass judgement on the appropriateness of a well-developed Wikibook.

Wikibooks badly need more Patrollers. As more users come to utilize Wikibooks more than Wikipedia (which, by definition, is more restrictive), the percentage of vandalism is likely to increase (but thankfully, self-patrols will also go up). As it is, we are hard pressed to catch vandals and react swiftly enough to minimize the damage they cause. We need to breed a group of contributors who are sufficiently civic-conscious to do what is needed, without the benefits of material rewards or acknowledgement.

== Ass Pus Attacks ==

The '''Ass Pus Attacks''' are a series of attacks that has the same MO:

# A named user attacks [[:Image:WikiThanks.png]] by changing the image (a sunflower) into that of the words &quot;Ass Pus&quot; (hence the name of this section). As this image is used by several official pages, it is a quick way to vandalize mulitple files.
# The user uploads various crude images and link them to editable official pages like this page.
# The user can also start moving official pages to pages that has the name &quot;Ass Pus&quot; in them.


To date, the following users are known to use this attack. These users have been blocked.

:* [[Special:Contributions/Duke of Puke|Duke of Puke]] (First known instance.)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Greeno|Greeno]] (Partial; blocked by [[User:Waerth|Waerth]] before full damage is done but uploaded signature &quot;Ass Pus&quot; image. Reconstructed from audit trail.)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Henry the 88th|Henry the 88th]] (Observed in full by me ([[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]).)
:* [[Special:Contributions/Ting Tong|Ting Tong]] (Not observed by me ([[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]]) but has signature style.)

The following is a record of the various information posted by various admins/ contributors at the time of the attack. These are copied from the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|Vandalism]] page.

=== [[Special:Contributions/Duke of Puke|Duke of Puke]] ===
He's vandalizing pages and templates.  He needs to be banned.  Homepage is a redirect. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 06:09, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
* I had to move it back.  He moved [[User:TUF-KAT]] to his own page, and also moving key policy pages around (including this page) and giving them offensive names.  User's userpage is currently a redirect to [[User:TUF-KAT]] as a result. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:11, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)
*He's been blocked. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:58, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Special:Contributions/Henry the 88th|Henry the 88th]] ===
Vandal. U/led inappropriate image [[:Image:Gap8.jpg|here]], vandalized 4 pages including 1 Template page. The other template he inserted a standard wiki img so I'm going to leave it alone. Suspected alias of [[Special:Contributions/Duke_of_Puke|Duke of Puke]] et. al., please block ASAP.

As a precaution, can I request that [[:Image:WikiThanks.png]] be protected? The attacks from Henry the 88th, Ting Tong, Duke of Puke (and suspect Gumba Gumba) all had similar styles, and of late (since Ting Tong) they have kept attacking this image as it is a commonly used image in Wikibooks. I'll willing to bet money the next wave from this person/ persons will also target this image. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 08:37, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: Update: Seems like I missed the last Duke of Puke sockpuppet attack, this time under the name [[Special:Contributions/Greeno|Greeno]]. Same MO (i.e. attacked the WikiThanks.png with the same image as previous attacks. [[User:Waerth|Waerth]] blocked him before too much damage is done.

: Can we protect this image to stop these attacks? Granted, he can still u/l the image under another name, but at least he would not be able to affect so many pages with one edit. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 10:29, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago is indicative of the blends of Amerindian, European, African, Indian, Chinese, Creole, and Lebanese gastronomic influences, and is also more similar to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Guyana|cuisine of Guyana]] than most other countries in the Carribbean. 

A representative main dish from Trinidad and Tobago is callaloo, a creamy and spicy sauce made of dasheen leaves, okra, coconut milk, pumpkin and chandon benit (French thistle or fitweed). Crab and callaloo is generally considered a national dish of Trinidad and Tobago; it is often prepared for Sunday lunch. Pelau, a rice-based dish, is also a standard dish in Trinidad and Tobago. Another popular dish is roti  - this is of East Indian origin and consists of curried potatoes, channa (chickpeas) and meat wrapped in dalphurie (similar to pita bread). Other local dishes include coo coo, sancoche, macaroni pie and oil down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tigers are my favourite animal and I am highly against tiger poaching. It is a cruel and discusting thing to do to a living creature. How would you like it? G-d made humans to rule over the animals and to look after them. So why are we missusing our responsibility? Tigers are camouflaged, fast and excellent predators. The reason for the decline in the number of tigers is the greatest predator in the world: Man. If we keep killing tigers for our own selfish purposes then not one species of tiger will strive.Tigers like so many other animals in this world are so close to extinction. It was the human race that has brought them to where they are today, and it is only human beings who can help them.

Circuses and zoos..yet another attempt to master the great beast.  To then lock him up and stare at him as a live trophy.  To make him perform silly stunts and be humiliated so that people can laugh and be entertained.  To watch him pace back and forth on a floor of concrete, and stare through iron bars.  All so we can be amazed that such a creature is truly captured.  How strong we must be to do this!  How glorious of a species we must be to have taken away his freedom and to have humiliated the very defnition of grace and power.  Therefore we see ourselves as beautiful and powerful, when all we really are is cowards and theives.  

Soon, because we hold all the power, we begin to destroy even ourselves because there is nothing left and it is in the heart of every creature to gain the control.  The glorious thing about nature is that it does not allow one to remain in that position forever, it allows one species to recede so that another can prosper and then the circle completes when the one who receded can now prosper again.  And so it goes, the cycles that must be so.  Humans have damaged it, ruined it, abused it and misunderstood it.   
 
So as you can see, I am highly against tiger poaching and the displaying of tigers in zoos and circuses. However, I am more concerned about the displaying of tigers in circuses than that in zoos, as zoos are there to save the few tigers that are left in the world. But if there were no poachers, there would be no need for zoos of any kind, and t[[Image:Example.jpg]herefore, I end my point: Tigers should be free to roam the world just as we are.

==A Little Balance, Please==
I am human, yet I have a deep and marvelous relationship of love, trust and mutual respect with the big cats I rescue.  There is no such thing as collective guilt.  I was born in a body that is superbly equipped to carry my life force where it wants to go, and has touch and sight and hearing good enough to love whom I will love, lion, tiger or human.  It happens to be a human body, and for that I am unapologetic.  That I do not have four legs or wings is neither a judgment against me nor a source of shame.  Man's self exile from Nature comes from two sources: those who feel nature is a backdrop for man's grand exploits, and those who feel unworthy to touch the living wild.  I choose not to exile myself from nature, and for this reason I am a much more effective champion of conservation than a hundred self-flagellants who bemoan their opposable thumbs.  Forgive yourself and mankind, and go forth in love to stop the war against nature and heal the broken remnants of living Earth.  Peace be with you....

      <text xml:space="preserve">Catalan verbs can be tricky to conjugate. Many verbs are irregular, though similarities between three basic groups of verbs do exist and a few ground rules can be made.
Verb use in Catalan is similar to French and Spanish but has a few notable exceptions:
*Like Spanish, Catalan regularly uses two past tenses. 
**If the action was completed today, or the result of the action is still valid, Catalan uses the '''pretèrit indefinit'''
***''Aquest matí hem cantat—We sang this morning. Enguany he visitat les illes balears—This year I visited the Balearic Islands''
**If the action was completed before today, or the action clearly occurred only once, Catalan uses the '''pretèrit perfet'''
***''Ahir al matí vam cantar—We sang yesterday morning. L'any passat vaig visitar les illes balears—Last year I visited the Balearic Islands''
*A third past tense exists, similar to the ''passé simple'' in French, the '''pretèrit perfet simple'''. Like its French counterpart, it is only used in the more eloquent literary form of Catalan, and it is almost never used in spoken language.
***''El compositor nasqué/naixé l'any 1923—The composer was born in 1923.''

TO BE CONTINUED


Use of the small but comprehensive &quot;Els verbs catalans conjugats&quot; by J.B.Xuriguera—Edicions Claret is highly recommended.
On the internet, Verbix [http://www.verbix.com/languages/catalan.shtml] offers free verb conjugations. Note that the tenses are indicated in French. Dacco [http://www.catalandictionary.org] also offer free  conjugations of the more than 1,000 verbs contained in their dictionary - with tenses indicated in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==C==
''looking for the story of C here''
===Type===
C is a full, procedural language.
===Execution Entry Point===
An executable starts with the main() method.
===General Syntax===
The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:
 a = b;
===Comments===
Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */
===Variable Declarations===
Declarations need to appear at the top of the scope.

Declare i as an integer: 
 int i;
Declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:
 int i = 0;

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Methods are declared by specifying the interface for the method.  

 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name);

Method implementation repeats much of the same information

 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name)
 {
     // work with arg_1_name, arg_2_name, and default_arg_name
     // depending on the argument types the variables are passed by 
     //   value, reference, or are constant
     // don't forget to return something of the return type
     return 36;
 }

===Scope===
Scope is defined by curly braces.
 { // this the the beginning of a scope
     // the scope is about to end
 }
===Conditional Statements===
If and only if A is equal to B assign C to D, otherwise, assign E to F.
 if( A == B )
 {
     D = C;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is equal to B
 }
 else
 {
     F = E;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is not equal to B
 }
or
 if( A == B ) 
     D = C; //more lines of code are not permitted after this statement
 else
     F = E;

Alternatively, a switch statement can be used for multiple choice operations.  This sample converts a number input to text.
 switch( number_value )
 {
     case 37:
         text = &quot;thirty-seven&quot;;
         break; // this line prevents the program from writing over this value with the
                //   following code
     case 23:
         text = &quot;twenty-three&quot;;
         break;
     default: // this is used if none of the previous cases contain the value
         text = &quot;unknown number&quot;;
 }

===Looping Statements===
This code counts from 0 to 9, adding up the contents of the array.
 int i = 0;
 for( int index = 0; index &lt; 10; index = index + 1 )
 {
     i = array[index];
 }

This code repeats until the number 4 is found.  If this runs off of the end of the array, there could be a problem.
 int index = 0;
 while( 4 != array[index] )
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }

This code increments the counter before the check is made, so that it starts with element 1.
 int index = 0;
 do
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
 while( 4 != array[index] );
===Output Statements===
 printf( &quot;%s&quot;,&quot;Hello world!\n&quot; );

===Containers===
struct
===Algorithms===
Implement your own, or find a library.
===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is manual.
===Physical Structure===
Generally, the interfaces are defined before the implementation in header files (often *.h) or above the implementation.  The implementation files are often named *.c.  Useful collections of classes can be compiled into libraries, often *.dll, *.a, or *.so, which can be compiled into executables (statically linked) or used on the fly (dynamically linked).
===Tips===
Don't confuse these two:
 =  // assignment
 == // comparison, is equal to
Often using the one you don't want will compile, and will produce results you did not expect.

A good practice is to write; if(CONSTANT == variable) rather than if(variable == CONSTANT) since the compiler will catch; if(CONSTANT = variable) but not if(variable = CONSTANT).

Use a compiler that generates lots of helpful warnings, even if the code is valid.  You could also / instead use a program such as 'lint'. This will help you avoid simple bugs such as the above-mentioned bug &quot;if ( x = 1 )&quot; instead of &quot;if ( x == 1 )&quot;.

Arrays start with index 0.

===Web References===
''List additional references on the web. Please include for what level reader the references are appropriate. (beginner/intermediate/advanced)''
===Books and Articles===
''need references''

==Perceptual &quot;filling in&quot;==

Perceptual &quot;filling in&quot; occurs when visual properties such as textures, colours, brightness or motion are extended in the visual field to areas where they do not have corresponding events in the world. 

The filling in of the blind spot by the properties of the field in the contralateral eye has already been discussed. The part of the visual field represented by the blind spot is also &quot;filled in&quot; in the case of monocular vision.

[[Image:constudblindill.gif]]

Shut the right eye and focus on the pink cross with the left eye, if the head is moved towards the pink cross there is a point at which the yellow disk disappears but the white lines are still present. In this &quot;filling in&quot; the visual field does not appear to be distorted. 

Fiorani ''et al.'' (1992) developed a technique for probing the cortical blind spot using vertical and horizontal bar stimuli. Matsumoto &amp; komatsu (2005) used this technique on macaque monkeys.  In the monocular case they found that as a bar was moved across the visual field so that it crossed the blind spot there was a sudden change in neural activity in the deep layers of the neurons in the blind spot area of V1. When the bar was moved across the same part of the visual field of the contralateral eye the neural activity in the blind spot area increased steadily as the bar was moved. The authors found that there were neurons in the deep layers of blind spot cortex that had elongated receptive fields that could respond to stimuli outside the blind spot and transfer this activation into the blind spot cortex. 

Filling in of a slightly different type occurs in &quot;scotoma&quot;. In scotoma an area of the retina is damaged and unresonsive to visual stimuli, immediately after the damage patients report an area of visual field that is unresponsive to stimuli. After several months patients report that the area of field represented by the scotoma contains visual properties related to the physical world surrounding the area that would have formed an image on the scotoma. This results in a distortion of the visual field. (see for instance Gilbert(1993)). Direct measurements of activity in cortical area V1 show that the neurons that represented the area of the scotoma become sensitive to activity in the surrounding visual field. At the cortical level the scotoma is literally &quot;filled in&quot;.

There are many stimuli that cause &quot;filling in&quot;. These stimuli are known as &quot;illusions&quot; because they produce phenomenal experience that has no correlate in the world outside the body. In the &quot;neon colour spreading illusion&quot; a lightly coloured circle appears where there should be a white background. Sasaki and Watanabe (2004) used fMRI to show that the part of the topographic map in cortical area V1 corresponding to the light coloured circle was activated.

==Binocular Rivalry, Pattern Rivalry and Binocular Fusion==

Sir Charles Wheatstone (1838) was the first scientist to systematically investigate binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry occurs when different images are presented to the left and right eyes. The subject sees successively one image, a combined image and then the other image. The swapping of images can take a second or more. Binocular rivalry is of interest in consciousness research because the parts of the brain that contain the dominant image should also be those parts that are contributing to conscious experience. Binocular rivalry involves at least two components; the first switches from one image to a merged image and then to the other image and the second permits the view to be part of conscious experience. 

[[Image:Constudrival.gif]]

The switching of one image for another may involve selecting one of the images as the percept or selecting one of the eyes. Blake ''et al.'' (1979) performed an experiment in which subjects could change the image at a given eye by pressing a button. When a particular image became dominant they pressed a button to change the image at the eye receiving the dominant image for the non-dominant image. They found that the subjects immediately experienced the second image as the dominant image. This suggests that binocular rivalry is selecting between eyes rather than images. Lehky in 1988 proposed that the switching may be occurring as a result of feedback between visual cortical area V1 and the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (a thalamic relay - see Carandini ''et al.'' 2002) and Blake in 1989 also proposed that the switching occurred at the level of area V1. (Visual cortical area V1 receives visual input direct from the LGN.) 

Tong (2001) has argued that, in humans, the switching of images in binocular rivalry may occur at the earliest levels in the visual cortex. In particular, Tong and Engel (2001) used an elegant technique measuring the activity in the visual cortex that represents the blind spot of the eye to show that almost complete switching to the dominant image occurs at the level of visual cortical area V1. In support of this idea of switching at the level of V1 or even before the cortex, Kreimann ''et al.'' (2001, 2002) used direct electrode recordings in human cortex and found that the activity of most neurons changed with the percept. Other experiments have not shown a single locus in the brain where the suppressed sensory information gets switched out (Blake &amp; Logothetis 2002, Leopold &amp; Logothetis 1996, Gail et al., 2004).

Functional MRI has also shown cortical activity outside of sensory visual cortex related to both images in binocular rivalry. Lumer ''et al.'' (1998) found that only the fronto-parietal areas of cortex switched with the percept, Fang &amp; He (2005) found that activity relating to both suppressed and unsuppressed images were present in the dorsal stream of the visual system. Wunderlich ''et al.'' (2005) and Haynes ''et al.'' (2005) have both found suppression at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus using fMRI in humans.

Pasley ''et al.'' (2004) have shown that, even during suppression, fearful faces can produce activity in the amygdala (see Pessoa (2005) for a review).

Rivalry alternations seem to be the result of widespread activity changes that cover large parts of the brain, including but not necessarily originating at the earliest sensory stages of visual processing. &lt;!-- Full reference needed in reference section for this sentence: This is also reflected in several psychophysical results that are incompatible with eye-based suppression (see: Lee, 2004).--&gt; Most investigators have found that, once switching has occurred, there are areas of the brain that contain activity that is solely related to the percept but this varies from most of the cortex to largely more frontal regions depending upon the study. The most likely explanation for binocular rivalry is that the switching occurs at the level of the LGN as a result of feedback from the cortex.

Pattern Rivalry is also of interest in consciousness research for the same reasons as binocular rivalry. In pattern rivalry a figure may have two or more forms that replace each other. Typical examples of such figures are the Necker cube and Rubin's face-vase. The similarity of the time course of the switching between percepts in binocular rivalry and pattern rivalry has led many authors to suggest that these involve the same mechanism. Logothetis ''et al.'' (1996) used novel dichoptic stimuli (different images to each eyes) to produce a form of rivalry that seems to involve switching at levels in the cerebral cortex that are more distal to the sensory stimulus than V1. Leopold and Logothetis (1999), on the basis of their work with monkeys, state that &quot;..many neurons throughout the visual system, both monocular and binocular, continue to respond to a stimulus even when it is perceptually suppressed.&quot;. Kleinschmidt ''et al.'' (1998) investigated pattern rivalry with MRI and found activity in higher order visual areas during change of dominant pattern. Pettigrew (2001) also describes effects on rivalry due to thought and mood that may require involvement of large areas of cortex in the switching operation and stresses the way that V1 represents different visual fields in different hemispheres of the brain so that inter-hemispheric switching must also be considered.

It seems likely that the change of dominant pattern or percept is associated with higher level cortical activity but once the dominant percept is established many of the visually responsive neurons in the cortex are switched over to the new percept. This might account for the similarities in timing of binocular and pattern rivalry and the disparate results found by the various groups of authors. In the words of Kleinschmidt ''et al.'' (1998):

&quot;The transient activity fluctuations we found suggest that perceptual metastability elicited by ambiguous stimuli is associated with rapid redistributions of neural activity between separate specialized cortical and subcortical structures.&quot;

Which permits both the idea of selecting particular eyes or percepts, perhaps by feedback that switches a thalamic relay on the basis of cortical processing of patterns. Once the cortex has switched the thalamic relay most of the neurons in V1 would become exposed to the dominant percept but there would still be a few neurons in the cortical visual system receiving data from the non dominant image.

The investigations of binocular and pattern rivalry provide evidence that conscious visual experience is probably distal to V1 (i.e.: cortex or thalamus). 

Perceptual rivalry may be part of complex decision making rather than being simply a switch to blank out unwelcome input. It is clear from the Rubin face-vase that pattern rivalry is linked to recognition and would involve a complex delineation of forms within cortical processing. This would suggest that many areas of cortex should be involved before a particular percept is made dominant. Pettigrew (2001) argues that rivalry is the result of a complex phenomenon rather than being simply a switching event. Pettigrew's discovery that laughter abolishes rivalry also points to a complex cortical system for switching percepts. Pettigrew proposes that complex cortical processes control rivalry and that the actual switching of percepts is performed sub-cortically in the Ventral Tegmental Area. He concludes his review of the problem by noting that &quot;Rivalry may thus reflect fundamental aspects of perceptual decision making..&quot; Pettigrew (2001).

Another effect, known as &quot;binocular fusion&quot;, provides further compelling evidence for the non-conscious nature of the cerebral cortex. In binocular fusion images from both eyes are fused together to create a single image in experience. Moutoussis and Zeki (2002) used a form of binocular fusion in which images of faces were flashed at 100ms intervals to both eyes simultaneously. When both eyes received images of the same colour the subject could see the faces but when one eye received a green image on a red background and the other a red image on a green background the subjects reported seeing a uniform yellow field that contained no faces. 

fMRI scans of the subject's brains showed that when both eyes were exposed to images of the same colour the part of the brain that deals with faces was active and when each eye received images of different colours the same areas of brain showed activity. In other words the cortex contained strong activity related to faces whether or not faces were experienced. Moutoussis and Zeki found a similar effect when they used images of houses instead of images of faces. The authors concluded that: &quot;The present study further suggests that there are no separate processing and perceptual areas but rather that the same cortical regions are involved in both the processing and, when certain levels of activation are reached and probably in combination with the activation of other areas as well, the generation of a conscious visual percept&quot;. 

This conclusion does not seem to be supported by the data. There is no evidence that any area of cortex contains the percept itself. The experiment shows that the cortex contains data relating to both red and green faces which suggests that the cortex is not the site of the conscious percept. The percept is most likely distal to the cortex perhaps in the thalamus or some other area that receives cortical sensory output.

It is interesting that Fries ''et al.'' (1997) found that neurons that were activated by the dominant image in binocular rivalry fired synchronously whereas those that were activated by the non-dominant image did not. Thalamocorticothalamic oscillations are the most likely source for synchronising neurons over whole areas of cortex, suggesting that the conscious percept is located in the thalamus rather than the cortex.

==Synchronisation of Neural Processes==

Our experience seems to contain entities with their attributes attached to them at the correct places in space and time. When a dog barks we see its jaws open at the same time as the bark and both jaws and bark are at the same location. We take this for granted but the brain must be engaging in some complex processing to achieve this synchronised and appropriately positioned set of objects and events. The illustration below shows the two basic processes that might be used to synchronise events between the different specialised processors in the cerebral cortex and brain in general.

[[Image:Constudsynch.gif]]

In the first option a complete model of sensation, dream etc. may be created and then allowed to become part of conscious experience. In the second model events are released into experience as fast as possible but are synchronous when recalled, having been synchronised in a storage buffer. There is a third option in which there is no synchronisation of events so that the output from different processors would occur at different times.

The 'experience buffer' would be a volume of brain in which a succession of events could be recorded. The buffer might either be updated in steps, the previous content being discarded, or continuously updated with the oldest content being lost continuously.

In the first option events from different processes would always appear to be simultaneous unless the experience buffer were updated as a series of steps in which case any changes at around the moment of updating might appear in successive buffers. For instance, if change of position were processed before change in colour a circle on a screen that changed from green to red at the start of a motion might seem to be briefly green during the motion and then turn red.

In the second model events from different processors might appear asynchronous at the moment of experience but synchronous when recalled.

Colour vision and motion vision are processed in different parts of the visual cortex and in distinct parts of visual cortical areas V1 and V2. They are different processes and hence ideal for studying the synchronisation of cortical activity. Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) presented subjects with moving coloured squares on a computer screen that changed from red to green or vice versa as they changed direction of movement. It was found that subjects seemed to perceive changes in colour some 70-80 msecs before they perceived a change in the direction of motion of the squares. Further work by Arnold ''et al.'' (2001) and Arnold and Clifford (2001) have confirmed that colour changes seem to be perceived before motion. Arnold and Clifford (2001) also found a quantitative relationship between the colour/motion asynchrony and the direction of change of motion, complete reversals of direction giving rise to the greatest asynchrony between the detection of colour and motion changes. 

Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) conclude by stating that the asynchrony of neural processes shows that &quot;..the perception of each attribute is solely the result of the activity in the specialised system involved in its processing..&quot;. It seems more likely that the experiments simply show that slow neural processes are not synchronised before they become percepts (the third option above). The experiments are excellent evidence for the concept of the cortex as a set of specialised processors that deliver their output asynchronously to some other place where the output becomes a percept. 

These experiments on colour and motion suggest that there is no synchronisation between the processes that deal with these two aspects of vision. Another set of experiments by Clifford ''et al.'' (2003) supports this idea of processing being asynchronous. They asked subjects to perform a variety of judgements of when visual events occurred and found that the degree of synchrony of one visual event with another depends on the type of judgement. Different judgements probably use processors in different areas of cortex and the output from these arrives asynchronously at the part of the brain that supports the percept. 

When the percept is formed there must be feedback to the cortical processes that create its content. Otherwise it would not be possible to report about the percept and the cortex would be unable to direct processing to the percept in preference to other, non-conscious cortical data.

Although slow processes (20 milliseconds to 1 second) do not seem to be synchronised there is some evidence for very rapid synchronisation. Andrews ''et al.'' (1996) revisited a problem raised by the famous physiologist Charles Sherrington. Sherrington considered the phenomenon of 'flicker fusion' in which a flickering light appears to be a continuous steady light if it flashes on and off at frequencies of about 45 Hz or higher. He reasoned that if the images from both eyes are brought together to form a single image then the frequency at which a flickering light appears to be steady should depend on whether one or two eyes are used. Flicker fusion should occur if each eye receives alternate flashes at only half the normal flicker fusion frequency. The flicker should disappear if the left eye receives flashes at 23 pulses per second and the right eye receives alternate flashes at 23 pulses per second. When Sherrington performed the experiment he found that this was not the case, using approximate figures, each eye required 46 pulses per second for fusion to occur. Sherrington proposed that the flicker fusion in alternate binocular presentation was occurring &quot;psychically&quot;, outside of normal physiological processes.

Andrews ''et al.'' duplicated Sherrington's result but investigated it further. They found that when lights were flashed in each eye alternately at low frequences (2 Hz) the experience was the same as a light being flashed in both eyes at this rate. At frequencies of four Hz and higher the subjects began to report that the lights being flashed alternately in both eyes seemed to flicker at the same rate as lights being flashed in both eyes at half the frequency. It seemed as if a flash in one eye followed by a flash in the other eye was being perceived as a single flash or &quot;conflated&quot; as the authors put it. The authors explained this effect by suggesting that the brain activity corresponding to the flashes was sampled for a short period and any number of flashes occurring during this period became perceived as a single flash. The maximum rate of sampling would be about 45 Hz. This idea is similar to option (1) above, where the buffer is filled and emptied 40 - 50 times a second. 

An experience buffer that is refreshed at 40-50 times a second might also explain the results obtained with colour and motion asynchrony because synchronisation between processes may well happen too quickly to affect processes that occur at very slow rates. Singer and Gray (1995), Singer (2001) have proposed that synchronisation between neurones at about 45Hz is the discriminator between those neurones with activity that contributes to conscious experience and activity in other neurones. A rapid refresh rate in a sychronising buffer agrees with the results found by Fries ''et al.'' (1997) in which visual cortical neurones that represent a percept underwent synchronous oscillations in the gamma frequency range (39-63 Hz). Tononi ''et al.'' (1998) have also found synchronisation of neural activity in neurones that represent the percept.

The gamma frequency oscillations are intrinsic to the cortex but are triggered by the thalamus and are part of the 'arousal system'.  Readers should be wary of the term 'arousal system' because it evokes the idea of something waking up a conscious cortex.  The cortex can be fully active during sleep and even during pathological unconsciousness such as persistent vegetative state so it is possible that the arousal centres themselves or nearby structures actually host phenomenal consciousness.

==EEG and synchronisation==

If electrodes are placed on the scalp varying electrical potentials of a few tens of microvolts can be recorded between the electrodes. Recordings of potentials from electrodes on the scalp are known as electroencephalograms (EEGs).

The potentials recorded in the EEG are due to postsynaptic potentials in nerve cells. The EEG is insensitive to the activity of single cells and occurs as a result of relatively slow, '''synchronised''', changes in large areas of cells.  The differences in potential between two scalp electrodes are largely due to depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of the dendritic trees of cortical pyramidal cells. The folding of the cortex (gyri) is problematical for recording and interpreting EEGs because opposing layers of cortex can cancel any net potentials.

The EEG shows rhythmic activity.  This is conventionally divided into the following frequency bands:

Delta waves 0-4 Hz

Theta waves 4-8 Hz

Alpha waves 8-12 Hz

Beta waves &gt;10 Hz

Gamma waves (also called fast beta) 25-100 Hz

EEGs also contain short bursts of activity called spindles and very fast oscillations (VFOs). Spindles last for 1-2 seconds and contain rhythmic activity at 7-14 Hz. They are associated with the onset of sleep. The VFOs consist of short bursts at frequencies of over 80 Hz.

When the eyes are closed the amplitude of activity from most pairs of electrodes is increased compared with when the eyes are open.  When subjects are awake the EEG consists mainly of alpha and beta activity with considerable low amplitude gamma when the eyes are open. In stage 1 sleep the EEG consists of theta waves, in stage 2 sleep of varied activity and spindles, in stage 4 sleep of delta and during REM sleep of beta and theta activity. In epileptic seizures there tends to be high amplitude activity with pronounced synchronisation between many pairs of electrodes.

The rhythmic electrical activity is due to cortical feedback loops, cortico-cortical synchronisation, thalamic pacemakers and thalamo-cortical synchronisation. VFOs have been attributed to the activity of electrical connections between cells (dendro-dendritic gap junctions) (Traub (2003)).

The gamma activity, centred on a frequency of 40 Hz appears to be related to activity in cortical interneurons that form electrical connections between their dendrites  (Tamas ''et al.'' 2000).  These oscillations can be triggered by high frequency stimulation of the posterior intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus  (Barth and MacDonald 1996, Sukov and Barth 2001)  and as a result of activation of the reticular system (Munk ''et al.'' 1996).  This suggests that stimulation of cortex by thalamic sensory relays triggers gamma band activity in the cortex. A shift from gamma to beta waves can occur in human event related potentials after about 0.2 secs (Pantev 1995, Traub ''et al.'' 1999).

The alpha activity is related to thalamic pacemakers, perhaps as a result of intrinsic oscillatory activity in thalamic sensory relays (see Roy &amp; Prichep 2005 for a brief review). Theta activity, which occurs during some cognitive tasks and mental arithmetic involves a loop from the cortex to the non-specific thalamic nuclei. Delta activity seems to be endogenous to cortex when input is suppressed during sleep. Beta activity is due to cortico-cortical interactions, often after a brief period of gamma activation. It should be noted that gamma and beta activity can be expressed as impulses in cortico-thalamic pathways and that when cortical and thalamic activity is correlated there is a conscious state. In other words gamma or beta waves in the cortex are not correlates of consciousness on their own - see for instance Laureys ''et al.'' (2002).

==Event related potentials==

After a sudden event there are a characteristic set of changes in EEG activity known as '''event related potentials''' or ERPs. The time course of the ERP is shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:constudevent.gif]]

ERPs occur in response to novel stimuli and are also produced by brief transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)(Iramina ''et al.'' 2002). The slow component is known as the P3 or P300 phase of the ERP. It is due to activation of areas of the brain that are relatively remote from the primary sensory areas of brain. 

Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) have reviewed the origin of the P300 ERP: &quot;To summarize, convergent evidence suggests that P3-like activity can be recorded in several, widely separated brain areas. These include some medial temporal and subcortical structures (e.g., the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and thalamus), but these structures are unlikely to contribute directly to the scalp-recorded P3.&quot;. According to Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) the recorded P300 may be due to temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortical activity. Linden (2005) has also concluded that widespread, but specific, cortical activation is correlated with the recorded P300 ERP.

The generator of the P300 is still obscure. Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) consider that the Locus coeruleus, a nucleus in the pons that regulates task related attention and part of the sleep-wake cycle, may be responsible. In line with this, Mashour ''et al.'' (2005) have discovered that TMS induced P300 activity is reduced in unconscious states. 

Whether the P300 is related to Libet's 0.5 second delay is still obscure but the discovery that the P300 occurs in association with subliminal stimuli (stimuli that do not enter awareness)(Bernat ''et al.'' 2001) suggests that it is associated with non-conscious cortical processing. Williams ''et al.'' (2004), in an investigation of subliminal and supraliminal fear perception, found that &quot;conscious fear perception was distinguished by a more prominent N4, peaking around 400 msec&quot;; the N4 component follows the P300 component in the succession of phases of the ERP. Williams ''et al.'' considered that the earlier phases in the ERP are probably related to non-conscious processing. In contrast Vogel ''et al.'' (1998) found that suppression of the P300 was associated with suppression of awareness.

==The integration delay==

Psychological experiments often involve binary decisions where subjects give one of two outputs in response to stimuli.  It is found that if the stimuli are made increasingly noisy or complex the response time tends to increase. Psychophyicists have developed various mathematical models to explain the increased response times due to noise such as the Integrator and Accumulator models (cf: Luce(1986)). These models have been fairly successful when explaining experiments such as judging the net direction of movement of sets of dots on a screen when the dots are given semi-random paths and different brightness etc. In these circumstances it can take up to 2 seconds for an accurate decision.

There are many tasks however where the accuracy of decision making does not improve after about 300 milliseconds. The accuracy of the performance of rats when choosing between two alternatives when reacting to odours peaks at about 300 ms (Uchida and Mainen(2003), Abraham ''et al.'' (2004)). The accuracy of humans when performing vernier acuity tasks, line detection, contrast sensitivity, motion velocity discrimination and stereoscopic depth discrimination seems to peak at 300ms (Uchida ''et al.'' 2006).

Uchida, Kepecs and Mainen (2006) suggest that &quot;rapid and short integration time is a sensible strategy for rapid processing of low-level sensory information in order to form more complex sensory images, both in vision and olfaction.&quot;  Whether these authors regard these derived sensory images as the content of consciousness is not mentioned. The authors propose that the 300ms optimal integration time may be partly due to the mechanics of sniffing (a sniff takes about 125-200ms) and the nature of optical fixation (inter-saccade intervals are typically 200-400 ms ). The authors note that the animal or human could, in principle, choose to integrate over longer intervals but if it is moving this may not lead to information that is current for changed circumstances.

An optimal processing time of about 300 ms would be consistent with the delays observed before conscious awareness occurs in response to a stimulus - an interval required to form &quot;more complex sensory images&quot;.

==Global Workspace Theory==

Global Workspace Theory is the idea that somewhere in the brain there is a facility that integrates the processes that occur in the various separate areas of the brain.  The theory was first proposed by Descartes as the ''sensus communis'', the common sense, but the modern form of the theory dispenses with the idea of a point soul looking at the brain. In modern Global Workspace theory it is proposed that an area of brain receives input from most of the cerebral cortex and broadcasts its outputs to all of the unconscious modular information processors in the brain.

Modern Global Workspace Theory has been championed by Baars (1983, 1988).

There is increasing evidence for a Global Workspace or Global Workspaces in the brain. Much of this evidence comes from fMRI, single unit and magnetoencephalography studies in which it is shown that non-conscious or subliminal processing mainly occupies primary, sensory cortex whereas conscious processing occupies large areas of cerbral cortex.

In binocular rivalry the stimulus that is consciously perceived is responsible for relatively intense activation of large areas of brain whereas the non-conscious stimulus is often suppressed (see above and Sheinberg &amp; Logothetis (1997), Tononi ''et al.'' (1998)). The suppression is likely to occur in the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei which suggests a role for the Thalamic Reticular Nuclei, which modulate LGN activity, in the control of the percept. 

===Masking and visual awareness===

Word masking has also been used to investigate the idea of a Global Workspace. When a word is presented on its own for a few tens of milliseconds it remains readable but if it is immediately succeeded by, or accompanied by, another word it becomes indistinct or invisible. This effect is known as &quot;word masking&quot;. Vogel ''et al.'' (1998) have investigated a version of word masking known as the &quot;attentional blink&quot;. They found that when stimuli became invisible the P3 component of the Event Related Potential, which peaks at around 300-500 millisecs after a stimulus, was completely suppressed. The P3 component of the ERP has been related to the lodging of data in working memory and also to gamma band activity in the EEG.  This strongly suggests the involvement of a cortico-thalamic loop in the &quot;attentional blink&quot;. The delay of 0.3 to 0.5 secs is typical of the time required for conscious awareness (see above).

Word masking in conjunction with fMRI and Event Related Potential (ERP) recordings has been used by Dehaene ''et al.'' (2001) to expose control by a central mechanism.  It was found that masked words activate mainly the visual cortex and ventral stream (inferior temporal lobe) whereas visible words also activated distant parietal, prefrontal and cingulate sites.

Dehaene ''et al.'' (2003)  and found that the dynamics of the loss of visibility of words in an attentional blink experiment could be modelled by a simulated cortico-thalamic loop. In their simulation a distributed cortical process determined which events would receive attention and the system used the thalamic gating systems to exclude those that did not receive attention. 

Tse ''et al.'' (2005) have used purely visual stimuli in masking experiments and concluded that, in the case of purely visual stimuli, the neural correlates of awareness were limited to the occipital cortex:

&quot;We suggest that there are both lower and upper bounds within the visual hierarchy for the processing of visual masking and the maintenance of visual awareness of simple unattended targets; the lower bound is at least as high as the border between V2 and V3, and the upper bound is within the occipital lobe, possibly somewhere downstream of V4.&quot;

This discovery would mean that activation of large areas of cortex are unnecessary for awareness.

Melloni ''et al.'' (2007) compared compared the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and
unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceivedinduced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the  event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillationsbefore the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the
critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the earlytransient global increase of phase synchrony of scillatory activity in the gammafrequency.

===Attention and the global workspace===

Baars (2002) in his review of evidence for the Global Workspace Theory quotes many other experiments that show activation of larger areas of cortex in response to conscious stimuli compared with unconscious or subliminal stimuli.The effect is also seen in change blindness, learning and attention.  Newman and Baars (1993) consider that the &quot;workspace&quot; is fairly global in the brain: 

&quot;This Neural Global Workspace (NGW) model views conscious processes in terms of a globally integrative brain system. The neural circuitry contributing to this system is not only widely distributed across the neocortex, but includes key corticothalamic and midbrain circuits as well. These cortico-subcortical circuits are hypothesized to be critical to understanding the mechanisms of attentional control that provide an essential basis for the conscious processing of information&quot;. 

However they focus particularly on the role of the thalamic Reticular Nucleus and cortico-thalamic connectivity in the control of attention.

Other ideas for the location of the Global Workspace are the idea of Singer et al. that gamma synchrony controls access to the content of consciousness and  Llinas et al. (1998) that the thalamus is the hub through which communication occurs between areas of cortex.

One of the problems with Global Workspace theory is that it suggests that attention, working memory, cognitive control and consciousness may all be in the same area of the brain.  It is likely that the mechanisms of attention, working memory, and cognitive control may involve several, interlinked systems perhaps co-opting the basal ganglia in the process. In view of this Maia and Cleeremans (2005) propose that &quot;.. attention, working memory, cognitive control and consciousness are not distinct functions implemented by separate brain systems. Attempting to find separate neural correlates for each may therefore be the wrong approach. Instead, we suggest that they should be understood in terms of the dynamics of global competition, with biasing from PFC (prefrontal cortex).&quot;.  The inclusion by Maia and Cleeremans of consciousness with distributed attention, working memory and cognitive control is reminiscent of Zeki &amp; Bartel's idea of microconsciousness.

It should be noted that, in common with Libet's data, the percept seems to be available to phenomenal consciousness some 0.3 to 0.5 secs after a stimulus; this suggests that whatever determines the content of phenomenal consciousness operates before events become part of phenomenal consciousness. This relegates phenomenal consciousness from being a controller of attention to being the recipient of content that is the subject of attention.  This finding is consistent with the philosophical problem of the '''apparently''' epiphenomenal nature of phenomenal consciousness. 

Given the data on the timing of conscious awareness it seems that there may be two &quot;workspaces&quot;, an active workspace that models the world, discarding and suppressing data during rivalry, and a passive workspace that receives the final, edited product. The active workspace would correlate with the cortical systems stressed by Dehaene ''et al.'' and Maia and Cleermans although, given the results of Tse et al., the workspace would be limited to small zones of cortex.  The loading of the passive workspace with the output of the active workspace would correlate with thalamo-cortical activity during component P3 of the ERP in which data is transferred from the cortex to the thalamus. This workspace might constitute the source for reports of the content of phenomenal consciousness. 

Llinas ''et al.'' (1998) have proposed two parallel cortico-thalamic attentional systems, one of which is related to the thalamic specific nuclei and the other to the thalamic non-specific nuclei, especially the ILN. The non-specific system would be related to consciousness itself.

==The &quot;cognitive map&quot; and the neural basis of perceptual space==

Our bodies appear to be mobile within a constant space. We walk around a room; the room does not rotate around us. The constancy of the location of things gives us the feeling that we are directly viewing a constant world. But how does the brain provide a constant world rather than a world that rotates with the movement of the sense organs? Why is our view of the world when we move our eyes so different from the disturbing flow of images that occur when a video camera is waved around? Do our brains contain a constant &quot;cognitive map&quot; (O'Keefe and Nadel 1978) of our surroundings?

Mittelstaedt &amp; Mittelstaedt (1980, 1982) discovered that female gerbils were able to recover their pups in darkened surroundings by searching in a semi random fashion on the outbound journey and then proceeding directly back to the nest on the inbound journey. The direct journey back to the nest seemed to be due to an integration of the various directions taken on the outward journey ('''path integration'''). If the equipment being explored by the mother gerbil was rotated very slowly the mother would make an error equivalent to the amount of rotation. More rapid rotations that activated the vestibular system of the rat (acceleration measurement) did not cause errors in navigation. This demonstration that rodents could navigate accurately on the basis of '''idiothetic''' cues (cues that are due to internal senses) led to research on the neural basis of the navigation. 

As early as 1971 O'Keefe and Dostrovsky had discovered that there are particular cells in the hippocampus that fire according to the position of an animal in the environment. This has been complimented by research that showed that changes in visual cues within the environment caused changes in the firing rate of place cells in hippocampal area CA3 (.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theories of Consciousness==
Some recent scientific theories of consciousness are tabulated below. The extent to which they account for the phenomenon of consciousness is shown.

It is remarkable that many of the theories are consistent with one another.  As in the tale of the 'blind men and the elephant' some of the theories seem to describe the trunk, some the tail etc. but they all seem to be part of the same elephant! The convergence of the theories is shown in the illustration below:

== CONVERSION ==

A solar cell converts light directly into electricity using the “Photovoltaic Effect”.  There is no fuel, steam or thermodynamics involved.  When light hits a solar cell, it instantly produces electricity.  Solar cells today do not store electricity.  In other words, when the light is taken away from the cell, it stops producing electricity.  It is very common to store the electricity from a solar cell in a battery.

You can store electricity generated from a solar panel in a battery such as a typical car battery or you could use a Deep Cycle battery for more storage capacity. Typical car batteries are not recommended for use in solar power systems.  They have a very small range of operating voltage and if discharged too deeply, the battery will be irrepairably damaged.  Deep cycle batteries have a wider operating voltage range and are more suitable for use in solar power systems. If you are using a large solar panel to charge your battery, it would be wise to purchase a charge controller to regulate the current flow.

Once the battery is charged you can connect an inverter to the terminals. Connect the negative terminal first. An inverter will convert the battery's DC current to usable AC current which you can use to power AC appliances.

== AC VS DC ==

AC and DC voltage waveforms.  Alternating Current (AC) is the type of electricity found in the outlet in your home.  DC Direct Current is what you would find in the outlet of your car.  DC electricity is also the type of electricity stored in batteries.  Generators at big power plants use rotating alternators to produce AC electricity while the dynamo found in your bicycle (still a rotating machine) produces DC.   Solar Cells only produce DC electricity and their excess power output is most readily stored in deep cycle batteries.  In order to run most appliances in your home, you will need to use a power inverter which changes the DC voltage to AC.  Invertors range in size from the very small 50 watts all the way up to 5Kw.  You should consider what appliances and equipment you intend to run off your power inverter.  Cheaper power inverters will typically use a square wave output signal to create the AC voltage.  More sensitive equipment such as computers will require pure sine wave outputs.  Pure sine wave power inverters are typically more expensive.

Temperature can be an interesting parameter to measure. The temperature of the surroundings might not be very useful for a mobile robot, the temperature of a motor or battery back is.

==What is temperature?==
&quot;Temperature: A measure proportional to the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic motion of atoms and molecules. The flow of heat is from a high temperature region toward a lower temperature region.&lt;ref&gt;
-Courtesy of the references cited below but mostly based on the operational definition on the HyperPhysics pages at Georgia State University by R. Nave. and the discussion in &quot;Traceable Temperatures&quot; Second Ed. by Nicholas and White-See the discussions and definitions below for our rationale.&quot; Note, the Hyperphysics page is located at: [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/temper.html#c1]
From the page at [About Temperature Sensors entitled &quot;What is Temperature&quot; (http://www.temperatures.com/wit.html) ].
Permission to reproduce this definition has been granted by its author and the webpage copyright holder.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units and their conversions==
The most used units for temperature are Degrees Celsius, Kelvin, and Degrees Fahrenheit .

===Degrees Celsius===
This temperature scale is defined around water. It defines 0°C as the temperature on which water freezes at standard atmospheric pressure. 100°C is defined as the temperature at which water boils.

'''Conversion:''' 
:To Fahrenheit: Tc * 9/5 +32
:To Kelvin: Tc + 273,15

===Kelvin===
Kelvin is a temperature scale with one defined temperature: 0 Kelvin is the lowest possible temperature, which is about -273,15°C. An increase of 1 Kelvin has the same size as an increase of 1°C.&lt;BR&gt;
The Kelvin (note it's not '''degrees''' Kelvin) temperature scale is used in science and engineering, most formulas containing temperature require Kelvin, unless it involves temperature differences, then one can use both Celsius and Kelvin as the difference between 10 and 20 Kelvin and between 10 and 20°Celsius are equal. 

'''Conversion:'''
:To Fahrenheit: Tk *9/5 -459,67
:To Celsius: Tk - 273,15

===Fahrenheit===
This scale uses the lowest temperate that could be measured at the time when this scale was developed and the temperature of the human body. The first temperature is defined as 0°F the latter as 100°F. This places 0°C at 32°F and 100°C at 212°F. A difference of 1°F isn't the same size as a difference of 1°C.

'''Conversion:'''
:To Kelvin: (Tf + 459,67) * 5/9
:To Celsius: (Tf - 32) * 5/9

==Methods of measuring temperatures==

===Non-electric methods===
''Are any of these non-electric methods useful for robotics?''

The old fashioned way to measure temperature uses the expansion of mercury in a glass capillary tube. Newer thermometers use other liquids like alcohol.
Other methods use two thin metal strips with different thermal expansion rates fused together and are called bimetal or bimetallic.

Yet another way uses the expansion of gas or liquid or a gas-liquid combination in a closed metal capillary tube system, called gas thermometers and filled systems.
Other ways use the change of phase of some materials, such as paints and pastes whereby their reflectivity or color changes permanently when a specific temperature is reached. These are often called temperature or thermal paints and labels.

Another method uses the variation in reflectivity of certain liquid crystals with temperature.
One of the original thermometers, named after Galileo, uses several precision weights in labeled small glass globes, of known volume, all placed in a vertical cylinder of liquid like water, sufficient in size to allow all the globes to fit and with sufficient width to enable the globes to move freely past one another. As the temperature of the assembly changes, the density of the water changes and the globes assume differing heights in the cylinder according to their density with the globe in the highest position indicating the temperature to be at or below its labeled value.&lt;p&gt;

===Electric or thermoelectric methods===
====Thermocouples====
Thermocouples consist of a pair of wires of different metals connected together at both ends and insulated but kept thermally close to each other over their length. When they encounter a temperature gradient form one end to the other, an electrical current flows through the circuit due to the Seebeck Effect. If one of the wires is opened and the voltage between the open ends is measured with a suitably high impedance voltmeter, a voltage nearly equal to the average relative Seebeck coefficient times the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends will be measured.

Thermoelectric properties of many material combinations have been developed over the past hundred years or so and also have been standardized for several of them, more commonly known by their ISA letter designations, as standard. Their electrical outputs for cold end reference temperature at 32 Deg F and 0 deg C are widely published in ASTM Standard E230. Many sources on the web provide these tabular values including the National Institute for Science &amp; Technology (NIST) in the USA.

====Temperature sensitive resistors====
Many electrically conductive materials have a resistance that varies with temperature -- they are temperature sensitive resistors.

There are two generic types of temperature sensitive resistors: Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) devices and Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) devices.

Usually the PTC devices, if made of metal, are termed Resistance Temperature Detectors or RTDs. Ones made from other materials are usually called Thermistors, short for Thermal Resistors.

RTDs are a highly developed technology worldwide and several international standards exist for the most widely used type, those made of pure Platinum. They are usually called Platinum Resistance Thermometers, or simple PRTs. Very special PRTs are used as interpolating devices in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), these and similar devices sold commercially are often known as Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers, or SPRTs.

Tables for the most commonly used RTD materials, Platinum, Nickel and Copper, can be found in several International and national standards as well as many locations on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.temperatures.com/rtds.html &quot;Temperatures.com: Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs)&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermistors are also very highly developed, but there are no uniform standards for their properties. Each supplier makes their own products and provide their own calibration tables. Some of these tables have been cataloged on the measurement database website.&lt;ref&gt;
http://measurementdb.com/
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular thermistors are manufactured using material with a B of 3300 K or a material with a B of 5133 K or some other material with an intermediate value.

Independent of the material, most thermistors are manufactured such that the resistance at room temperature (298.15 K = 25 °C) is one of these [[Wikipedia: preferred value| preferred value]]s: 1 k&amp;Omega;, 2 k&amp;Omega;, 5 k&amp;Omega;, 10 k&amp;Omega;, 20 k&amp;Omega;, 50 k&amp;Omega;, 100 k&amp;Omega;, 200 k&amp;Omega;, 500 k&amp;Omega;, 1 M&amp;Omega;.

* [[PBASIC Programming/RCTIME]] and [http://reprap.org/wiki/ExtruderIO &quot;RepRap: ExtruderIO&quot; ] have more details on measuring the RC time constant of a capacitor + thermistor circuit; then from that time calculating the temperature.
* [[Embedded Systems/Low-Voltage Circuits]] and [http://reprap.org/wiki/thermistor &quot;RepRap: Thermistor&quot;] have more details on measuring the output voltage of a &quot;resistor divider&quot; resistor + thermistor circuit; then from that voltage calculating the temperature.

====Semiconductor====
Semiconductors, such as diodes and transistors have properties that vary greatly with the temperature. This arises from the temperature sensitivity of the bandgap in such devices which is highly repeatable and very stable, especially in Silicon semiconductors. 

Several Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturers, such as Analog Devices, Dallas Semiconductors and National Semiconductors manufacture many variants of the basic diode temperature sensors with additional circuitry to scale the output for use with simple digital display meters.

====Radiation Thermometer &amp; Optical Pyrometer====

The popular ear thermometer and low cost &quot;laser&quot; thermometer of today are variants of the radiation thermometer (pyrometer) that began its development in the 19th Century. The devices are all based on the thermal radiation properties of literally everything in nature, whether it be gas, liquid or solid. The physical processes at work inside all materials includes emission of electromagnetic radiation that is a function of the temperature and optical properties of an object.

The physical emission of thermal radiation was first described correctly by Max Planck in the last year of the 19th Century. His theory led to the quantum revolution in Physics. It has stood the test of time as an accurate and reliable theory of thermal emission of radiation and enables instrument designers to develop instruments that can measure temperature without contacting the object that is being measured with remarkable levels of accuracy and repeatability. There are very few standards for such devices.&lt;ref&gt;The only radiation thermometer standards of which we are aware are described on the webpage: INFRARED RADIATION THERMOMETER and THERMAL IMAGER STANDARDS [http://www.temperatures.com/stds-rts.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to measure pressure is very beneficial to the subject of robotics. The density of the atmosphere changes with altitude. If the air pressure is known then the altitude can then be established.
If the robot contains fluids under pressure (for example, hydraulic systems), pressure sensors can be used to detect faults in the system. Pressure sensors can also be installed in a compressed tank of gas to measure the amount of gas left.

==Measuring Pressure==
                                   
===Analogue Methods===
[[Image:Manometer_104026.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Bourdon gauge]]
A Bourdon gauge uses a coiled tube which causes a rotation of an arm connected to the tube as it expands due to pressure increase. However, this is not particularly useful in Robotics unless you design a way to get voltage to vary with respect to needle displacement.

[[Image:Strain gauge.svg|thumb|Typical foil strain gauge.  The gauge is far more sensitive to strain in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction.  The markings outside the active area help to align the gauge during installation.]]

===Electric Methods===
* Resistive (Strain Gauge) - As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor.  Foil strain gauges are only useful to detect large pressure changes and are not very precise over small changes.

* Capacitive - The deflection of the piston is often one half of a capacitor, so that when the piston moves, the capacitance of the device changes. This is a common way (with proper calibrations) to get a very precise, electronic reading from a manometer, and this configuration is called a capacitive manometer vacuum gauge.

* Piezoelectric/Piezoresistive - For measurements of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, called piezoresistors, are often preferred over foil gauges. A semiconductor gauge usually has a larger gauge factor than a foil gauge. Semiconductor gauges tend to be more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.

      <comment>/* Different dialect of Pascal (Object Pascal) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are going to write a book on Borland Pascal, can you at least mention the fact that it is Borland Pascal ? The first programs I looked at here were not valid Pascal.--[[User:67.180.160.45|67.180.160.45]] 4 July 2005 17:35 (UTC)

Disregarding the date, all of the code looks relatively fine - everything should compile with Free Pascal 2.2.2. [[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 03:18, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

==Um...==
I plan on adding a category regarding Units and I plan to elaborate the 'Getting Started' section with the basic format (program, type, const, var, begin, end.) My experience is limited so I do not understand Units very well - I only have 'Essential Pascal' to rely on as a source. 

Also, I personally do not yet understand the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;Function WindowProc (Window:HWnd;AMessage : UINT; WParam : WParam; LParam:LParam): LResult; stdcall; export;&lt;/source&gt; I presume the export refers to DLL's (which is another subject I'm unfamiliar with.) [[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 07:11, 9 November 2008 (UTC)


==Content==
* Discuss each of the three main compilers more. Provide basic install assistance?
* Beginning: Basic structure, Comments, Code Clarity.
* Variables and Constants: should include data types. Include custom data types?
* External Libraries: DLL's, etc.
* Units: Structure, Usings, Makings.
* Control Structures: Include label..goto?

==Organization==
* Split Syntax from Function/Procedures? Place syntax near the beginning?
* Keep arrays and pointers seperate? Elaborate each.
[[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 12:24, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Different dialect of Pascal (Object Pascal)==
As pascal programming languages are improved beyond its standard, there are different dialect of pascal programming language , Delphi, Free Pascal and GNU Pascal have differences in their implementation. As an example Delphi supports Interfaces () from version 7 and has for each loop from Delphi 2006 and these are not developed in Free pascal or as another example GNU Pascal has some result definition syntax which is not implemented in other pascals. I think it should be mentioned in this book about different dialects and If a specified implementation is going to be used.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Basic_foodstuffs|Basic Foodstuffs]] | [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions|Vegan Substitutions]]

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/2 cup shredded dried [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 very large cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed but not peeled.
* 1 1/2 tbsp. black [[Cookbook:Peppercorn|peppercorns]]

* Extra boiling water as needed

==Procedure==
# Place the seaweed in a pot and add 4 cups of water. 
# Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to keep it bubbling along. 
# Cook for 20 minutes.
# Add the rest of the ingredients and enough water to make about 6 cups total in the pot. 
# Bring back to a boil, then boil fairly high for at least 1/2 hour. 
# At that point, begin to taste (just a little, though--it's strong). 
# When the stock is reduced by about half, it will be almost too salty to eat, and that means it is ready. 
# Strain through fine mesh or a coffee filter and allow to cool.

==Ingredients==
*1 large fish (weighing about 2 lbs/1 kg) 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*2 cups uncooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] 
*1 1/2 cups chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and water 

== Procedure ==
# Fry fish in olive oil until well cooked. Remove the fish and allow to cool.
# Fry the chopped onions in the same oil until well browned. Meanwhile, bone the fried fish, reserving the cooked fillets to be served over the rice. 
# Add the head, bones and skin of the fish to the fried onions and cook with four cups of water in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes, or for a longer time in an open pan. 
# Strain the broth and boil the rice in it using 1-4 cups of broth for each cup of rice (this will depend on the absorbency of the rice you use). 
# Simmer the rice on a low fire so that most of the broth will be absorbed. 

Some of the broth may be flavored with a few drops of lemon and served on the side as a sauce for this dish.

== Introduction ==

== What is a database? ==

A '''[[w:database|database]]''' is a collection of [[w:information|information]] stored in a computer in a systematic way, such that a [[w:computer program|computer program]] can consult it to answer questions. The [[w: software|software]] used to manage and query a database is known as a [[w: database management system|database management system]] (DBMS).

For the purposes of English law, s.3A [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988] defines a database as a collection of independent works, data or other materials which are:
* arranged in a systematic or methodical way, and
* individually accessible by electronic or other means

As such, under English law, a database includes data held electronically and, notably, data held in a non-electronic format, e.g. paper records.

== Legal protection of databases in England &amp; Wales ==

The law in England and Wales recognises the existence of two separate legal rights in databases: (i) '''[[Database_Law#Copyright | copyright]]'''; and (ii) '''[[Database_Law#Database_Right | database right]]'''.

Copyright is available to certain, but not all, databases. The key criteria for determining the availability of copyright to a database is whether the database qualifies as a &quot;literary work&quot;. 

Database right is available to all databases.

== Copyright ==

Copyright in England and Wales is governed by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]. For the purposes of this wikibook this will be referred to as the 1988 Act.

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv1 s.1(1)(a)] of the 1988 Act, copyright is stated to &quot;subsist&quot;, i.e. exist, in &quot;original literary works&quot;.

&quot;Literary works&quot; are defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv3 s.3(1)] of the 1988 Act as being &quot;any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung&quot;. 

Copyright will exist in database if it is sufficiently original; in order to be a literary work, “the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database” must constitute the author's own intellectual creation [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--b.htm#6 s.3A] of the 1988 Act.

===Existence===

Copyright arises automatically in a work that meets the criteria outlined below. There is no need to register copyright in a database with a central organisation.

====Originality====

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv1 s.1(1)(a)] requires the database to be original.
 
&quot;Original&quot; for the purposes of copyright means that the database is the author's own work, i.e. not copied from the work of another party. 

A common misconception is that an idea can be protected by copyright. This is not correct. Copyright protects that expression and form of an idea, not the idea itself. It is equally the originality of the expression and form that matters, not the idea.

====Minimum effort====

A literary work does not require significant effort in order to obtain copyright protection. Any writing will attract copyright, provided it is substantial enough to constitute a work.

====Recorded====

In order to obtain copyright, data must be recorded. The nature of databases is such that this requirement will always be satisfied.

===Ownership===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv11 s.11(1)] of the 1988 Act, initial ownership is owned by the author or co-authors of a database. 

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv11 s.11(2)] of the 1988 Act, if the author of the database is an employee, copyright in the database is owned by his employer. This is subject to the following provisios:

* the database must have been created in the course of the employee's employment
* there must be no agreement to the contrary between the employer and employee, e.g. an agreement granting the employee copyright in the database 

If a database is commissioned, copyright rests with the author, not the person, company or organisation whom commissioned the database. An agreement whereby a third-party is commissioned to create a database should contain a clause providing for assignment or licence of copyright work. In the case of [http://legal.wikicities.com/wiki/Law_reports/197121qb78 Blair v Alan S Tomkins &amp; Anor (1971) 21 QB 78] it was held that in the absence of licence, one will usually be implied. 

Note, in [http://legal.wikicities.com/wiki/Law_reports/2003ewhc2914 R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans (2003) EWHC 2914]. it was held that the party who commissioned a database may be entitled in equity to beneficial title in the database if a mere licence may not give them enough rights to stop the work being used by a rival.

===Duration===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv12 s.12] of the 1988 Act, copyright will protect a database for the life of the author (or employee) plus 70 years.

===Rights===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv16 s.16] of the 1988 Act, copyright provides the owner of a database with the right to prevent another party copying the database. 

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16] equally provides the owner of a copyright with exclusive rights to:

* copy the work (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv17 s.17])
* issue copies of the work to the public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.18])
* rent or lend the work to the public (see s.18A)
* perform, show or play the work in public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv19 s.19])
* to communicate the work to the public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv20 s.20])

===Infringement===

Copyright in a database is infringed if a “substantial part” of the database is copied by another unauthorised party.

The question of what is a substantial part is qualitative.

====Primary infringement====

A party who commits a primary infringement of copyright in a database is liable regardless of state of mind.

Copying can be indirect – i.e. a result of seeing a copy of the original work – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16(3)].

Copyright in a work is infringed by a person who without the licence of the copyright owner does, or authorises another to do, any of the acts restricted by the copyright – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16(2)]

There is a rebuttable presumption of copying if the defendant's work is similar to that of the claimant and the defendant has access to the claimant's work.

====Secondary infringement====

Requires knowledge, or reason to believe, that one is dealing with an infringing copy. 

Copies are made without the copyright owner's permission.

Includes:
* people who import infringing goods – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv22 s.22]
* people who sell infringing goods – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv23 s.23]

===Defences===

Fair dealing: 

*for purposes of research or private study – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.29]
*for purpose of criticism or review – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.30(1)]
*for the purpose of reporting current events – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.30(2)]

===Remedies===

Damages for primary infringement – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv97 s.97]
* Note, this remedy is not available if a defendant did not know and had no reason to believe that the database was copyright

Delivery up for primary infringement – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv99 s.99]

The database owner may seize offending copies of the database – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv100 s.100]. 
* Normally this remedy is only used against street traders as the right excludes business premises. 

An infringing party may face criminal liability for making or dealing with infringing articles – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv107 s.107]

Delivery up of infringing copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv108 s.108] 

Destruction of offending copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv114 s.114]

Order preventing importation of infringing copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv111 s.111]

== Database Right ==

[[w: Database right | Database right]] is a ''[[w: sui generis | sui generis]]'' right that has provided protection for databases in England and Wales since 1997. 

Prior to 1997 the view in England and Wales was that databases were adequately protected by copyright (see previous). This conflicted with the wider view in continental Europe that databases were functional documents, not literary works, and as such could not be protected by copyright.

The European Union passed [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0009:EN:HTML Council Directive 96/9/EC on the Legal Protection of Databases] ('the Database Directive') in order to standardise the legal protection provided to databases across the EU.

In England and Wales, the Database Directive was implemented by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19973032.htm Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 SI 1997/3032] ('the 1997 Regulations'). The 1997 Regulations amended the 1988 Act to limit the extent to which copyright applies to databases (s.3A).  

===Existence===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#13 Reg.13] of the 1997 Regulations, database right subsists in a database if &quot;there has been a substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of the database&quot;.

In order to qualify for database right in English law, one or more of the creators of the database must reside in the [[w: European Economic Area | EEA]], see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#18 Reg.18].

Like copyright, database right will arise automatically in databases that meet the criteria provided Regs.13 and 18. The creator of a database right does not need to register the right with a central body.
 
===Ownership===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#15 Reg.15] of the 1997 Regulations, the ''maker'' of the database is the first owner of it.

The ''maker'' is defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#14 Reg.14(1)] of the 1997 Regulations as &quot;the person who takes the initiative in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of a database and assumes the risk of investing in that obtaining, verification or presentation shall be regarded as the maker of, and as having made, the database&quot;.

Regulation 14(2) provides a caveat that &quot;where a database is made by an employee in the course of his employment, his employer shall be regarded as the maker of the database, subject to any agreement to the contrary&quot;. This is similar to the position with copyright.

===Duration===

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#17 Regulation 17(1)] of the 1997 Regulations provides that &quot;database right in a database expires at the end of the period of fifteen years from the end of the calendar year in which the making of the database was completed&quot;.

Regulation 17(3) provides further that &quot;any substantial change to the contents of a database, including a substantial change resulting from the accumulation of successive additions, deletions or alterations, which would result in the database being considered to be a substantial new investment shall qualify the database resulting from that investment for its own term of protection&quot;.

In effect, it is possible for databases that are updated regularly to obtain indefinite rolling protection from database right, i.e. every updated version of the database obtains 15 years protection.

===Rights===

Database right gives the owner the right to prevent copying and unauthorised use of the database.

===Infringement===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#16 Reg.16(1)] of the 1997 Regulations, &quot;a person infringes database right in a database if, without the consent of the owner of the right, he ''extracts'' or ''re-utilises'' all or a ''substantial'' part of the contents of the database&quot;.

Extraction, re-utilisation and substantial are defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#12 Reg.12].

''Extraction'' is defined as &quot;the permanent or temporary transfer of [the] contents [of the database] to another medium by any means or in any form&quot;.

''Re-utilisation'' is defined as &quot;making [the] contents [of the database] available to the public by any means&quot;.

''Substantial'' is defined &quot;in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both&quot;.

Regulation 16(2) further provides that &quot;the repeated and systematic extraction or re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the contents of a database may amount to the extraction or re-utilisation of a substantial part of those contents&quot;.

===Defences===

Fair dealing - [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#20 Reg.20] of the 1997 Regulations:

* extraction by a lawful user - Reg.20(1)(a)
* extraction for purpose of illustration or teaching or for a non-commercial purpose - Reg.20(1)(b)
* the source is indicated - Reg.20(1)(c)

Regulation 20(2) provides further exceptions to database right for public administration. These are detailed in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--e.htm Schedule 1] of the 1997 Regulations.

== Re: Comfortable Words ==

I haven't even finished the page with the link back to {{Christianity]] the Wikibook I am spearheading and you already put it up for Speedy Deletion, what gives? [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 20:18 (UTC)
:If it's not a book in its own right, but a subpage of an existing book, it should either be named &lt;code&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/code&gt; in accordance with [[Wikibooks:Naming_conventions]]. Otherwise, how is a user subsequently going to be able to write a book entitled &quot;Comfortable Words&quot;. Please don't pollute the main namespace, it's bad enough already, but people are slowing converting older books to more recent conventions. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 20:31 (UTC)

:Update: Also note that using the &lt;code&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/code&gt; convention will automatically add a link to the subpage which leads back to the main book. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 20:34 (UTC)

Sorry, then it's an issue of non-conformity. If I try subpage [[Christianity/The Comfortable Words]] then you delete the other, is that preferable.

Saw your vote on John 2, thanks. I will redirect all pages to Christianity/... That was the problem and this is the solution, I think. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 21:05 (UTC)

:Update: I've moved all the offending pages, and updated the links on the [[Christianity|main page]]. I'll note it in [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 21:47 (UTC)

Thank you again, when I got back to it, you did all the work. The move function, not redirect, worked for a remaining page [[Palestine map]] and now I understand the naming convention. What a switch, to say, you may have saved Christianity (the book).

Update as of September 5 &amp;#8722; Christianity: The Book became The Appendix as calmer influences have the last word. Others may talk til they are green in the face.

==Finalized==
Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* God so loved the world.
* Start with only a few versions of the Bible, various household references, some ancient manuscripts now available on the Internet and a Wikipedia link. So, begin a new translation with no preconceived notions. The progression is steady just like the early church, in fact parallel. Aramaic and its oral tradition are the backbone. Evidence, the earliest persecutions by Saul of Tarsus were in Damascus, they spoke Aramaic. The Syrian tradition spreads to Egypt, Modernity picks up the earliest Coptic Gospel of John on papyrus which may have come from a trilingual. To ''Koin'' a phrase, early Christianity is to Greek as Shakespeare is to English, making Greek the expansive written language of choice, but something must be said for Latin which would emanate from Caesarea early on. Thus Modernity speaks through Codex D or Bezae of the bilingual Greek-Latin, which some (incl. F.H. Chase) have called Western Syro-Latin text. The introductory Latin Word Picture comes in v. 20 where something was hidden from the light, ironic. The exemplar for the Sub-Achmimic Coptic version would have been 2nd century and for the Codex D, probably 3rd century. Evidence, the Coptic Codex Q (Qua) incorporating the Greek alphabet omits Eccehomo of John 19, but Codex D and Codex B include it, a Latin addition.
::Reference: ''The Gospel of John According to the Earliest Coptic Manuscript'' and Translation by Sir Herbert Thompson, British School of Archaeology in Egypt and Egyptian Research Account. 1923. (Introductory Conclusion, pp. 28-30).
* The conversion of Cephas in Chapter 1 to a tiny wikified image of the screenshot Aramaic rather than ISO numbers which were read differently in different browsers, opened the door to small inline facsimiles of phrasing from ancient manuscripts, a unique placement of Coptic and Latin with the enlargement and more information behind the image link. 
* Something about the laborious method proscribed to recording the Greek Word Pictures and weighing the possibilities for that concise spacing redeems the effort, deepening the thought process. The wordplay seems inevitable.
* Would it be presumptuous to say, if the translator emulates the early church and writes the Word, that such a person becomes possessed and God takes over, setting the rules. Yeshua (Ezra 3: 8) is the simplest Aramism and the name by which the early church would remember Jesus. Every chapter could mention Yeshua in the margin at least once beginning with Chapter 5, only taking liberties in Chapter 15, following the lead of Chapter 1 verse 12 by substituting “name of Jesus” for “name.” This allows the column heading Aramism to stand as a logical extension even when one Latin phrase is cited per chapter, thus bringing to bear the nomina sacra and monumental Latin like pastor for shepherd, paracletus for Comforter, proverbus for figure of speech, yet, confirming the language of Rome plays a minor part overall. Messiah remains the most elevated term, see Chapter 1 and 4 for the only mention of the original word in the N.T. “The Christ” alone is described everywhere else as the Messiah, an Aramism.
* The transition from Latin to Old English is a natural, thus the transition of Iesous from Greek to Latin to O.E. to English reaches an interesting juncture in Chapter 4. Jesus had foreign relations. Modernity opts for universal language at that point. The Coptic version only starts in Chapter 2, first viable sacred name is a preview in 3: 10, unavoidably (the abbreviation &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;IHC&lt;/span&gt; represents the unpronounceable name of God already) this shows a mixture of Greek and English translation, an awkward moment, but one of the earliest examples of superlineation and an Aramism of redundant verbage, all in three words, altogether fascinating since the Greek would have required four words adding '''&amp;kappa;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;''' in between. Latin makes it easier, Codex D starts at John 3: 16, first viable sacred name John 4: 1. The last leaves or pages in both codices are missing bringing the Latin phrases to a dramatic conclusion in Chapter 20 and 21, even more so the Aramaic in Chapter 20.
* Gender issue, double entendre in v. 6 comment. Issue, whether to pursue gender neutral at all? Why tick some people off, because the clock has been ticking long enough and, God willing, the time may have arrived. Issue (meaning, definition number 30 in the Random House, offspring), the birth itself is to issue forth and all human offspring are the bodily issue of a woman. The alternative, flesh, is only skin deep, yet beauty is … This too, a mind, body, and spirit exercise as in v. 9. If the process becomes at all cumbersome then a retraction can be issued. She/he designation (v. 5) is not appropriate for these times, but see nothing wrong with an occasional his/her. The Wikipedia article on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Revised_Standard_Version NRSV] is of interest, commenting:
:''Gender-inclusive language does represent a change from the traditional translations, however, in many cases, the original language, Koine Greek, is gender ambiguous. For example, adelphoi, can be translated as either &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot;''&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bonding==
Dogs are social animals; they live in packs. They will, very soon after you bring them into your home, regard your family as their pack.  This trait is what makes it so easy to train a dog.  

Instinct makes dogs defer to the leader of the pack. This does not mean that they fear the leader, but that they ''respect'' and /or ''love'' him/her.  And it is so much easier for all concerned if that respect and love is reciprocated.

It is cruel to isolate a dog from the pack.  A dog that is tied on a leash (or a chain) in a yard all day long is an abused dog, and he will soon exhibit behavioral problems.  The same is true of a dog that is left in an apartment all day, while its master is at work. If you can't provide comapanionship to a dog, how can you get companionship from him?  If you must leave the dog during the day you should have one or two other animals to keep him comapany.  And they must have adequate space to attend to their needs.

Remember that your dog is a person too, although of a different species.

==Training==
It is perhaps not too extreme to say that every dog needs a job, and that if you don't give him one he will invent one of his own, and you might not like the job he chooses.  So it is essential that your dog must be trained.  He will enjoy doing the jobs you give him, no matter how small or large.  And you will be proud of him.  

You should start with simple things and very gradually progress to more complicated ones.  

Dogs, like people, have varying degrees of ability and varying likes and dislikes.  Some dogs love to swim all day long, others will not even let their feet get wet, though all dogs ''can'' swim if they must.  It is almost as cruel to try to have a dog do something he really doesn't like as it is to lock him in a dark room all day.  And throwing or pushing a dog into the water (for example), in an effort to teach him to swim, will only make him hate water all the more.

===Communication===
Most of the effort in training a dog is spent in communication.  He ''and'' you must learn each other's language to some extent.  Shouting at him will '''''not''''' make him understand you any better.  It will, however, hurt his feelings until he learns that it just your meaningless way of barking, and learns to ignore it.

He will, however, understand your '''''tone''''' of voice almost immediately, so, if you want to tell him &quot;no&quot;, do it in a deep, growl-like way, and if he does the right thing, be happy about it, and tell him so.  But his hearing is very keen, and you can almost whisper.

===Focus===
When you are training your dog, especially if it is something new, you must not allow yourself or him to become distracted.  If something comes up that you '''''must''''' deal with it is better to drop the training entirely, and take it up at a later time.

===How to start===
====First Lessons====
If you have a new puppy, you will want to house-break it as soon as possible.  This can be a very easy process.  The very best way is to teach the puppy to urinate and/or defecate on command.  Don't despair, it is '''''easy'''''.</text>

'''Spinal radiosurgery''' is the one or a few fractions and high doses per fraction for primary or metastatic tumors involving a vertebral body with close proximity to the spinal cord.  It is often used in a site of prior irradiation, so IMRT can be used to limit the dose to the cord.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Robotics#Design Basics|Robotics]]: Design Basics: '''Mechanical Components'''

== Gears ==

Gears are mechanical parts with cut teeth designed to mesh with teeth on another part so as to transmit or receive force and motion. The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs.
In Robotics Gears are used to transfer rotational forces between axles. They can change speed and direction. The axles can stand in any orientation, however not all orientation can be done with 2 gears. Commonly gears are used to reduce the speed of a motor. When they reduce the speed, the torque of the output axle increases.

Common types of gears as used in Robots are explored below. 
Each type of gear is used for different purposes and it has both advantages and disadvantages.

See [[w:Gear|this Wikipedia article]] on gears. This page will cover how each gear is used specifically in robotics.

=== Spur gear ===
[[image:gears_large.jpg|thumb|200px|Spur gears found on a piece of farm equipment]]
Spur gears are the best known gears. These are the simplest form of gears and are commonly used in light machines as bikes, mixers, etc,...&lt;BR&gt;
They aren't used in cars as they are very noisy and their design puts a lot of stress on the teeth.

You might use them to transfer rotation from a motor output shaft (coming directly from the motor or from the gear box) to the axle on which the wheels are attached. This poses a limitation: the motor output axle and the wheel axle have to be parallel.

=== Bevelled gear ===
Bevelled gears are used when you wish to transfer work between two perpendicular shafts that are on the same plane (if the axles were to be extended they would hit). They can have straight, spiral or hypoid teeth.

=== Worm Gear ===
This is a gear that resembles a screw, with parallel helical teeth, and mates with a normal spur gear. The worm is in most cases the driving gear, there are however a few exceptions where the spur gear drives the worm. The worm gear can achieve a higher gear ratio than spur gears of a comparable size. Designed properly, a built in safety feature can be obtained: This gear style will self-lock if power is lost to the drive (worm) however this feature doesn't work if the pinion is powered.
[[Image:Worm Gear and Pinion.jpg|thumb|200px|An Example of a Worm Gear and Pinion]]

===Rack and Pinion===

Torque can be converted to linear force by a rack and pinion. The pinion is a spur gear, and meshes with a toothed bar or rod that can be thought of as a sector gear with an infinitely large radius of curvature. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s).

==Internal gear==

==Chains &amp; Belts==

Chains and belts can be used to transfer rotational motion over a longer distance. The main difference between the two, lays in the fact that a belt can slip. This is not necessarily a bad thing as slipping occurs when the output shaft carries a load that is too heavy. In this case the belt slips instead of the motor being stalled. This protects the motor as it could otherwise be damaged by the stall current.&lt;BR&gt;
The disadvantage of belts is that since it can slip, the amount of rotation  doesn't remain the same, e.g., the input axle may turn 4 times, while the output axle may turn only 3.8 times. This should be taken into account if the position of the output axle is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Video components split up in 2 categories. On one hand you have a video camera, some form of transmission (wire or radio) and a display. On the other hand you have computer vision.

==Camera, transmission, display==
There are very small cameras, some even with built in wireless connection, which are cheap and need hardly any external components. These cameras can be mounted on a robot and let the user see through the robots &quot;eyes&quot;.

If the robot has an on-board computer (single board or laptop) a webcam can be used. This allows robot control over a network or even the internet.

==Computer Vision==
Computer vision is a relatively new area. It tries to provide a computer with eyes and the ability to &quot;understand&quot; what it sees. The first step is easy. Webcams have been around for quite some time. However the second step, understanding the image, is the hard one.

{{AltBookCat}}

Image processing plays a substantial part in robotics where computer vision is used.  There are many aspects to image processing including: demosaicing, image registration, differencing, recognition and segmentation.

==Demosaicing==
Demosaicing is perhaps the first step in image processing as it pertains to computer vision due to the fact that this process occurs just after the image is initially captured.  In general, demosaicing is an algorithm that takes the image after being processed by a color filter array (CFA), such as a Bayer filter, and reconstructs a full color image.  The image shown on the left is the output from the CFA and the image on the right shows the reconstructed image using the demosaicing algorithm.  The result is an overall loss in detail and sharpness leading to a loss in resolution.

==Image Registration==
Image registration is the process used to combine multiple images into a single coordinate system.  Combining images into a single coordinate system makes it easier to process the data contained in images taken at different times or from different perspectives.  There are two main types of image registration based on how the images are combined into a single coordinate system.  The first of which is intensity based, which uses correlation metrics to compare intensity patterns within the images to combine them.  The other method is feature based, which uses points, lines and contours within the images to combine the images.  Image registration has also been used in the realm of digital photography with the process of photo-stitching.

==Image Differencing==
Image differencing is used to obtain the changes between two images and is done by comparing the images pixel by pixel.
A typical application of image differencing is with a traffic camera that needs to determine where cars are located
in an image.  By taking an image and finding the difference between it and the frame before it, the result is an image
similar to the one shown where the outlines of the vehicles are neatly shown.  The problem with this method
is that there is a gap between the images in where the car is located.  To solve this problem,
taking the difference between the current image and a stock image that was taken when no cars were present gives a much clearer image depicted where the cars are located.

==Image Recognition==
The process of image recognition is difficult to pull off in the realm of computer vision.  Nothing comes close to what a human can accomplish, but robots can do simpler tasks.  Some of the simpler tasks that can be accomplished within computer vision are recognizing simple geometric shapes, human faces and fingerprints.
Different aspects of the problems involved with image recognition include: object recognition, identification
and detection.  An implementation of image recognition is known as geometric hashing.  The 
geometric hashing algorithm uses a model image of a particular object such as a computer mouse to see if it is located in a given image.

==Image Segmentation==
The process of image segmentation is used to simplify other aspects of image processing.  This includes breaking an image down into smaller pieces making object detection and edge detection easier.  The K-means algorithm
can be used to segment the image into K clusters.  The basic algorithm is shown below.

// Basic K-means algorithm

1.	Pick K cluster centers, either randomly or based on some heuristic

2.	Assign each pixel in the image to the cluster that minimizes the variance between the pixel and the cluster center

3.	Re-compute the cluster centers by averaging all of the pixels in the cluster

4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is attained (e.g. no pixels change clusters)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==My Notes for now==
The following is from: Brown, Rupert; Gaertner, Samuel L. Editors. - Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes - 2002

p. 65 &quot;In particular, two traditionally held views have undergone major revision. One view, that children become gradually more prejudiced with age, is no longer tenable. Empirical research now typically shows an inverted-U relation between age and prejudice. The second view, that children learn stereotypes and prejudice solely from parents and peers, has also not been supported. Rather, children are now seen to play a more active role in the biases they develop. Perhaps the revisions are due in part to a decline in normative forms of prejudice and thus greater variability in attitudes of parents and children.&quot;

p. 66 &quot;Ethnic bias has been particularly harmful in imposing constraints on the social and academic opportunities afforded minority children, and on the social relationships of majority children. Gender stereotypes impose the same harmful constraints on development; however, we know that boys and girls will eventually be dating and mating. The ethnic divide only becomes larger with age, not necessarily because of personal bias, but because of societal structures such as marriage and religion that keep us a Dart.&quot;

p. 67 &quot;A discussion of measurement techniques leads to the question of how children's prejudice differs from adults' prejudice. This question often arises because teachers and parents express disbelief at the early high levels of prejudice reported by researchers. They claim to be unaware of prejudice in all but a few young children. Most people identify spontaneous slurs and stereotypic remarks as indications of prejudice. Children, however, differ from adults in verbal and emotional sophistication. Consequently, they do not frequently express their prejudice in racial slurs. Furthermore, the emotional underpinnings of children's prejudice is less likely to be anger and hostility and more likely to be suspicion, fear, sadness, and expectations or projections of rejection, harm, and avoidance.&quot;

p. 70 &quot;By the time minority children are between 7 and 10 years old, any pro-White bias seems to have disappeared, and they either no longer exhibit any clear bias or express pro-ingroup bias.&quot;

p. 71 &quot;This is demonstrated with measures that highlight a fixation on ethnic classification over multiple classification. For example, children have been asked to sort pictures of people into as many groups as they like, based on whatever criteria are salient to them (&quot;Make groups of children who go together or who are similar&quot;). In some studies, race was a particularly salient cue for sorting, more salient than gender or age (e.g., Davey, 1983; Ramsey, 1991), whereas in others race was less salient (Bennett, Dewberry, &amp; Yeeles, 1991; Bigler &amp; Liben, 1993; Hirschfeld, 1996; Verkuyten, Masson, &amp; Elffers, 1995). When children were asked to reclassify pictures they had already sorted based on one dimension, for example, race, they found this difficult at 4 and 5 years, but generally were able to resort at 6 or 7 years (Bigler &amp; Liben, 1993). More difficult was the simultaneous multiple classification task which requires that the child use two criteria such as race and gender to classify people.&quot;

p. 72 &quot;Most studies do not report the number of children who have close cross-race friends, but when they do, the percentages appear to be less than 50% during pre- and early adolescence (Aboud &amp; Mendelson, 1999; DuBois &amp; Hirsch, 1990; Graham &amp; Cohen, 1997). Although studies generally report gender effects, there has been no consistent finding that girls or boys have more cross-race friends.
&quot;Black, Hispanic, and Asian students have generally, but not always, reported more cross-race friends than White students.&quot;

p. 73 &quot;Several theories have been formulated over the years to explain the development of prejudice. The most commonly held theory of prejudice is that it is learned from parents (Allport, 1954). Most lay people, educators, and psychologists explain the ethnic conflicts and name-calling of young children in this manner. &quot;If children are not born prejudiced, then they must have learned it from their parents&quot; is the logic employed. The alternative cognitive-developmental theory proposes that cognitive maturation leads children at a young age to construct and evaluate categories from available information, and that subsequent maturation leads children to differentiation within these categories (Aboud, 1988; Katz, 1976; Piaget &amp; Weil, 1951). Individual differences in the way children use these categories (Levy &amp; Dweck, in press) may explain why some children maintain prejudice into adolescence. We now describe the theories and the evidence pertaining to them.&quot;
Any guess which side he'll favor?

p. 74 &quot;The simplest way to demonstrate parental influence on the acquisition of prejudice is to correlate the attitudes of parents and children. Some studies have found a small correlation (Carlson &amp; lovini, 1985; Mosher &amp; Scodel, 1960). Others found no significant relationship between White parents and their children (Aboud &amp; Doyle, 1996b; Davey, 1983) or Black parents and their children (Branch &amp; Newcombe, 1986). Children of 10 years could not accurately predict the attitudes of their parents or best friends, but their own attitudes correlated significantly with what they thought were others' attitudes (Aboud &amp; Doyle, 1996b; Epstein &amp; Komorita, 1966). Children generally seem to perceive in others levels of prejudice comparable to their own, either because they egocentrically distort others' attitudes or because they have little real evidence on which to base judgments to the contrary.
&quot;Most children receive very little information about race or ethnicity from their parents. Kofkin, Katz, and Downey (1995) reported that only 26% of White parents of 3-yearold children had ever commented on race, usually for the purpose of teaching their children about equality and appreciating differences, or merely to answer their children's questions. The correlation between parent and child attitudes was .33 in families where race had been discussed, and nonsignificant in families where race had not been discussed. This suggests that children are influenced by their parents' attitudes only when parents explicitly talk about their views. Typically it is in regions where ethnic conflict is high that parents explicitly and emotionally express their attitudes (e.g., Bar-Tal, 1996; Duckitt, 1988), leading to the one-sided conclusion that high prejudice in children comes from parents. However, parents are just as likely to be responsible for lowering the levels of prejudice in their children.&quot;
Informative.

p. 75 &quot;In contrast with gender socialization, which appears to decline with age during childhood, minority ethnic socialization may increase as parents detect their children's receptivity to the more complex aspects of ethnic group membership. Likewise, it is thought that minority children derive important ideas about minority group identity from watching television programs, which to date have not provided the kinds of models that parents find desirable (Graves, 1993).&quot;
I was right in my criticism of Elijah Anderson's work - media is a major influence on youth, minorities in particular.

p. 79 &quot;Intervention experimental studies. Because category formation and outgroup homogeneity appear at a young age, researchers have not attempted to train these skills in order to observe their role in the formation of prejudice. However, a number of cognitive approaches have been used in schools to reduce prejudice. The common one is to provide knowledge about the cultural ways of minority groups. This is unrelated to cognitive developmental theory in that it makes no reference to age-related cognitive structures, but rather to the idea that prejudice is based on ignorance. Typically these studies find no consistent effect of information on reducing prejudice (Pate, 1988; Furuto &amp; Furuto, 1983). In fact, the presentation of information about typical cultural patterns, simplified for young schoolchildren, runs the risk of contributing to group stereotypes. Even if the goal is to instill a positive stereotype, say about the eating habits of Chinese people, it is quite inappropriate to teach children that Chinese Americans use chopsticks, when many of them do not.
&quot;More successful are role-playing programs, where students re-examine their attitudes after experiencing powerlessness or discrimination in a simulation game (McGregor, 1993). Another cognitive approach, called antiracist teaching, seeks to reduce prejudice by discussing the social/historical inequalities that underlie racism and discrimination. Role-playing and antiracist teaching, however, are limited in scope and application. First, they are rarely used with elementary schoolchildren because they require a certain amount of social and emotional sophistication. Secondly, they may unintentionally portray minority members as helpless victims, rather than as potentially respectable friends. Thirdly, they are directed to a White audience only, and the material is often inappropriate for non-White ethnic group members. Fourthly, they may raise feelings of guilt that young children cope with in unproductive ways, for example, by blaming the victim or denying wrongdoing.&quot;

p. 80 &quot;In summary, there may be several routes to the acquisition and reduction of prejudice. Children appear to have a predisposition to create ethnic categories around age 4 or 5, and then to use these to infer group distinctions and homogeneity of members within categories. If evaluations from parents are explicit, preoperational children may adopt these evaluations. However, a more likely scenario is that prejudice is acquired when children identify with one ethnic category and generalize their self-esteem to their group, or without a salient identification they generalize from social attachments to similar others. As a function of age and familiarity, children become more flexible in their thinking and more reciprocal in their social relations; this results in fewer distinctions between ethnic groups, more differentiation within groups, better reconciliation of differences, and use of multiple cross-cutting categories. These social-cognitive abilities, developing in the concrete operational stage, appear to contribute to a post-7 year reduction in prejudice. Minority group children differ from White children only in their greater attitude variability pre-7 years. They may not all follow the ingroup preference route to the extent that ingroup identification is not salient or personal attachments are multiethnic. Why some but not all children develop balanced attitudes in middle childhood is not clear, though there may be individual differences in cognitive assumptions about people or the presence of other controlled, as opposed to automatic, processes such as belief in fairness. Research published over the next decade will address questions about social and cognitive inputs to prejudice by designing experimental interventions to prevent early high levels of prejudice and to reduce prejudice and discrimination in school children (see Aboud &amp; Levy, 2000).&quot;

----

These look like very reasonable and comprehensive notes and should be added.

== Some examples of specific types of alleged racism ==

*[[w:Afrocentrism|Afrocentrism]] - the belief that black African cultures were historically more powerful and influential than most historians believe, or that certain ancient civilizations were created or maintained by black Africans
*[[w:Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitism]] - racism directed towards followers of the Jewish faith or people of Jewish [[ethnicity]], the latter often including those who follow other faiths.
*[[w:Apartheid|Apartheid]] - a now defunct, white supremacist system that once existed in [[South Africa]], in which Whites, Blacks and &quot;Coloreds&quot; were segregated; some refer to current Israeli policies towards Palestinians as apartheid as well.
*[[w:Black supremacy|Black supremacy]] - the belief that those of African descent are the superior race.
*[[w:Bumiputra|Bumiputra]] -  A system whereby Malays are accorded economic privileges not available to those of other races.
*[[w:Caste|Caste system]] - (not always considered racist) A system of social hierarchy among various social groups, such as in India often stratified along color lines, with the darkest individuals being members of the most subordinate caste - each assigned a specific occupation and social role.
*[[w:Colonialism|Colonialism]] - a practice of the imperial powers of Europe and Asia, wherein foreign territories were subjugated and minority ruling classes were installed to exploit the natural and human resources of the territory.  Although not explicitly racist by intent, negative consequences due to racism nearly always resulted.
*[[w:Colorism|Colorism]] - a bias against dark skin resulting from an internalization of white racist values, manifested in such things as the [[w:brown paper bag test|paper bag test]]. There seems to be an implicit calculus behind this belief that makes the worth of an individual inversely related to the darkness of his/her skin.
*[[w:Cultural genocide|Cultural genocide]] is a term used to describe the deliberate destruction of the cultural heritage of a people for political or military reasons.
*[[w:Ethnic Cleansing|Ethnic Cleansing]] - the intentional and systematic relocation and/or elimination of different ethnicities to produce an ethnicly &quot;pure&quot; territory or country - for example, recent history in the former Yugoslavia
*[[w:Eurocentrism|Eurocentrism]] - the practice of historically and culturally focusing on white Europeans, to the exclusion of study, or even mention of, significant achievements of other groups of people; and often the appropriation of achievements of people of color as being European in origin
*[[w:Genocide|Genocide]] - the intentional and systematic elimination of different races to produce an racially &quot;pure&quot; territory or country - for example, the history of the Third Reich
*[[w:Institutionalized Racism|Institutionalized Racism]] - the process of purposely discriminating against certain groups of people through the use of biased laws or practices.  Often, institutionalized racism is subtle and manifests itself in seemingly innocuous ways, but its effects are anything but subtle.  An example of this type of racism is the [[w:redlining|redlining]] of districts to keep certain people from moving in to a new neighborhood, pervasive in the financial industry in the 1950s and 60s.
*[[w:Islamist terrorism|Islamic terrorism]] - Political [[w:reverse discrimination|reverse discriminatory]] prejudice and terrorism against non-Muslims, Muslims who do not adhere to their particular brand of Islam, and non-Islamic governments.
*[[w:Islamophobia|Islamophobia]] - the manifestation of hatred and hostility towards [[w:Muslim|Muslims]] and sometimes [[w:Arab|Arab]] people in general.
*[[w:Manifest Destiny|Manifest Destiny]] - a historical form of the belief that asserted that white Americans had the right and duty to colonize the West and &quot;[[w:civilize|civilize]]&quot; the [[w:Native American|Native American]] inhabitants.
*[[w:Model Minority|Model Minority]] - stereotype that [[w:Asian Americans|Asian Americans]] are intelligent and hardworking and should serve as a &quot;model&quot; for other minorities in the United States
*[[w:Nazism|Nazism]] (National Socialism) - a historical form of political organization coupled with extreme racism, that directed its energies against the [[w:Jew]]s, [[w:Roma (people)|Roma]] (the so-called Gypsies), [[w:Poles|Poles]], among other groups. Some adherents of Nazi ideology continue to exist today.
*[[w:Racial purity|Racial purity]] - the belief that the various so-called races should be kept &quot;pure&quot; by not permitting interbreeding

*[[w:Redlining|Redlining]] - the practice of denying marginalized communities services (such as food delivery or taxi service), or access to home or business loans allowing residents to build equity and have a financial stake in their own communities, or refusal to locate businesses or other services in marginalized communities (such as supermarkets, banks, or bus and subway routes).
*[[w:Reverse discrimination|Reverse discrimination]] or [[w:reverse racism|reverse racism]] - the belief that measures designed to correct alleged racism, such as [[Affirmative action]], have in fact simply created new racist policies against the dominant groups. This is a highly controversial idea.
*[[w:White flight|White flight]] - the practice of white residents abandoning a neighborhood or area due to the arrival of black or other residents, often weakening the tax base and reducing public services. The practice is also known as the [[w:tipping point|tipping point]].
*[[w:White man's burden|White man's burden]] - the belief once held by Europeans that they were obligated to civilize and &quot;correct&quot; the great unwashed heathen masses of the world.  Although considered a noble mission by some, in practice its consequences nearly always resulted in more human suffering.  Term coined by [[Rudyard Kipling]].  Similar to &quot;colonialism&quot;.
*[[w:White skin privilege|White privilege]] - preferential treatment enjoyed by [[w:whites|white persons]] in various aspects of society.
*[[w:White supremacy|White supremacy]] - the belief that Caucasians are, as a race, superior or worthy of supremacy, even called by some the &quot;[[w:master race|master race]]&quot;. 
*Attitudes of [[w:suburb|suburb]] and [[w:gated community|gated community]] developers, who are often accused of pandering to racist views by emphasizing &quot;crime risk&quot; in more racially diverse downtowns, especially in [[North America]].

== My Recommendations Regarding Accuracy, Errors and Additional Detail.  ==


Hetep and Respect SuperUnspecial Wiki is a wonderful tool but as all new open tools it is a double-edged sword.  That is, one will find accurate information and errors. This is especially true with respect to cultural information. 

Below you will find my notes regarding this article, which, have been formally submitted to my fellow wikipedians and wikibookians for their consideration as we speak.
 

This book deals with complex subject matter and is useful as an introductory survey of the range of issues associated with notions of ethnicity and the later concepts of Euro-centrism and ‘race” my comments should be of interests to those concerned with sociology, anthropology, psychology, the nature of Cultural Health and social science in general.  

The book like many in their early start up phase contains accuracy, error and the need for more detail. Below you will find my contribution, insofar as with my wikipedian hat on, I can attest to accuracy, point out an error and make a recommendation for the addition of detail. 
'''
Accurate:'''

“…Debates continue in and among academic disciplines as to how race should be understood. Most sociologists believe race is a social construct, meaning it does not have a basis in the natural world but is simply an artificial distinction created by humans. As a result of this understanding, some researchers have turned from conceptualizing and analyzing human variation by race to doing so in terms of populations, dismissing racial classifications altogether. In the face of the increasing rejection of race as a valid classification scheme, many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word ethnicity to refer to self-identifying groups based on shared religion, nationality, or culture…”

“…The understanding of race as a social construct is well-illustrated by examining race issues in two countries, the U.S. and Brazil…”

This is a very useful survey and the contrast between the U.S. with its approximate 13 million African Americans and Brazil with more then 100 million African Brazilians is a good introduction to the subject.  

'''Errors:'''

Here the first ethnographic studies are correctly attributed to “Egypt” But the indigenous name of the Country Kemet is not mentioned and the fact that we are here talking about Classical African Civilization in the same way that Greece is related to Western Civilization needs to be corrected. One must be careful here not to insert or overlook the work of anti-Kemetic Egyptologists. Anti-Kemetic Cultural Poisoning should be avoided and historicity should be maintained. 

“…The division of humanity into distinct races can be traced as far back as the Ancient Egyptian sacred text the Book of Gates, which identified four races according to the Egyptians. This early treatment merged racial and ethnic differences, combining skin-color with tribal and national identities.

Here we have and example of mixing up truth with falsehood. The classical Africans of Kemet (Egypt) did produce the first ethnographic studies but they had no word for “race”. Yet the author talks as if such a concept existed, it did not, and he offers no proof that it did exist. I personally have never seen or heard of any word in the 10,000 year history of metu neter, (hieroglyphics) for “race”. 

The Kemetic people do not ‘identify four “races” ‘ in this ethnographic study from the time of Seti I in the book of Gates. They do identify three major ethnic groups and two Nationalities. Blacks are shown by nationality Kemetian (Egyptian) and Nubian. The other two ethnic groups are Caucasian (White) and Multi-ethnic (Semitic).

There is also an Ethnographic study from the time of Ramosis II that deliniates three major ethnic groups and  Two Nationalities. The study precisely notes the Kemetic nationality as belonging to the Black ethnic group. So the first ethnographic studies in recorded history, c. 1500 - 1200 B.C.E., delineate the three major ethnic groups Blacks, Asians and lastly Whites/Semites. Despite the invention of the word “race” some approximately 2,700 years later.  I have seen no evidence to invalidate the Cultural Health Golden Rule (There is one race the human race and many ethnic groups) established by the first sociologists in recorded history.

Scroll down the page until you come to the “African American Cultural Literacy Section. Start the video clip 3.35 minutes in you will see the ethnographic study and the professor’s explanation.

'''Recommendation for Additional Detail'''

&quot;...The word race was introduced to English from the French in the late 16th century...&quot;

I do not have the details on the tip of my tongue but this detail should be filled in, as the facts are known. I recommend the following level of detail be added. 

Name of first users of “race”, his book and page number (non racial use)

Name of Second user, book and page number (First racial use)

'''Worcestershire Sauce''', pronounced &quot;Wuh'ster'sher,&quot; can trace its origins back to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. The original recipe was brought back by a Lord Sandys from Bengal, and is kept a closely guarded secret. The ingredients include malt [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] (from barley), spirit [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]], [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] extract, [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] and flavourings. The production process includes maturation in oak barrels for several months.

First made by Lea &amp; Perrins in 1835, the company still makes the sauce in the same way today. It is invaluable for spicing up savoury dishes.</text>

Level spelled backward is level,as both ends of a foundation should be! Bubble levels come in many shapes and sizes, the smallest one used to level the longest length. It is a line level and the idea is to stretch a string as taut as one dares to and hang this little 3 inch level on it. These are hard to work with and wind can cause false readings. The best level for long foundations is the water level. Other builders levels are the torpedo, a 9&quot; level, that are great for scaffold building if they are magnatized. There are 18&quot;, 2ft,4ft, and 6ft levels. It is always a good idea to check one level against another by simply stacking one on top of the other to make sure that they read the same.

Iraqi cuisine has changed and evolved since the time of the Babylonians, Sumerians and Assyrians. The cuisine has been influenced by those ancient civilizations, which also had influence Greek and Persian cuisines. With the coming of Islam and the spread of Arab culture, which influenced the region, the food was enhanced to combine old and new sets of tastes.

As Baghdad became the centre of the Islamic world, Muslims from all over (Africa, India, China, Indonesia, etc.) visited Iraq, which gave Iraq new twists to its food. As Iraqis traveled, trading absorbed Mediterranean flavors.

With the Ottoman rule of Iraq, influences of Turkish cuisine also became incorporated into Iraqi recipes.

==First Order Differential Equations==

The simplest types of differential equations to solve are '''first order equations'''.  These are equation where the highest derivative in the equation is the first. So, a first order equation is a function &lt;math&gt;F(x,y,y^{\prime})&lt;/math&gt;; there are no occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime \prime}&lt;/math&gt; or higher derivatives.  

There are two easily solved types of first order equations.  These are equations with '''separable variables''' and '''linear equations'''.  This chapter covers how to solve and graph any equation in one of these forms, or reducible to these forms.  Other types of differential equations, such as '''non-linear equations''', are not covered yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== book rating ==

There is a template to rate the books: {{stage|75%|Apr 3, 2005}} and {{stage short|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}. Important - in the dynamic wiki environment - is the date when the rating was issued.

In the beginning the rating of pages was just done by a small icon (you know 0%.png, 25%.png) etc. pp. and most pages are still rated this way.

However it is suggested that any new rating is done with the templates above. This templates also show the date when the rating was done.

See [[Help:Development_stages]] for more details on how to rate a book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Branches of Philosophy ==
In order to narrow the aims of discussion philosophy was broken into branches. Traditionally philosophy has been broken into four main branches; however we would like to add a fifth branch in our text  

=== Epistemology ===
'''Epistemology, from the Greek words episteme (knowledge) and logos (word/speech) is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge and love.'''
APPROVAL: Mla MBILI JR II--[[Special:Contributions/196.21.83.196|196.21.83.196]] ([[User talk:196.21.83.196|discuss]]) 18:20, 4 March 2014 (UTC)MM

=== Metaphysics ===
'''Metaphysics however (derived from the Greek words &quot;ta meta ta physika biblia&quot;) - meaning 'the book that follows the physics book'. It was the way students referred to a specific book in the works of Aristotle, and it was a book on First Philosophy. (The assumption that the word means &quot;beyond physics&quot; is misleading) Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of &quot;first principles&quot; and &quot;being&quot; (ontology).''' In other words, Metaphysics is the study of the most general aspects of reality, such as substance, identity, the nature of the mind, and free will.In other way is a study of nature and the nature of the world in which man lives

=== Logic ===
'''Logic (from Classical Greek λόγος (logos), originally meaning the word, or what is spoken, but coming to mean thought or reason) is most often said to be the study of arguments. logic is the study of correct reasoning.However, the subject is grounded, the task of the logician is the same: to advance an account of valid and fallacious inference to allow one to distinguish good from bad arguments.

'''

=== Ethics ===
'''Ethics is a general term for what is often described as the &quot;science (study) of morality&quot;. In philosophy, ethical behaviour is that which is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right.&quot; The Western tradition of ethics is sometimes called moral philosophy.

===''' Other Branches''' ===


'''Philosophy of Education:' Fairly self-explanatory. A minor branch, mainly concerned with what is the correct way to educate a person. Classic works include Plato's Republic, Locke's Thoughts Concerning Education, and Rousseau's Emile.

'''Philosophy of History:''' Fairly minor branch (not as minor as education), although highly important to Hegel and those who followed him, most notably Marx. It is the philosophical study of history, particularly concerned with the question whether history (i.e. the universe and/or humankind) is progressing towards a specific end? Hegel argued that it was, as did Marx. Classic works include Vico's New Science, and Hegel and Marx's works.

'''Philosophy of Language:''' Ancient branch of philosophy which gained prominence in the last century under Wittgenstein. Basically concerned with how our languages affect our thought. Wittgenstein famously asserted that the limits of our languages mark the limits of our thought. Classic works include Plato's Cratylus, Locke's Essay, and Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

'''Philosophy of Law:''' Also called Jurisprudence. Study of law attempting to discern what the best laws might be, how laws came into being in the first place, attempting to delimit human laws from natural laws, whether we should always obey the law, and so on. Law isn't often directly dealt with by philosophers, but much of political philosophy obviously has a bearing on it.

'''Philosophy of Mathematics:''' Concerned with issues such as, the nature of the axioms and symbols (numbers, triangle, operands) of mathematics that we use to understand the world, do perfect mathematical forms exist in the real world, and so on. Principia Mathematica is almost certainly the most important work in this field.

'''Philosophy of Mind:''' Study of the mind, attempting to ascertain exactly what the mind is, how it interacts with our body, do other minds exist, how does it work, and so on. Probably the most popular branch of philosophy right now, it has expanded to include issues of AI. Classic works include Plato's Republic and Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, although every major philosopher has had some opinion at least on what the mind is and how it works.

'''Philosophy of Politics:''' Closely related to ethics, this is a study of government and nations, particularly how they came about, what makes good governments, what obligations citizens have towards their government, and so on. Classic works include Plato's Republic, Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Two Treatises, and J.S. Mill's On Liberty.

'''Philosophy of Religion:''' Theology is concerned with the study of God, recommending the best religious practises, how our religion should shape our life, and so on. Philosophy of religion is concerned with much the same issues, but where Theology uses religious works, like the Bible, as it's authority, philosophy likes to use reason as the ultimate authority.

'''Philosophy of Science:''' Study of science concerned with whether scientific knowledge can be said to be certain, how we obtain it, can science really explain everything, does causation really exist, can every event in the universe be described in terms of physics and so on. Also popular in recent times, classic works include Hume's Treatise on Human Nature, Kripke's Naming and Necessity, Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Doing Philosophy ==
Many fields can be studied and learned without ever actually working with the tools in the field.  For instance, chemistry can be learned in depth without ever picking up a test tube or mixing ionic compounds.  Philosophy, however, is more about the methodology behind deriving answers than it is about the answers themselves.  As such, students studying philosophy must use the methodology of philosophy on the philosophy they are learning as they are learning it.  Doing philosophy involves asking the right questions, critically examining the work of previous philosophers, truly understanding the works and the reasoning behind the works, and possibly building on the works of previous philosophers by expanding or testing this methodology.

'''Naan''' is a round [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] made with white [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and is a staple accompaniment to hot meals in central and southern Asia.

==Ingredients==
To make approximately 4 large naan breads:
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (450g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3/4 cup (180ml) water



==Procedure==
# [[Cookbook:Knead|Knead]] the dough by combining all the ingredients and sufficient water (this will be approximately 3/4 cup but some judgement is required).
# Wrap the dough in a damp muslin cloth and leave it to rise for 2-3 hours.
# Divide the dough into small balls.
# Roll out the balls in oblong or round shape with a rolling pin or by slapping and stretching with your hands.
# Smear the surface with water and bake in a tandoor or preheated oven (as hot as your oven will go).
# The naans should puff up a little, and be ready to remove from the oven in 4 to 5 minutes.
# Brush the naan with butter. Serve hot.

==Alternative Recipe Ingredients==
* 1 tsp dried active yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 200g/7oz white bread flour
* pinch black onion seeds (nigella seeds)
* ¼ tsp salt
* ½ tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp natural yoghurt
* 2 tbsp milk

==Alternative Recipe Procedure==
# Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1.
# In a small bowl, mix the yeast with one tablespoon of warm water. Stir in the sugar and leave it in a warm place for five minutes until the yeast is covered with froth. This will show that the yeast is ready to use.
# Mix together the flour, onion seeds, salt and baking powder. Stir in the oil, yoghurt and milk, then stir in the activated yeast mixture.
# To knead the dough, clench your hand into a fist, wet your knuckles with a little water, then press them repeatedly into the dough. Continue pressing and kneading until you have a soft, pliable dough. It should take about 10 minutes. Leave to rest for 10 minutes and then knead again for another 5 minutes.
# Place the dough in a mixing bowl, cover it with cling film and leave it in a warm place to rise for 20-30 minutes.
# Divide the dough into four balls and place on a floured surface or board. Roll each into a long oval shape about 0.5cm (¼ inch) thick. 
# Place them on a greased baking tray and put them in the centre of the oven for 10-15 minutes. They are ready when they have puffed up a little. Serve fresh from the oven.

* To add an extra crispy finish, pop the baked naans under a preheated grill for 30 seconds before brushing with butter and serving.
* To add extra flavour, consider adding finely chopped garlic and coriander to the butter you brush over your cooked naan breads. Then return them to the oven (or place under a grill) for a short time to cook the garlic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When editing this chapter, please make sure to keep in mind that what we consider ''doing philosophy'' is that of reading of ideas. That is we do not whish to have our reader be confused by saying &quot;Wait, you mean I have to read to be a philosopher!? I suppose I am just a deep thinker then.&quot; This is far from the case. We wish our philosophical friends to feel comfortable, but please make sure to inform them that the idea of doing philosophy does lay in the fact of not posing ideas that have already been said. 

That is, please do not forget that there are other people in the world who might have thought the same as you, and they might have thought before you. It is common then to read works to become familiar with ideas in order to perhaps build upon them or relate to them. This way, your idea seems less abstract when trying to relate it to another person.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

There are as many ways of preparing '''Pasta e Fagioli''' (or ''Basta Fazool'' if you come from southern Italy) as there are Italians. In Brooklyn during the 1940s, all the Italians would have it every Friday night because it is meatless. Usually it is a soup dominated by tomatoes. This recipe, in contrast, is the consistency of a stew, and is dominated by the umami flavor.

#Soak overnight  OR bring to boil, boil 2 minutes and let stand, covered, for 1 hour.
#Do not drain beans, but bring to a boil.
#Skim off foam and add oil, garlic and bay leaf.
#Simmer for about 2 hours, or until tender.
#Cook pasta for 6 or 7 minutes, but don't let it get too soft.
#Drain pasta and save some of the water.
#Stir pasta and red pepper into beans and simmer until pasta is eatably soft, adding some of the saved water if necessary.
#Garnish with red pepper to taste and parsley.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Beans: Use whichever sort is the favorite in your neighborhood and likely to be freshest.  In Southern California that would be [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]], in the deep South, [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] or perhaps [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|butter beans]]. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|Garbanzos]] might be good. [[Cookbook:Navy Bean|Navy beans]] are always safe.
*Olive oil: Use the best grade you can get:  Cold pressed, Extra Virgin.
*With a salad and some red wine this is a hearty meal, and can be eaten the next day, cold or reheated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../First Order|First Order Differential Equations]]

This section deals with a technique of solving differential equation known as '''Separation of Variables'''. Before we begin discussing separation of variables it is very helpful to recall the theorem behind integration by substitution from calculus.

Which states that if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has a derivative that is a continuous function - hence &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; being a function itself, then integrating such chained functions yields
::&lt;math&gt;\int f\big(y(x)\big) y'\,dx = \int f(y)\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, our integrand &lt;math&gt;f(y(x))y'(x)&lt;/math&gt;  and our antiderivate will be the same if we took the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and plugged it into &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This provides a very useful tool to solve many ODE's.

To take an example let's consider the differential equation:
::&lt;math&gt;y'=ay&lt;/math&gt;

We comment the constant function &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is a solution.  We will focus on finding solutions that are not zero.  As commented before it is a consequence of the uniquenesss of solutions that two solutions can never intersect.  For this problem it means that solutions are always positive or always negative because they cannot cross &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. For easier understanding, picture a normal Cartesian coordinate system.  The solutions can only be above or below the x-axis.  

For this reason we are justified for the remainder in assuming that &lt;math&gt;y(x)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we can divide by &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; as division by zero is undefined, to find that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}y'=a&lt;/math&gt;

Now integrating both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we have that

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{y}y'\,dx=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the theorem about integration by substitution theorem:

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Or 

:: &lt;math&gt;\ln |y|=ax+C&lt;/math&gt;.
:: &lt;math&gt;y=\pm e^C e^{ax}=Ce^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally we comment that, &lt;math&gt;e^c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; collapsing to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, so technically speaking the above derivation only shows that we get a solution if &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, taking into account &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;.   Notice on the other hand that if we allow &lt;math&gt;C=0&lt;/math&gt; then we can recover the solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we can represent all solutions as 
::&lt;math&gt;y(x)=Ce^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a real number.

This method is known as separation of variables because after we have divided we have one side that is entirely in terms of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the other side entirely in terms of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  

== Comments about notation and heuristics==
While the change of variables theorem is the mathematical justification, using Leibniz' notation for derivatives allows for excellent mnemonics for remembering how separation of variables works.   

We present two notationally different but equivalent derivations here:

Beginning from the point where we have divided by &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; and using Leibniz notation we have that:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}=a.&lt;/math&gt;

One might not view this as fully separated because there is still a &quot;dx&quot; on the left hand side.  But one can fully separate the equation by multiplying by &quot;dx&quot;, to get:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}\,dy=a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Then placing an integral in front of each term one gets:
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

This arrives at the correct place, but treating &quot;dx&quot; as a number is purely heuristic.

A second mnemonic which is fairly similar uses Leibniz notation to remind us how the change of variables theorem should work.  
Beginning from the step in the original example where we integrated both sides with respect to x, and using Leibniz notation we have: 
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}\,dx=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can &quot;cancel the dx&quot; to get that &lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{\cancel{dx}}\,\cancel{dx}=\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.
Again, &quot;dx&quot; is not a number, so it cannot really be canceled.  But the heuristic does correctly give the change of variables formula. 

The reader should use which ever of the above methods seems most clear to them individually.  The book will undoubtedly use anyone of the three at different points in its exposition.

== What is a Separable Equation? ==

An ordinary differential equation is called '''separable''' if it can be rewritten in the form: 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)+N(y)y'=0&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int M(x)\,dx + \int N(y)y'\,dx = C&lt;/math&gt;

Now by one of the methods we discussed above we can change and simplfy the second integral to 

::&lt;math&gt;\int M(x)\,dx + \int N(y)\,dy = C&lt;/math&gt;

An equation where you can factor out both P and Q into separate functions of x and y

&lt;math&gt;P_1(x)P_2(y)dx+Q_1(x)Q_2(y)dy=0&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''separable''' because the equation can become an equation with separated variables.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac {P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}dx + \frac {Q_2(y)}{P_2(y)}dy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac {P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}dx = - \frac {Q_2(y)}{P_2(y)}dy&lt;/math&gt;

However, attention must be paid to this process of division. The cases when &lt;math&gt;Q_1(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2(y)=0&lt;/math&gt; will be additional possible integral solutions that will not be found through the integral because of this division.

== Trivial cases ==

There are two special cases of a separable equation that make the solution almost trivial.  These are the cases where either 

::&lt;math&gt;N(y)=k \,&lt;/math&gt;

or 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)=k, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is a constant.  In either case, the equation changes from being in terms of 3 variables and reduces down to 2.  When we can throw out one of the two variables, the solution can be achieved by a simple integral.

===No ''y'' term: ''N''(''y'') = ''k''===

If ''N''(''y'')=''k'', we can treat ''k'' as part of ''M''(''x''), and turn ''N''(''y'') into 1.  That is, if we divide both sides by ''k'' and let {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''M''(''x'')/''k''}}.  Then we're left with 

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=M(x)/k=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

This is now basic calculus - take the integral of both sides.  The general solution is

::&lt;math&gt;y=\int f(x)dx+C,&lt;/math&gt;

where C is a constant.

Let's take a look at a few examples.

==== Example 1 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2+7&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we have a derivative equaling a function of ''x''. The original function is the '''antiderivative''' of this, that is, we have to integrate to find it. Now we integrate both sides of the equation, w.r.t.''x'' (with regard to 'x'):

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{dx}\,dx=\int(x^2+7)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{3}x^3+7x+C&lt;/math&gt;

This is the general solution. A function that solves a differential equation is said to '''satisfy''' it, so

::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{3}x^3+7x+C&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies the differential equation

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2+7&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example 2 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}= \sin x+e^x&lt;/math&gt;

This works the same as before - integrate both sides with respect to ''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{dx}\, dx= \int\sin x+e^x\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=- \cos x+e^x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that even in this simple case, it may be impossible to write down a formula for the solution because ''f''(''x'') cannot be integrated in elementary terms.  In this case, writing the integral of ''y'', which is the function we are looking for, symbolically with an integral symbol is deemed to be a solution.

===No ''x'' term: ''M''(''x'')=''k''===

Another special case is when 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)=k.&lt;/math&gt;

The only difference is how we make it into an integrable form. Our equation is

::&lt;math&gt;N(y)\frac{dy}{dx}= -k.&lt;/math&gt;

This type of equation is called an ''autonomous'' differential equation.  The differential equation has no explicit dependence on the independent variable ''x'' except through the function ''y''.  We will have more to say about this type of equation later, but for the moment we note that this type of equation is always separable. 

Integrating both sides with respect to ''x'' we get

::&lt;math&gt;\int N(y)\frac{dy}{dx}\,dx= \int k\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

We now have two integrals, each with respect to the functions contained in them. The solution is of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\int N(y)\,dy=kx+C.&lt;/math&gt;

You can now try to solve for ''y''. It is possible that the left hand side doesn't have an antiderivative that can be expressed as a nice formula, and in that case, we leave it in a as clean a form as possible, that is with the integral symbol unresolved. Another important concept emerges here. 

==== Example 4 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{k}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we multiply through by ''y'', and multiply through by ''dx''. The rest of the math works as before.

::&lt;math&gt;ydy=kdx \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int ydy=\int kdx \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}y^2=kx+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y^2=2kx+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, its more convenient to solve for ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; than ''y''.  If we take the square root to solve for ''y'', we change the equation (since the square root of a number is always positive, we would lose half of each solution curve).  In these cases its just fine to leave it in its current form.

You may have noticed that the right hand side of the equation, before solving for ''y'', is the same for both examples.  When ''f''(''x'')=''k'', the right hand side will always be ''kx''+C where ''k'' is whatever constant is in the problem.  It only changes when ''f''(''x'') is not constant.

As before, it may be impossible to do the integral.  Even if it is possible, it may then not be possible to invert the equation to give y explicitly as a function of x, for example if we get tan(y) + 1/y = x.  Again, this does not matter; the result is regarded as a valid solution.

== General Separable Variable Equations==

In the most general case, neither ''M''(''x'') or ''N''(''y'') is a constant.  In this case, we use the same method as before (although the variables might have to be separated first). The only difference is that both sides result in non-trivial integrals, so we a little more work to do.  This can produce some untidy solutions, and ODEs are known for this. This untidiness often means that we might want to check our result at the end.

==== Example 5 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=y^3x&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and multiplying by ''dx'' gives

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y^3}=xdx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y^3}=\int xdx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2y^2}=\frac{1}{2}x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y^2=-\frac{1}{x^2+C}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 6 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

We multiply by &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{y}&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y}=\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y}=\int\frac{dx}{x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\ln(y)=\ln(x)+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{\ln(x)+C}=e^Ce^{\ln(x)}=Cx \,&lt;/math&gt;

Again &lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; collapsing into &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example 7 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=xy+y&lt;/math&gt;

This doesn't look separable at first glance.  A little factoring can be applied though:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=(x+1)y&lt;/math&gt;

This is separable.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y}=(x+1)dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y}=\int(x+1)dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\ln(y)=\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^{\frac{1}{2}x^2+x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Problems with Initial Conditions==

Solving an initial value problem is fairly easy.  Solve for ''y'' as we did above. Then once you have the equation, plug in ''b'' for ''y'' and ''a'' for ''x''.  Then, solve for the constant.

=== Example 8 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=ky, \quad y(0)=10&lt;/math&gt;

As we saw in example 3, the general solution to this is ''y''=C''e''&lt;sup&gt;kx&lt;/sup&gt;.  Let's plug in our boundary conditions:

::&lt;math&gt;10=Ce^{0k} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;10=Ce^{0} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C=10 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=10e^{kx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the particular solution.

Unfortunately in some cases care must be used when solving for the constant.

=== Example 9 ===
::&lt;math&gt;2yy'=2x+2\qquad y(0)=-2&lt;/math&gt;
This equation is already separated, so integrating both sides
::&lt;math&gt;\int 2yy'\,dx=\int 2x+2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y^2=x^2+2x+C&lt;/math&gt;

By plugging in we find that:
::&lt;math&gt;C=(-2)^2=4&lt;/math&gt;

So now we have that: 
::&lt;math&gt;y^2=x^2+2x+4.&lt;/math&gt;

But if we continue to solve for ''y'' we must be careful.  One may naively write:
&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

But there is a problem, we are looking for a ''function'' ''y''(''x''), which means the function must be single valued (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-valued_function Single-valued function]).  And we should be careful what we mean by &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;.  
Do we mean that for each different ''x'' there is a different possibility of a sign?

Fortunately since the function has to be differentiable (and hence continuous), the function ''y''(''x'') cannot jump back and forth 
between positive and negative values.  So we must mean there is one choice of sign:
::&lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt{x^2+2x+4};&lt;/math&gt;      Or
::&lt;math&gt;y=-\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

But which one? It is a nice consequence of uniqueness, that only one of the two functions could solve the problem.  Both solve the differential equation, so we can double check the initial condition.  In the first instance ''y''(0)=2, so that is not our solution, but for the second function ''y''(0)=-2 as desired.  Thus the solution is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;y=-\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 10 ===
Another interesting example that illustrates problems that may arise is:
::&lt;math&gt;y'=6xy^{2/3}\qquad y(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to solve this initial value problem we begin by separating variables.

::&lt;math&gt;\int y^{-2/3}y'\,dx=\int 6x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;3y^{1/3}=3x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+C)^3&lt;/math&gt;

Now to plug in the initial conditions we have that:
::&lt;math&gt;0=(0^2+C)^3&lt;/math&gt;,  Thus
::&lt;math&gt;C=0&lt;/math&gt;

So we have a solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=x^6&lt;/math&gt;.  But by inspection we also have the solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  So there are at least two solutions to this problem.  Perhaps there are more, at the moment we have no way to be sure.  Worse, there is nothing that comes up while separating variables to indicate we are in a situation where the situations are not unique.  For this reason we will return to issue and discuss the general mathematical theorems that guarantee the existence of unique solutions.

This may be important for many reasons.  For example, often one believes a real life process is described by a function which satisfies an ODE.  Usually using the ODE, and actual measurements of the process you'd like to deduce what function is governing the process so you can make predictions about future behaviour.  But if the solutions to the ODE are not unique, it is difficult to tell when you have found the one solution which is really giving the behaviour of the real world process.

=== Example 11 ===
In the example above we saw that sometimes a differential equation is not well behaved and admits multiple solutions.  In this example we see that sometimes the problem is perfectly well behaved but if we are not careful we may think we find multiple soluitons.

::&lt;math&gt;y'=4y^{1/2}x\qquad y(0)=4.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int y^{-1/2}y'\,dx=\int 4x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+C)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now by plugging in the initial condition we find that
::&lt;math&gt;4=(0^2+C)^2=C^2&lt;/math&gt;

At this point it is very tempting to claim that:
::&lt;math&gt;C=\pm 2&lt;/math&gt;

And we appear get two solutions 
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2-2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

But if we are careful we can see that the second equation is not really a solution.  To see this let's plug it into the equation.

If
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2-2)^2&lt;/math&gt;, then
::&lt;math&gt;y'=4x(x^2-2)&lt;/math&gt;, and 
::&lt;math&gt;y^{1/2}=|x^2-2|&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus when we plug into &lt;math&gt;y'=4y^{1/2}x&lt;/math&gt;  we are trying to equate
::&lt;math&gt;4x(x^2-2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4x|x^2-2|&lt;/math&gt;, 
but notice the first equation is negative for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; while the second equation is always positive.

This doesn't happen for the other function because we end up trying to compare &lt;math&gt;4x(x^2+2)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y'=4x|x^2+2|&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x^2+2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can drop the absolute values in the second expression.

So what went wrong?  We introduced the ambiguity when we were solving for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by squaring both sides of the equation.  We could have avoided this issue if we solved for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; immediately after integrating, in which case we would have been working with the equation &lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+C&lt;/math&gt; and: 
::&lt;math&gt;2(4)^{1/2}=2(0)^2+C&lt;/math&gt;, so
::&lt;math&gt;C=4&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this back in and solving for y we get:
::&lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+4&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y^{1/2}=x^2+2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>+ Subject-past participle agreement</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages|french=yes}} 

I came across this when recording audio for this lesson; would &quot;quel jour est-il&quot; be more common than &quot;quel jour sommes-nous aujourd'hui&quot;? Please comment. I will record the audio file later when this has been cleared up. [[User:Jonojet|Jonojet]]
::You could be bold and add a second section oof how to say it the normal way, and leave the way we have it here as well. And hey, could we sacrifice alphabetical order and have the things on audio file first and the things that aren't can be after that?[[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 17:37, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

==Subject-past participle agreement==
This section says: ''When conjugating with être, the past participles of the above verbs must agree with the the subject of a sentence in gender and plurality. Note that there is no agreement if these verbs are conjugated with avoir.''

While this explanation is correct for the type of sentences shown, there is an exception for verbs conjugated with avoir if the participle is preceded by a direct object. In that case, the participle agrees with the gender of the preceding direct object (according to Glanville Price &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; p354). Perhaps this is more complication than we need to cover in this lesson, though. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:03, 29 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hey Jonojet, I'd be really greatful if you'd consider commenting on my proposed restructure for the French Wikibook at [[User:Serge/French]]. As one of the main contributors to this book I value your opinion. Thanks, [[User:Serge|Serge]] 06:15, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can I ask -- in what way is this book intended to be different from the [[Help:Editing|Editing Help]] page? - [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 6 July 2005 11:15 (UTC)

== Merge ==

I suggest merging the entire [[MediaWiki User Guide]] into this [[Editing Wikitext]] book.
Both books seem to have exactly the same topic and audience -- people who edit the content at some MediaWiki instance.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:08, 31 May 2009 (UTC)
:Please do not do it.   The result is most likely the demise of both.   By all means improve this book by adding sections that have been forgotten;   subscripts and superscripts e.c.t., with a view to improving it further.   Mathematical notation needs a step by step instruction within this set in my opinion.   Perhaps somebody would care to have a whack at it?  Anonymouse. (0800 GMT , 7-Aug-2009)
: &amp;nbsp;
: I'd propose not to merge &quot;Editing Wikitext&quot; with &quot;Mediawiki User Guide&quot;. While the actual subject matter seems to be the same, the books have a very different style. The wikibook &quot;Editing Wikitext&quot; has a misleading title, as its subject matter is &quot;Editing Wikitext with Mediawiki&quot;. &quot;Editing Wikitext&quot; is chatty, and has colorful backgrounds and typographic niceties, while &quot;Mediawiki User Guide&quot; is terse in words, and plain in typography. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 09:45, 20 August 2009 (UTC)


: I find the book in it's current form very usefull :) I'm very happy i found it! The user guide should probley be the &quot;reference guide&quot; and this the &quot;user guide&quot; [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:00, 31 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;People began to do things in similar ways (it is a property of human nature to want to belong).&quot;

I'm not sure about this - aren't people more likely to do things the way other people in their civilization do because they've grown up used to that idea and they don't know any other way? For example, people here usually build rectangular doors not because they want to have the same door as everyone else, but because they don't think about any other kind of door. Humans may want to belong, but I don't think that's a main reason behind homogenized cultures. But I didn't edit that because I have no background in psychology or anthropology -- can anyone explain or comment?--[[User:Lady~Macbeth|Lady~Macbeth]] 6 July 2005 20:26 (UTC)

== Persians ==

I found that the section on 'Persians' is under development. I wish to remark here that I'm currently wiriting a book on [[Iranian History]]. You are free to borrow content from my book. Thanks :-) -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 03:28, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

== Source for dates? ==

According to &quot;Western Civilisations&quot; Lerner,Meacham,Burns 12th ed. [1993] vol. 1 p29 Sargon the Great conquered all of Sumer in 2320BCE and that Sumer gained it's independence in 2130BCE. The date for the conquering in the wikibook is 2125BCE. There seems to be a discrepency here! does anyone know the source for the date and others mentioned in the wikibook?

[[User:Zfishwiki|Zfishwiki]] ([[User talk:Zfishwiki|talk]]) 18:28, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== Criticism of content priorities ==

In my belief too much information is given regarding Sargon the Great and his descendents and their respective campaigns. This is supposed to be a world history, not a political history of Sumer. The time would be better spent on describing what life was like for the inhabitants of Sumer and on important technical innnovations such as the wheel, the lunar calendar and writing. And whilst we are on the subject of writing: what is all that guff about the Georgian Asomtavruli alphabet. It surely does not deserve a place in a brief History of Mesopotamia

also see my critique of the structure in the talk page of World History

[[User:Zfishwiki|Zfishwiki]] ([[User talk:Zfishwiki|talk]]) 18:38, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== Sources? ==

Could someone provide sources for the following?

From an anthropological viewpoint Sumerians belonged to the Caucasian, Mediterranean, Balkan European race.

For instance, the ancient Asomtavruli alphabet of the modern Georgian language has ethno-cultural contacts with the Sumerian world.

But Sumerian did not confide the Semites with the Majuscule alphabet, the secret spiritual alphabet that has a lot of similarity to ancient Georgian Asomtavruli alphabet

the Semites inhabiting the town of Akkad conquered Sumer and made the Sumerian scientists create an alphabet for them

 my big question is isn't the Abyssinian kingdom an ancient civilization i have read a lot about abyssinian(ethiopian) kingdom when i wrote my paper &amp; i have read that ethiopian civilization dates many  years back before christ birth. evidences for this are;1, Diodorus Siculus bkii, says that egypt was a colony of ethiopia &amp; the lows &amp; script of both lands were the same but the hieroglyphic script was universal in ethiopia but confined in priestly clasess alone in egypt,2; Herodotuss called ethiopians &quot;wise men occuping upper nile, men of long like, whose manners &amp; customs pertain to the golden age those virtous mortals whose feasts &amp; banquets ownerd by jupiter him self&quot; in greek times egyptians depicted ethiopia as an ideal state
3; the puranas,the ancient historical books of india speaks of the civilization of ethiopia as being older than that of egypt. This Sanskirt books mention the names of old kushite kings that were worshiped in india &amp; who were adopted &amp; changed to suit the fancy of the later people of greece &amp; rome.

==Some of the sentences read confusingly to me==
I feel I am of least average intelligence with decent comprehension.  Yet I feel some of the sentences are incomprehensible.  Too many facts crammed into one sentence perhaps.  For example - 
&quot;
The first known mention of Akkad is in an inscription of Enshakushanna of Uruk, where he claims to have defeated Agade—indicating that it was in existence well before the days of Sargon of Akkad, who the Sumerian kinglist claims to have built it.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transcendence addresses the nature of God to act within history, ''while being above human history''.  The Christian faith in Jesus illuminates this idea.  On the one hand, the presence of Jesus (for the Christian) reflects God's intervention in the world to provide hope and salvation.  On the other hand, Christians also believe that Jesus arose from the dead, and as such is observing human history without directly manipulating it.  So for the Christian, Jesus is considered transcendental.  Prayer reflects the hope that God will once again intervene in the course of human affairs, and influence a favorable outcome.

In developing a deeper understanding of transcendence, it is important for the theist to reconcile additional views of God's intervention in human history with the established idea of humanity's &quot;free will.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page was originially created in an effort to change [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks&amp;redirect=no this page] into a bona fide Wikibook about Wikibooks itself, including how to create them, and how to work with them (linking to other pages in the Wikibooks namespace as appropriate). The idea is to try to create a normative index to all these pages, while merging any duplicate content. It should include information on common conventions and practises. This may already exist somewhere else. Add it to the lists and categories of Wikibooks, and try to get it linked from the main page, since the main page doesn't really tell you what the site is all about, and the other pages are somewhat disorganised.

      <comment>popular tools to support configuration management; some related jargon; etc.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the Wikipedia description of [[Wikipedia:Configuration management | configuration management]].

Assessing the size of the development team and the scope of the
development are two things that need to be identified
very early in the project.  The larger the team, the more important it is to develop a configuration management
strategy that keeps the developers moving without stepping on each
others' toes (having a tool that supports a local developer sandbox,
integration, and release areas automatically as opposed to &quot;making them
by hand&quot;, like we've always done). The more complicated the development, the more complicated the configuration management strategy.  
Specifically, is support of multiple releases of the same product
necessary?  If so, a heavier weight configuration management strategy (one that supports
branching) is more desirable.

Being able to automatically re-create software from the
baseline repository is a ''must'', independent of size of project or team.
It provides product predictability expected of manufacturing processes.

Some popular tools to support configuration management include:
* Makefile and make: Originally these were designed to allow a programmer to tweak one source file and then type &quot;make&quot; to regenerate all the executables, without having to remember the exact name of each and every source file or the exact compile-time options for each one. Today, many programmers also include regression tests in the Makefile.
* distributed version control systems. A programmer uses a VCS to pull the latest version (tip) from the repository into a sandbox (also called a working directory), test it out, make some changes, and then commit any improvements back into the repository.
* ...

I hate postmodernism, I loathe every sentence of it. Nevertheless since it's so prevelant amongst sociologists a nod in the direction of Foccaults views of medicine might be neccessary. 

==Additional Topics Might Include==
*STDs
*Euthanasia
*theory:
**Structural-Functional – defines healthy
**Sick people are exempt from normal responsibilities
**Sick people need to want to get well
**Sick people need to seek help
**Symbolic Interaction
**Illness is socially constructed
**Social-Conflict
**Health care is a commodity under capitalism
**Profit Motive
**Politics of medicine

Please be aware that there has already been extensive work on the [[Portuguese|Portuguese Language Wikibook ]] on grammar. Maybe instead of creating a second book we could combine the two?? - [[User:Serge|Serge]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This web text is a reference for all topics in the mechanics of multibody systems. A format similar to that of an encyclopedia has been adopted to clearly take advantage of web style referencing and encourage other authors to add new topics or complete existing ones where they are lacking.

A topic is deemed complete when it includes the following elements:
* an overview of the method or operation outlining its application.
* a complete analytical description (and derivation where appropriate).
* example of computational implementation (in a MATLAB and Octave compatible m-file).

==&lt;center&gt;'''1873, 1874 &amp; 1882 Queen Victoria &quot;Sidefaces&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;==

1873:

1/2d Pink/Rose (Newspaper Rate)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
1874 First Sidefaces:

1d Lilac
2d Red
3d Brown
4d Maroon
6d Blue
1/ Green
2/ Red
5/ Grey
&lt;br&gt; (The 2/ and 5/ are very hard to find.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1882 Second Sidefaces:

1/2d Black
1d Red
2d Purple
21/2d Blue
3d Yellow
4d Green
5d Grey
6d Brown
8d Blue
1/ Chestnut

==&lt;center&gt;'''1898 Pictorials'''&lt;/center&gt;==

1/2d Mt Cook (black)
1d Taupo
2d Pembroke (red)
21/2d Wakatipu
3d Huias
4d Terraces
5d Otira
6d Kiwi (green)
8d Canoe
9d Terraces
1/ Kaka
2/ Milford
5/ Mt Cook
&lt;br&gt;
Notes: Four stamps from this set can also be found overprinted OFFICIAL: 3d Huias, 1/ Kaka, 2/ Milford and 5/ Mt Cook.
&lt;br&gt;
The 21/2d Wakatipu can also be found with the spelling variation &quot;Wakitipu&quot;, These are not hard to find and are most commonly seen unused.
&lt;br&gt;
The 5/ Mt Cook is not scarce but it is difficult to find in good condition with a regular cancellation. Fiscally used embossed, circular &quot;crown&quot; cancels, or pen cancels are common and worth much less than catalogue value, One leading NZ dealer sells fiscally used copies for $35NZ which is less than 1/20th of the catalogue price. Also beware of &quot;mint no gum&quot; of this stamp as most are fiscally used with the pen cancel cleaned off.

==&lt;center&gt;'''1900 Pictorials'''&lt;/center&gt;==

1/2d Mt Cook (green), 1d Terraces, 11/2d Boer War, 2d Pembroke, 4d Taupo, 6d Kiwi.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes: This set contains mostly reprints of designs from the 1898 pictorials, in different colors and values.

1d Zealandia (diagonal lines on globe)
3d Huias
6d Kiwi (red)
1/ Kaka

Notes: Same designs as earlier issues - but these are smaller (except for the zealandia which can be identified by the lines on the globe.) The Zealandia and 6d Kiwi can also be found overprinted Official.

1/2d Green
1d Zealandia Dominion
2d Mauve
3d Brown

1/2d Green
1d Red
11/2d Brown
2d Two Pence overprint on 1/2d Green
3d Brown
6d Purple
1/ Orange

Note: The 6d and 1/ are commonly found with heavy parcel cancels, these are worth considerably less than catalogue values.

==&lt;center&gt;'''1923 Map Stamp&lt;/center&gt;==

1d Red

==&lt;center&gt;'''1925 Dunedin Exhibition&lt;/center&gt;==

=Separable Variables: Real-World Examples=

This page gives some examples of where simple separable variable DEs are found in the world around us.

__TOC__

== Acceleration, velocity, and position ==

The classic real world example of differential equations is the relationship between acceleration, velocity, and position.

::&lt;math&gt;a(t)=v'(t)=x''(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

So if you're given an equation for acceleration, you can figure out both velocity and position.


===Example 1 - Constant Acceleration ===

Lets say that accelearation is a constant, g  (the acceleration due to gravity, or about 10 m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The initial velocity at ''t''=0 is ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The initial position is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Solve for ''v'' and ''x''.

First, you need to solve for ''v''. I.w.r.t.''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;v'=a=g \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int v' dv=\int g dt \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v=gt+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug in to find C.

::&lt;math&gt;v_0=g \times 0+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C=v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v(t)=gt+v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now we solve for ''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;x'=v=gt+v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int x' dt=\int (gt+v_0)dt&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+C&lt;/math&gt;

Again, now we solve for C.

::&lt;math&gt;x_0=\frac{1}{2}g \times 0^2+v_0 \times 0+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x_0=C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+x_0&lt;/math&gt;

Anyone who has studied physics will recognize this as the basic equation for position for an object undergoing a constant force in one dimension.

===Example 2 - Resistive Medium ===

Lets say we're traveling through a medium that resists movement.  In this medium, &lt;math&gt;a=-v^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Solve for ''v'' and ''x'', given that the initial velocity was 10 m/s and the initial displacement was 0 m.

::&lt;math&gt;a=v'=-v^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=-v^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{v^2}dv=\int -1 dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{v}=-t+C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{t+C}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that as ''t'' increases, velocity decreases.  This is what you'd expect if the medium was resisting your movement and slowing you down over time. Now substitute in the initial velocity at ''t''=0

:&lt;math&gt;10=\frac{1}{0+C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

Now to solve for ''x''.

:&lt;math&gt;v=x'=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{1}=\frac{dt}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int 1 dx=\int \frac{1}{t+0.1} dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=ln(t+0.1)+D \,&lt;/math&gt;

The position increases throughout, but it increases ever more slowly as time goes on.  This is again what you'd expect for a medium resisting motion.  Since velocity is never less than 0, we never stop going forward, but we go exponentially less far over time. Putting in our boundary conditions,

:&lt;math&gt;0=ln(0+0.1)+D \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D=-ln(0.1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=ln(t+0.1)-ln(0.1)=ln(10t+1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Exponential Growth and Decay ==

One of the most common differential equations in science is 

:&lt;math&gt;y'=ky \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

The solution to this is

:&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^{kt} \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

If ''k'' is positive, this is called exponential growth.  If ''k'' is negative, its exponential decay.  Both are used in science, for very different reasons.

=== Population Growth ===

Lets say we have a group of animals in the wild.  We want to know how many animals there will be in ''t'' years.  We know how many there are now.  We also know the birth rate and death rate.  Can we solve this problem?

Of course we can.  First, we need to figure out the rate of growth.  If the birth rate is B, and the death rate is D, the total rate of change is (B-D).  Since this is the rate, we need to multiply it by the current population to get the population growth.  The final equation looks like

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=(B-D)P \,&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the population. That looks like the equation for exponential growth, doesn't it?  As a matter of fact, change the 'delta' to a differential, and it is.  The growth factor is (B-D).  

==== Example 3 ====

:In a certain population of rabbits, the birth rate is 10%.  The death rate is 15%.  The initial population is 100.  How many rabbits are there after 10 years?  Will we always have rabbits?

From our solution to the exponential equation:

::&lt;math&gt;P=Ce^{(B-D)t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;100=Ce^{(B-D)\times 0}=Ce^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C=100 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;P=100e^{-0.05t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;P(10)=100e^{-0.5}\approx 61&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, we will not always have rabbits.  Since the growth rate is negative, they will eventually go extinct.  (Note:  we will never actually hit 0, but in real life you can't have less than 1 rabbit.  If we were measuring a continuous property instead of a discrete one, we would always have something, it would just get very small).

=== Radioactive Decay ===

Another situation for exponential growth is radioactive isotopes.  If you have a sample of radioactive material, individual atoms will randomly decay or not decay.  While you can't know exactly how many atoms decay and when, you do know the average rate of decay.  Every &amp;lambda; years, half of the atoms left will decay.  This period of time, &amp;lambda;, is called a half life. The ''activity'' of the sample (how many decays per second) is called A. Mathematically, this looks like

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt}=\lambda A&lt;/math&gt;

These problems look just like the problem above.  Just like rabbits, we will eventually run out of radioactive atoms as well.

1) f(x,y) has no discontinuities, so a solution exists.  &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial {f} }{\partial {y} }&lt;/math&gt; has no discontinuities, so the solution is unique.

3) f(x,y) has discontinuities at y=1 and -1, but not at 0 so a solution exists.  &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial {f} }{\partial {y} }&lt;/math&gt; has no discontinuities at (0,16) so the solution is unique.

4) f(x,y) has discontinuities at y&lt;0, but not at 1 so a solution exists.  &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial {f} }{\partial {y} }&lt;/math&gt; is discontinuous at 1, so the solution is not unique

7) &lt;math&gt;y'=y^3sec^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y^3}=sec^2(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{y^3}=\int sec^2(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2y^2}=tan(x)+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2tan(x)+C)}}&lt;/math&gt;


8) &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{5y^2+6}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{ydy}{5y^2+6}=dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{ydy}{5y^2+6}=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{10}ln(5y^2+6)=x+C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\sqrt{Ce^{10x}-\frac{6}{5}}&lt;/math&gt;


9) &lt;math&gt;y'=x^3/y^3&lt;/math&gt;

12) &lt;math&gt;y'=\frac{cos(x)}{sin(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;sin(y)dy=cos(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;

14) &lt;math&gt;y'=7y^2,y(5)=9&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y^2}=7dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{y^2}=\int 7dx&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Restoring current version.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides general information about configuring a wireless hotspot.

== Components ==
Wireless networks require hardware, and to a lesser degree, software.

=== Hardware ===
At a minimum, the following are needed:

*A router — This typically connects to a high-speed internet connection and manages the network's communication with the Internet. If you're dealing with a network not connected to the Internet (Rare), a switch or hub may be used. If you're only connecting two computers to each other (An &quot;Ad Hoc&quot; network), only adapters are needed.
*Adapters for each machine on the network — These will be expansion cards for  desktop computer and [[w:PCMCIA|PCMCIA]] cards for laptops.

If you have a large area to cover, separate antennas and/or access points may be needed.

=== Software ===
All computers on the network need to have an operating system version (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc) that can deal with wireless networking.

* All Windows from 98 on have some degree of ability in this field. 98, ME and 2000 require additional software and drivers. XP with the latest updates from Microsoft will work automatically with many network cards, Vista will work natively.
* Mac OS 9 has some wireless networking ability, 10 will work natively.
* Most recent Linux kernels have built-in wireless networking capability.

=== Notes ===
Most wireless routers also have 4 Ethernet (Hardwired, conventional networking) ports on them. If you have a machine that you don't or can't put on the new network, consider locating it and the router close together so it can get on the network by a cable.

Both adapters, routers and other ancillary parts can range in price from 20 USD up to several hundred. A good advice is to go with a well known brand, the currently dominant three are [[w:D-link|D-link]], [[w:Linksys|Linksys]] and [[w:Netgear|Netgear]].

== Hardware setup ==
Assuming a basic router-and-clients setup, the following hardware will be needed:

# At least one router
# A wireless adapter for each machine that doesn't already have one (Some laptops have built in antennas)
# A cable and adapter for each machine that will be wired into the network
# Depending on the layout of your house and devices, you may need some repeaters. The following section will explain this.

=== Location of equipment ===
Most likely your router will have to connect to your modem (If you don't have an Internet connection, you can disregard this). If this is in a central location for your planned uses, then you will likely not need anything beyond the router and adapters. If you're installing the modem and are planning to have wireless networking, consider installing it in a central location.

If not, you can run more wiring in your house to get it to the router, or accept a weaker signal in the parts of the house farther from the router. If this is an issue, you may want to invest in a repeater that can bring your wireless signal to the far corners of your house.

As discussed previously, wireless signal strength is of significant importance. Some points of information about signals and permeability:

*Wireless signals can pass through drywall relatively easily, but if it must pass through a significant number of walls the signal will degrade rapidly.
*Wireless signals do not travel well through cinder block walls.
*Wireless signals can be disrupted by ducts of a climate control system.
*Water can greatly distort wireless signals.  Take into account aquariums, sinks, and water pipes.  Remember, the human body is 66% water, so locations with a high density of people can distort wireless signals. This also includes rain or humidity, so consider bath/shower rooms or other regularly wet areas.

If you want coverage outdoors (which can be very nice during good weather with a laptop!), consider locating the router or a repeater near a window facing the direction you want to cover. An upper floor can be an excellent place for a router or signal propagator for coverage around the outside of the building, and possibly inside as well.

=== Wiring up the router ===
Most residential routers are fairly simple to set up and have standardized markings. The usual setup is this:

# Plug the Ethernet (data) cable from your cable or DSL modem into the &quot;WAN&quot; port (If your modem has USB and Ethernet ports, use the Ethernet port and don't connect anything to the USB port).
# Plug any computers you wish to hard-wire to your router to one of the &quot;LAN&quot; ports. If every computer is to connect wirelessly, skip this step.
# If possible, disconnect the antenna, or shield it from transmission.
# Shut off/unplug your modem for about 15 seconds
# Restore power to your modem
# Plug in your router

The above steps '''may''' or '''may not''' cause the router to obtain an internet connection from the modem. These are VERY generic steps, which will ''sometimes'' work if the user's Internet Service Provider uses DHCP. If not, the router must be manually configured, and only the physical connections listed here will be of use to the user.

After a few seconds (At most), the router should start up with the default settings. Leave the antenna disconnected/blocked until you've had a chance to change the wireless security settings, as router defaults are notoriously insecure.

===Router configuration===
The vast majority of residential routers are configured by a &quot;web-based interface&quot; (A webpage which you can view with Firefox or IE or whatever you use to surf the web).

To access this webpage, a special address (called an [[w:IP address|IP address]]) is used. This is normally detailed in the users manual or &quot;quick start guide&quot;. The username and password to be used are also listed. If a &quot;quick start wizard&quot; comes up, you can follow it through or dismiss it. The rest of this guide assumes that it didn't appear or was dismissed.

Once logged in to the router, the first steps should be to strengthen the security. See below...

Expansion cards should be installed with the computer turned off. PCMCIA cards for laptops can be inserted at any time. If the operating system doesn't automatically detect and set up the new networking hardware, try using the disc that came with it.

What is the purpose of this article?

Is this article about system behavior and the major types of systems or is it specifically about IT systems?

Is this supposed to be a monlogue against the Great Satan, Microsoft, or is it supposed to be about systems theory?

There appears to be too much emphasis on IT systems with quite a bit of half baked philosophy thrown in.</text>

Robots need some form of artificial intelligence in order to be able to navigate around a room or to solve a problem. Such AI can range from simple, as in following particular rules when a specific input is received, through more complicated, as in fuzzy logic rules or simple neural nets, to complicated, as in state of the art machine learning methods.

How complicated you can make your AI depends on a few factors:
*Processing power: How fast is your microprocessor, is it 8-, 16-, or 32-Bit, How many microprocessors do you use?
*Available memory: Both temporary and &quot;permanent&quot; memory. Limited amounts of memory restrict how much data can be held at a time, e.g. a map of the surroundings, sensor history, movement history. Systems with much permanent storage and little ram are slower than systems with large amounts of ram.
*Your knowledge: AI is a very broad subject. Parts of it are very math intensive and can be tricky to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Notation ==

There are several notations; please refer to this
[http://www.vanderblonk.com/tutorial/before-you-start#notation notation guide].

Briefly:

* There are six sides to the cube, presented as Front, Back, Left, Right, Up and Down. They are usually referred to by their one-letter abbreviations.
* In the isometric diagrams below, where a corner points out at you, you see the F, R and U sides. The F faces to the left.
* Movements are presented as one quarter rotation (90 degrees) of an external face per movement. This means that the center tile colors are not changed. In our diagrams, F is blue, R is red and U is yellow. The other three colors are typically orange opposite red, green opposite blue and white opposite yellow
* Quarter-rotations of that face's layer default to clockwise. Counter-clockwise rotations are often referred to as &quot;inverted&quot; and indicated by &amp;prime;, for instance, R&amp;prime;. (The &amp;prime; is commonly read as &quot;prime&quot;, &quot;apostrophe&quot;, &quot;tick mark&quot;, &quot;anti-clockwise&quot;, &quot;anti&quot; or &quot;i&quot; for inverted). Half-rotations (180 degrees) are indicated by the digit &quot;2&quot;, for instance, R2 (meaning 2 quarter-rotations following the one-letter abbreviation).
* To see what is happening on the sides of the other three colors, rotate the cube as a whole, described as rotating along the ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' space axis, all pointing out of the page. ''x'' is R, ''y'' is U and ''z'' is F, but since this sort of move also changes the colors of the center-tiles, it is used sparingly.

== Example solve ==

As an example, let's consider a complete solve. 25 move scrambles are used to mix up the cube. Our sample scramble is:

: U B&amp;prime; R2 D&amp;prime; U&amp;prime; R U2 B R&amp;prime; B2 L2 R F2 R2 U2 R B U2 F2 L2 F2 D R B2 R2 ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2RF2R2U2RBU2F2L2F2DRB2R2&amp;scripttype=Generator demo: scramble])

The solve is:

: R&amp;prime; B R D2 F2 L U&amp;prime; F U R&amp;prime; D R F D F&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F U2 R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R U2 U&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F U U B&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; B U&amp;prime; ''y''2 F D2 F2 R F R&amp;prime; B&amp;prime; D F D&amp;prime; B D F&amp;prime; F2 D M D2 M&amp;prime; D F2 (54 moves, [http://vanderblonk.com/wp-content/plugins/rubik/cubeapplet.php?initscript=UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2RF2R2U2RBU2F2L2F2DRB2R2&amp;alg=R'BRD2F2LU'FUR'DRFDF'F'D'FU2R'D'RU2U'F'D'FUUB'D'BU'y2FD2F2RFR'B'DFD'BDF'F2DMD2M'DF2&amp;scriptType=Generator demo])

== Faster methods ==

While the above method may be good for a beginner, it is too slow to be used in [[w:speedcubing|speedcubing]]. The most popular method for speedcubers is very similar to the method above, except steps 2 and 3 are combined, and the last layer is solved in two steps instead of three. The inventor of this common method is [[w:Jessica Fridrich|Jessica Fridrich]]. With this method, speedcubers with good dexterity and memory can average under 20 seconds after a few months of hard practice. However, to learn the method you must learn 78 algorithms. There are methods just as fast that require far fewer algorithms to be memorized. Here is a brief synopsis of several popular [[w:speedcubing|speedcubing]] methods:

=== Layer by Layer methods ===

'''Fridrich Method:''' A very fast First 2 Layers (or F2L) method, start by solving a cross on one face, then proceeding to solve the First 2 Layers pairing up edge and corner combinations and putting them into their ''slot''. This is followed by solving the Last Layer in two steps, first orienting all pieces (one color on the last layer), then permuting them (solving the ring around the last layer). The basic method has 78 algorithms (without the inverse of them), and is recognized as one of the fastest methods currently in use. [http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html]

'''F2L Alternatives:''' Methods that follow the same principle as Fridrich's method, but using different algorithms. Many of the algorithms are shared but there are a few differences, so there should be one to suit your fingers:
* Bob Burton: [http://www.cubewhiz.com/]
* Shotaro 'Macky' Makisumi: [http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/]
* Speedcubing.com Collection: speedcubinglovers.com

'''ZB method:''' This method was developed independently by [[w:Ron van Bruchem|Ron van Bruchem]] and [[w:Zbigniew Zborowski|Zbigniew Zborowski]] in 2003. After solving the cross and three c/e pairs, the final F2L pair is solved while orienting LL edges. This is known as ZBF2L. The last layer can then be solved in one algorithm, known as ZBLL. The ultimate method requires several hundred algorithms. [[w:Lars Vandenbergh|Lars Vandenbergh]]'s site has ZBF2L algorithms, used in his VH system. [http://www.cubezone.be/zbf2l.html] ZBLL algorithms can be found on Doug Li's webpage. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Hardwick/zbll.html]

'''ZZ method:''' This method was created in 2006 by Zbigniew Zborowski, the co-creator of the ZB method. It has three basic steps: EOLine, F2L, and LL. [http://cube.crider.co.uk] [http://www.emsee.110mb.com/Speedcubing/ZZ%20speedcubing%20system.html] EOLine stands for Edge Orientation Line. The orientation of edges is defined as either good or bad. Good meaning the edge can be placed into the correct position with a combination of R, L, U, D, F2, or B2, moves. Bad meaning it would require an F, F&amp;prime;, B, or B&amp;prime; move to be moved into its correct position. Any F, F&amp;prime;, B, or B&amp;prime; move will cause the four edges on that slice to change from its current state, good or bad, to the opposite state. The Line portion of EOLine is forming a line on the bottom of the cube that consists of the DB edge and the DF edge in their correct positions. The next step is F2L, First 2 Layers. It uses block building techniques to solve the two remaining 1x2x3 blocks of the F2L using only R, U, and L moves. This allows for very quick solving of F2L as it does not require cube rotation. The final step of the ZZ method is LL, Last Layer, and it can be broken into multiple steps or maintained as one depending on the algorithms used. There are two main approaches to this method OLL [http://cubefreak.net/speed/fourlook.html] and PLL [http://jmbaum.110mb.com/pll.htm], Orientation of LL and Permutation of LL, and COLL [http://jmbaum.110mb.com/coll.htm] and EPLL [http://cubefreak.net/speed/fourlook.html], Corner OLL and Edge PLL. The first, OLL and PLL, is to use one of 7 algorithms to solve the top layer (OLL) and then permute the edge and corners into their correct positions (PLL), this requires 21 algorithms. The total algorithms required for the first approach of solving LL is 28. The second approach to solving LL is to solve the top and the corners in one algorithm (COLL) and then solve the edges (EPLL). COLL requires 40 algorithms and EPLL requires 4, making the total 44 algorithms. The second approach is faster due the ease of recognition and speed of execution of EPLL.

'''VH method:''' Created by [[w:Lars Vandenbergh|Lars Vandenbergh]] and [[w:Dan Harris|Dan Harris]], as a stepping stone from Fridrich to ZB. First, F2L without one c/e-pair is solved with Fridrich or some other method. Then the last pair is paired up, but not inserted. Then it's inserted to F2L and LL edges are oriented in one go. Then, using COLL, corners of LL are solved while preserving edge orientation. Then edges are permuted. [http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/]

=== Block methods ===

'''Petrus System:''' Created by [[w:Lars Petrus|Lars Petrus]]. One of the shortest methods in terms of face turns per solve, the Petrus method is often used in fewest moves contests. Petrus reasoned that as you construct layers, further organization of the cube's remaining pieces is restricted by what you have already done. For a layer-based solution to continue after constructing the first layer, the solved portion of the cube would have to be temporarily disassembled while the desired moves were made, then reassembled afterwards. Petrus sought to get around this [[w:quagmire|quagmire]] by solving the cube outwards from one corner, leaving him with unrestricted movement on several sides of the cube as he progressed. There are not as many algorithms to learn compared to the other F2L methods, but it takes a lot of dedication to master. The basis of the method is to create a 2 × 2 × 3 block on the cube, then proceed to solve a 3 × 3 × 2 block, but also flipping the edges on the Last Layer. Then the Last Layer is solved in two steps, first corners and then edges. [http://lar5.com/cube/]

'''Heise method:''' Created by [[w:Ryan Heise|Ryan Heise]]. First, one inner square and three outer squares are built intuitively. Then they are placed correctly while orienting remaining edges. After that you create two c/e-pairs, and solve the remaining edges. The last 3 corners are solved using a [[w:commutator|commutator]]. [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/]

'''Gilles Roux Method:''' Another unique method, but works in blocks like the Petrus method. You start by solving a 1 × 2 × 3 block and then solve another 1 × 2 × 3 block on the other side of the cube. Next you solve the last 4 corners and finally the edges and centers. Has only 24 algorithms to learn. [http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html]

=== Corners first methods ===

'''Waterman Method:''' Created by Mark Waterman. Advanced corners first method, with about 90 algorithms to learn. Solve a face on L, do the corners on R and then solve the edges. An extremely fast method. [http://www.rubikscube.info]

'''Jelinek Method:''' Created by Josef Jelinek. This method is very similar to Waterman's. [http://rubikscube.info/]

Create a solved 2 × 2 × 2 cube on one corner and rotate the remaining blocks (it may take a while but you will eventually solve it).


== Three &quot;Levels of Difficulty&quot; ==

A procedure has been developed whereby a complete beginner can learn and master the Cube by moving up through three self-contained &quot;Levels of Difficulty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McNaughton, D.|title=The Rubik Cube: A three-stage approach to mastering it|journal=Junior News|date=November 1989 - February 1990|publisher=Al-Nisr, Dubai, UAE|url=http://dlmcn.com/rubik2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest level deliberately maintains configurations in which every face exhibits horizontal and vertical symmetry, so it also enables a number of &quot;pretty patterns&quot; to be constructed - such as Chequers, Crosses, Stripes and Central 'Dots'. Level Two involves solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. Techniques acquired in those earlier stages, remain useful when continuing up to the next level.

Here are some of the more popular solution pages listed. All are different, although they mostly use a similar layer by layer method. Usually you will need Java to see the animations used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Physical Therapy ==

== Home Exercises and Stretching == 

A highly recommended book to start with is Robin McKenzie's &quot;7 Steps to a Pain-Free Life: How to Rapidly Relieve Back and Neck Pain&quot;. These exercises don't help everybody, but for a sizable portion of the population they do a great deal of good.

Also, consult Pete Egoscue's &quot;Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain&quot;. You can also receive expert advice from Postural Restoration Therapists and Posture Alignment Specialists (PAS). See egoscueuniversity.com and posturalrestoration.com

== Other Behavior Modifications == 

Many people with lower back pain find that bad posture while sitting contributes to their pain. A good chair can help alleviate this problem, but a cheaper and more universal solution is a lumbar support roll. These come in many forms, from the home-made to professionally designed solutions sold in most back-pain stores.

A lumbar roll is placed just above the belt line, while sitting up straight in a normal chair. It causes your spine to bend forward in the same way it should naturally, but is often lost with age.

Two easy home alternatives to a lumbar roll is a roll of paper towels (Small sizes work best) or a rolled up towel.

== Overview ==

[[Image:Blender3d-ejemplo_logo_2d.jpg|right|200px]]


We will be using this graphic as a template for a 3d logo, tracing it, then discarding the 2d image. ''(Click thru to get the larger sized version, for you to follow along with)''


{{Clear}}

== Load the background image into blender ==

=== Basics of the background image panel ===
If you haven't already done so, open blender and select one of the orthogonal view angles by pressing '''NUM7''' (top), '''NUM3''' (side), or '''NUM1.''' (front).  At the bottom of the 3D viewport on the left, there are some menus, click '''View''' -&gt; '''Background Image'''

[[Image:blender-background-dialog.jpg|right|200px]]
A small window will appear containing just one button marked '''use background image'''; click this button.  A few more buttons will appear.  One of them says '''image:''' and has a small button with a picture of a folder on it; click this button. You are now presented with a file selection screen. Using the navigation techniques from the previous tutorials, find your 2D jpeg image on your computer, click the file in the list once then click the '''Select Image''' button at the top right of the screen.

Noob note: The image is only displayed in orthogonal view. If perspective view is enabled, toggle to orthogonal view by pressing '''NUM5'''. ''(The image will not be rendered as it is not part of your scene.)''

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender_background_image_dialog.JPG|right|200px]]

Once a background is selected you'll have a dialog like this one. (Note: This tutorial was originally generated from Blender v2.37. v2.43 has been added - older versions may differ.) The background dialog buttons are described below:

{{Clear}}

=== Details of the background image panel ===
The [[Image:Blender_use_background_image_button.JPG|inline|Use Background Image Button v2.37]] is a toggle button that turns display of the image on or off. Turning the button off will not clear the settings; it just hides the image. When you turn the button on again, your previous settings are back. Try it - click the button a few times. In v2.43 the equivalent button is the  [[Image:Blender_use_background_image_button_v2p43.JPG|inline|Use Background Image Button v2.43]] button.

Image selection is controlled on the row labeled [[Image:Blender_image_select.JPG|inline|Blender_Image Select v2.37]]. There are 2 buttons, a text box, and a final button. The first button [[Image:Blender_image_select_button1.JPG|inline|Browsing Image Select v2.37]] is used for browsing for an image. The 2nd button [[Image:Blender_image_select_button2.JPG|inline|Image Select History v2.27]]is for selecting an image from a history list. (This will be empty for the first time. Selecting it now will display the image you currently have selected.) The text box [[Image:Blender_image_select_textbox.JPG|inline|Image Select Textbox v2.37]] allows typing in the file directly. The [[Image:Blender_image_remove.JPG|inline|Image Remove]] button removes the current background image. Version 2.43 is the same with the addition of the [[Image:Blender_refresh.JPG‎|inline|Image Refresh]] button that refreshes the image or movie, and the [[Image:Blender_users_count.JPG|inline|Image Users Count]] button which shows the number of users of the image block.

The third row is called Texture and will not be used for this tutorial.

The fourth line, labeled '''blend''' controls the transparency of the background image with a slider. A setting of 0 is completely solid and 1 is completely transparent. You can adjust it by clicking left or right of the knob for gradual changes, clicking and dragging on the slider for rough settings or clicking directly on the '''blend''' text for numeric entry.

The use of the blend function will become obvious once we start tracing our logo. For now, play around with it, see how it changes the image, and put it back to the 0.500 default.

The fifth line,  '''size''', controls the size of the image. This size setting is independent of the zoom for the 3D view window. To see how the size works move the default cube off to the side so that you can see both the cube, the background dialog and the background image. Now watch both the cube and image as you change the size. Notice how the image changes size but the cube doesn't? Now press '''NUM+''' and '''NUM-''' to change the view's zoom. Now both the cube and image change size.

The final row controls the X and Y offset for the image. These controls move the image up and down (Y) or left and right (X). These settings can be useful if you need to reposition the image from the default position. Like the size, these offset values are independent of the view. As you change the offset values the cube you added earlier won't move. Now scroll the view using by clicking and dragging the '''SHIFT MMB''' and notice how the cube and image move together?

Once you start tracing the image you won't be using the size or offset setting.

=== Details for version 2.6X===

the check box left to the title indicate if you can see the image or not.
the ''Axis'' menu indicate in what views you could see the image.

the button ''Image'' and ''Movie Clip'' indicate of course if you use a Image or a Movie.

the button to left of the text box allows to choose the image from the exist, the text box say the name of the image, the F botton make the image a fake user, the folder sign allow to upload a image, and the X sign delete the link to the picture.

== Delete the cube ==
Delete the cube (select it, press '''XKEY''' and select '''All''' from the '''Erase''' menu), and set the size so that the entire image is viewable. Then set  both the X and Y offsets to 0. 

Set the view to top view ('''NUM7''') for the rest of the tutorial!

Finally minimize the Background Image dialog. You'll only need it to adjust the blend setting until you finish tracing.

== Introducing the Bezier Curve ==

The [[w:Bézier curve|Bézier Curve]] allows drawing graceful, complex curves and only requires a few points. Specifically, it only requires 4 points for a curve: two end points and two control points. 

For the moment set the blend to 1 on the Background Image dialog. With the center of the 3D view still selected, press '''SPACE -&gt; Add -&gt; Curve -&gt; Bézier Curve'''.  Alternatively you can use the '''Add''' menu at the top of the screen or press '''SHIFT -&gt; AKEY''' to jump directly to the add menu. Be sure to be in EDIT MODE not OBJECT MODE.  

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-bezier-curve-initial.PNG|frame|right|The Curve you added.]]

Unlike the traditional Bézier Curve each Bézier vertex has 3 points. I've labeled the 3 points for the left vector: A, B and C.  

Just like any other vertex you select the control points and the end points with '''RMB''' and move them with standard commands like '''GKEY''', '''SKEY''', '''EKEY''' or '''RKEY'''. if you wish to rotate, scale, or move the whole curve, then select all the vertices on the curve using one one of the various selection methods, and then use the '''GKEY''', '''SKEY''', or '''RKEY'''

'''Point A''' is an end point. The curve will always go through this point.
'''Points B and C''' are control points. These points influence the path of the curve as it leaves '''Point A'''. Because the path stops at '''A''', '''Point B''' has no real effect on the path. Instead '''B''' is currently locked with '''C'''. (If you move either '''B''' or '''C''', the other will move.) We will ''fix'' '''Point B''' to move independently a little later.

The control points have 2 effects on the path exiting the end point: direction and distance (these are termed slope and magnitude in math circles) from '''Point A'''. The direction will provide the direction that the path will follow when it leaves '''A''' and the distance will determine how long the path follows that direction before it starts making its way to the curve's next point. 

 &lt;!-- these images never seems to have been uploaded[[Image:Beziersharpturn0001.gif|thumb|right|N.B. To easily make sharp turns; take ''B'' point and move it really close to ''A''.]] [[Image:Beziersharpturn0002.gif|thumb|right|Take ''C'' point and move it in the exact direction you want to turn]] [[Image:Beziersharpturn0003.gif|thumb|right|(with ''C'' selected) Press EKEY to ''extend'' the Bezier, and drag it out; you will find it goes where you pointed ''C''! ''--[[User:Jawboot|Jawboot]] 01:30, 30 April 2006 (UTC)'']]--&gt;

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-bezier-curve-sample.PNG|right|200px]]
The example to the right shows how the control points influence the path of the curve. In the top picture, we see three curves. The top curve is the default curve. In the next curve down, '''C''' has been moved to give a drastically different direction. Notice how the path leaving '''A''' moves away from the other end point. The third curve, the distance was changed dramatically. Watch the path move much higher than the other two curves.

In the bottom example, I've built a heart shape using just the points shown. ''Dragging the bottom end point down will make the shape closer to a leaf.'' You'll be able to do the same at the end of this tutorial. Go ahead move around the points for the curve and see how they all interact. Get a good feel working with the curve and when you're ready we'll move on to tracing.

Now that you know how to work with a bezier curve set blend back to 0.5 on the Background Image dialog so we can start tracing.

{{Clear}}

== Modeling the lighting bolt ==
=== Rough Tracing ===

If you don't already have a curve add one now. It will help to move the curve to the center of the yellow lightning bolt.

[[Image:blender-curve-tools-convert.PNG|frame|right|Curve Tools for Blender 3D version 2.37]]The first step in tracing is to click the Polygon convert button on the curve tools panel. You'll find this in button on the '''Buttons Window'''. You may need to select the '''Edit Panel'''. Press '''F9''' if this panel isn't visible. 
In Blender 2.59, the 3D View panel's Tool Shelf ('''T''') houses the Curve Tools, including Set Spline Type, from which you should select Poly. You must be in Edit Mode to reach the Curve Tools.

'''Noob Note:'''  The 'Curve Tool' panel will not appear if you don't have a bezier curve already placed.  I learned this the hard way.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-rough-trace-points.png|right|200px]] Next, move the vertices of the curve to the points shown in the image to the left. This is called Rough Tracing because you don't need to exactly trace the image. 

You only need to approximate the image. Moving the vertices should be done using the instructions from the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating a Simple Hat|Creating a Simple Hat]] tutorial.

''Note: Selecting the best place to put a vertex is a bit of an art that you'll acquire as you work with curves. For now follow the arrows along the cutouts and place each of the vertices as shown.''

This tracing uses all the vertices of the polygon. Other cases, you'll need add or remove extra vertices by selecting the end point of your curve press '''CTRL''' and click '''LMB'''. At the place you clicked a new vertex will appear connected to your curve.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-rough-trace-final.png|right|200px]]
After moving the last vertex, we finish the rough tracing by pressing the '''CKEY''' to close the polygon. You should see an image similar to the one on the right. (If you only have an outline switch your view port shading to solid by pressing the '''ZKEY''' for now.)


'''Question''': how do you close the polygon in blender 2.61? '''Answer'''_ ALT + CKEY  pressing c key alone brings up circle select.

''Note: In Blender 2.63 and certain prior versions, the curve needs to be changed from 3D to 2D shape in order for the polygon to show up, else you get an error. This can be changed by going into Object Data and, under the Shape heading, switching the curve from 3D to 2D.''

Notice how the polygon doesn't cover all of the yellow of the bolt and how in some places the polygon fails to conform to the shape of the bolt. This is expected and should not be a cause for concern. We correct this in the next section.

{{Clear}}


Once you've finished several logos you should begin to get a feel for the required placement of vertices. Until then, here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:

* A gradual curve may only require a single vertex.
* Tight curves will likely require two closely placed vertices.
* Curves may not require a vertex at all - you can define some curves using the control points of the adjacent vertices. We did this for both of the inside curves of the bolt above.
* Corners require a single vertex placed where the curve bends. A square, for instance, requires four vertices - one at each corner - to be modeled properly. 
* The end point of a curve will always be on the curve. So should all of the vertices you place.
  
We are now ready to move onto the next step modeling the logo.

=== Polishing the Tracing ===

Press '''ZKEY''' to return to wire frame mode, then Press the '''Bézier''' convert button to convert the polygon back to a curve. 

This will convert your polygon back into a curve. Nothing obvious will happen. If you look close, you should notice the number of points on the curve tripled. When you converted the curve back to a Bézier curve, Blender changed all of the polygon vertices to Bézier vertices. While the polygon vertex is a single point the Bézier vertex is made of an end point and 2 control points. So the extra points are the control points of the Bézier vertices. These control points are placed along the curve to produce the same shape as the converted polygon.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-position-control-points.png|right|150px]] Our job is to move the control and end points so that the curve follows the edge of the bolt. The trick is to move the 2 control points between adjacent end points to bend the curve to the edge of bolt. First, move the right control point of the top-left vertex. This should pull the curve from its end point to more closely match the line of our bolt. After placing this point, we move to the next control point following a clockwise direction around the bolt. Use the '''RMB''' to select the point you want to change and move it with '''GKEY''' to place it.

'''Noob Note:''' if you wind up with pink lines when you select the contral handels, that means you hit '''HKEY''' by accident, and have put the control point in manual. to correct this hit '''HKEY''' again to put it back into &quot;easy&quot; or auto mode.

As you move the second point notice how the curve exiting the first end point is drawn away from the edge of the bolt being traced. We now have to adjust the first control point again to get that line back on track. This quickly turns into a balancing act adjusting each set of control points. The trick is to make smaller movements for each iteration of adjustments. Make a game of it and move the control points all along the bolt. Always move along the clockwise direction. This practice is not just for consistency, it keeps your place and ensures that moving a control point doesn't change a portion of the curve that you've already completed. In time you learn to move the first point only part of the way. Then moving the second brings the curve for the first into correct alignment.

If you have some trouble aligning the curve to the edge of the bolt, consider adding a new point. There are two (at least) ways to accomplish this:
* Select 2 points that surround the problem spot where you want a new vertex and click the Subdivide button on the Curve Tools 1 tool panel.
* If near an end point, Select it, press the '''CKEY''' to open the curve, then '''Control+LMB''' click to add a new point beyond the end of the selected final vertex. Press the '''CKEY''' to reclose the curve.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-position-2.png|frame|right|Adding a new end point]] The new end point should be positioned and then you have to adjust the curve on both sides of the end point you move. Any time you move an end point be sure that the curve going into both adjacent (clockwise and counter-clockwise) end points still aligns with the edge of the bolt.


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-find-defects.png|frame|left|Finding trace defects]] Once you've made the complete circuit around the bolt, you're ready for the final polishing of the edge of the curve. Press the '''TAB''' to switch to the object mode. This makes the polishing easier as Blender hides the points and lines for editing the curve. Now zoom in on the bolt's edge using the '''NUM+''' or '''Control+LMB''' drag. Use '''Shift+MMB''' drag the screen so that you closely observe the entire edge of the bolt while zoomed in closely. Look for places where the curve pulls away from the edge. 

Also look for sharp bends at each of the end points that should be smooth. You can see several defects that I found in my project after tracing the bolt. Switch back into edit mode to fix the curve and then go back into object mode to look for more defects.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-fix-defects.png|frame|right|Correcting poorly shaped curve]] Sharp end points are adjusted by decreasing the angle between end point and the control points. Many times that is impossible to do, without messing up what you're trying to draw, so the other way is to add more curves by subdividing ( '''WKEY''' -&gt; subdivide )the existing curve between two end points, and playing with the control points to get a nice smooth curve,

Places where the curve pulls away from the edge can be resolved by moving the control point closer to the edge. In the above image the curve was found to have been pulled away from the edge. This was fixed by moving the control point a little to the left.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png|left|thumb|Final Polished Curve]] Here's the final polished curve for my project. It is shown in both edit mode and object mode so you can clearly see both the control and end points on the left and the curve to the right.

'''Noob note:''' In blender 2.37 and later (not sure of earlier versions) pressing the '''HKEY''' toggles the control points between free and aligned (Edit Mode). Free Control Points are good for sharp angles, and aligned are good for smooth curves. This shortcut is in the '''Space -&gt; Edit -&gt; Control Points''' menu.

This concludes the tracing of the bolt. All that remains is making the curve 3 dimensional, applying a material and positioning the final object. Before doing that, we will trace the circle in the next part of the tutorial. Save this project if you want to take a break before continuing. You'll need it on the next turorial.

{{Clear}}

=== Adding a Third Dimension ===
[[image:Blender3d bezier Curve and surface panel.jpg|right|250px]]
First, give the object some depth. if you are in wirefame, hit '''ZKEY''' to go in to solid mode, then down on the editbuttons screen, locate the  &quot;Curve and Surface&quot; panel, and set the following values: 

* Back and front buttons are selected (depressed), otherwise it will be see through.
* Extrude: 0.2 (the height of the extrusion on either side)
* Bevel Depth: 0.02 (the radius of the round bevel applied to the exruded edge)
* BevResol: 4 (the number of subdivisions on the bevel curve)

'''Noob note:''' In previous versions, Extrude and Bevel Depth were Ext1 and Ext2.)

'''Noob note:''' In versions 2.6x(possibly also 2.5x), go to ''Properties panel --&gt; Object Data --&gt; Geometry'' for these settings.

Now you can use your knowledge from earlier in this book to change the material and/or add texture to your logo.  Feel free to rotate, add lighting, or whatever floats your boat. Don't forget to press '''ZKEY''' to toggle wireframe mode.

{{Clear}}


[[image:Blender3d 2d Logo center 3d lifted.jpg|left|200px]]

You should now have something that looks like the photo on the left.


{{Clear}}

== Modeling the red circle ==

It will be helpful to make the lightning bolt distinct from the circle part of the logo, by applying a yellow material to it before continuing.

Method one is the easiest, so try it that way first.


=== Method 1 - using bezier circle ===

====Outer circle====
[[Image:bezier_circle1.png|right|200px|Bézier Circle]]

Switch to object mode by hitting '''TAB''' if you aren't already there. '''LMB''' somewhere near the center of the background photo. Press '''space -&gt; Add -&gt; Curve -&gt; Bézier Circle''' to add a closed bezier curve with four points forming a circle. If you are in solid draw type, switch to wireframe with '''ZKEY''' so you can see the underlying image better.  Hit '''SKEY''' to scale the bezier circle to fit over the circle in the image.  

'''Noob note:''' You should stay in object mode for now, as it's easier to scale and move the bezier circle without having to keep track of which end points are selected.


{{Clear}}
[[Image:bezier_circle2.png|right|200px|Match up left and right sides]]

You will probably find that the bezier circle is not dead center on the sample logo so you will need to move it with '''GKEY''' to center it.  You may need to scale it and move it several times to get it right.  You will also find that the circle in the sample image is actually a slight oval, so scale and position the bezier circle, along the X axis, and Y axis, so that it touches the circle in the image on the left and right sides.  


{{Clear}}
[[Image:bezier_circle3.png|right|200px|Move top and bottom points]]

Normally, you could then scale the circle and constrain it on the X and Y axis by using '''SKEY''', but it turns out that the oval isn't regular anyway, so just select the point on the top and hit GKEY and then '''XKEY''', or '''YKEY''' to move it around until it touches the top of the oval in the image.  Then do the same for the bottom point and you should have a pretty good fit.


{{Clear}}
====Inner half circle 1====
[[Image:bezier_circle4.png|right|200px|Circle in circle]]
Just to understand what's happening in the next steps, switch to solid view with '''ZKEY'''.  As you can see, you now have a circle, but it's filled in the middle where you want to be able to see through it.  To cut a hole out of the circle, be sure that the circle is selected, then hit '''Shift+S''' -&gt; &quot;cursor to selection, to put the cursor in the middle, switch into '''edit mode''', if you're not already in it, and then '''Space -&gt; Add -&gt; Bézier Circle'''.  A new circle will appear inside the larger circle.  As you can see in solid mode, the new circle actually cuts its shape out of the larger circle surrounding it.

'''Noob note:''' make sure you are in Edit Mode or it will add the new Bézier circle without cutting it out of the existing one.

[[Image:bezier_circle_5.png|right|200px|Place two points at either end of the bar]] 
Switch to wireframe mode with '''ZKEY''' so that you can see the underlying image again.  Scale up the smaller circle so that it approximately fits the inner part of the circle in the image.  Don't worry about getting it exact since you'll be manually moving all four points anyway.  Move the bottom point of the bezier circle to the top left corner of the bar that crosses the circle. 


{{Clear}}
[[Image:bezier_circle_6.png|right|200px|Place two points at either end of the bar]]
Move the right point of the circle to the other corner.  When you create a Bézier Circle, Blender by default sets the alignment of all the control points to aligned.  To make the diagonal bottom edge you need to break the alignment on the two lower sets of control points.  Hitting the '''HKEY''' will toggle between free control points and aligned.  Once you've selected the two lower bezier points and hit the '''HKEY''' to make them free you can move each of the inner control points to create a nice straight edge. Then move the other two points and adjust their control points until you have a pretty good approximation of the rest of the inside curve.

''In Blender 2.63 and others, pressing the H key seems to hide vertices instead. To set control points to free, select the vertice, then in the curve tools under Handles, select Free. (can also be set via the menu at Curve-control points-set handle type-Free)''

====Inner half circle 2====
[[Image:bezier_circle_8.png|right|200px|Wider bevel has a nice look]]
Next step is to press '''space -&gt; Add -&gt; Bézier Circle''' again and repeat the same steps, but for the lower opening in the logo.  Once you've completed both openings, switch back to solid view with '''ZKEY''' and examine your work.  Make any adjustments you need to by switching the draw type back and forth as needed.

====Make it 3d====
[[Image:Blender 3D - Logo circle in 3D - 20100905.jpg|right|200px]]
The next step is to make this part three dimensional like you did with the lightning bolt.  
Go to object mode with '''TAB''', then select the editing buttons.  

Under curve and surface, set:

Extrude/Ext1 to 0.05, 

Bevel Depth/Ext2 to 0.02

BevResol to 4. 


{{Clear}}

[[Image:bezier_circle_10b.png|right|50px|Width adjustment restores to normal size]]
[[Image:bezier_circle_9b.png|right|50px|Bevel has increased logo size]]
Now that we have beveled it there will be a problem. Switch back to wireframe mode with '''ZKEY''' and you'll see that the bevel has widened everything so that the circle no longer matches the original image.  This can be fixed fairly easily by reducing the width parameter under curve and surface to about 0.98. 


{{Clear}}
[[image:Blender3d Logo combine into one unit.jpg|right|150px]]
For final steps, select the lightning bolt again and switch into sideview with '''NUM3''' and hit '''GKEY''' and then '''ZKEY''' to move both elements up or down until the bolt is inside the circle. 

Apply a red material to the circle and bar portion. Finally, you can go to view, then to background image and hit the background image button to hide the image now that it is no longer needed.  At this point, you can add any finishing touches for lighting and camera angles and render the logo.

After rendering you will have something like this:

===Method 2 - using mesh circle and edges ===

Instead of using the Bézier Curve, you can use Circles.

There are two ways of doing this:

====Easy way====

Place two vertices (CTRL+LMB), one on the inner circle and one on the outer circle so that they form a line. This line has to be perpendicular to the circle you are tracing. Then place the cursor on the middle of the circle. Then just use the spin tool under the Mesh tools tab (360 degrees and 32 steps). This creates a circle made of 32 adjacent squares. Give it more steps to increase the quality of the circle.

====Detailed way====

Go to the top view (NUM7), and press SPACE -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Circle. Accept the 32 vertices, you can make it less but it won't look as good.

Move it into the center of the circle, if you don't then I advise you have wireframe on for the moment (press Z). Then press S, for scale, and make it the correct size for the inside of the circle. Once you have that in the correct place, like so:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle1.jpg|center|200px|Adding the first circle]]

You may need to stretch it sideways a little, then press 'E' to extrude (choose Only Edges), press 'S' to scale and another sized circle will appear, size this appropriately then click LMB.

Deselect the second circle, then select four vertices that are near each other and that form a square. 

[[Image:Johno_logocircle2.jpg|center|200px|Selecting the four vertices]]

Now press F and a face will appear, i.e. the box will be filled (turn off Wireframe, press z). Now do this right around the circle. To do this, hold down Shift and Ctrl, then draw a circle around the two vertices you wish to deselect with the Left Mouse Button. Then draw a circle around the next two vertices while holding down Ctrl and LMB, '''NOT SHIFT'''. Shift changes the control from selecting, to deselecting. 

Once you have gone all around the circle it's time to make the line through the middle.
To make the crossing line you need to move 4 of the vertices slightly; example below:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle3.jpg|center|200px|Moving the four vertices]]

Once you do this, highlight the 4 you moved, then press F.

====Making the circle 3D====

Highlight the full circle by pressing A either once or twice. Go to Side View, and press E for extrude and drag it down so that it is the same thickness as the lightning bolt (you'll see why). 

Now look at what you have made... it looks nice enough but where the lightening bolt goes through the circle it looks a bit odd so we will make it look like the circle is laying on top of the bolt. Where the bolt goes through the circle, note the edges and the vertices. Move them so that the lines are just either side of where the bolt goes through. Then make new edges using CTRL+R on the outsides of these edges. Like so:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle4.jpg|center|200px|Creating the overlap]]

Now you have squares where the lightning bolt hits the circle. Change to Wireframe (z) if you are not already in it then highlight the 16 vertices of these boxes and raise them. Now do the same for where the center line crosses the bolt but create 4 lines instead of two. To explain why, I've created a diagram.

[[Image:Johno_diag_1.jpg|center|200px|Why we use 4 points instead of 2]]

Now we can make the finishing touches, add subsurf and set it to 2 or 3 and add color! Then you are done :-) I won't go over subsurf and adding color because people have covered that better than I could in previous 'Noob to Pro' pages. I think that's everything.

You should now be looking at something similar to:[[Image:Johno_logofinished.jpg|center|200px|The finished article]]

=== Method 3 - using mesh circle and a cube ===

Tracing the '''No symbol''' is somewhat more complex than the lightning bolt. The reason is this symbol is hollow and requires additional planning to trace than just following an outline of an object.

I'll be back to explain the difficulties in the near future, so stay tuned.

One way to do this is outlined below:
* The first thing to do is add a mesh circle. Hit '''SPACE''' and select 'Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Circle'. (This circle is mostly for measuring purposes, and will ultimately be removed.)
* Scale ('''SKEY''') and move ('''GKEY''') the circle so that it's sides are even with the sides of the logo circle, and the top and bottom are an even distance from the top and bottom of the logo circle. (The logo circle is not perfectly round.)
[[image:Firstcircle.png]]
* Make sure you're in object mode ('''TAB'''), add a cube ('''SPACE''', 'Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Cube') and place it ('''GKEY''') on the right edge of the circle so that it is centered on the right     edge.
* Scale ('''SKEY''') the cube so that it is the same width as the wall of the circle and touching each side of the wall. 
* Now, we want the 3Dcursor at the center of the logo circle. To do this, go back to object mode ('''TAB'''), and select the circle that we added earlier ('''RMB'''), then press '''SHIFT+SKEY''' and choose 'Cursor -&gt; Selection'. (This is the main reason why we have this circle here.)
* Reselect the cube ('''RMB''') and  '''TAB''' to edit mode.
* Choose '''NUM7''' for the top view, and use '''RMB''' to  select only the front face of the cube. (Before this you have to make sure that you are in 'Face select mode'.) 

* Press '''XKEY''' and choose Erase Vertices. This will reduce the cube to a square


* Press '''NUM7''' to go to the top view then select the Editing panel ('''F9''').
* Press '''AKEY''' to select all, and then make sure that the rotate settings are set to degr:360 , Steps:50 , Turns: 1. (Actually, Steps can be whatever number suits your fancy. You may want to play with various values.) This is just like we did for creating the man's hat.
* Click on 'Spin' to extrude the square into a ring. 

Next we will create the bar.  
* Staying in Edit mode, hit '''SPACE''' and select 'Add -&gt; Cube'. If you haven't moved the cursor since the ring extrusion, it should appear in the middle of the ring.
* Expand ('''SKEY''') the cube so that it just encompasses the inside circle of the ring
[[image:CircleSquare2.png]]
* Scale ('''SKEY''') the square in the Y axis ('''YKEY''') so that it is approximately the thickness of the logo bar.
* Return to object mode ('''TAB'''), and rotate ('''RKEY''') the ring together with the just designed bar so that it is parallel to the logo bar.
* In Edit Mode ('''TAB'''), squash the ring in the Y direction ('''SKEY''', '''YKEY''') so that it fits the logo ring.
[[image:RingBar1.png]]
* In edit mode, reselect just the bar.  To do this, choose 'Face select mode', and do an area select of the face selectors near the center of the bar (use the '''BKEY''', or '''SHIFT+RMB''' methods).
* Re-rotate ('''RKEY''') the bar (in Edit Mode) so that it is parallel to, and in the middle of, the logo bar.
[[image:RingBar2.png]]
* The next thing we need to do is scale the bar so that it is precisely the same width as the logo bar.  
* To do this, choose scale ('''SKEY'''), and press '''YKEY''' twice.  This will go to local scale mode (local to the object). This is why we were rotating the entire ring, since the ring and bar are part of the same object.
[[image:RingBar3.png]]
* We no longer need the original circle now, (it should be sticking out from the top and bottom of the ring), so select it ('''RMB'''), and delete it ('''XKEY''').
* If you hit '''NUM3''' You'll see that the bar and the ring are at completely different heights than the lightning bolt.  Select and scale them so that they are all roughly the same height (the bar should be slightly higher than the bolt, and the bolt slightly higher than the ring so that all the proper parts are covered.).
* You can use the trick above to select ('''RMB''') only the bar, scale it in the Z axis ('''SKEY''', '''ZKEY''') and then  hit '''SPACE''' and choose 'Select -&gt; Inverse' to select the ring (all but the bar). 
* When done rescaling, press '''NUM7''' to look at your handiwork.
[[image:RingBar4.png]]
* There is one last bit, which is to slightly rotate the whole ring around the X axis so that it is below the top of the bolt and above the bottom.
* Once that's done, all that's left to do, is color in the ring.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to solve any NxNxN cube ==
Eeep, this solution is essentially the same as the one found at jeays.net/rubiks, and it gives a second solution, also by David Singmaster.--[[User:64.230.50.205|64.230.50.205]] 01:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge.''' It would only confuse beginners on the subject of how to solve a Rubik's Cube, and they are most likely going to be the most frequest visitors to this page. And it seems that half the people who want to merge the articles aren't giving any reason as to why it would be better, either.

'''Don't merge'''. This article should contain a link at its end to the general NxNxN cube, but these are separate topics that should have seperate entries. [[User:68.162.100.40|68.162.100.40]] 03:59, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

Definitely '''merge'''! -[[User:Mydotnet|Mydotnet]] 02:16, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

'''Merge'''. --[[User:Ryan524|Ryan524]] 02:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)&lt;BR&gt;

Eh. '''Merge''' it. It makes more sense as an extension of this book anyway. How does one go about merging a book? Do administrators do it, or do authors? -- unknown

My advice. '''Dont merge''' it ''unless by merge you mean append as separate section''.
This solution is 'easy' to follow.
The general solution of nxnxn is harder to follow and even harder for some people to see how to apply it to say a 2x2x2.
The third book missing, (not yet started) is one that details how to solve such puzzles in general using the principles of conjugation... That method solves dodecahedral 'cubes' and a number of other variants that do not fit nxnxn. It solves whole classes of rearrange the bits puzzles where a move always move N pieces. Eg Olympic ring shaped grooves with coloured balls rolling around in them...



In fact it also solves 3x3x3x3 but that gets spooky...
[[User:202.164.205.96|202.164.205.96]] 15:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge'''. This book is a self-proclaimed inefficient but ''intuitive'' introduction to solving the cube for beginners. NxNxN is great for completeness but it is not ''intuitive'' or in any way easy for beginners. Beginners need all the clarity they can get. The fewer new concepts they have to learn the better. Adding NxNxN would create an immediate and unnecessary order of complexity. As a recent beginner I can garauntee you that if this page had been muddled with NxNxN strategies, I wouldn't have read it. 
[[User:Credford|Credford]] 17:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

'''Merge!''' It should be used as a reference to other users if they want to find out more about it. [[User:3857wiki|3857wiki]] 20:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge'''. Lots of beginners (incl. me) turn to the 3*3 cube wikibook for simple, specific instructions. Merging will effectively render the 3*3 page useless for beginners, while not making the general solution any more useful for technically accomplished cubers. There's no upside.  A link from the 3*3 solution to to the generalized solution  is in order, but that's all. [[User:207.6.31.6|207.6.31.6]] 21:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

Can we reach  a consensus on this? There seems to be no good reason to merge and lots of good reasons not to. Should I remove the merge suggestion from the Rubik's Cube article? [[User:207.6.31.6|207.6.31.6]] 05:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

I see your point.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lunakeet]

I say dont merge because it will just really mess up beginners-- nobody you need to know of

'''Don't merge''' This is a specific article on how to solve the 3x3 cube. Also, the other page's instructions are harder to understand.

'''Rewrite the NxNxN article''' Looking at the NXNXN article, it really almost exclusively focuses on 3X3X3 and only mentions 2X2X2 to state the obvious. (e.g. if you can solve a 3X3X3; the same thing works for 2X2X2). It's 3X3X3 method is different than this one so it would be rather difficult to merge that one in here without removing much of this. So I think what should happen is on the NxNxN article should be changed to really become how to solve what the article title says.

== Neglects to mention easiest method of &quot;solving&quot; (which isn't really solving at all)==

i.e removing the stickers and putting them back in the default position. Far easier than all the rubbish mentioned here. --[[User:86.135.217.213|86.135.217.213]] 06:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:This method has been added. [[User:68.52.56.111|68.52.56.111]] 19:52, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

::That isn't solving.  It's cheating.  People who want to know how to solve a Rubik's Cube need not be taught how to peel the stickers off.  Actually, if you practice, it's ten times faster (at least!) to solve it than to peel the stickers off.  Besides, the stickers are nearly impossible to replace without an adhesive.  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

:What about taking the cube apart instead?  If you're going to cheat, you may as well do it without rendering the cube unusable.  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:55, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

Can't you treat this seriously? Yes, you can take the stickers off and replace them, or disassemble and then reassemble the cube, but these do not constitute solving, and have their associated problems. The stickers are prone to peeling off after extended use; actively peeling them off only accelerates this. Disassembly risks permanent damage if not done properly. - [[Sorceror Nobody]]

==Rotating the center faces==
lol 105 moves.. well it works but there is a much simpler alternative at alchemistmatt's page: http://www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/rubikcenter.html will someone integrate this please. [[User:218.102.220.129|218.102.220.129]] 01:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

[[User:879(CoDe)|Nate]] 22:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
:Desperately. The Step 3 description is so convoluted that by the end of the first paragraph one has no idea which edges he (or she) is meant to be solving.
:Yes I completely agree with this. As someone who is trying to learn to solve the cube from this article, I can tell you it is extremely unclear on many points. I keep getting bad results and having to start again. I am finding vanderblonk.com significantly more helpful.

== Clean up the description ==

As noted above, Step 3 is VERY difficult to comprehend.  I would recommend rephrasing that section so that it conveys the thought process coherently. [[Special:Contributions/99.225.118.72|99.225.118.72]] ([[User talk:99.225.118.72|talk]]) 19:05, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

== 2 vs. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==

This page uses &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to denote half turns, but simply 2 is much more common.  Should this be changed?  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:49, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

::I believe it should, if noone complains, I will change it. --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] 17:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

How about L&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning ''n'' compositions of the operator L? Makes more sense than ''n''L. --NF July 2007

::Definitely not, this is a very ''mathematical'' way of showing algorithms. The cube may have some mathematical relatedness, but that doesn't make it necessary to make algorithms less readable. The standard notation adopted on the internet is to not use special characters or formatting, so just 2 will suffice. And by the way, it's not ''n''L it's L''n'' --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] ([[User talk:Blonkm|talk]]) 21:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== Copyvio? ==

This page seems to be ripped from the following page: [http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm] (see solution #2). I would recommend a deletion or complete rewrite. [[User:211.72.233.5|211.72.233.5]] 10:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ultra-Loser Ultra-Loser])

== White-other color? ==
In attempting to learn the method described in this article, I was immediately stumped by the description &quot;white-other color (OC)&quot;. Is this a white piece with a particular color adjacent to it? Can this be clarified in the article?

:I agree with you, this article was clearly not written with clarity in mind, though it is helping me to solve my cube.

:Please someone edit this.  I really have no clue what other-color means.


I agree wholeheartedly. I attempted to learn how to solve the cube with the explanation here and it was written so poorly I couldn't make heads or tails of one line of it. (edit: well i'm pleased to say i figured out how to solve the cube on my own.. and now reading back over this it certainly does make sense. and now i can say with a lot more certainty that it is worded horribly)


== UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2 is gibberish to a beginner. ==

This page needs to start with a proper explanation of what the letters and numbers mean. A complete beginner (such as myself) has no idea. [[User:Dodger67|Dodger67]] 11:03, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

it does. click on the link under &quot;notation&quot; [[User:Sompm|Sompm]] 02:58, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

== Pictures in notation ==

The picture in the notation section under 'F' doesn't seem right to me.  It looks like the cube's colors have been switched when there's meant to be a face rotation.  Thinking there should be a white bar instead of a yellow one in the pic.  Can anyone fix this?

The picture for 'D' also isn't correct. The green side is supposd to be colored orange. The white tiles in the 'F' picture are supposed to be orange as well. I've tried uploading the necesary files, but can't seem to include them in this page. The correct SVG-Pictures are at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubiks_F_1.svg] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubiks_D1.svg]

== Notation? ==

Is there any difference between R' and R? Article should mention something about it since the link doesn't

:R´ denotes rotating the right face counterclockwise and R denotes rotating the right face clockwise. The notation is given in the Wikipedia article about the Rubik´s Cube: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube. Erwin

== Step 2 is incomplete ==

In step 2, three possibilities are given: the corner block is in the D layer (with the white face on either D or F/R face) or the corner block is in the correct position in the U layer. It is however also possible that the corner block is in the U layer, but not in the correct position. How should one proceed then? Erwin

::Good point. Usually it is advised to take out the corner using one of the algorithms mentioned (it will push out the corner, since you are inserting another one). Then, again using one of the algorithms mentioned, you can solve the corner. This should be added (though IMHO this whole book needs a rewrite, which I have been pondering but never got to...) --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] ([[User talk:Blonkm|talk]]) 21:26, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== This book needs to be rewritten ==

I would do it myself, but my English is very poor. I have read it all and a think '''the example solve is full of mistakes and ambiguity''' -- even if it gives a solve after all.

== Step 5: Position corner pieces ==

I'm trying to solve a cube for the first time, and I was doing fine up until this step (the last corners).
It mentions &quot;the last 4 unsolved corners&quot;, but I have 5: the four U (opposite the nearly-solved white side) and the DRB &quot;empty&quot; corner.
And the rest of the step is completely incomprehensible. What, exactly, am I putting DRB and UFL? This needs to be clarified or rewritten.

(update to above) I've figured out Step 5, but it's still badly written.[[Special:Contributions/65.96.201.130|65.96.201.130]] ([[User talk:65.96.201.130|talk]]) 00:53, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

== Why does example solution add unnecessary moves? ==

You could look at is as clearly sub-optimal, or as incorrect use of notation?

R′ B R D2 F2 L U′ F U R′ D R F D F′ F′ D′ F U2 R′ D′ R U2 U′ F′ D′ F U U B′ D′ B U′ y2 F D2 F2 R F R′ B′ D F D′ B D F′ F2 D M D2 M′ D F2 (54moves)

can be written/simplified as

R′ B R D2 F2 L U′ F U R′ D R F D F2 D′ F U2 R′ D′ R U F′ D′ F U2 B′ D′ B U′ y2 F D2 F2 R F R′ B′ D F D′ B D F D M D2 M′ D F2 (50moves)

I would change it but the animation needs changing as well.</text>

Those loathe to admit the latter will take up residence in the former.

=== Interdisciplinary Entanglements ===
There is a b[ou]rrowing pattern: &quot;Economic subjectivism&quot;, &quot;Interpretive sociology&quot;, &quot;Social psychology&quot;, &quot;Sociolinguistics&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline of the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive sciences] gives greater credence to the individual and detailed study of biology.&lt;br /&gt;
The present field of Communications betrays four factions: Rhetorical Theory, Social theory, Theater and Journalism.&lt;br /&gt;
Theater Arts and Journalism are often distinguished schools.&lt;br /&gt;
The difficult relationship of classical Rhetoric and Sociological interpretation constitute a significant fissure within the Communication discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
The elements of linguistics, philosophy and computer science are prevalent in the Cognitive sciences. Convergence with the field will reinforce the Rhetorical (read: persuasive) nature of Communications. The terminology of rhetoric and the intertextual discourse of rhetorical scholars, quantitative analysts and interpretive researchers has and will continue to increase within the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Examples and Problems==

We can always use more real world examples, and more example problems both in the text and in the problems and answer section.  Even a few help, especially if you have access to mathematica and/or maple and can generate them quickly.  I do not and have to solve them by hand, a slow process.

NOTE: Especially need help on the first order linear section.  My calc-fu is not up to doing complex integrals of &lt;math&gt;e^{f(x)}g(x)&lt;/math&gt; by hand.

NOTE: Especially need more real world examples of both homogenous and nonhomogenous constant coefficient problems.

==Checking existing examples==

Since I do them by hand, there are probably some mistakes among the existing examples.  If someone cares to check them and fix any mistakes, it'd be appreciated.

==Graphs==

For the section on graphing-  I don't have any good software for generating graphs.  If anyone can get me some jpegs of slope fields and isoclines, I can write my explanation to work with your jpegs.  Or just write the lesson if you care to.

: I have Mathematica 5.2, I can make some graphs if you give me the equations. Just reply with the equations and I will post them. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:71.107.52.66|71.107.52.66]] ([[User talk:71.107.52.66|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.107.52.66|contribs]]) 22:23, 30 December 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

: Just a small note, you'll want to save the graphics as a PNG file. It's a lossless compression format and is best suited for exactly these types of images. I have Mathematica and gnuplot, so I may look into making some graphs. [[User:Robert A. Maxwell|Robert A. Maxwell]] ([[User talk:Robert A. Maxwell|talk]]) 15:00, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

: The [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib] Python module is freely available, similar to, and nearly as good as Matlab if you are familiar with that.

==Write a section==

Feel free to just go ahead and write a section I haven't gotten to yet.  If that would require opening the next chapter that hasn't been broken down yet, I'd be happy to discuss how to do it with you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Development of Home Remedies and Herbalism ==

The use of home remedies throughout history extends from simple food remedies, to more complex herbal preparations. Generally, the home herbal remedies were prepared as a tea to be drunk, or a poultice to be applied externally. Food remedies ranged from having an underlying  complex classification system such as used by the Chinese in Traditional Chinese Medicine, to having a poorly understood but still effective oral tradition. 


A unifying characteristic of these remedies is that they comprised of ingredients that were at least readily available at the time, such as using local herbs that were growing in the area. Indigenous groups, such as the Australian aboriginals and American Indians, made use of native plants to develop remedies that modern herbalists have also begun to explore in their practices. An example of this is the use of an extract of Wild Plum native to Australia to balance blood sugar levels.


The efficacy of some, but not all, traditional herbal home remedies is shown in the development of some modern drugs by the early pharmaceutical industry. For example, opium was developed from opium poppies, aspirin from Willow Bark (which is still used by individuals and herbalists today), the heart drug digitalis from foxglove, and quinine from the cinchona tree.


The body of knowledge that today is known as 'home remedies' and 'herbal medicine' developed along three main avenues, although as I described above, each country has their own oral traditions. Western herbal medicine developed from the early traditions of Greek, Roman and Medieval sources. Ayurveda developed in India, and the Chinese developed Traditional Chinese Medicine (or TCM). These traditions, and in particular the early Western tradition from the time of the Greeks, borrowed ideas and treatments from other traditions, especially the Indian and Oriental sources. This cultural cross-influence often reflected colonization, trade, or other, wider societal developments which facilitated the exchange of ideas. 


In some instances, this cross cultural pollination was developed from learning to survive in adverse conditions. Early settlers in America, such as Samuel Thompson (1769-1843) learned useful remedies from the American Indians, which was synthesized with medical and healing related literature of the day.


All three of these modalities (Ayurvedic, Western and Oriental) at one time included both philosophical and spiritual aspects along with the scientific knowledge that existed within a specific time frame.

Latin is a language,

At least it used to be;

It killed the Ancient Romans,

And now it's killing me.

(Iambic Trimeter)



It killed Julius Caesar

And killed those who learned it.

Bless the dead!

They surely earned it.

I started a new book [[A guide to identifying rocks and minerals]], and can't figure out how to add it to the new books list. '''Pleas Help!!!''' --[[User:Summergirl|summergirl]] ([[User talk:Summergirl|talk]]) 23:53, 18 December 2008 (UTC)

Now that more books are being added can we have maybe a showtime of say two or three weeks instead of a month? - [[User:Serge|Serge]]
:What seems to work is just a certain number of books - 15 fits perfectly on the front page (for me at least, in 1280x800), so maybe the policy should be changed to just be &quot;remove the last book when you add one&quot;? [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 19:14, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
::When the list gets too long, it's not unheard of to remove entries after only 2 weeks. I don't think the &quot;1 month&quot; thing is set in stone, it's just a guideline. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

I'm new to wikibooks, but isn't this backward?  I mean, in Wikipedia, the way you use a template is by having the &quot;Template:whatever&quot; page to be a certain formatted thing that you want on all the pages marked with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.  Then, all the pages marked thus point back to that template and they have that formatted thing embedded in them.  --[[User:Gandalfxviv|Gandalf]] 03:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:It's used in two places in different ways: one has it with full-size font and the other a reduced size. I forget where the two are ([[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:New]]) would tell you), but that's the reason as far as I can tell. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:30, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

I've just created a wikibook [[Metal Gear Series]], which I've just begun writing. How do I add it to the template? [[User:Jagged 85|Jagged 85]] 19:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

I too am confused about adding my book to somewhere.  I suspect it is ignorance on my part.  I have created the new book Telescope Making.  I have not been able to add it anywhere.  [[User:vorblesnak|vorblesnak]] 11/03/06

:Seeing as no one else added it. I decided to add [[Telescope Making]]. vorblesnak, all you have to do is click &quot;template&quot; and &quot;edit this page&quot; to edit [[Template:New]]. Just add a link to the new wikibook page, followed by the status complete, and the date the page was created. It seems like everyone is using a bold dot (·), not a period (.), to separate each book. This is what I added: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Telescope Making]] {{stage|100%|2006-11-03}} '''·'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (I'm assumming you're finished so I put 100% complete. Please change it if this is wrong.) Hope this helps! -[[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 09:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== How do you add a new book to the new Wikibook list? ==

I'm a new user and have recently written a pamphlet that I want to add.  Regarding this, I read the following on the &quot;[[Help:How to start a book]]&quot; page:

&quot;Note: If you are a new user, you cannot place your book on the bookshelf by yourself. Once you add your book to the list new Wikibooks, then someone will put it there for you.&quot;

Fine.  Trouble is, the list of new Wikibooks was locked, at least the one I found on the [[Main Page]].  The same list appeared on [[Template:New]], but it was also locked. Is there another list?  If someone could help me break through the confusion so I can add my book to the list, I would appreciate it!  Thx. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Peterb323|Peterb323]] ([[User talk:Peterb323|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peterb323|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:Sorry, for the confusion you are having. I started a discussion here: [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/November#System for adding new wikibooks and suggesting hot picks]] about changing the system for adding new Wikibooks (and suggestions for hot picks too). There is really only one list for new book links. The one that appears on the main page is the same as the one in this template. Click &quot;edit this page&quot; on the template page for [[Template:New]] or follow this link: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template:New&amp;action=edit. Once you add a link to your book to the template, it will appear on the main page. Note that this isn't some all inclusive new book list, it just a list to show new books that people want to put on the main page. -[[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 04:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Issues/suggestions ==

A few issues:
# the ingredients part says baking powder, but the procedure says baking soda. I assume baking soda is meant, since it reacts with the vinegar.
# the ingredients part doesn't mention salt, but the procedure calls for it. I didn't know how much salt, so I just used a pinch.
# the recipe should probably mention that the cake should be allowed to cool before being removed from its pan, otherwise it will crumble.
# this could be my personal taste, but I think the tofu mousse is pretty bland... I think adding some sugar would help.

Otherwise, this is a nice recipe and I will probably use it again in the future! Thanks! -[[User:Kotra|Kotra]] ([[User talk:Kotra|talk]]) 21:46, 21 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">:[[../First Order|First-Order Differential Equations]]

As we saw in a previous example, sometimes even though an equation isn't separable in its original form, it can be factored into a form where it is.  Another way you can turn non-separable equations into separable ones is to use &lt;b&gt;substitution methods&lt;/b&gt;.

== General substitution procedure ==

All substitution methods use the same general procedure:

#Take a term of the equation and replace it with a variable ''v''. The key is that the new variable must cover ''all'' instances of the variable ''y''. Otherwise substitution would not help.
#Solve for &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, take the equation &lt;math&gt;v=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the term you replaced and take its derivative.&lt;br&gt;
#Plug in &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
#Plug &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; into the original term replaced, and solve for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Constant coefficient substitution ==

Lets say we have an equation with a term ''ay+bx+c'', such as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=G(ay+bx+c).&lt;/math&gt;

where G is a function. This is non-separable.  But we can sometimes solve these equations by turning the term into a function ''v'', defining ''v''(''x,y'') and finding ''v''&amp;#39;(''x,y,y''&amp;#39;).

:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=ay+bx+c \,&lt;/math&gt;

The trick with the derivation of v is that y is also a function of x. The derivative of v thus becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=a\frac{dy}{dx}+b&lt;/math&gt;

In maxima this looks like so:

:(%i1) v:a*y(x)+b*x+c;
and
:(%i2) diff(v,x);
yielding
:(%o1) a*(dy/dx)+b

Next, we rearrange terms and solve for ''y''&amp;#39;(''x,v,v''&amp;#39;):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dv}{dx}-b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug v back into the original equation, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=G(ay+bx+c)&lt;/math&gt;, and get it into the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{dv}{dx}-b}{a}=G(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=aG(v)+b&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for v, that is integrate on both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=aG(v)+b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= \int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= x+D&lt;/math&gt;

Once you have v(x), plug back into the definition of v(x) to get y(x).

:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=\frac{v(x)-c-bx}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

It is highly suggested that one should not memorize this equation, and instead remember the method of solving the problem.  The final equation is rather obscure and easy to forget, but if one knows the method, he/she can always solve it.  It will also help if one uses other substitution methods.

=== Example 1 ===

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=(x+y+3)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Lets replace the quantity being raised to a power with ''v''.

:&lt;math&gt;v=x+y+3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now lets find ''v''&amp;#39;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dx}+1&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''y''&amp;#39;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dv}{dx}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Plug in for ''y'' and ''y''&amp;#39;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}-1=v^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=v^2+1&lt;/math&gt;

Now we solve for ''v'', using the methods we learned in [[Differential_Equations/Separable 1|Separable Variables]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v^2+1}=dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{v^2+1}=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1}(v)=x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\tan(x+C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we have ''v''(''x''), plug back in and find ''y''(''x'').

:&lt;math&gt;y+x+3=\tan(x+C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\tan(x+C)-x-3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Other methods ==

These are not the only possible substitution methods, just some of the more common ones.  Substitution methods are a general way to simplify complex differential equations.  If you ever come up with a differential equation you can't solve, you can sometimes crack it by finding a substitution and plugging in.  Just look for something that simplifies the equation.  Remember that between ''v'' and ''v''&amp;#39; you must eliminate the ''y'' in the equation.

=== Example 4 ===

:&lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dy}{dx}=y^2+x-1&lt;/math&gt;

This equation isn't separable, and none of the methods we previously used will quite work.  Let's use a custom substitution of ''v=y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''-1.  Solve for ''v''&amp;#39;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=2y\frac{dy}{dx}+1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dv}{dx}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Plug into the original equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}-1=v&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''v''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v+1}=dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{v+1}=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(v+1)=x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=Ce^x-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug in and get ''y''

:&lt;math&gt;Ce^x-1=y^2+x-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=Ce^x-x \,&lt;/math&gt;


Pretty easy after using that substitution.  Keep this method in mind, you will use this for more complex equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The A-level, short for Advanced Level, is a General Certificate of Education qualification in the United Kingdom, usually taken by students in the final two years of secondary education (commonly called the Sixth Form), or in College (not to be mistaken with the &quot;college&quot; term some countries such as the United States use for University), after they have completed IGCSE or GCSE exams. It is also recognized around the world. &lt;sup&gt;[[w:A-level|Says Wikipedia]]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==&quot;What is the name of the bridge that opens in the middle?&quot;==
This is '''Tower Bridge''' - not London Bridge.  It is called so because it crosses the River Thames near the Tower of London. Tower Bridge was built in 1894. As an aside- there is a bridge called the London Bridge, and an American businessman purchased it, allegedly believing it to be the Tower Bridge.

[[Image:Towerbridge2.jpg|400px|The bridge in 2004, still standing after over 100 years.]]

==&quot;What is the river that flows through London?&quot;==
It is the '''[[w:River Thames|River Thames]]'''.

==&quot;Where does the Queen of England live?&quot;==
The Queen's London residence is '''[[w:Buckingham Palace|Buckingham Palace]]''', located just south of Green Park. It is possible to visit the palace; St James's Park is the nearest underground station. The post code of Buckingham Palace was the first one ever issued, being ''SW1 1AA.''

The mambots are small scripts that does stuff to the content of mambo. This can be all content - components, mambo content and all other content of the site.

There are many forms of mambots. The most frequent ones are content mambots. These are used like this: you insert {mambot_name} into some content, and the mambot replaces this tag with the functions of the mambot. This can be embeding flash, linking to other content, inserting images etc.

'''First of all, we will explain the concept of ‘Home page’ and ‘the ‘Front page Component' in Mambo: Your &quot;Home page&quot; is the same as your &quot;Front page&quot;.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== I am a computer professional ==
I arrived here July 8 because it was suggested that what I was trying to contribute to Wikipedia more correctly belonged here, so now I am looking here to find out about here.

Here's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AlMac my page on Wikipedia].

Here's one of the articles I am working on there, which some people tell me perhaps ought to be moved to Wikibooks.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Audits Computer security audit] 

Before starting this article, I had studied another one already on Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditing_information_security Auditing IT security] and concluded that the earlier article applied to captains of industry that could afford comprehensive intensive computer audits, from the top down, while what I wanted to describe was the process by which most anyone can afford to do a computer security audit process to improve the security of any system, from the bottom up, gaining education in improving security.

I had started this article, because it is a main section of my earlier effort to address [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_breaches Security breaches], which have been much in the news this year.  I was told that my earlier work did not have a neutral point of view, and while I was trying to fix that, found that my language lost its boldness, so that's one reason I started the audits article, one of a series of definitional articles that I had intended to show that if a computer user is engaged in this or that process, the risk of security breaches is dramatically reduced.

I arrived at Wikipedia approx June 27 because some material I was posting to [http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/General_Computer_Security Midrange Wiki] was deemed inappropriate for that location.  The reason is that the IBM midrange computer system is one of the most secure in the world, in which most security problems are because we need to interconnect different kinds of computers, including many that are less secure.  My content that was inappropriate for there was that which was about computer security in general, not IBM in specific.

Basically I have been working in computers for over 40 years, and in computer security for at least half that time.  I feel that collectively we have been going backwards in the science of implementing computer security as technology marches forwards.

* So I had gone to Midrange Wiki and started to enthusiastically participate, only to learn, that much of my content was inappropriate to that site because of content outside of the IBM platform.  I figure I had contributed several months worth of stuff there, and had barely begun, when I learned this.  I plan to return an post lots more there, that is directly on point IBM platform, but first I want to get my computer security efforts migrated to wherever they are welcome.

* Then I moved to Wikipedia and have contributed to many articles, with over a week of effort, in intermittent bursts, trying to share my computer know-how, again to learn that perhaps that is not the right place for this.  The article subject is perhaps appropriate for there, but my viewpoint perhaps would blend in better some place else.   I am not ready to give up on Wikipedia.  I may end up posting some articles there, and some here, as I get a better understanding of what belongs in the different places.
[[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 8 July 2005 19:27 (UTC)
* [[SQL/400]] is my first effort to do a Wikibook based on what I have learned so far about what appears to be needed here.  [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 22:53, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
Here is an interesting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk#Programming_problems challenge]: What are meaningful challenges to give students of programming, so they gain an understanding of real world programming? [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 22:24, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

''Wiki religious discussion records history, a dark day, but the result is comfortable words, as God breathed a sigh.''&lt;br&gt;
(moved to discussion page)}}

The verses, The Comfortable Words, are not labeled as such in the U.S. BCP p. 331 (Holy Eucharist I). I should add &quot;This&quot; to Little Gospel, referring to the [[Talk:John_3|John 3:16]] discourse only. [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] 00:39, 8 Jul 2005 (UTC)

:I join you in your prayers for London at this time: it is certainly a resilient city and a resilient people.
 
The 1549 Prayer Book of Edward VI has:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Heare what coumfortable woordes our sauiour Christ sayeth, to all that truely turne to him.

:Come unto me all that trauell, and bee heauy laden, and I shall refreshs you. So God loued the worlde that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, to the ende that al that beleue in hym, shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerlasting.

Heare also what saint Paul sayeth.
:This is a true saying, and woorthie of all men to bee receiued, that Jesus Christe came into thys worlde to saue sinners.

Heare also what saint John sayeth.
:If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propiciacion for our sinnes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:These words have become a very important part of Anglican tradition.

I joined Wikimedia because I love contributing in open source projects but have very limited knowledge in programming.  Through Wikimedia I feel I can help others easily.  I plan to contibute in many projects, mostly focused around music and graphic arts.

Thanks for looking,&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief Description==

A table saw consists of an electric motor, mounted below a table, which drives a circular saw blade projecting through an opening in the table's surface. The blade rotates toward the front of the table; the operator pushes the work into the blade, against the direction of rotation.

The two primary table saw operations are '''ripping''', in which a board is reduced in width (cutting along the grain) while being pushed along a fence which is parallel to the blade and fixed at a distance from the blade equal to the desired width, and '''crosscutting''', in which the board is reduced in length (cutting across the grain) while being carried through the blade by a mitre gauge, which holds the board perpendicular to the blade while sliding along a groove in the table's surface parallel to the blade (known as a mitre slot).

There are many variants of these operations. The motor may be pivoted laterally so that the blade forms an angle other than 90º to the table's surface, permitting beveled rips and crosscuts. The mitre gauge may be adjusted to form an angle other than 90º to the mitre slot and saw blade, thereby allowing mitres to be cut. And a series of adjacent, parallel cuts can be made with the blade's height set lower than the thickness of the work to create dados and rabbets; these can also be cut using a stack of blades known as a dado set.

==Types of Table Saws==

Table saws can be divided into several categories. The '''bench''' or '''bench-top saw''', also known as a portable or jobsite saw, is compact and lightweight; its durability and accuracy suffer as a result, but it still represents a considerable improvement over a circular saw with a rip guide for production work in the field.

The '''contractor's saw''' is a substantial tool, offering a cast-iron table, typically with a pair of stamped steel extension wings, a 1 1/2 horsepower motor, and a reasonably reliable fence and mitre gauge. The '''hybrid saw''' improves on the contractor's saw with cast-iron extensions in place of the stamped steel, a more powerful motor, and a longer fence adjustable to finer tolerances.

Finally, the '''cabinet saw''', so named because of its enclosed base, features massively rugged construction throughout, from the trunnions supporting the motor, to the handwheels that adjust the height and tilt of the blade, to the rails the fence clamps to. This saw is typically powered by a 3 or 5 horsepower motor, is often accompanied by an extended table and fence/rail system for ripping wide panels, or a sliding-table attachment for crosscutting large pieces, and may weigh in at 500 pounds or more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook was started in 6 July 2005, pretending to be a comprehensive grammar of Portuguese language for foreign people, a reference for advanced and even basic learners.

It is divided in two main parts. The first part, [[Portuguese Grammar/Alphabet &amp; Phonology|Alphabet &amp; Phonology]] and [[Portuguese Grammar/Basic grammar|Basic grammar]] intends to provide an objective text about standart Portuguese. The second part, [[Portuguese Grammar/Advanced grammar|Advanced grammar]], [[Portuguese Grammar/More on History|More on History]] contains information on the usage of the language, and some pecularities of Portuguese. [[Portuguese Grammar/Variations|Variations]], finally, redisscuss all the book under the perspective of the regional speakings.

This wikibook is strongly based in the Brazilian ''Gramática Normativa da Língua Portuguesa'' by Prof. [[w:Carlos Henrique da Rocha Lima|Carlos Henrique da Rocha Lima]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Última flor do Lácio'': that is how the [[w:Brazil|Brazilian]] poet [[w:Olavo Bilac|Olavo Bilac]] described Portuguese in his [[Portuguese Grammar|famous poem]]: the last flower from [[w:Latium|Latium]], it is one of the latest languages [[w:Romance languages|derivated]] from [[w:Latin|Latin]]. The first documents in Portuguese appear in the thirteenth century.

Initially it was a variety of [[w:Galician|Galician]], but Portugal developed fast and Portuguese became a national language and after an Imperial language: Portuguese ships lead the great Discoveries and spread their language all over the world.

The written language kept strongly its resemblance with other romance languages, specially [[w:Spanish|Spanish]], which is not so far to be mutually comprehensible.

Today, Portuguese is spoken in [[w:Angola|Angola]], [[w:Brazil|Brazil]], [[w:Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[w:East Timor|East Timor]], [[w:Guinea Bissau|Guinea Bissau]], [[w:Macau|Macau]] ([[w:China|China]]), [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[w:Portugal|Portugal]], and [[w:São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]] by more than 200 million native speakers, being the fifth or sixth most-spoken first language in the world. Portuguese also developed into several varieties of [[w:Portuguese Creole|Creole]] in Africa. The main varieties of Portuguese are the Brazilian and the European Portuguese. The Portuguese spoken in the ex-collonies in Africa is more similar to the European variety. The differences between these varieties are mainly phonetic, but there are some ortographic disparities. Lexical is similar in formal language, but the familiar language are very enriched in the ex-colonies, by american indians in Brazil or by African black people.

Some remarkable literary works are the epic poem [[w:The Lusiad|The Lusiad]], written by [[w:Luís de Camões|Luís de Camões]] in 1572, which marks the change point from archaic to modern Portuguese. The poem tells the period of the [[w:Portugal in the period of discoveries|Great Discoveries]], specially the journey of [[w:Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]], the first European to reach India by sea.

Modern literature in Portuguese is very productive. Important writers include Portuguese novelist such as [[w:Eça de Queirós|Eça de Queirós]] and [[w:José Saramago|José Saramago]], Brazilian novelists, [[w:Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]], [[w:Jorge Amado|Jorge Amado]], [[w:Érico Veríssimo|Érico Veríssimo]], and [[w:Luís Fernando Veríssimo|Luís Fernando Veríssimo]], the Angolan novelist [[w:Pepetela|Pepetela]], the Mozambican novelist  Brazilian poets like [[w:Olavo Bilac|Olavo Bilac]], [[w:Carlos Drummond de Andrade|Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] Portuguese poets [[w:Fernando Pessoa|Fernando Pessoa]].

Did I misread the description? Is this recipe's presence in _canada_ because of the influx of loyalists? I changed it to read that the presence in the southern states was because of loyalists, but reading it again, this seems wrong. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;
: It's in Canada because the Loyalists fled the wrath of the Revolutionaries, they came to Canada because Quebec didn't revolt.  So it came from Southern Loyalists, as the tale goes, and became part of the Ontario culinary palette.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] ([[User talk:Nmontague|talk]]) 11:30, 31 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Paleolithic Cave Paintings */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Paleolithic Art ==


Art has been part of human culture for millennia. Our ancestors left behind paintings and sculptures of delicate beauty and expressive strength. The earliest finds date from the Middle Paleolithic period (between 200,000 and 40,000 years ago), although the origins of art may be older still, lost to the impermanence of materials.

=== Paleolithic Cave Paintings ===

Famous examples of Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) art can be found in France at the caves of Lascaux and Chauvet. Art from this era is also found in regions around the world, including South Africa, where finds at Blombos Cave include an engraved piece of ochre believed to be about 70,000 years old.

In terms of speculating about the consciousness of these artists, it is particularly worth noting that at Lascaux, in what was originally called the Cave of the Dead Man, we could a semiotic effort to talk about the human soul. The &quot;reality&quot; of the representation of all animal figures is very high grade. The one human figure in the cave is done as a stick figure. In the foreground stands a staff surmounted by a bird figure.

{{NOTE|This theme of staff/bird, serpent/bird is found in many cultures, and is noted as part of the language on spirituality in Matthew 10:16, and later by Rumi.

The term &quot;serpent wisdom&quot; continues to live on in numerous places, from discussions of Mayan calendars and the meaning of the so-called Templar mysteries, to a Louisville USA world music dance band. Yet clearly the concept can be seen as part of what we can recognise as human consciousness over 20,000 years ago. [[w:Joseph Campbell|Joseph Campbell]] identifies this figure as the &quot;first hero.&quot;}}

=== Paleolithic Venus Figurines ===

[[Image:VenusWillendorf.jpg|thumb|''The Venus of Willendorf.'']]
Small figurines dating from the Upper Paleolithic period (from about 40,000 to about 10,000 years ago) have been found throughout Europe. They are referred to as &quot;Venuses&quot;, because they usually depict women, often with exaggerated hips and breasts.  Some experts believe these figures could be fertility totems and among the first physical representations of  a religious or superstitious system.  The objects are also sized to be carried easily from place to place as tribes migrated.

The Venus of Willendorf, which was discovered in Austria, is one of the best-known of the Venuses. Carved from limestone, it is estimated to be around 25,000 years old.

Another well-known Paleolithic Venus, &quot;The Black Venus of Dolní Věstonice&quot;, was found in the Czech Republic. It is remarkable in that it (together with other objects found nearby) is the earliest known ceramic work of art so far discovered.

== Mesolithic Art ==

The Mesolithic, or &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot; Period lasted from about 10,000 years ago to the onset of farming in many areas which ranged from about 8,000 - 4,000 years ago. The production of small, portable works of art such as the Venus figurines popular during the Paleolithic era seems to have been greatly reduced.

Rock painting continued into the Mesolithic era, and included highly stylized depictions of human beings. Sites where Mesolithic art has been found include Kamennaya Mogila in the Ukraine, where rather primitive depictions of animals were carved into sandstone, Gobustan in Azerbaizhan and the Zaraut-Kamar grotto in Uzbekistan, both of which include stylized paintings of humans.

'''Chemical equilibrium''' occurs when a '''reversible reaction''' is occurring backwards and forwards at the same time by the same amount.  It is the balancing point of a chemical reaction, when it seems to stop happening.  Although some reactions (like the combustion of propane) occur to completion (no backwards reaction), most reactions occur in both the forward and backward direction.  One reaction will occur at a faster rate than the other, causing a net result.  As the reaction progresses, the forward reaction slows down and the backward reaction speeds up.  When the rates are equal, '''equilibrium''' has occurred.  The reaction appears to have stopped, and the total amount of products and reactants remains stable.

{{Info|Chemical reactions never really stop, but they no longer make any progress once the forwards and backwards reactions are occurring at the same rate.  This is ''equilibrium''.}}

== The Equilibrium Constant ==

The ratio of products to reactants, or &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''equilibrium constant'''. For the generic reaction mA + nB → xC + yD, the equilibrium constant is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^x[D]^y}{[A]^m[B]^n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where [X] detonates the '''activity''' of X. The activity of X is:
*its concentration if X is a gas or in a solution
*1 if X is a pure solid or pure liquid

In other words, pure solids and liquids don't affect the equilibrium constant, as long as there is enough for the reaction to proceed.  Their activity is 1, so they don't need to be written in the equilibrium constant.

=== K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ===

There are two types of &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.  One is &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, and the activities are ''concentrations''.  You are already familiar with this expression; it is the normally-used &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.  For gaseous reactions, you may use the concentration equilibrium.  You may also use ''partial pressures'' instead of concentrations.  This expression is denoted &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;.  The activities are partial pressures instead of concentrations.  This can only be used when all products and reactants are in the gaseous phase.

To convert between &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, there is an equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

R is the Universal Gas Constant and T is the temperature at which the reaction is occurring.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta n&lt;/math&gt; is the change (in moles) of gas molecules between products and reactants.  It may be zero (in which case K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Examples===

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1
15.0 moles of X and 20.0 moles of Y are put into an empty 2.0 liter container. They react, and eventually reach equilibrium with 7.0 moles of Z according to the hypothetical equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{X} + 2\hbox{Y} \to \hbox{Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Calculate the equilibrium constant.}}

Solution: Because the container was originally empty and at equilibrium, all 7.0 moles of Z are produced by the reaction.  Therefore, 7.0 moles of X and 14.0 moles of Y are consumed in the reaction, so at equilibrium there remain 8.0 moles of X, 6.0 moles of Y, and 7.0 moles of Z.  Divide these values by 2.0 liters to determine the concentration, then substitute into the equilibrium expression:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{[Z]}{[X][Y]^2} = \frac{[3.5]}{[4.0][3.0]^2} = 0.097&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2
5.00 moles of hydrogen are put into an empty 1.00-L container with 5.00 moles of iodine, where they react according to this equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{I}_2 \to 2\hbox{HI}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The equilibrium constant is 51.5 at the temperature of the reaction. Calculate the number of moles of HI that will form.}}

Solution: Suppose 2''y'' moles of HI forms. Then, ''y'' moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are consumed.  Therefore, at equilibrium, there are 2''y'' moles of HI, and (5.00 - ''y'') moles of both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Dividing by 1.00 liters (to find concentration) and writing an equilibrium expression gives:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;51.5 = \frac{[2y]^2}{[5.00-y][5.00-y]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Solving this equation gives y = 3.91 (reject the other solution, as it is greater than 5.00).  At equilibrium, there are 7.82 mol of HI.

== Calculations With K ==

The exact value of K doesn't really matter.  What is important is its ''magnitude''.

{|
 | &lt;b&gt;K &gt; 1&lt;/b&gt;
 | Reactions favors products
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt;K &lt; 1 &lt;/b&gt;
 | Reaction favors reactants
 |}

If the reaction favors products, it will occur in the forward (left-to-right) direction.  If K is very large, the reaction will occur mostly to completion, using up almost all the reactants.

If the reaction favors reactants, it will occur in the reverse (right-to-left) direction.  If K is very small, the reaction will use up almost all the products and make them into reactants.  The reverse reaction is favored.

=== Reaction Arithmetic ===

If you reverse the reaction (changing the direction of the arrow, or flipping the left and right sides), the new value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; will be its reciprocal.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border:1px&quot;
| A → B || (K = x)
|-
| B → A || (K = 1/x)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If you add two reactions, their equilibrium constants are multiplied.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1px&quot;
|A → B &lt;br&gt; G → H || (K = x) &lt;br&gt; (K = y)
|-
|A + G → B + H || (K = xy)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

These basic principles can help you determine an unknown equilibrium constant by combining known constants.

=== Q ===

K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is only used when a reaction is in equilibrium.  To find it, write its concentration (or partial pressure) expression, then plug in all the measured values.  The resulting K can be used to predict other equilibrium positions.

If a reaction is not at equilibrium, you can still plug in the measured concentrations.  Instead of calling this value K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, it is called Q.

{|
 | &lt;b&gt; Q &gt; K &lt;/b&gt;
 | The products must decrease and the reactants will increase.
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt; Q = K &lt;/b&gt;
 | There is equilibrium.
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt; Q &lt; K &lt;/b&gt;
 | The reactants must decrease and the products will increase.
 |}

So, if you know the equilibrium constant for a reaction, and you know all the concentrations, you can predict what direction the reaction will proceed.

=== I-C-E Charts ===

Let's say you know K for a reaction, and you know some concentrations.  You can calculate the final (equilibrium) concentrations using an &quot;Initial-Change-Equilibrium&quot; chart.  Here is an example.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CO}_{(g)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(g)} \to \hbox{CO}_{2(g)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At 25°C, K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 23.2 for this reaction.

First, write the equilibrium expression:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_c = \frac{[H_2][CO_2]}{[CO][H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In a sealed container of 2.00 L: 3 mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 4 mol CO, 1 mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been added.  (Write the ICE chart):

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1px&quot;
! 
! CO
! H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
! CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
! H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Initial
| 2
| 1.5
| 0
| 0.5
|-
| Change
| -x
| -x
| +x
| +x
|-
| Equilibrium
| 2-x
| 1.5-x
| x
| 0.5+x
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Now, plug in the &quot;equilibrium&quot; values into the K expression.  Substitute all known values and solve for x.  Then, substitute x for the final values to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

By substituting everything into the K expression, we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 23.3 = \frac{(0.5+x) \times (x)}{(2-x) \times (1.5-x)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Solving this will require the use of the quadratic equation.  It may be easier to use approximations or a graphing calculator.  When solved, &lt;math&gt;x = 1.34&lt;/math&gt; (disregard values of x that would give negative concentrations).  By substituting x into the &quot;equilibrium&quot; values in the ICE chart, we can determine the concentrations of all substances when the reaction reaches equilibrium.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1px
 !CO
 !H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
 !CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 !H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 |-
 |0.66 M
 |0.16 M
 |1.34 M
 |1.84 M
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

To check your answer, you could substitute these values into the equilibrium expression and see if it equals 23.3 (the given K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; value).

{{Info|This was a fairly simple example.  There were no coefficients in the reaction, so no exponents in the expression.}}

The purpose of doing this is to see the final concentrations of the substances involved in a chemical reaction.  Unless K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is incredibly large, not all the reactants will be consumed.

== Equilibrium in Detail ==

The next few chapters in this book will provide more details on equilibrium.

===Shifts in Equilibrium===
'''Le Chatelier's principle''' states that a system will adapt to minimize a change.  If reactants are added, they will be consumed and products will form.  Likewise, if products are added, they will be consumed (by the reverse reaction) and reactants will form.  

The only change in a system that will affect the value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is temperature.  The value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is never changed by the concentrations or pressures of the substances.

===Special Constants===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[H^+] [A^-]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids and bases have special '''ionization constants''', which show how they react with water. The acid ionization constant, or K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, tells how strong an acid is.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K_b = \frac{[\mbox{OH}^-][\mbox{BH}]} {[\mbox{B}]}&lt;/math&gt;
| The base ionization constant, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, similarly tells how strong a base is.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = \frac{[A^+] [B^-]}{[AB]}&lt;/math&gt;
| The '''solubility product''' K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; shows how much an ionic substance will dissociate when dissolved.
|}
===Relation to E===
There is a special relation between the standard potential of a redox reaction and the equilibrium constant
&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{0.0592 \log K}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred.
This is a significant equation, because this allows us to calculate the hard to measure K from the easy to measure E.

'''Skillet Cornbread''' - Commonly found in the Southern United States, this delicious and easy to make dish is often served beside a pot of brown beans.  It can be made a day or two ahead of time, as long as care is taken to keep it from drying out.

==Ingredients==
*3/4 cup white all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]
*3/4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 1/4 cups yellow or white [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn meal]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 to 3 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Lard|pan drippings]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or buttermilk.

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to 425°F
#Grease the skillet with bacon drippings (ideal) or oil. Butter isn't recommended, since it can burn when you preheat the skillet.
#Preheat the skillet until the drippings/oil is smoking. This ensures a good crust on the bottom of the cornbread.
#In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Thoroughly mix the sifted ingredients together and add the corn meal.
#In a second bowl, beat the egg well.  Add the melted butter (or pan drippings) and the milk and continue to beat until well mixed.
#Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix using fast strokes.  Take care not to overmix.
#Pour the batter into the skillet and place in the oven.  Bake for 25-30 minutes.  The cornbread should have a golden brown color when done, and a knitting needle or knife-point will come out &quot;dry&quot; when inserted in the bread.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Ideally, all ingredients should be at room temperature (about 75°F) for this recipe.  However, a good result can still be had if this is not the case.
*Yellow corn meal is preferable to white corn meal, but this can vary according to locality and personal taste.
*Optionally, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced cooked ham or crumbled bacon can be added to the batter before pouring into the skillet.  This may add a few minutes to the baking time.

==Warnings==
*The skillet must be oven-safe. Ideally, skillet cornbread should be baked in a cast-iron skillet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vietnamese is a tonal language, i.e. the meaning of each word depends on the &quot;tone&quot; in which it is pronounced. Many other languages also use tones, like Chinese.

There are six distinct tones; the first one (&quot;level tone&quot;) is not marked, and the other five are indicated by diacritics applied to the main vowel of the syllable:

&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;#eecc00&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tone&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Marking&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th colspan=12&gt;Marked vowels&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ngang (Level)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unmarked&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A/a&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#258;/&amp;#259;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Â/â&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7840;/&amp;#7841;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7862;/&amp;#7863;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7852;/&amp;#7853;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7864;/&amp;#7865;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7878;/&amp;#7879;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7882;/&amp;#7883;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7884;/&amp;#7885;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7896;/&amp;#7897;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7906;/&amp;#7907;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7908;/&amp;#7909;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7920;/&amp;#7921;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#7924;/&amp;#7925;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The lowercase letter &quot;i&quot; should retain its dot even when accented. (However, this detail is often lost in computers and on the Internet, due to the obscurity of Vietnamese specialty fonts and limitations of encoding systems.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout this text a consistent notation is maintained, which is essentially that promoted by Kane (and presented to the author with modification by Anderson).  This notation eliminates the ambiguity associated with the multiple [[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frames]] inherent in multibody analysis.  It has been the author's experience in industry that too many problems are brought on by poor notation, and the notion that for some topics this notation is to rigorous has been dismissed.

Scalar quantities are represented by numbers, letters and/or symbols. The following are all scalars:
    x, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, X, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, 3, and 5.5.

Arbitrary vectors are denoted with over-arrows as
    &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

and unit vectors are given the usual hat notation
    &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|Reference frames]] are labeled with a single capital letter, with 'N' being reserved for the [[Multibody Mechanics/Inertial Frame|inertial frames]]  (also called the 'Newtonian' frame).

Each [[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frame]] is assumed to have a set of right handed [[Multibody Mechanics/Basis Vectors|basis vectors]] labeled with the same lowercase letter.  Basis vectors for the frame 'B' would be:
    &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_1 \times \hat{b}_2 = \hat{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;.

This page is an update of a great tutorial originally built for blender 2.44.

Blender is not just useful to create complete animations, but it's also a great modeller. You can build your complete 3D scene in Blender, and then export it to a useful format. In fact, you can use it for much more, for example I was using it as a level editor for a freeware 2D game someone else made. There was a short deadline for the game to be finished, and 2 weeks before that deadline, there still was no level editor for it. It had a custom ASCII level format, consisting of lists of materials, vertices, triangles and objects. So, remembering the Blender Python exporters, I volunteered to write an export script for Blender, so it could be used as level editor. And it worked out very well, Blender can be completely used as level editor for that game now.

In this tutorial we'll learn how to write a simple Python export script for Blender. Without requiring previous Python knowledge, it will explain how to query the objects in your scene, and how to write them to a file. It will also demonstrate the usefulness of export scripts, by showing how you can process the data while exporting, so you can achieve things that would not work by using any other existing format.

So, open Blender, make sure the default scene is loaded, and let's begin..

== Finding out about things in a scene ==

[[Image:Blender259 EditorSelector.jpg|203px|right|Blender259 EditorSelector]]

Before we can export something, we must know what to export. One way to get this information is the Outliner window ('''SHIFT-F9'''). It will list all the things currently known to Blender. Now, we want the same information from a script. Click the editor selection button and from the popup menu choose '''Python Console'''.

Now, you are ready for the big moment, you are about to execute the first Blender scripting command. Type this and hit '''RETURN''' (or you could type into the scripts window import Blender on the topmost line, then these lines below it, precede all the 'dir(x)' lines with print and choose file-&gt;Execute):

 list(bpy.data.objects)

As a result, you should see this:

 [bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]]

Now, what just happened? The variable given to &quot;list&quot; in &quot;list(bpy.data.objects)&quot; consists of three words, separated by two dots. The dots separate different things. The first, ''bpy'', means to use a function from the bpy module. ''data'' is a sub-module of Blender. And finally objects is an iterator of ''bpy.data.'' The ''list()''  function is used to loop through all data in ''bpy.data.objects'' and return that as a list of all available objects. In our case, this is a Camera, a Cube, and a Lamp.

To get more information about an object, you can use the object name as a key in bpy.data.objects, and assign it to a variable, like this:

 camera = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;]
 cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]
 lamp = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]

We just assigned the three objects to three variables, camera, cube and lamp. To see the contents of a variable, type just its name:

 cube 
 bpy.data.objects['Cube']

 camera 
 bpy.data.objects['Camera']

 lamp 
 bpy.data.objects['Lamp']

Sometimes it's useful to use Python's dir() function to get more information about an object. For example

 dir(cube)

will write the names of all functions and properties of the object. Quite a lot. But don't worry, soon you will know how to use all of them. You also may want to find out the type of something, which you can do like this:

 type(cube)

In this case, just typing &quot;cube&quot; already displays the type, but from within an actual script, you would use type(). Something else which can be useful is viewing the documentation of Python objects. To do so, use the help() function on a variable or object.

 help(bpy.data.objects)

This will print the documentation of the bpy.data.objects function we used. Of course, an easier way to view the documentation is the online HTML help. Click on '''Help-&gt;Python API Reference'''. Hopefully now your browser opens and displays the online documentation of the Blender Python API. If not, you should find it also here:

http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_59_2/

In the documentation, click on bpy, then on data and you can see more examples. Using the documentation will get absolutely vital whenever you need to do something in a script not covered in a tutorial. And you will need to do so, else you wouldn't want to learn scripting at all.

Another resource you will need, depending on how far you will go with scripting, is the Python reference:

http://docs.python.org/

For this tutorial, maybe read the &quot;Tutorial&quot; section in the python docs, but you will understand everything without doing so.

Now, let's try to find out more about our cube. Type:

 cube.type

It will tell us that the cube really is a Mesh object in Blender. Look up &quot;type&quot; in the online docs. Since the variable cube holds an Object, and &quot;type&quot; is an attribute of that Object, click on Object. There you find its &quot;type&quot;.

Now that we know that the cube is a mesh, let's find out more about the mesh.

 cubedata = bpy.data[&quot;Cube&quot;]

'Note: in Blender 2.6.0 the script command actually looks like this, but the above is still valid: (Chronus001)

'Note: in Blender 2.6.5 above is not valid any more

 cubedata = bpy.data.meshes['Cube']
Every Blender object has data assigned to it, depending on the type. In the case of a mesh, the data are of type Mesh. In the documentation, go to the top again, and look for the Mesh module. It will contain documentation for the Mesh type. You can also try

 dir(cubedata)

to get an idea about the available functions and properties. Try these:

 list(cubedata.vertices)
 list(cubedata.faces)

The first line will list the 8 vertices of the cube's mesh. The second line will list its 6 faces.

To get a member out of a list, you specify the index in square brackets, starting with 0. So:

 v = cubedata.vertices[0]

This will assign the first vertex of the cube to the variable v. By now, you already know how to use dir() to get a list of possibly interesting things in v, find out about its type with type(), and where to look for the API documentation. It is in the module Blender/Mesh, when you click one &quot;MVert&quot; under &quot;Classes&quot;.

 v.co

This will display the 3D coordinates of the first vertex. Now, what if we want to know the coordinates of all vertices? We could of course assign them all to a variable, but the real way to do this is using a looping constructs. There are numerous ways to do this, but one simple way looks like this:

 for v in cubedata.vertices: print(v.co)

The '''for variable in list:''' construct assigns each element of the list to the variable in turn, and then executes the commands after the colon with the variable having the value of one particular list element. In a real script, you will have much more than a single command after the colon - so you would write them in the following lines.

By now, you should know enough to try yourself at a real script in the next section.

== Creating a script ==

You can write scripts either in an external text editor, or in Blender's built in text editor. Move to a panel you wish to change to be the text editor, click the editor select button and choose &quot;text editor&quot; (shortcut) '''SHIFT+F11'''. Click the + New button at the bottom.  If you want, you can enable line numbers and syntax coloring with the buttons at the bottom. Create a new script with ''File'' → ''New'', paste the code below into it, and save it. Or alternatively, paste the code below into a file, and open that file with ''File'' → ''Open'' in Blender. As name choose something with the extension .py, for example wikibooks.py. Put it into Blender's user scripts path.

For different operating systems this is:
*Linux: ~/.blender/scripts
*Windows XP: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Windows XP (alt): C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts

 
*Windows Vista: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Mac OS X:
**Under Mac OSX the path is actually hidden in the blender.app so to know the path you would have to know that the script folder is actually hidden in the blender.app itself. Assuming that Blender is in the applications directory the path would be &quot;/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts&quot; If you try to open the .app contents from the finder you will notice that .blender section of the path is not visible, while blender will still be able to navigate to this folder.
** Right-click (or ctrl-click) the file &quot;blender&quot;, and select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; in the popup-menu.  It will display all the hidden files under blender's folder, and select &quot;scripts&quot; folder inside it.
** To see this folder from the OSX terminal use the ls -a command (lists all folders/files even hidden) in the MacOS folder of the listed path. It is probably a good idea to create an alias to the scripts folder in the &quot;/Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc&quot; folder so that scripts can be easily manipulated through the finder. I know that its confusing that Blender should have its script folder buried inside the app but it is necessary to keep the app portable and not require an install.
**A safer approach than the one above consists in keeping your scripts somewhere in your home folder: with this scheme, there is no risk of deleting your scripts when you upgrade your blender application, as they are not contained within its folder.  A method that follows this principle is as follows: create a folder that will contain your scripts (or some of them) inside your own home directory; then, instead of putting your files directly in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder discussed above, simply add a ''link'' to your script directory in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder (for instance with the &quot;ln -s&quot; Unix command, or by doing &quot;open /Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts/&quot; [adapted to your version of blender] and then creating a link through the Finder, with File-&gt;Make Alias).  Blender will now find all the scripts that you put in your home directory: it will follow the link you created in its .../.blender/scripts/ folder and go to the corresponding folder in your own directory, and find all the python scripts you put there.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
#!BPY

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Name: 'Wikibooks'
Blender: 259
Group: 'Export'
Tooltip: 'Wikibooks sample exporter'
&quot;&quot;&quot;
import Blender
import bpy

def write(filename):
    out = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)
    sce= bpy.data.scenes.active
    for ob in sce.objects:
        out.write(ob.type + &quot;: &quot; + ob.name + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out.close()

Blender.Window.FileSelector(write, &quot;Export&quot;)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, go back into the scripts window, and in its menu, click ''Scripts'' → ''Update Menus''. If you saved it into the right path, from now on there should be an entry &quot;Wikibooks&quot; in the ''File'' → ''Export'' menu. Try exporting any scene with it. It should open the file chooser dialog, and after you select a file and press the &quot;Export&quot; button, write a list of all objects in the scene into it. There will be one object per line, with the type, followed by a colon and the name.

How does it work? If you look at the script, you probably already know. But just in case, let's look at the script line by line. The first line contains this:

 #!BPY

It tells Blender that this is a Blender script, and therefore it will consider it when scanning for scripts. Next simply follows a string, enclosed in triple quotation marks, so it can span multiple lines.

 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 Name: 'Wikibooks'
 Blender: 259
 Group: 'Export'
 Tooltip: 'Wikibooks sample exporter'
 &quot;&quot;&quot;

It contains four items, which Blender uses to place the script into its menus. The name, group (submenu name), and tooltip, all enclosed in single quotes. And the Blender version this is for. Note the group name must be one of those predefined by Blender (check the submenus in its Scripts menu to see the valid names); if Blender doesn’t recognize the group name, the script will be put into the “Misc” submenu.

 import Blender
 import bpy

Remember how we said all functions from the bpy module start with &quot;Blender.&quot;? In the interactive shell, we could simply use them, but in a python script, all used modules must be declared with an import statement (if you want to directly use functions from the Blender module in a script, you can simply replace the import statement above with &quot;from Blender import *&quot;: no &quot;Blender.&quot; prefix is necessary any more; however, this slows down the loading of your script). So the above simply allows us to use the functions from the Blender module in our script.

the bpy module is new and will replace Blender for data access.

 def write(filename):

This defines a function in Python. The syntax is '''def name(parameters):'''. In our case, the name is &quot;write&quot;, and we have one parameter, called &quot;filename&quot;.

     out = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)

Here we open a file for writing (the &quot;w&quot;), with the name passed to the function (filename). The python function &quot;open&quot; will open the file, and return a reference to it, which we store in the variable &quot;out&quot;.
    sce= bpy.data.scenes.active
    for ob in sce.objects:
        out.write(ob.type + &quot;: &quot; + ob.name + &quot;\n&quot;)

These three lines are our real export script. You already know what the first line does - first we get the current scene, then get a list of all objects in that scene, the for loop is assigning each one in turn to the variable &quot;ob&quot;. The second line writes to the file - first the type of the object, then the string &quot;: &quot;, then the name of the object, and finally a newline.

 Blender.Window.FileSelector(write, &quot;Export&quot;)

This is where execution of the script starts. It is simply a call of a Blender function (look it up in the API docs), which opens the file selector. It will display an &quot;Export&quot; button, and when the user clicks it, our function &quot;write&quot; from above gets called and is passed the selected filename.

This script isn't really very useful yet, but it shows the basics. You should now be able to e.g. also list all the materials in the scene. (Hint: They are just like objects, try to find them in the API docs.)

In the next section, we will learn how to export additional information about objects to our text file.

== Exporting a Mesh ==

Our export script lists the type and name of every object, but that's not very useful yet. If we want to load the exported data in another application, we need more. Let's try to export a mesh object in the OBJ format.

The example below is a cube in the OBJ file format.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
v 1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000001 1.000000 1.000000
v 0.999999 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
f 1 2 3 4
f 5 8 7 6
f 1 5 6 2
f 2 6 7 3
f 3 7 8 4
f 5 1 4 8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is a simple obj export script that exports a selected mesh object, used to export the OBJ file above.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import Blender
import bpy

def write_obj(filepath):
	out = file(filepath, 'w')
	sce = bpy.data.scenes.active
	ob = sce.objects.active
	mesh = ob.getData(mesh=1)
	for vert in mesh.verts:
		out.write( 'v %f %f %f\n' % (vert.co.x, vert.co.y, vert.co.z) )
	
	for face in mesh.faces:
		out.write('f')
		
		for vert in face.v:
			out.write( ' %i' % (vert.index + 1) )
		out.write('\n')
	out.close()
Blender.Window.FileSelector(write_obj, &quot;Export&quot;)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This script will export an OBJ file that can be read by many applications. Let's look at what's going on.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	sce = bpy.data.scenes.active
	ob = sce.objects.active
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we are getting the object you last selected in the current scene. This will raise an error if there are no selected objects, but its an easy way to test a new exporter.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	mesh = ob.getData(mesh=1)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This gets the objects linked datablock. At the moment we don't know its a mesh, another case where error checking would need to be added.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	for vert in mesh.verts:
		out.write( 'v %f %f %f\n' % (vert.co.x, vert.co.y, vert.co.z) )
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we write a line for every vertex, using string formatting to replace the &quot;%f&quot; on the left, with the 3 values on the right.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	for face in mesh.faces:
		out.write('f')
		
		for vert in face.v:
			out.write( ' %i' % (vert.index + 1) )
		out.write('\n')
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
In the OBJ format each face references a number of vertex indices.
For every face we have a line starting with &quot;f&quot;, then loop through the vertices in the face.
Just as mesh.verts are a list of all the vertices in a mesh, face.v is a list of verts in the face limited to 4 vertices maximum.
(where mesh and face are arbitrary variable names assigned to Mesh and MFace objects)
Every vertex writes its index on that same line with 1 added. This is because with the OBJ file format the first vertex is indexed at 1, whereas with Python and Blender the first item in a list is 0.

A new line is written so the next face will start on a new line. - in python '\n' represents a new line when written to a file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Different terminology is used in different programming languages to mean different things.  The same things in different languages can have different names.  Programs, Procedures, Functions, Subroutines, Subprograms, Subqueries ... these words all have very similar meanings.  The issues or differences are whether they can stand alone; 

We can call an object, it executes and performs a complex process.  Whether that object is called any one of the above list depends on what programming language it is written in, whether a human being can call it, or whether it has to be called by another program or one of the other names on the list.

== Subroutines and functions ==
In general programming theory, when an institution using the programs can have libraries of millions of programs collectively with billions of lines of source code, we want to avoid duplication of having the same code in multiple places.  Suppose something needs changing.  There is a new error message to add to the collection.  Customer numbers just went from being 6 digit #s to 8 digits.  There is a new currency, such as the Euro, to be handled.  If this stuff was referenced in every single program that worked with it, we could have tens of thousands of programs to have to update to handle the change.  But if there are sub-programs to handle different scenarios, then when that scenario changes, the only update is to the relevant sub-program.  Similarly, when we write a new program, many elements of what it needs are already in existence, such as accessing a particular file to get a particular kind of data, calculating on-hand inventory.  Instead of writing many lines of source code to do that function, with that code replicated across millions of programs, we can call the standard sub-program that performs that function.

In some languages there are parameters to be passed from the calling program to the called program.  The secondary program causes those values to be altered, then returns control to the primary program.  This architecture, of one program calling a secondary program to do specialize work for it, can in fact go many levels deep.  The different programs, that are calling each other, can be written in many different languages.  This is done for two big reasons: organization of overall functions into logical manageable pieces; and different languages are better suited to different types of functions.



=== Subroutines and &quot;sub contents&quot; in RPG ===
RPG has sections of code to handle activities like file definition, tables &amp; arrays defined, input, output, communications with other systems and other programs, various kinds of data structures defined, and calculations.  The calculation section has a main routine and any number of subroutines which can be called from the main routine and from each other. 

In RPG, a chunk of source code is called a subroutine if it has a defined begin point and end point and is embedded within the main program.  Some point in the main program calls the subroutine.  Control goes to the start of the subroutine which then has control until either it gets to the end point or prematurely hits an exit statement within the body of the subroutine.  Here is an example:

 Main calculations routine
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 EXSR $TOP
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 End of main routine

The EXSR command means Execute Subroutine.  Subroutine names can include letters, symbols, and numbers, but may not start with a number.  Since a compilation includes a cross index of all elements used in the program, it is customary to use a special character at the start of certain kinds of functions, so that they all show up in a consistent location in the cross index, such as currency symbol for subroutines, and some other symbol for output to printer.

At the beginning of any subroutine it is good programming practice to place comments with a summary statement or explanation of what the function is of the $TOP subroutine, such as to handle what is to be printed at the top of the report.

 Comments
 BEGSR
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 RPG statement 
 EXCPT @PAGE
 EXCPT @TITLE
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 EXCPT @HEAD
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 ENDSR

BEGSR is the begin subroutine statement, while ENDSR is the end subroutine statement.  EXCPT is the statement that identifies some type of output to a printer or printer-like file.  Data can be written to a log or other object that is in a format similar to printout, sequential lines of stuff.

When control is transferred from this program to another program, called by this one, then this one calls that other program a sub-program.  Sub=programs contain other types of RPG content such as file definition, input output etc.  A sub-program does not need to access any files.  It can get all of its data from data structures populated by the calling program.

These subroutines and subprograms are merely a way to organize the program into logical chunks of the work to be done.  We can think of them as being black boxes which are fed in various different standard pieces of information, only to return predictable results to the main program.  Thus when a program needs to be maintained, we can effectively ignore that part of the program that has nothing to do with the maintenance effort.  This is critical when we are maintaining programs whose collective source code, main routines and subroutines and subprogram contents, can run to hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

If you were to compare a listing of the actual source code of an RPG program, and what is there at time of compilation, you would probably see a lot of stuff in the compile that is not explicitly in the source code.  This usually gets there one of two ways. 

If using a standard externally described object, such as a file or data structure, the source code only needs to specify that object with a few lines of code, which one, and what changes are needed for its handling in this program.  At compile time, the whole layout of the file, such as all columns of the table, is called into what gets compiled.

Another way, when using standard subroutines, or the code for calling standard subprograms, that are to be replicated in millions of other programs, is not to have that code within the source code of every one of the millions of programs, but to have a single line of code identifying what standard code is to be brought in here, and if in this program any of it is to be referenced by other names.

Very few other languages can be embedded within  RPG source code, such as [[SQL/400]].  RPG programs can transfer control to other programs, which RPG calls sub-programs.  Those other programs can be written in any language.  Depending on language, those programs need to be written so as to expect to be called, and the code, associated with this handshake with the calling program, can make it impractical to run the program in some way other than being so called.

Different kinds of error messages, with their associated help links, can be stored in different libraries based on the nature of the problem.  A person, using this program, may have called for a record that does not exist, tried to get at values that are out of bounds. 
The most hours in one day is 25, which is only on the day that gets changed due to daylight savings.  If someone tries to enter what activities occurred in a factory in one day, and the total time by one factory worker is more than 25 hours, this is an example of input that is out of bounds.
The program needs to communicate back to the user what the problem is.  Part of the message handling can use a sub-program that only knows what error message is involved by some reference code.  The actual current error message is not explicitly referenced in the sub-program that handles error messages, so that it can handle any different error message.  The only parameters it needs are those that define how to access the particular error message and its associated references, such as the manner in which a user may interact with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How are the results of the latest SAT test? What is the average height of females under 21 in Zambia? How does beer consumption among college students at engineering college compare to college students in liberal arts colleges?

To answer these questions, we would collect data and put them in a form that is easy to summarize, visualize, and discuss. Loosely speaking, the collection and aggregation of data result in a distribution. Distributions are most often in the form of a histogram or a table. That way, we can &quot;see&quot; the data immediately and begin our scientific inquiry.

For example, if we want to know more about students' latest performance on the SAT, we would collect SAT scores from ETS, compile them in a way that is pertinent to us, and then form a distribution of these scores. The result may be a data table or it may be a plot. Regardless, once we &quot;see&quot; the data, we can begin asking more interesting research questions about our data.

The distributions we create often parallel distributions that are mathematically generated. For example, if we obtain the heights of all high school students and plot this data, the graph may resemble a normal distribution, which is generated mathematically. Then, instead of painstakingly collecting heights of all high school students, we could simply use a normal distribution to approximate the heights without sacrificing too much accuracy. 

In the study of statistics, we focus on mathematical distributions for the sake of simplicity and relevance to the real-world. Understanding these distributions will enable us to visualize the data easier and build models quicker. However, they cannot and do not replace the work of manual data collection and generating the actual data distribution. 

What percentage lie within a certain range? Distributions show what percentage of the data lies within a certain range. So, given a distribution, and a set of values, we can determine the probability that the data will lie within a certain range. 

The same data may lead to different conclusions if it is interposed on different distributions. So, it is vital in all statistical analysis for data to be put onto the correct distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wording ==

The introduction states &quot;A polynomial over some commutative ring with identity R is an expression in the form&quot;.  I first misread this as &quot;commutative ring with (identity R)&quot; rather than &quot;(commutative ring with identity) [named] R&quot;.  The context makes it pretty clear the latter is correct, but is there a better wording so that first timers don't make the same mistake I did?  I'm still learning these subjects myself, but it seems commutative rings with identity are the norm so the &quot;with identity&quot; part could either be omitted or parenthesized.

== Proving irreducibility ==

In showing that q(x)=x^4+x+2 is irreducible in Z_3, it's demonstrated that there are no linear factors by evaluating q(0), q(1), q(2), q(3), and q(4).  However, since we're in Z_3, isn't evaluating q(3) and q(4) redundant with q(0) and q(1)?

== Division Algorithm ==

I beleive the line:
Furthermore, we have the degree of r(x) ≤ degree of f(x)
should read:
Furthermore, we have the degree of r(x) ≤ degree of '''g'''(x)

I was going to say the same, only that the proper remark would be:&lt;br&gt;
... the degree of r(x) '''&lt;''' degree of '''g'''(x)&lt;br&gt;
The original statement might be right, but it's probably not as relevant as one regarding g(x). --[[User:Sgirbau|Sgirbau]] ([[User talk:Sgirbau|talk]]) 18:15, 8 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Downchuck.  You left a message for me on my user page indicating you wanted to chat.  What can I help you with? 
*Specifically, I'm curious about the possibility of copyright on Griffin's list of Journals. While I've seen all of the movies on the abutting list, I've certainly not witnessed even the existance of all of the Journals. Should I cut it down to Journals widely available (by quality of University library collections), should I trim it only to Journals I can personally review/confirm topicality? Otherwise, any general thoughts about the [[Wikiversity:Social Sciences]]?
**Copying the entire list from Griffin seems like it would breach copyright laws, but I'm certainly not an expert.  I would suggest following his format but modifying it extensively so no accusation of copyright infringement could be leveled.  There is certainly nothing wrong with creating your own list of journals in Communications, but you may want to see how many you can verify and point the titles to their corresponding web pages.  If they don't have websites, that may be a good way to determine which ones you want to keep: drop the ones that don't have websites.  As for the movies and such, that is clearly drawing very heavily on Griffin's work.  If I were you, I would probably put that list on hold until you can either modify it (by adding or replacing) or replace it entirely.  

:I've extensively modified Griffin's list of movies, adding more R-rated films, and removing all of the films I've not seen. But I understand that I'm walking a fine line. However, as a movie buff, I constantly quote movies to (fail to) explain concepts/thoughts. It typically fails because of the esoteric nature of any given person's catalog of films. But I think it's a wholey appropriate thing to include in a course Appendix. I'll take your advice (and mine) and renovate the Journal listings. I'll also spend more time revising the movie listing, so as to exclude movies listed by Griffin, and reduce his unwilling contribution to something negligible. If that doesn't work, I'll just remove all movies he mentions and restructure the categories.  [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC) I've reconsidered. The media titles should be supported by (an educational) discourse analysis. The list alone is bland and of little value. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:05, 13 July 2005 (UTC) I feel that I've wandered off track. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 21:16, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

*Also, [[User:jxn]] on [[Talk:Wikiversity:Social Sciences]] brings up a point. Most of the theory I focus on is from the Social sciences, but there are large areas of rhetorical criticism that are identified with Humanities.
:[[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 06:22, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
**This is an interesting issue.  Communications is generally included in the Humanities divisions of universities despite the fact that it draws heavily on social scientific theory and is increasingly turning to social scientific methods of research.  I have to admit I am not particularly familiar with Communications (I took one course in my undergraduate training on The Social Construction of Reality - Berger and Luckmann), so my opinion here may be tainted by the current setup of universities.  I would probably suggest keeping it in the Humanities section for now.  Perhaps this will change over time.  But if this division of Wikibooks develops well, I could certainly see the utility in cross-listing it in the social sciences.  I hope this helps. 
:Cross-listing makes some sense. I took some time reviewing various University websites, and Communications placed in the Social sciences on many of them. There are more however, that use the title, Humanities &amp; Social sciences, and others that simply use Liberal Arts. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
::The [[Wikiversity:School of Literature and English Studies]] provides most of the Humanities courses offered within the Communications catalog of my college. This allows the [[Wikiversity:School of Communication]] a greater focus on social science. There is some overlap that will need to be addressed, eventually.

One other thought... If you want someone to go over whatever you develop in terms of theory that is derived from the social sciences, just drop me a line on my talk page and I'll stop by to take a look.  Best... 

:Once it's developed, in terms of defensible substance, I certainly will. Many thanks. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]], chopped
*3 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves, minced
*3 large [[cookbook:beet|beet]]s, cubed (or 2 cans of beets)
*5 large [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, chopped
*1  large [[cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
*4 stalks of [[cookbook:celery|celery]], chopped
*2 lb. [[cookbook:meat|meat]], cubed
*1 lb. stew bones
*3 [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s (optional)
*2 24 oz. cans crushed [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es
*½ cup [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
# If you are using fresh beets, you first need to place them in boiling water for between 90 minutes and two hours.  For better flavor bake at 350 °F for 90 minutes. When they are soft enough that a fork will go in easily then they are done.  Put them in a sink or large bowl full of cool water.  Once they are cool pick up a beet and press your thumbs into the skin to start peeling them, sometimes they are not soft enough for this and you just need to cook them longer. If you use canned beets they will be ready right out of the can.
# While the beets are cooking you should start cooking the meat.  Place the meat and bones into a large 12 qt. stock pot.  Add the two cans of crushed tomatoes and a similar quantity of water.  Stir it up and bring to a boil.
# While the meat and beets are cooking chop up all of the vegetables, mince the garlic and squeeze the lemons.
# After the meat has been boiling for between an hour and 90 minutes then you should add all of the vegetables except the beets which are still cooking, the lemon juice and the sugar.
# Finish peeling and cubing the beets, when the simmering vegetables are soft add the beets, stir well.  Then add as much or as little lemon juice and sugar as you like, to suit your own taste.  Cook for five more minutes and it’s done.

'''Chocolate cheesecake''', rich in both chocolate and cheese.  It is noticeably less sweet than many other American desserts, and somewhat more complicated.

==Helpful equipment==
*[[Cookbook:Mixer|Electric mixer]]
*[[Cookbook:Springform Pan|Springform pan]]

==Ingredients==
===Crust===
*5 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted 
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] chocolate wafer crumbs, or the equivalent in chocolate [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or chocolate [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]]
===Filling===
*3 packages (8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (235g) each) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], at room temperature
*1 cup brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], packed
*5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*4 ounces (215g) (4 squares) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|semisweet chocolate]], melted
===Frosting===
*6 ounces (150g) (6 squares) semisweet chocolate, melted 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]

==Procedure==
#Place rack in center of the oven. Preheat oven to 150 °C (300 °F).
#If starting with whole cookies, crackers, or wafers, place them in a sturdy plastic bag a few at a time and crush using a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], or grind using a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].
#Mix together chocolate crumbs and melted butter.
#Press crumb mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch springform pan. 
#In a large bowl, beat together sugar and eggs at medium speed, slowly adding cream cheese, until smooth and fluffy. 
#Spoon half of cream cheese mixture into crust.
#Melt 4 ounces of chocolate using a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] or, with care, a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]].  Stir into remaining cream cheese mixture until well blended. 
#Drizzle over batter in crust.  Draw a spoon or other implement through the batter a few times to make swirls. Spread evenly.
#Bake cheesecake for 50 minutes.  After the first 30 minutes has gone by, place aluminum foil on top to prevent cracking and scorching.  
#Cool completely.
#Cover with plastic wrap, and chill for about 2 hours, up to several days.
#Transfer cheesecake to a serving plate.
#Uncover cheesecake; carefully remove side of pan.
=== Frosting ===
#Melt remaining chocolate.
#Mix with sour cream.
#Spread over cake, and chill to set.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Brown sugar is not absolutely necessary (can substitute granulated), but it provides better flavor.
*If no electric mixer is available, the cream cheese can be mixed with egg yolks one-at-a-time before the whites are added.  Unless you find separating eggs extremely difficult, this will be worthwhile for the effort saved in mixing.
*Without a springform pan, a cake this stiff will require that at least the first piece be broken up in the process of serving.  Fortunately, it's often easy to find someone who [[Cookbook:Aesthetics|doesn't care]].
*Without aluminum foil, the top of the cake will crack and brown somewhat, but frosting covers it effectively, making it practically unnoticeable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Cookbook help page}}

This page describes policies for pages in the [[Cookbook]]. It is a &quot;living document&quot; so it will change over time to reflect the standards created by Cookbook [[Cookbook:Contributors|contributors]].

==Recipe Formatting==
Recipes should be formatted according to the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template|recipe template]].

== Pages needing work ==
Pages which need work should be tagged with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, and will appear in [[:Category:Cookbook pages needing work]]. When a recipe has been sufficiently improved, the template should be removed.

==Naming Conventions==
===Cookbook Pages===

==== Case ====
The de-facto naming convention for Cookbook pages is [[w:Title case|title case]].

==== Name ====
Recipes should be named according to their traditional name, their origin, or their ingredients. Avoid naming recipes for people, unless it is a well-known recipe by that name. 

Recipes with a non-English name that have a common English name should be named with their common English name. For example, the primary name for [[Cookbook:Khaeng Keaw Wan]] should be [[Cookbook:Thai Green Curry]]. If necessary or desired a redirect from the name in the original language can be created. In cases where the non-English name is the common name, that name should be used, as in [[Cookbook:Huevos Rancheros]].

Recipes names with special characters ([[w:Diacritic|diacritics]], etc) should be primarily spelled with simple [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] characters and a redirect should be created with the special characters included.

==== Special Diets ====
Recipes for a [[Cookbook:Special Diets|special diet]] which are substantially adjusted variations of a normal recipe should be denoted by the diet name in parentheses after the name of the recipe. A vegan variation of [[Cookbook:Chili]] would be [[Cookbook:Chili (Vegan)]]; a gluten-free variation of [[Cookbook:Brownie]] would be [[Cookbook:Brownies (Gluten-Free)]]; a lactose-free variation of [[Cookbook:Milkshake]] would be [[Cookbook:Milkshake (Lactose-Free)]]. Recipes which adhere to a special diet, but are not variations for that specific diet ''should not'' be named in this fashion; instead only the appropriate category should be added. Trivial variations should be listed on the recipe page itself.

==== Duplicate Recipes and Disambiguation Pages ====
When there is more than one recipe for a single type of food, there are several ways to resolve the situation:
# If one recipe is of poor quality, delete it.
# If one recipe can be expressed as a variation upon the other, include it in the variations section and delete the original.
# If the recipes can be merged into a single recipe, merge them and delete the originals.
# Create a disambiguation page for the 'abstract' type of food (using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookdp}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template as a header) and give each recipe a unique name.

In the last case, the distinguishing name should be as descriptive of the unique qualities of the recipe as possible. For example, a disambiguation page is [[Cookbook:Lasagne]] which links to [[Cookbook:Traditional Lasagne]], [[Cookbook:Ricotta Lasagne]], and [[Cookbook:Lasagne with bean sauce]]. If there is not an appropriately descriptive way to distinguish the recipes, roman numerals should be used, as in [[Cookbook:Hummus I]].

===Cookbook Categories===
Cookbook-related categories are not entirely standardized, but these generally seem to be in the &quot;normal&quot; [[w:Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)|wikipedia form]] of capitalized first letter, lowercased first letter elsewhere (except with proper nouns).

For recipe categorization by ingredient, origin, diet, meal type, and recipe type classifications there is a tendency to use the &quot;___ recipes&quot; format e.g.:
* [[:Category:Egg recipes]] (by ingredient)
* [[:Category:Italian recipes]] (by origin)
* [[:Category:Vegan recipes]] (by diet)
* [[:Category:Cake recipes]] (by recipe type)
* [[:Category:Dessert recipes]] (by meal type)

For ingredient categorization, a plural form is generally used, e.g.:
* [[:Category:Fats and oils]]
* [[:Category:Cheese]]

==Featured Recipe and Ingredient==
The featured recipe and ingredient should be chosen to highlight the potential of the [[Cookbook]]. They should therefore be well written and wikified. In addition, the featured recipe should:
* have a picture of the finished recipe (if possible)
* follow the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template|recipe template]]
* have a recipe summary (see template above)
* have proper categories (by ingredient, diet, region, etc as appropriate)
* be an entire food item (i.e. not a component as in pie crust, sauces)

The featured ingredient should:
* have a picture of the ingredient
* have proper categories (by ingredient, diet, region, etc as appropriate)

The featured recipe and ingredient should be updated as frequently as once per week.

===Selection===
Cookbook contributors and users should tag worthy modules with [[:Category:Featured recipe candidate]] or [[:Category:Featured ingredient candidate]].

===Procedure===
* Edit [[Template:Featured recipe]] or [[Template:Featured ingredient]].
* Purge the cache of the main cookbook page, by [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Cookbook:Table_of_Contents&amp;action=purge clicking here]. This which will allow non-logged in users to see the change.
* Add [[:Category:Featured recipes]] or [[:Category:Featured ingredients]] to the featured item.

===Usage notes===
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Recipesummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
#* All fields are '''optional''', see [[Template:Recipe summary/doc#Examples]] for examples on using this template.
#* The &quot;Category&quot; tries to resolve to an actual category, but does ''not'' include the recipe in that category.
#* Rating is between 1 and 5 inclusive.
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nutritionsummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is shorthand for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Nutrition Summary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Its arguments are in the order they are displayed.
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Seasonality}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
#* The numbers entered are 1,2 or 3 for each month. 1 means the ingredient is not in season, 2 means the ingredient is not at it´s best, but is grown by natural means and 3 means the ingredient is in season. These values are entered for the northern hemisphere. The values for the southern hemisphere are automatically rotated 6 months.
#* Should preferably be accomplished by a small paragraph explaining the details of the seasonality of the ingredient. The page should also:
#** be tagged with one or more of [[:Category:Spring ingredients]], [[:Category:Summer ingredients]],   [[:Category:Autumn ingredients]], [[:Category:Winter ingredients]] or [[:Category:Ingredients available all year]].
#** be added to the tables on the [[cookbook:Seasonality|seasonality page]].
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{SeasonalitySpec}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used to enter the values for the southern hemisphere manually. The template has 24 number fields one per month per hemisphere, from Jan to Dec, northern hemisphere first.

      <comment>[[Van Dwelling:Dating]] moved to [[Van Dwelling/Dating]]: fixed NC</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The question of dating for Van Dwellers really has two sides to it. First, it can possibly scare some people when they discover they are dating a van dweller. Second, it can possibly scare a van dweller to be dating.

Many books about dating provide advice that is applicable to van dwellers, just as it is to the rest of society. Basically, before even contemplating dating, there are some things to consider:

# Do you have a way to maintain good personal hygiene?
# Do you have a steady way to make money? (Printing your own does not count).
# Do you have a stable place to live?

These are important questions to ask before beginning dating. It will be very difficult to get dates (or at least second dates) without good personal hygiene. Dating can be very well done on the cheap, but it will occasionally require some amount of money. 

The third question may be of most interest to some van dwellers. A very small percentage of the population is open to the idea of dating somebody that they view as &quot;homeless,&quot; even though you may not consider yourself homeless. As such, you probably only have 3 options:

# Only date people that accept your chosen mode of living.
# Just don't let people know.
# Don't date.

Since you're reading this, you probably don't consider #3 an option. Finding people that fit #1 may be difficult, but not impossible. Thus, we go to #2.

Since many people consider honesty to be one of those big cornerstones of a successful relationship, this one can get a bit tricky. Things can get even worse when a dating partner starts to question &quot;why we never go back to your place.&quot; Therefore, it may be advisable to let somebody know about your situation after a certain number of dates if you plan on pursuing a steady relationship.

This is strictly a personal philosophy, but I would tell a potential partner somewhere around date number five, if I had any inclination of pursuing a long term relationship. My approach would be to start a discussion about the desire for personal freedom and the escape of rampant consumerism and the rat race, and use that as a segue into explaining my living choice.

Of course, if you pick up your date in at his/her house in your van, then they might perhaps be able to figure it out on their own and simply ask. :)

Considering the fact that you have chosen this mode of living for one reason or another, you may actually end up finding potential partners amongst people that are of similar mindset and inclination. If this is an idea you are open to, consider plugging into your local &quot;alternative&quot; community. Most cities have some semblance of a community of people interested in simpler lifestyles, reduced consumerism, and some sort of activism related to such concepts. Participating in groups, activities, and gatherings for these sort of things could provide a plugin to a pool of eligible partners that are open to the van dwelling lifestyle.

== ??? ==

Well, yes I am aware... Me, together with a small interest group are making a course, based on guidelines i posted, that will utilize the text already there, and add much more content. there are real people here waiting for this course, so it is planned to release weekly. Please tell, just which part exactly you do not like. --[[User:Lastguru|Lastguru]] 04:09, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== want to contribute? ==

just in case my first statement was too excluding, noone stops other people contributing to the new lesson thread... I hope when there will be some content (in, like 4 months) it will be possible to make these the front-page lessons... will see...--[[User:Lastguru|Lastguru]] 04:24, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== Old Grammer lessons ==

Since you seem to be the chief contributer to them, are new lessons being made and the old lessons are obsolete or have you just given up on them? --[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 21:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

no i didn't gave up on them... the lessons marked as old should be restructurized a little bit. they are still great, and i am hoping to continue them. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 22:02, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Portuguese grammar is similar to the grammar of other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] (or even English) and like them there is a strong [[w:latin|latin]] structure that is always being reconstructed. The learner shall find archaic constructions being replaced by modern ones, mostly in colloquial language but even in formal and standard languages.

Firstly, we shall see that Portuguese has a flexible [[w:Word order|Subject-Verb-Object]] order, just like in English and there is no [[w:Declension|case]] declensation. Adjectives are generally placed after the noun. In some cases, there are some subtle differences in placing them after or before the noun, like in French.

The noun has singular and plural forms, but it is interesting to note that, unlike in English, the adjectives also are declinated. There are just two genders: masculine and feminine. The latin neuter gender was absorbed by the masculine one.

Portuguese verbs are slightly complicated, with lots of [[w:Grammatical tense|tenses]] and [[w:Grammatical mood|moods]]. There are also some tenses which are equivalent: like ''eu fizera'' and ''eu tinha feito'' (I had done).

Some peculiarities are remarkable. The Personal Infinitive verb conjugation is found in few languages, such as [[w:Gallician language|Gallician]] or [[w:Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Portuguese has also developed the Subjunctive mood in such way 
doesn't found in other Romance languages and is used even in familiar language. Although, the most special feature of this language is the nasals. The nasal vowels - very abundant - has developed in the same way as in French. But the nasal diphtongues found in no language but Portuguese, probably . Although these diphtongues - ão, õe - are difficult for foreigners to pronounce, there is usually no confusion if they are mispronouced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blender 2.36 HotKeys ==

Ok, I converted this Hotkeys from official [http://www.blender.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=documentation&amp;file=index Blender PDF] file. Please use official Hotkeys names in your articles! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 14:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== ideas for organization ==

I'd like to start a discussion about how this book should be organized.  Perhaps the organization should be changed, or maybe it should stay the way it currently is.  Here's an idea:

Create a page for each shortcut.  The URL would be formatted very specifically; for example:

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Edit Mode/EKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Vertex Paint Mode/VKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Object Mode/SHIFT-DKEY]]

This way there could be very detailed information about each of the shortcuts in the different modes.

Then on the Mode Pages, for example the Edit Mode page, the shortcuts could be listed by function....

'''Edit Mode'''

'''''Mesh Modeling'''''

A

*AKEY - select all

E

*EKEY - extrude

etc...

: It's good idea to explain more detailed information about every HotKey, maybe even with examples or links to tutorial examples, but I think that is also good to have all HotKeys in one place (as it is) and from here links to more detailed explanations as you said [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]]. I would like to see here also keyboard drawing with color marked HotKeys large enough that can be printed and used on actual keyboard. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:30, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I just learned something using Template:whatever and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, let me try it out, I think this will help. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Check this out.  Follow the subpages I've created and take a look at the way these &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; work.  We can then embed the same hotkey instructions on any Blender book page anywhere in wikibooks using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Check it out: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_HotKeys/new

: Cool! This looks nice and useful! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:59, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Blender 2.37a HotKeys Update ==

New HotKeys are marked with &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:21, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's not at all uncommon to require information concerning rotation on a robot, whether from arm or manipulator axis motion to drive wheel speed. Rotary encoders can be found in several varieties, most commonly mechanical or using photodetectors. In mechanical encoders, electrical contacts periodically connect, usually to drive a terminal high or low. These electrical pulses are then used for information. Photodetector encoders can be made smaller and operate much quicker. Typically, a reflective sensor will shine on a marked reflective surface, or a photointerruptor will shine through a disc with transparent and opaque sections, such that the amplitude of received light causes high and low electrical pulses in the receiver. These pulses are then decoded by external circuitry.

==Encoding==
	Depending on the type and reliability of information needed, the patterning on the rotary encoder will be increasingly complex. If only rotational speed is required, a simple alternating pattern will do, but if both speed and direction are needed, more encoded information is required. Encoding position will inherently yield information regarding velocity and direction, as comparing the direction of change in position will give direction of rotation, where the change in position with respect to time will (by definition) indicate speed.
	The specific type of position encoding will depend on the precision required, as well as the reliability: how much of an error in measured rotational position due to an error in reading the encoded information, is acceptable in the application.

==Measuring Rotational Speed==
[[Image:Incremental encoder.gif|thumb|Example of simple speed-detection rotary encoder]]
	For some applications, only rotational speed needs to be considered. If a toothed wheel which is mechanically limited to spinning a single direction is being measured, the direction is already known, and only the velocity remains. Perhaps a feedback system is being developed for drive speed on a robot, and an encoder on the axle will enable the controller to calibrate speed by varying PWM values; if the controller enables the motor to spin in a specific direction, all it requires is the rotational speed. All that is necessary to measure speed is a single alternating pattern causing the detector to emit a pulsetrain. The pulse rate will be directly proportional to the rotational speed; measuring the time between consecutive rising (or falling) edges and dividing that into the angle of rotation represented by a pulse will yield the rate of rotation. 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \approx {{{2 \pi} \over n} \over {(T_1 - T_0)}}, ~~~ where~n = pulses~per~revolution
&lt;/math&gt;

If the rate is changing during the time of the measurement, the calculated rate will be an average approximating the instantaneous rate. This is where precision comes into play – the more pulses per rotation, the shorter the time between measurements, and the closer the approximation is to correct. Anyone familiar with calculus will recognize that the rate of change of position with respect to time is a derivative, and the definition of the derivative states that as the timestep across which a measurement for approximation is taken approaches zero, the result is equal to the derivative at that time.


:&lt;math&gt;lim~ \Delta t \rightarrow 0 ~~ { { { \theta ( T_0 + \Delta t ) } - { \theta (T_0) } \over {\Delta t }}} = {{d \theta (t)} \over {dt}} = {\omega (t) }&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta t = {T_1 - T_0} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;lim~ (T_1 - T_0) \rightarrow 0 ~~ { { { \theta ( T_0 + (T_1 - T_0) ) } - { \theta (T_0) } \over {{T_1 - T_0} }}} = {{d \theta (t)} \over {dt}} = {\omega (t) }&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;lim~ (T_1 - T_0) \rightarrow 0 ~~ { { { \theta (T_1 ) } - { \theta (T_0) } \over {{T_1 - T_0}}}} = {{d \theta (t)} \over {dt}} = {\omega (t) }&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \theta (T_m) = m \frac {2\pi}{n}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \theta(T_1) - \theta(T_0) = \frac{2\pi}{n}(1 - 0) = \frac{2\pi}{n}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;lim~ (T_1 - T_0) \rightarrow 0 ~~ { { { \theta (T_1 ) } - { \theta (T_0) } \over {{T_1 - T_0}}}} = { {\frac{2\pi}{n} } \over {T_1 - T_0} } = {{d \theta (t)} \over {dt}} = {\omega (t) }&lt;/math&gt;

	Measuring the difference in the calculated velocities of successive pulses can give an approximation of rotational acceleration as well.

==Measuring Direction==
[[Image:Incremental directional encoder.gif|thumb|Two-row encoder for finding speed and direction]]
	Assume a machine is tuning its PWM routines for powering the drive wheels. The controller obviously needs to know the rotational speed of the wheels so it can determine the speed outputs for given duty cycles. But what if the machine is placed on a hill? It starts to roll backward and the controller sees a substantial rotational speed for no input, which messes up the entire calibration process. If the controller were able to determine that the wheel was spinning backward, it would know to ignore the speed information.
	In order to determine direction with a rotary encoder, there must be at least two patterns on the disk, so there is a reference for the direction of change. The simplest way to achieve this is with two alternating patters that are half a pulse out of phase with each other.

	If the disc is rotating in a particular direction (in this case, such that the pattern slides to the left), the rising (or falling) edge of channel A will be detected before that of channel B; if rotation is in the opposite direction, the edge of channel B will be detected first. By testing for which pattern's edges are detected first, the direction of rotation can be determined. The time between pulses for a single channel can be measured to approximate rotational speed. However, combining detections from the two channels gives an effective pulse rate double that of a single channel, which halves the measuring time and doubles precision.
	A means of measuring speed and direction with a single channel exists as well. Two receivers are placed on a single channel spaced half a pulse width apart, so that as the disc rotates, one sensor will be in state as the other transitions. The order in which the two sensors transition into a state is dependent on the direction of rotation of the disc.

==Measuring Position==
[[Image:Binary_encoder.gif|thumb|Simple binary encoder example]]
[[Image:Gray_Code_encoder.gif|thumb|Simple Gray code encoder example]]
	The simplest way to determine an angular position on a rotary encoder is to divide the disc into segments and imprint each segment with a unique pattern. The more segments the disc is divided into, the more precision is gained in knowing the location at a given time (each segment will cover a span of angles, so there will be uncertainty, but more segments will give fewer degrees per segment). More segments, however, require more unique identifiers, which means a more complex scheme. This discussion is limited to digital-signal encoders, where the possible outputs for any given channel are limited to 0 or 1. This is conducive to a binary encoding scheme, where each segment is imprinted with a unique binary number. The number of unique IDs required depends on the number of segments; the number of channels is equal to log2(n) where n is the number of segments. A disc with 8 segments has a resolution of 360° / 8 = 45° per segment, and requires log2(8) = 3 separate channels. For a doubling of the number of segments, precision is doubled with an increase of only one pattern channel.

==Reliability==
One of the problems with using a binary encoding scheme is detector error. There's no guarantee that every channel is going to transition at the same time, which can cause a misread of a segment's ID. If the section of the disc below the detector is transitioning from one segment to the next, briefly the decoder might read only part of the bits correctly. Assume a standard eight-segment binary encoding scheme, where segments are numbered from 0 to 8 sequentially: if the transition from segment 000 to segment 001 doesn't read the rising edge correctly, your read is off by one space, which for the moment is negligible. If, however, it's transitioning from segment 011 to segment 100, and the least significant bit is read in first, briefly your controller will think it's transitioned to 010, in the complete opposite direction. If the most significant bit is read in first, it'll think it jumped from 011 to 111, on the complete opposite side of the wheel. Transition errors when a single bit changes can often be considered negligible, as the error in calculated position is 1. Errors from multi-bit transitions can be catastrophic.

Gray code is a specific type of binary pattern in which there is only a single bit changing during a transition from one element to the next. Being a binary pattern, Gray codes use the same number of channels for the same number of specific patterns; they are just ordered differently. Binary uses patterns in a numerically sequential order; Gray code does not. Encoding positions using this method will require additional software or hardware to decode the ID (as a simple binary conversion will not yield a sequentially-ordered set of segments), but the benefits for the reliability of hardware are substantial – as only a single bit changes during each transition, then the maximum error in detected position for an error in pattern reception is 1 segment.
	Gray code can be written out bitwise in much the same way binary can. In binary, the least significant bit alternates from 0 to 1 every step; the next bit alternates every two steps, the next every four and so on. In Gray code, each bit holds a pattern of 0-1-1-0; the least bit holds each element for one step; the next bit holds each two steps, the next four and so on. It can be noticed that two-channel Gray code is identical to the two-channel pattern used to find rotational direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prerequisites: Addition

Subtraction deals with the taking away of numbers, like number a from number b so that: a &gt;= b while b &gt; a. Such a case is with:

20 - 10 = 10.

a = 20 and b = 10.

So a - b = 10, a &gt;= b is true, and b &gt; a is initially true.

Subtraction is the inverse of addition, meaning that it is the opposite.

While our number remains at 23, we could either move it up (to 25) or down (to 20). Since the number is closer to 20, we make the number 20.

(b): Our number is now 26. This number is above 5. And since 30-4 =26, we will increase the number to 30, because of the small gap.


But what about the number 5? For all numbers what include 5, we round them up to the nearest 10.

(c):
Number = 25.
New number = 30 (after rounding).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientific notation or exponents deals with the simplification of very large or small numbers into easy to read ones. Often used alot in sciences such as physics or in scientific math, scientific notation (referred to as exponents from here on in for naming conventions) can be used to describe the size of an electron, or the speed of light. 

The speed of light in one such example is shown as:

3.0 x 10^8 or 3.0E8 Where 10^8 stands for 10 to the 8th exponent and 10E8 means the same.

The size of an electron could be described as this for an example:

3.45 x 10^-23 or 3.45E-23 Where 10^-23 means 10 to the -23 exponent (E the same), which is actually making it into a fraction, meaning that 3.45 x 10^-23 will be:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{3.45}{100000000000000000000000}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">* What the hell are you doing? You can not add that table of contents without taking it to the discussion page first! I am awrare that this is a wikibook, but i still feel that as i am the major contributor, i should at least been consulted before adding things! And i am totally against the statement that articles should be started in the table of contentds.

This table of contents is not needed at all, the whole book is based on a table of contents!

I am really pissed off now!! --August 22:16, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

*'''First of all''' - calm down, relax, remember all, what I have wroted and think... And then (let's say after 2 days) if You will insist to remove that TOC, I will move it to my Sandbox. Ok?&lt;BR&gt;'''Second''' - If I need this type of TOC, maybe someone else will need? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 13:45, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

**You should not tell me to calm down, as i think i acted as i should. This TOC only creates more work for us, and makes it more &quot;uneazy&quot; to browse the book. Only one toc is needed, and the whole book is boult around a toc! --August 23:40, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

*Sorry for some didactis, but seems You are overreacting... Why You can't realise, that 'toc_August_version' does not suit AndriuZ needs, so 'toc_AndriuZ_version' was created ? This did not corrupted Your's contributions to the book itself in any way. Whole Idea behind Wikipedia is cooperation of efforts. Your arguments are not accepted, because for me 'toc_August_version' not provides functions of TOC, just TOC_TOPICS... Put links 'next reading' on each page and will see... Maybe I'm oldfashioned, but according to [[w:Book]] and [[w:Table of contents]] is: ''an organized list of titles for '''quick''' information on the summary of a book or document and '''quickly directing''' the reader to '''any''' topic.'' I repeatedly ask You to provide more logic arguments (not emotions) - othervise I will ignore and if You want to make book for yourself - make it on Your '''own installation''' of Wiki... Sorry again. --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 09:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

**I have stopped contributing to this book now, as i cannot stand people like you doing very silly things to my book. Wiki is nothing for me, i guess. I will create another version of the book at mambosolutions.com instead, where i can control the content - so far other people have just added crap (exept for typo fixing), so i will just create it by myself there. --August 19:02, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

No problem! Good to see sparklin' new recipes! My blasted session timed out again... [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:47, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== Jewish Recipes ==
I think &quot;Jewish cuisine&quot; would be an appropriate subsection of [[Cookbook:Cuisine]], though I'm sure there's some overlap into other regional cuisines. You may want to introduce regional sections or lineage sections underneath it, and crosslist common recipes and also crosslist the recipes when the coincide with normal regional cuisine (i.e. not entirely jewish-specific) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:24, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stuff to be merged into [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]

== Weapon availability at ammunation ==

Weapons become available once you open up a new area of the game or complete a certain mission:

Country Rifle- Complete Body Harvest

Satchel Charges- Complete Against All Odds

Desert Eagle- Open Las Venturas

Combat Shotgun- Complete You've Had Your Chips

Sniper Rifle- Complete Snail Trail

Colt M4- Open the Dessert

AK-47- Open San Fierro

== Vertical bird mission ==

The right analog stick controls the position of the jets. Pushing forward rotates the jets so they point backwards. Pulling back rotates the jets so they point down. The former makes it behave more like a plane, and the latter makes it behave more like a helicopter.

For the first part (air-to-air combat), you probably want the former, for the second part (air-to-ground combat), you probably want the latter.

In both cases, try to get the target in view, press R1 to lock on. When the green crosshair turns red, press L1 to fire missiles.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mambo 4.5.3: hopes and realities... Impressions...  
08.07.2004  Kiselyov Denis    
So you have decided to extort and establish CVS version Mambo 4.5.3 (upasi My God to do it without valerjanki, at me nerves strong it is simple)... 
What for this moment it is made by developers? 
And it is made here that... 
'Pluses: 
* multishablonnost, i.e. each basic section of the menu (category) can appoint the pattern. Not bad... But forces the designer to do patterns so that they corresponded to integrity of design as those... If patterns will collapse on color scale.. The Gloom will be... We Have: the majority of beginners mamberov is simple zabjut on this opportunity, and for the pro not sickly help... Fortunately it is possible to appoint one pattern for all sections. 
* There was a concept &quot;element&quot;, which in turn can include (and in a crowd) both components, and modules, both boats, and patterns. We have: for the user of convenience establishing an element well it is direct as in VIP hotel, for the developer the complicated architecture of creation installjatora, but it is that costs. 
* Creation of own fields of a conclusion of modules. I.e. them will be not 6 as was.. And the to appoint it is possible... Conveniently devilishly... We Have: at use of standard patterns this function simply disappears (admit fairly, not everyone are able to correct patterns, I speak about beginners), well and if handles primontirovany there where it is necessary SUCH it is possible to heap up! - Radely &quot;References&quot;, &quot;Announcements&quot; and &quot;Contacts&quot; now are not separate components and a part of kernel Mamby.. Though burst instead of you will cut out already...:i) 
* Internationalization is made very well, and... Now each of a site-aeeaa?ia has an opportunity to edit lokali manually from adminki! (mine regardy to developers!) 
Speed of generation of pages has essentially increased. It is connected with transition to a little bit other system of installation of parameters and a cutting of gathering of statistics on a site. We have: who on a hosting does not have administrator of the control panel a hosting with statistics fly by, at whom is.. Has carried... 

;Minuses: 

* And it is not realized up to the end krossbazovost. Support PostgreSQL till now in a condition of planning. That that I expected was not justified. True krossbazovosti do not wait... 
* Patterns are planned to moving to the catalogue of elements (imho: not the best decision, but we have centralization), the catalogue of elements will get the huge sizes at installation of a plenty of elements. 
* Now the pattern is added as an element, instead of simple copying in the necessary catalogue. To choose a pattern begins business gemmorojnym (I speak about a choice haljavnyh patterns when much and all would be desirable to look them in operation) 
* And it is not realized till now multi sajtovost and krossautentifikatsija. 

Perhaps while will suffice. It is a lot of defects, but I ask to consider, that it is just the CVS version... And up to bety it is still far. Three weeks. For three weeks much can happen.:i) 

But as a whole I am happy. Developers have made much. And still will make much.:i) 

N.B. Expected date of an output of the first bety Mambo 453 - the end of July, 2005.

__NOTOC__

'''Lasagna''' is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough. In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with  small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and simialrly small amounts of  [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|&quot;besciamella&quot; ]] or béchamel sauce in an oven dish. There are at least 5 layers of pasta dough, and the layers stay separate and do not &quot;merge&quot; together into a mush. A light sprinkling of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese| Parmigiano-Reggiano ]], and a few dabs of butter end the dish which is then baked for about half an hour. The use of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|Mozzarella]] in place of Béchamel suggests a Neapolitan variation to the original Bologna classic, as does the use of Ricotta.

''Lasagne'' refers to multiple sheets of pasta; ''lasagna'' refers to the dish or to individual sheets of pasta.

In Italy but especially outside, many lasagna variations exist today. Vegetable lasagna, lasagna without béchamel sauce, lasagna without any sauce (just vegetables and/or meat) or even lasagna without sheets of pasta.

When assembling a lasagna, start with the main ingredient (ragu, vegetables, seafood, etc.), add a layer of béchamel sauce, then one layer of lasagne pasta sheets and then the main ingredient again. Continue until the oven dish is full. End with a layer of pasta, spread some béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle the cheese over it. 

== The Pasta ==
When it comes to the pasta dough there is, as always, a choice between home-made pasta and store bought sheets of dried pasta. Since dried pasta is made with just water and flour and home made fresh pasta usually includes eggs, there is a distinct difference in flavour and texture. The main difference, however, comes from ease of use. Making pasta from scratch can be a lengthy process and takes some practice to get it right. See the [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] page for a fresh pasta recipe.

Dried pasta is usually precooked, so it can be put in to the oven dish straight out of the packet. 

In the US, pasta sheets generally have a curvy surface. Outside the US, they are almost always flat. 

Apart from the plain lasagne sheets, the green ones that Bologna favours are also common. These are called ''lasagne verdi'' and are flavored with spinach. They work well with white sauces ([[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|bechamels]] or cream-based sauces and seafood.

== General Guidelines for making Lasagna ==

* Most packaged lasagna need to cook in a preheated oven for 30 to 50 minutes (based on the size) at gas mark 4 (350°F/180°C).

== Notes, Tips &amp; Variations ==

* Some recipes call for the béchamel sauce to be mixed through the ragu or tomato sauce, while others tell you to layer it between the pasta and the ragu. This seems to be based on personal preference and taste.
* Besides sprinkling cheese on top of the lasagna, it's also a good idea to mix some through the béchamel sauce, to give the lasagna some cheese flavor throughout, instead of just on top. Turn the heat off under the béchamel sauce before adding the cheese, or the sauce will become rubbery.
* A [[Cookbook:Moussaka|Moussaka]] is essentially a lasagna with slices of eggplant instead of pasta.
* A [[Cookbook:Pastitsio|Pastitsio]], or Greek Lasagna, is a Greek casserole like lasagna where the ragu is combined with tubular pasta, and topped with a [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|béchamel sauce]].
* A [[Cookbook:Scacchi|Scacchi]] or ''mina'' is a lasagna-like dish made during Passover by some Italian and Sephardic Jews, using broth or water-soaked matzo as the starch layer and generally containing ground beef or lamb, spinach or other greens, and other vegetables as ingredients.

Hey, I'd like you to have a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] and consider giving this course a hierarchy. At the moment it's entirely up to you to show readers what the parent of a page is. And doing it the way you are now you're eventually going to run into conflicts with existing books/pages' names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Order of Operations in math is dealing with the order in which you work out an equation, which can solve many problems.

For example:

2 x 3 + 5 = x

In this example, what is x?
We could either multiply 2 by 3, then add 5 to it OR we could add 3 and 5 together and multiply that by two. But how do we know?

Using BODMAS we can. BODMAS stands for Brackets Over Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction. This is the order we go in.

So using BODMAS we will multiply first and then add. So it is really:

(2x3) + 5 = x
x = 11

Order of operation is also inportant in boolean algebra (see: Boolean Algebra). When a problem needs to be solved, it can be turned into BODMAS form to solve it. For example:

1 AND 1 OR 0 NAND 1. How would this work? If we convert it, it is:

1x1+0x1'= x 

So we would go for multiplication first, 
1x1 = 1. 

so it is now:

1+0x1'=x

We do multiplication again:
0x1 = 0, but because this is the inverse, we make it 1.

So it is now:
1+1 = 2 (or in this case 1, because it is OR).

And our problem gets solved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decimals (or floating point numbers) are the oposite of fractions, where fractions take the form of a number over a number eg:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; which is one half.

In decimal format this would be 0.5. Why?

Well one half of 1 is 0.5 since 0.5 * 2 is equal to 1. If we multiply the number at the bottom by the decimal we should get the number at the top. Such as:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; Is still one half.  
&lt;math&gt;2/4 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0.5*4 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

So the formulae could be: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}=x&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;x*b = a&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measurement in math is the act of finding the length, width, height etc... of a certain object, different measurement schemes are used for different objects.

eg:

Centimetres for small shapes, 
Square centimetres for area
Centimetres cubed for volume.

There are different ways of measuring geometric shapes, depending on the dimentional qualities of them.
For example, measuring a line ----- long, you could count how many dashes there are, and call it 5 dashes long, or you could measure it with a ruler.

But for something like:

  -------
  I     I
  I     I
  -------

You would first use the formula for Area to get the inside size, or use the formula for perimeter.
A=LW for a square,
So Area = Length * Width

So as &lt;math&gt;4 * 7 = 28cm^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which is 28cm squared

For perimeter in a square, you take each side and add them together.
So &lt;math&gt;4 + 4 + 7 + 7= 2*4 + 2*7 = 8 + 14 = 22&lt;/math&gt;

Portuguese alphabet, like in other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] has a natural evolution from latin and so it is not strictly phonetic and has some features inheirited from its history. Although, compared to English or even French it is easy to read and not so hard to write.

== Welcome ==

Cooked according to classic preparation rules, Tafelspitz (literally translated: the point of the table) is known to have been Austrian Hungarian Emperor Francis Joseph's favourite meal. Viennese “Tafelspitz” for Austrians is not only a way to boil beef, but is a whole special culinary science prepared with a special cut of beef. It is not a pot roast. The authentic Tafelspitz requires a custom-cut fresh piece of the hind part of beef (comparable to the American tri tip, also called silver tip); on the North American market, a substitute can be fresh beef chuck brisket (not corned brisket).

The secrets of a juicy Tafelspitz are: heating the water to a rolling boil before the piece of meat is put in the water; the sudden sealing of the meat’s juices as soon as the meat’s pores close when the Tafelspitz touches the boiling water; not too much salt, but enough to enhance the meat’s flavour; a few pieces of vegetables (sometimes also sections of bones with marrow), the right cooking time, and the gentle rolling of the boiling water which will cook but not break the meat’s fibre. This recipe is a simplified version of this very Austrian dish.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 ½ pounds (1200g) of either fresh beef brisket, silverside or sirloin-enough water for your suitable Dutch oven pot (about 5 Qt. (700ml) Pot capacity with about 4 Qts. (560ml) Of water) + salt (about ½ tablespoon for every Qt. Of water).
* 3 whole cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], slightly crushed, peeled.
* 3 whole green (freeze dried) or white [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]].
* 2 [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]] (you may substitute with 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]).
* 3 whole medium size [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], peeled, trimmed (about 4 oz. [110g)]).
* 1 small-medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], trimmed, unpeeled, halved (about 2 oz [55g]).
* 3 sprigs fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].

== Procedure ==

# In a suitable covered Dutch oven, bring water to a rolling boil over medium heat.
#When the water boils, add meat, garlic, peppercorns, juniper berries, and cover.
# Bring the water to a boil again and add carrots, onion, and parsley.
#Cover and let everything simmer for 60 minutes.
#Turn the meat over, add salt, and let everything cook, covered, for 90 additional minutes.
# Switch off the heat and let the meat steep for 20 minutes.
#Remove the meat from the broth and cut meat across the grain when you serve it.

Serve Tafelspitz with “Apfelkren” and your choice of raw and cooked vegetables.

Note :Keep the broth for soups. Cut cold meat leftovers in thin strips and use like a meat salad mixed with raw sliced onions dressed with a simple oil, vinegar, salt and pepper vinaigrette.

How to make “Apfelkren” (apple horseradish sauce) for Tafelspitz:

# Combine and blend 1 pound Golden Delicious apples, cored, peeled, grated and cooked until very mushy with 1 tablespoon wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why are these together? [[User:Notthe9|Notthe9]] 05:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

Bobcats are actually a ''type'' of Lynx, so all this information on them being &quot;different&quot; is false. See the [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568386/Lynx.html Encarta article]. --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 02:45, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Changed it around a bit, making it clear that bobcats are a kind of lynx. I messed up the layout slightly, but I feel the image I added shows the face of a lynx beautifully. I went and called the ''Lynx Lynx'' and ''Lynx Canadensis'' just plain Lynx, since they are very similar in the first place. Not the best of edits, but I feel it was a step in the right direction. --[[User:BCalchet|BCalchet]] 04:02, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* My Questions for who I talk to */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">For the interview section, or perhaps just content for the Big Cats issue, I am planning to attempt to solicit an interview with someone at [http://www.livingdesert.org/ The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens] here in the Palm Springs, CA area.

They have one or more:
Bobcat 
Caracal 
Cheetah 
Leopard
Ocelot 
Puma
Serval

==My Questions for you here==
*How should I deal with this?  I am thinking of introducing myself as &quot;Mike Graham with (or maybe ''from'') the WikiMedia Foundation,&quot; which has an air of legitamacy to it.  I hope introducing myself as such would not be to presumptuous.

*I should also probably give myself a title.  Contributor sounds a little too informal, it seems to me.  Would calling myself a writer for the Foundation be going to far?

:I think either contributor or volunteer sound general enough that they leave a lot of room for interpretation, especially volunteer since you are representing a foundation.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

*Are there any matters of interview etiquitte I should be aware of?  Also, how should I dress?  (Note: it is very hot here, I'm talking in excess of 110 degrees.  I suspect this might be an outdoor, touring interview.  At least that's what I'd like, and I think that might be most productive.

:The most important rule I've heard isn't ettiquitte: Never ask a question that can be answered with a yes or no.  Rephrasing such a question will get you way more information.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

==My Questions for who I talk to==
::Post suggestions here for questions, or other suggestions.  I'll post more details about who I will be interviewing (assuming I will be interviewing somoene) when I get information.

These are the kinds of things I think kids would ask:
*What do you feed your cats and how much do they eat?
*Which of your cats are considered the most dangerous?
*How do the cats get exercise in the zoo?
*What types of toys do they have / particularly enjoy?
*Where do you get your big cats?
*How do you keep them from escaping?
*What kind of special care do cubs born in the zoo require?

I might also ask 
*What are the biggest problems zoos face in caring for big cats?
*What question do you wish more people would ask?

This is definitely something where input from someone with a classroom full of our target age would be really helpful.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:19, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:Also if the [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Tigons and Ligers]] is staying, you probably want to ask about Tiger and Lion hybridization in zoos and the ethics of it.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Things encountered on Linux

*GCC
*Makefiles
*Tarballs
*Bash Scripts
*Free Software Licences
*Packaging Systems (e.g. deb)
*Versioning Systems (e.g. CVS, Subversion)


== Free Software Licences ==

Due to Linux's origins you will find that a lot of packages available for it
use various types of free licenses. It is important that you pay attention 
to these if you are going to be using the code for any further development.


== Tarballs ==

A term referring to a package stored as a file with the extension tar.gz 
these are often used for distributing source files. They perform a similar 
function to a zip file.

==Makefiles==
A text file used by the make program to create a program. The script used to make a program uses the form
 program : codefiles
  command to build

The script
 clean:
   rm -f objectfiles program
tells make what to delete when the command &lt;tt&gt;make clean&lt;/tt&gt; is invoked.

== Versioning Systems ==

In open development processes many people may be working on the same codebase.
To ease the complexity of co-ordinating development the code is sometimes stored 
in a versioning system. This usually consists of a central repository where developers 
can &quot;check out&quot; (like you check a book out of a library) pieces of code to work on
they then work on it and their changes are merged back in when they have finished.

----

In set theory you can specify a set by naming the elements of a set (say &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) and giving constraints on them (say &lt;math&gt;cond(a)&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt; \{a | cond(a) \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Now try to construct the set of all sets that do not contain themselves in the above notation. If it were to exist, all sets should be unambigously elements of that set or not. Otherwise a contradiction would result. Which set would be most worthwhile to consider?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy of consciousness==

The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a confident use of nineteenth century scientific ideas amongst philosophers of mind and a few philosophers such as Whitehead were also coming to terms with modern science.

==ER Clay==
ER Clay deserves a mention in the catalogue of important nineteenth century philosophers of consciousness for the quotation from his work given in William James' classic text ''The Principles of Psychology'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past -- a recent past -- delusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three . . . nonentities -- the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clay provides an eloquent description of the extended, or ''specious'', present, mentioning both the way that consciousness seems to occupy a duration of time and the way that events within conscious experience have their own durations so that they snap out of existence when they end. This description in itself allows us to see how McTaggart's &quot;A Series&quot; might be constructed from the overlapping extended present's of events.

Clay's use of the pejorative term &quot;specious&quot; for the way that experience has a duration was necessary in the nineteenth century but now we know that it was the nineteenth century idea of physical time that was specious. A neutral term for experience laid out in time might be the &quot;extended present&quot;.

==Alfred North Whitehead==

[http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Whitehead/Whitehead_1920/White1_01.html The Concept of Nature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1920): 49-73.]

Many twentieth century philosophers have taken the nineteenth century idea of space and time as the framework within which their descriptions of experience are elaborated. Whitehead was a mathematician and philosopher who understood the limitations of this framework and pointed out that our failure to understand and overcome these limitations was probably at the root of our failure to understand consciousness. He traces the problem to the nineteenth century view of time and space and rails against materialists who elevate nineteenth century scientific doctrine above observational and scientific reality.  

He also believed that mind and nature are part of the same phenomena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I am essentially protesting against is the bifurcation of nature into two systems of reality, which, in so far as they are real, are real in different senses. One reality would be the entities such as electrons which are the study of speculative physics. This would be the reality which is there for knowledge; although on this theory it is never known. For what is known is the other sort of reality, which is the byplay of the mind. Thus there would be two natures, one is the conjecture and the other is the dream.

Another way of phrasing this theory which I am arguing against is to bifurcate nature into two divisions, (31) namely into the nature apprehended in awareness and the nature which is the cause of awareness. The nature which is the fact apprehended in awareness holds within it the greenness of the trees, the song of the birds, the warmth of the sun, the hardness of the chairs, and the feel of the velvet. The nature which is the cause of awareness is the conjectured system of molecules and electrons which so affects the mind as to produce the awareness of apparent nature. The meeting point of these two natures is the mind, the causal nature being influent and the apparent nature being effluent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that science is about the relations between things:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The understanding which is sought by science is an understanding of relations within nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead was aware of the way that the simultaneity of events is of crucial importance to phenomenal experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general fact is the whole simultaneous occurrence of nature which is now for sense-awareness. This general fact is what I have called the discernible. But in future I will call it a 'duration,' meaning thereby a certain whole of nature which is limited only by the property of being a simultaneity. Further in obedience to the principle of comprising within nature the whole terminus of sense-awareness, simultaneity must not be conceived as an irrelevant mental concept imposed upon nature. Our sense-awareness posits for immediate discernment a certain whole, here called a 'duration'; thus a duration is a definite natural entity. A duration is discriminated as a complex of partial events, and the natural entities which are components of this complex are thereby said to be 'simultaneous with this duration.' Also in a derivative sense they are simultaneous with each other in respect to this duration. Thus simultaneity is a definite natural relation. The word' duration' is perhaps unfortunate in so far as it suggests a mere abstract stretch of time. This is not what I mean. A duration is a concrete slab of nature limited by simultaneity which is an essential factor disclosed in sense-awareness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead also stresses the role of the extended, or 'specious', present in sense awareness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to distinguish simultaneity from instantaneousness. I lay no stress on the mere current usage of the two terms. There are two concepts which I want to distinguish, and one I call simultaneity and the other instantaneousness. I hope that the words are judiciously chosen; but it really does not matter so long as I succeed in explaining my meaning. Simultaneity is the property of a group of natural elements which in some sense are components of a duration. A duration can be all nature present as the immediate fact posited by sense-awareness. A duration retains within itself the passage of nature. There are within it antecedents and consequents which are also durations which may be the complete specious presents of quicker consciousnesses. In other words a duration retains temporal thickness. Any concept of all nature as immediately known is always a concept of some duration though it may be enlarged in its temporal thickness beyond the possible specious present of any being known to us as existing within nature. Thus simultaneity is an ultimate factor in nature, immediate for sense-awareness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So a set of events that are extended in time constitutes conscious experience. He then defines continuity in terms of overlapping durations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuity of nature arises from extension. Every event extends over other events, and every event is extended over by other events. Thus in the special case of durations which are now the only events directly under consideration, every duration is part of other durations; and every duration has other durations which are parts of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That experience exists as whole durations that overlap means that the overlapping durations can be considered to be composed of moments or instants and these can be assigned to a series which we call 'time':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such an ordered series of moments is what we mean by time defined as a series. Each element of the series exhibits an instantaneous; state of nature, Evidently this serial time is the result of an intellectual process of (65) abstraction.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Processes can occur within a duration of sense awareness so things can change within the extended present of a conscious interval.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sense-awareness and thought are themselves processes as well as their termini in nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Whitehead's durations of sense awareness both contain processes and are phenomena in their own right.  A movement can be both a succession of changes of position and a quality of motion over the whole duration that contains it.

One disturbing feature of his analysis is that he does not mention the way that durations are attached to events; Clay states that the extension in time of an event disappears when the event ceases.

&lt;!-- this paragraph needs a reference and quotation 
Whitehead recognised a possible problem with Aristotle's system of categories. Whitehead suggested substituting his category of relation for Aristotle's category of substance, giving us a different conception of being. This allowed Whitehead to postulate a conception of consciousness that avoided an infinite regress and the need for accounting for awareness as a product of our physical senses. Thus, a different approach was recognized, one that rivalled the post-Cartesian approach to understanding the world. It is Whitehead's encounter with Aristotle that allowed him to formulate a different possible solution to the problem of consciousness and one that falls squarely in the domain of panpsychism.--&gt;

==Edmund Husserl==

Husserl has been influential in postmodern philosophy. He writes in a slightly obscure style that has been adopted by many European philosophers, an example of this almost post-modern style is given below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The genuine intentional synthesis is discovered in the synthesis of several acts into one act, such that, in a unique manner of binding one meaning to another, there emerges not merely a whole, an amalgam whose parts are meanings, but rather a single meaning in which these meanings themselves are contained, but in a meaningful way. With this the problems of correlation, too, already announce themselves; and thus, in fact, this work contains the first, though of course very imperfect, beginnings of &quot;phenomenology.&quot;&quot; (Husserl 1937).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Husserl seems to be largely a Humean in the sense that he gives precedence to mental experience as the only thing that may be known directly and hence certainly. He regards the components of experience as part of consciousness, so the intention to move, the movement and the sensation of movement are bound or 'bracketed' together into a single meaning. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my perceptual field I find myself holding sway as ego through my organs and generally through everything belonging to me as an ego in my ego-acts and faculties. However, though the objects of the life-world, if they are to show their very own being, necessarily show themselves as physical bodies, this does not mean that they show themselves only in this way; and [similarly] we, though we are related through the living body to all objects which exist for us, are not related to them solely as a living body. Thus if it is a question of objects in the perceptual field, we are perceptually also in the field; and the same is true, in modification, of every intuitive field, and even of every nonintuitive one, since we are obviously capable of &quot;representing&quot; to ourselves everything which is non-intuitively before us (though we are sometimes temporally limited in this). [Being related] &quot;through the living body&quot; clearly does not mean merely [being related] &quot;as a physical body&quot;; rather, the expression refers to the kinesthetic, to functioning as an ego in this peculiar way, primarily through seeing, hearing, etc.; and of course other modes of the ego belong to this (for example, lifting, carrying, pushing, and the like).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be noted that Husserl believes we ''perform'' acts of perception and that we should refrain from judgement about where the things in perception are located or their nature. This suspension of judgement is called ''epoche'' and derives from ancient Greek skepticism.

Husserl seems to share Locke's view that experience is extended in time. He is obscure about whether he believes consciousness itself is a process that initiates action. He uses a linguistic argument to justify the idea of consciousness as a form of action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Whatever becomes accessible to us through reflection has a noteworthy universal character: that of being consciousness of something, of having something as an object of consciousness, or correlatively, to be aware of it we are speaking here of intentionality. This is the essential character of mental life in the full sense of the word, and is thus simply inseparable from it. It is, for example, inseparable from the perceiving that reflection reveals to us, that it is of this or that; just as the process of remembering is, in itself, remembering or recalling of this or that; just as thinking is thinking of this or that thought, fearing is of something, love is of something; and so on. We can also bring in here the language we use in speaking of appearing or having something appear.&quot;(Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Intentionality is a process and Husserl seems to be suggesting that consciousness is a process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. The Purely Mental in Experience of the Self and of Community. The All-Embracing Description of Intentional Processes. (Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

then, not surprisingly, fails to find any processes within it and changes his view of consciousness to that of observation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... But I &lt;must&gt; immediately add that the universality of the phenomenological epoche as practiced by the phenomenologist from the very beginning the universality in which he or she becomes the mere impartial observer of the totality of his conscious life-process brings about not only a thematic purification of the individual processes of consciousness and thereby discloses its noematic components; (Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He calls the contents of perception the perceptual ''noema''. Husserl seems to be aware of the problem of the extended present:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we account for the fact that a presently occurring experience in one's consciousness called &quot;recollection&quot; makes us conscious of a not-present event and indeed makes us aware of it as past? And how is it that in the &quot;remembered&quot; moment, that sense can be included in an evidential way with the sense: &quot;have earlier perceived&quot;? How are we to understand the fact that a perceptual, that is to say, bodily characterized present can at the same time contain a co-presence with the sense of a perceivability that goes beyond the &lt;immediate&gt; perceivedness? How are we to understand the fact that the actual perceptual present as a totality does not close out the world but rather always carries within itself the sense of an infinite plus ultra &lt;more beyond&gt;?&quot;(Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But is vague about whether mental time is a continuum or has three components of remembered past, present and some sort of intuition of the future. His rejection of the possibility of describing the mind through the spatio-temporal models of the physical sciences limits his interpretation of mental space and time.

==Gilbert Ryle 1900-1976==

Gilbert Ryle is famous for his &quot;logical behaviourism&quot;.  He was Waynflete Professor of metaphysical philosophy at Oxford and amongst his eminent students are Daniel C Dennett and David Armstrong.  Dennett wrote the Introduction to the Penguin edition of &quot;Concept of Mind&quot;.

===The Concept of Mind. First published by Hutchinson 1949. Published by Penguin Classics, Penguin Books, Chippenham, England.===

Ryle begins the Concept of Mind by proposing that there is an &quot;official doctrine&quot; of mind due to Descartes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The official doctrine, which hails chiefly from Descartes, is something like this.  With the doubtful exception of idiots and infants in arms every human being has both a body and a mind. Some would prefer to say that every human being is both a body and a mind. His body and his mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body his mind may continue to exist and function.

Human bodies are in space and are subject to the mechanical laws which govern all other bodies in space. ....

But minds are not in space, nor are their operations subject to mechanical laws.  The workings of one mind are not witnessable by other observers; its career is private.  Only I can take cognisance of the states and processes of my own mind.Chapter 1, p13.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Ryle considers that the &quot;official doctrine&quot; is absurd:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such in outline is the official theory. I shall speak of it, with deliberate abusiveness, as 'dogma of the ghost in the machine'. Chapter 1, p17.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

He considers that the &quot;official theory&quot; is due to a particular mistake that he calls a &quot;category mistake&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I must first indicate what is meant by the phrase 'Category mistake'.  This I do in a series of illustrations.
A foreigner visiting Oxford or Cambridge for the first time is shown a number of colleges, libraries, playing fields, museums,scientific departments and administrative offices. He then asks 'But where is the university? I have seen where the members of the Colleges live, where the Registrar works, where the scientists experiment and the rest. But I have not yet seen the university in which reside and work the members of your University.'  It has then to be explained to him that the University is not another collateral institution, some ulterior counterpart to the colleges, laboratories and offices which he has seen.  The university is just the way in which all that he has already seen is organized.    ....

My destructive purpose is to show that a family of radical category mistakes is the origin of the double-life theory.  The representation of a person as a ghost mysteriously ensconced in a machine derives from this argument.  Because, as is true, a person's thinking, feeling and purposive doing cannot be described solely in the idioms of physics, chemistry and physiology, therefore they must be described in counterpart idioms.  As the human body is a complex organised unit, so the human mind must be another complex organized unit, though one made of a different sort of stuff and with a different sort of structure.  Or, again, as the human body, like any other parcel of matter, is a field of causes and effects, so the mind must be another field of causes and effects, though not (Heaven be praised) mechanical causes and effects. Chapter 1, p 19-20.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Note that Ryle is still ridiculing the &quot;official theory&quot; in his description of the category mistake given above.  Ryle's style frequently makes it difficult to isolate his own proposals from the mockery of the proposals of his imagined rivals.

Ryle continues his attack on the &quot;official doctrine&quot; and considers that the ancient Greeks believed that the theorizing or intelligent part of the person was the mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...both philosophers and laymen tend to treat intellectual operations as the core of mental conduct; that is to say, they tend to define all other mental conduct-concepts in terms of concepts of cognition. They suppose that the primary exercise of minds consists in finding the answers to questions and that their other occupations are merely applications of considered truths or even regrettable distractions from their consideration. The Greek idea that immortality is reserved for the theorizing part of the soul was discredited, but not dispelled, by Christianity. Chapter 2. p27&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

He then attempts to dispel this &quot;intellectualist legend&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution of which can be more of less intelligent, less or more stupid.  But if, for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the circle.

Let us consider some salient points at which this regress would arise.  According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem.  But what makes him consider the one maxim which is appropriate rather than any of the thousands which are not? Why does the hero not find himself calling to mind a cooking recipe, or a rule of Formal Logic? Perhaps he does but then his intellectual process is silly and not sensible.  Intelligently reflecting how to act is, among other things, considering what is pertinent and disregarding what is inappropriate.  Must we then say that for the hero's reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the criteria of appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.  Chapter 2, p31.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the famous &quot;Ryle's Regress&quot;.

Ryle considers that when people use the term &quot;in the mind&quot; they actually mean &quot;in their heads&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people employ the idiom 'in the mind', they are usually expressing over-sophisticatedly what we ordinarily express by the less misleading metaphorical use of 'in the head'. Chapter 2. p 40.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryle is utterly against the concept of conscious emulation or simulation of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement 'the mind is its own place', as theorists might construe it, is not true, for the mind is not even a metaphorical 'place'.  On the contrary, the chessboard, the platform, the scholar's desk, the judge's bench, the lorry-driver's seat, the studio and the football field are among its places.  These are where people work and play stupidly or intelligently. 'Mind' is not the name of another place where work is done or games are played; and it is not the name of another tool with which work is done, or another appliance with which games are played. Chapter 2, p50.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Ryle has an implicitly endurantist idea of time in which introspection can only occur as successions of events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be admitted that only people with a special training ever speak of 'introspecting', but in such phrases as 'he caught himself wondering how to do so and so', or 'when I catch myself getting into a panic, I do such and such', the plain man is expressing at least part of what is meant by the word.

Now supposing (which it is the negative object of this book to deny), that there did exist events of the postulated ghostly status, there would still be objections to the initially plausible assumption that there also exists a species of perception capable of having any of these events for its proprietory objects.For one thing, the occurrence of such an act of inner perception would require that the observer could attend to two things at the same time. He would, for example, be both resolving to get up early and concomitantly observing his act of resolving; attending to the program of rising betimes and perpetually attending to his attending to this program. Chapter 6, p157-158.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

For Ryle things are known after the instant when they occur, he ignores any idea of the specious present:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If retrospection can give us the data we need for some states of mind, there is no reason why it should not do so for all. And this is just what seems to be suggested by the popular phrase 'to catch oneself doing so and so'.  We catch, as we pursue and overtake, what is already running away from us.  I catch myself daydreaming about a mountain walk after, perhaps very shortly after, I have begun the daydream; or I catch myself humming a particular air only when the first few notes have already been hummed.  Retrospection, prompt or delayed, is a genuine process and one which is exempt from the troubles ensuing from the assumption of multiply divided attention; .. Chapter 6, p159.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The basis for much of Ryle's philosophy in Concept of Mind is Aristotle's regress which he interprets in an endurantist fashion as meaning that there can be no internal mind.  He considers observing a robin and says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If sensations are proper objects of observation, then observing them must carry with it the having of sensations of those sensations analogous to the glimpses of the robin without which I could not be watching the robin. And this is clearly absurd.  There is nothing answering to the phrases 'a glimpse of a glimpse' or a 'whiff of a pain' or 'the sound of a tweak' or 'the tingle of a tingle', and if there ever was anything to correspond, the series would go on forever. Chapter 8, p197.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

Indeed, Ryle's philosophy is entirely the consequences of the acceptance of Aristotle's regress as an absolute constraint, it being assumed that there is no further physical theory available to explain mind or behaviour.

== Daniel Clement Dennett (1942 -) ==

[[Image:Dan_Dennett_in_Tahiti.jpg|thumb|left|Dennett (photo: Hayford Peirce)]]Dennett is well known for his &quot;Multiple Drafts Model&quot; of consciousness. The Multiple Drafts Theory or Model of Consciousness is a theory of consciousness based upon the proposal that the brain acts as an information processor. The Theory is described in depth in the book Consciousness Explained, written by Dennett in 1991. It proposes a form of strong AI.

Dennett describes his theory (CE p117) as '''operationalist''', as Dennett says: &quot;There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&quot; (Not to be confused with 'instrumentalism').

Dennett's starting point in the development of the Multiple Drafts theory is a description of the phi illusion. In this experiment two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.

An example of the phi illusion in the format described by Dennett is shown here: [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/handle.exe phi illusion] (use the 'test' option to select the simple phi demonstration).

Dennett explains the change of colour of the light in terms of either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses. In the Orwellian hypothesis the subject develops a narrative about the movement of the lights after the event. In the Stalinesque hypothesis the subject's brain would have a delay in which the movement of the green light towards the red light could be modelled after the sensory information from the red light had been received. He then says that it does not matter which hypothesis applies because: &quot;the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!&quot; 

It should be pointed out that fMRI studies by Larsen ''et al.'' 2006 have shown that the brain does indeed fill in the blanks during the phi illusion and Blankenburg ''et al.'' 2006 have shown that the brain fills in the blanks during the cutaneous rabbit illusion so Dennett's primary proposal is now known to be incorrect. The brain uses the Stalinesque paradigm - it models events during a delay.

According to the Multiple Drafts theory there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour. A wide range of behaviours may occur ranging from reactions to the event such as running away to descriptions of the experience of the event etc.

At different times after the event a person is able to relate different stories of what happened depending upon the extent to which the event has been analysed. Dennett compares this with a 'Cartesian Theatre' model of consciousness in which events suddenly appear on some sort of mental screen and then disappear as quickly. He provides numerous examples to show that events are analysed over a period of time rather than instantaneously.

Although Multiple Drafts is described as a model or theory of consciousness that differs from other models, Dennett points out that even Descartes was aware that reactions to an event could occur over a period of time with reflexes occurring first and judgements later. What makes Multiple Drafts different is that Dennett, in different sections of Consciousness Explained, either denies that normal conscious experiences actually occur or describes these as emerging in some unspecified way from the sheer complexity of information processing in the brain. His emergentism is clear when he defends the Multiple Drafts Model from Searle's Chinese room argument by saying of the critics: They just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system (CE p439).

As an example of an apparent denial of conscious experience Dennett denies that there is any internal experience of colour, instead he says that qualia in general are &quot;mechanically accomplished dispositions to react&quot;. This view originates in Dennett's belief in the method of heterophenomenology in which narrative is thought to be the most crucial tool for investigating consciousness. However, Dennett does not actually deny conscious experience but he does deny ''internal'' conscious experience (see below).

The origin of this operationalist approach can be seen in Dennett's immediately earlier work. Dennett (1988) redefines consciousness in terms of access consciousness alone, he argues that &quot;Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties&quot;. Having related all consciousness to properties he then declares that these properties are actually judgements of properties. He considers judgements of the properties of consciousness to be identical to the properties themselves. He writes:

&quot;The infallibilist line on qualia treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infal libility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F.&quot;

Having identified &quot;properties&quot; with &quot;judgement of properties&quot; he can then show that the judgements are insubstantial, hence the properties are insubstantial and hence the qualia are insubstantial or even non-existent. Dennett concludes that qualia can be rejected as non-existent:

&quot;So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors-- private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority--not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing--but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re- identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all. &quot; (Dennett 1988)

This identification of qualia with judgements rather than experience is the key to the Multiple Drafts Model, once accepted there is only a need to explain behaviour rather than personal experience itself.

The origin of this identification of qualia with judgements can be seen in ''Consciousness Explained'' p407-408. Dennett considers the experiences of someone looking at the world, and describes his idea of the relationship between conscious experience, mind and representation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It seemed to him, according to the text, as if his mind - his visual field - were filled with intricate details of gold-green buds and wiggling branches, but although this is how it seemed this was an illusion. No such &quot;plenum&quot; ever came into his mind; the plenum remained out in the world where it didn't have to be represented, but could just be. When we marvel, in those moments of heightened self-consciousness, at the glorious richness of our conscious experience, the richness we marvel at is actually the richness of the world outside, in all its ravishing detail. It does not &quot;enter&quot; our conscious minds, but is simply available&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Dennett minds have no &quot;plenum&quot;, no space with objects in it, the plenum is things outside the mind. Dennett considers mind to be processes. In his imaginary dialogue with 'Otto' in Consciousness Explained Dennett has Otto say &quot;Are you denying then that consciousness is a plenum?&quot; to which he replies &quot;Yes indeed. That's part of what I am denying. Consciousness is gappy and sparse, and doesn't contain half of what people think is there!&quot;. (CE p366). Unfortunately Dennett's assertion is difficult to understand because even half a plenum is a plenum, perhaps his remarks given above that 'conscious experience' has a plenum but 'mind' does not, explain his equivocation. This means that Dennett has moved conscious experience into the world outside the body.  Unfortunately this still leaves the problem of how this world is turned into the view that we each enjoy (there are no images in the world  other than those created by optical instruments such as the eye).  Has Dennett shifted the problem of conscious experience from a problem of brain function into a problem of the physics of the world outside the body?

[[Image:constuddennett.gif]]

Dennett makes a sharp distinction between information in the world and information in the brain. The information in the world seems to be allowed to be a plenum that can enter conscious experience but ceases to be a plenum in the mind. In contrast, according to Dennett the information in the brain is a &quot;logical space&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;So we do have a way of making sense of the idea of phenomenal space - as a logical space.  This is a space into which or in which nothing is literally projected; its properties are simply constituted by the beliefs of the (heterophenomenological) subject.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although how a &quot;logical space&quot; differs from a real space if it contains several things at an instant is not explained and how this &quot;logical space&quot; appears like phenomenal space at each instant is also not covered.

Dennett also attacks &quot;Cartesian materialism&quot; which he defines very precisely as the idea that there is a Cartesian theatre in the brain:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lets call the idea of such a centered locus in the brain ''Cartesian materialism'', since its the view you arrive at when you discard Descarte's dualism but fail to discard the imagery of a central (but material) Theater where &quot;it all comes together&quot;. The pineal gland would be one candidate for such a Cartesian Theater, but there are others that have been suggested - the anterior cingulate, the reticular formation, various places in the frontal lobes. Cartesian materialism is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of &quot;presentation&quot; in experience because what ''happens'' there is what you are conscious of.&quot;(CE p107)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems that Dennett is unaware of earlier uses of the term &quot;Cartesian materialism&quot; meaning the concept that the mind is in the brain and co-opts the term for his own use.  In Consciousness Explained Dennett assumes a model of Cartesian Materialism where some entity is looking at a theatre of events.  This is a dynamical interpretation of perception based on the idea that physical events are due to Whiteheadian materialism.  As such it is unlike the “theatre” that Aristotle envisaged in his “self aware sense” which has a view but no homunculus to view it. Indeed Dennett(1999) eschews the geometrical physicalism of the last century of physics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A curious anachronism found in many but not all of these reactionaries is that to the extent that they hold out any hope at all of solution to the problem (or problems) of consciousness, they speculate that it will come not from biology or cognitive science, but from–of all things!–physics! ....... Not just philosophers and linguists have found this an attractive idea. Many physicists have themselves jumped on the bandwagon, following the lead of Roger Penrose, whose speculations about quantum fluctuations in the microtubules of neurons have attracted considerable attention and enthusiasm in spite of a host of problems. What all these views have in common is the idea that some revolutionary principle of physics could be a rival to the idea that consciousness is going to be explained in terms of “parts which work one upon another,” as in Leibniz’s mill.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(The section of this book on Leibniz shows that he could find nothing resembling human perception in his mill). Dennett(1998) describes consciousness as distributed in time and space: &quot;Consciousness doesn't have to happen at an instant; it is much better to think of it as distributed in both space and time.&quot; but, unlike Descartes, Broad or Whitehead uses an early materialist conception of time and process to describe it.

===Two types of consciousness===

According to Block{{ref|Block1995}}, &quot;Phenomenal consciousness is experience; the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state. The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action.&quot; Block feels that it is ''possible'' to have phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness independently of each other, but in general they do interact.

There is no generally agreed upon way of categorizing different types of consciousness. Block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness tries to distinguish between conscious states that either do or do not directly involve the control of thought and action.

'''Phenomenal consciousness'''. According to Block, phenomenal consciousness results from sensory experiences such as hearing, smelling, tasting, and having pains. Block groups together as phenomenal consciousness the '''experiences''' such as sensations, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, wants and emotions. Block excludes from phenomenal consciousness anything having to do with cognition, intentionality, or with &quot;properties definable in a computer program&quot;. 

'''Access consciousness'''. Access consciousness is available for use in reasoning and for direct conscious control of action and speech. For Block, the &quot;reportability&quot; of access consciousness is of great practical importance. Also, access consciousness '''must''' be &quot;representational&quot; because only representational content can figure in reasoning. Examples of access consciousness are thoughts, beliefs, and desires.

A potential source of confusion is that some phenomenal consciousness is also representational. The key distinction to keep in mind about representational content that Block would place in the access consciousness category is that the reason it is placed in the access consciousness category is because of its representational aspect. Elements of phenomenal consciousness are assigned to the phenomenal consciousness category because of their phenomenal content.

====Reaction====
An immediate point of controversy for Block's attempt to divide consciousness into the subdivisions of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is that some people view the mind as resulting (in its entirety) from fundamentally computational processes. This computational view of mind implies that ALL of consciousness is &quot;definable in a computer program&quot;, so Block's attempt to describe some consciousness as phenomenal consciousness cannot succeed in identifying a distinct category of conscious states. This viewpoint is highly contentious however, see [[Consciousness Studies/The Neuroscience Of Consciousness#The_problem_of_machine_and_digital_consciousness|The problem of machine and digital consciousness for a discussion]]

As mentioned above, Block feels that phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness normally interact, but it is possible to have access consciousness without phenomenal consciousness. In particular, Block believes that zombies are possible and a robot could exist that is &quot;computationally identical to a person&quot; while having no phenomenal consciousness. Similarly, Block feels that you can have an animal with phenomenal consciousness but no access consciousness.

Block shares Chalmers' belief that we can have conscious experiences that are not possible to produce by any type of computational algorithm and that the source of such experiences is &quot;the hard problem&quot; of consciousness. To functionalists Block's position with respect to consciousness is analogous to that of Vitalists who defined Life as being in a category distinct from all possible physical processes. To those who support phenomenal consciousness the functionalist viewpoint is like believing in a flat earth, flat earthers see the world through biblical cosmology and functionalists view it through nineteenth century science. Biologists refute Vitalism by describing the physical processes that account for Life. Cosmologists refute biblical cosmology by describing modern physics. In order to refute Block's claim about the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness, it is up to biologists and artificial consciousness researchers to describe computational algorithms that account for consciousness. In order to refute functionalism philosophers and scientists draw attention to the fact that they are trying to explain an internal state of a conscious observer, something that cannot be explained in terms of the external behaviour of machines.

Why are some neurobiologists and computer scientists sure that Block's division of consciousness is wrong? What is the source of Block's certainty that there are non-computational forms of consciousness? One example of phenomenal consciousness discussed by Block is a loud noise that you do not consciously notice because you are paying attention to something else. Block is sure that you were aware of the noise (phenomenal consciousness) but just not &quot;consciously aware&quot; (access consciousness). Many scientists would say that in this case, you were not &quot;consciously aware&quot; of the noise, but it is almost certain that portions of your unconscious brain activity responded to the noise (you could electrically record activity in the primary auditory cortex that is clearly a response to action potentials arriving from the ears due to sound waves from the noise). This suggests that Block's controversial &quot;non-computational&quot; category of phenomenal consciousness includes brain activity that others would categorize as being unconscious, not conscious. Some unconscious brain activity can begin to contribute to consciousness when the focus of one's conscious awareness shifts. This suggests that some of what Block calls phenomenal consciousness is brain activity that can either take place outside of consciousness or as part of consciousness, depending on other things that might be going on in the brain at the same time. If so, we can ask why the consciously experienced version of this kind of brain activity is computational while the unconscious version is not. On the other hand many authors (Eddington, Broad, Penrose, McFadden, Zeh etc.) would point out that brain activity could be both computational and phenomenal.

Block stresses that he makes use of introspection to distinguish between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. Presumably this means that when the loud noise was not noticed, it was not accessed by introspection. Block has thus defined a category of consciousness that is outside of our &quot;conscious awareness&quot; (although he says we are &quot;aware&quot; of it in some other way) and not accessed by introspection. Maybe it is this inaccessibility of some cases of phenomenal consciousness that motivate Block's idea that such forms of consciousness cannot be computational. When experiences are accessible to introspection and available for inclusion in reasoning processes, we can begin to imagine computational algorithms for the generation of the content of those experience. However, it is difficult to imagine how the content could become the same as the form of our experience.

===Forms of phenomenal consciousness that are open to introspection===
In his 1995 article, Block went on to discuss the more interesting cases such as if upon starting to &quot;pay attention to&quot; the loud noise (see above) that was previously ignored, the experiencer noticed that there had been ''some'' earlier experience of the noise, just not of the type that we &quot;pay attention to&quot;; a type of experience that had been just &quot;on the edge&quot; of access consciousness.

In Ned Block's entry for &quot;Consciousness&quot; in the 2004 Oxford Companion to the Mind{{ref|Block2004}}, he discusses another example that he feels distinguishes between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness.

:&quot;Liss{{ref|Liss}} presented subjects with 4 letters in two circumstances,

:long, e.g. 40 msec, followed by a “mask” known to make stimuli hard to identify &lt;BR&gt;
:or &lt;BR&gt;
:short, e.g. 9 msec, without a mask.  

:Subjects could identify 3 of the 4 letters on average in the short case but said they were weak and fuzzy.  In the long case, they could identify only one letter, but said they could see them all and that the letters were sharper, brighter and higher in contrast.  This experiment suggests a double dissociation: the short stimuli were phenomenally poor but perceptually and conceptually OK, whereas the long stimuli were phenomenally sharp but perceptually or conceptually poor, as reflected in the low reportability.&quot;  

This experiment demonstrates a distinction between &lt;BR&gt;
:i) reportability of names of the letters &lt;BR&gt;
:and &lt;BR&gt;
:ii) perceptual sharpness of the image. &lt;BR&gt;
Block's definitions of these two types of consciousness leads us to the conclusion that a non-computational process can present us with phenomenal consciousness of the forms of the letters, while we can imagine an additional computational algorithm for extracting the names of the letters from their form (this is why computer programs can perform character recognition). The ability of a computer to perform character recognition does not imply that it has phenomenal consciousness or that it need share our ability to be consciously aware of the forms of letters that it can algorithmically match to their names.

====Reactions====
If Block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is correct, then it has important implications for attempts by [[Consciousness Studies/The Neuroscience Of Consciousness|neuroscientists]] to identify the neural correlates of consciousness and for attempts by computer scientists to produce artificial consciousness in man-made devices such as robots. In particular, Block seems to suggest that non-computational mechanisms for producing the subjective experiences of phenomenal consciousness must be found in order to account for the richness of human consciousness or for there to be a way to rationally endow man-made machines with a similarly rich scope of personal experiences of &quot;what it is like to be in conscious states&quot;. Other philosophers of consciousness such as [[wikipedia:John Searle|John Searle]] have similarly suggested that there is something fundamental about subjective experience that cannot be captured by conventional computer programs. This has led to proposals by physicists such as Penrose, Stapp, McFadden etc. for non-digital versions of machines with artificial consciousness.

Many advocates of the idea that there is a fundamentally computational basis of mind feel that the phenomenal aspects of consciousness do not lie outside of the bounds of what can be accomplished by computation{{ref|general}}. Some of the conflict over the importance of the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness centers on just what is meant by terms such as &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;program&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot;. In practical terms, how can we know if it is within the power of &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;program&quot; or &quot;algorithm&quot; to produce human-like consciousness? There is a problem of verification; can we ever really know if we have a correct biological account of the mechanistic basis of conscious experience and how can we ever know if a robot has phenomenal consciousness? Although of course, such misgivings apply both to those who believe that digital consciousness is possible and those who disagree. 

&lt;!-- why is this relevant to Block? It is discussed in great depth later

The results of the experiment of Liss (discussed above) can have several interpretations. Viewing printed letters can lead to activation of many different brain regions and brain processes. Some parts of the brain that are devoted just to visual processing make heavy contributions to our ability to form a clear mental image of the shape, form and color of letters. These brain regions allow us to become aware of visual features but we are almost totally unable to have any introspective insight into how we become aware of shape, form and color. Other parts of the brain are required for our normal ability to report the names of letters that we see. The experiment shows that by controlling the exact conditions under which experimental subjects are asked to report their experience of the letters, conditions will either favor awareness of letter form or awareness of the letter's names. Presumably, a sufficiently detailed analysis of brain activity would reveal how the variable test conditions of the experiment result in different patterns of activity in various parts of the brain and would allow for an account of the results of the experiment in terms of the details of brain function. 
--&gt;

&lt;!-- it is generally understood that inner speech and language are not consciousness - are deaf mutes and people with strokes unconscious?

Most philosophers participate in introspective efforts to understand the steps involved in their own linguistic competencies. Introspection can allow us to be aware of mental processes that seem to have a linear sequence for the production of speech or lines of reasoning. Computer science also has an established history of defining explicit algorithms by which strings of words can be placed in grammatically correct orders and various theorem generating programs now exist which seem to replicate some aspects of reasoning. Thus, introspection combined with knowledge of what computer science has and has not yet accomplished provides philosophers with certain intuitions{{ref|Block1997}} about the nature of consciousness and the nature of computation. In particular, Block along with Penrose, Zeh, Stapp, Eccles, Edelman, Weyl etc has been led to suspect that phenomenal consciousness is fundamentally outside of the range of things that can be done with programs.--&gt;

Block's justification of access and phenomenal consciousness uses a nineteenth century idea of the world so cannot be easily sustained against attack from functionalists and eliminativists. However he has clearly described a persistent division in the science and philosophy of consciousness that dates from the time of Aristotle. Aristotle considers this division in terms of those who consider that the soul originates movement and those who consider it to be cognitive, Descartes has the res cogitans and res extensa, Kant has the noumenal and phenomenal, Whitehead has the apparent and causative etc. and even Dennett has the reflex and emergent.

== Francis Crick (1916 - 2004) ==

Francis Crick (1994) The Astonishing Hypothesis. The Scientific Search for the Soul. Simon &amp; Schuster Ltd. London.

[[Image:Francis_Crick.png|left|thumb|Crick]]Crick begins this book with a statement about his opinion of the insignificance of human beings:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis is that &quot;You&quot;, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. As Lewis Carroll's Alice might have phrased it: &quot;you're nothing but a pack of neurons&quot;. This hypothesis is so alien to the ideas of most people alive today that it can truly be called astonishing.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Crick is not a philosopher so might be forgiven the derogatory &quot;no more than..&quot;, as a scientist he realises that the assembly of nerve cells that form a brain is highly complex and difficult to understand.

He suggests that the hypothesis is &quot;so surprising&quot; for three reasons:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The first is that many people are reluctant to accept what is often called the &quot;reductionist approach&quot; - that a complex system can be explained by the behaviour of its parts and their interactions with each other.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

......

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The second reason why the Astonishing Hypothesis seems so strange is the nature of consciousness. We have, for example, a vivid internal picture of the external world. It might seem a category mistake to believe this is merely another way of talking about the behavior of neurons, but we have just seen that arguments of this type are not always to be trusted.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

......

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The third reason why the Astonishing Hypothesis seems strange springs from our undeniable feeling that Free Will is free. ... I believe that if we solve the problem of awareness (or consciousness), the explanation of Free Will is likely to be easier to solve.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Crick believes that many phenomena in the brain are &quot;emergent&quot; with the vague implication that consciousness may also be emergent. He defines this term in the following way:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The scientific meaning of emergent, or at least the one I use, assumes that, while the whole may not be the simple sum of the separate parts, its behavior can, at least in principle, be understood from the nature and behavior of its parts plus the knowledge of how all these parts interact.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He wants to avoid the philosophical debates about the nature of consciousness:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. Everyone has a rough idea of what is meant by consciousness. It is better to avoid a precise definition of consciousness because of the dangers of premature definition. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Footnote: If this seems like cheating, try defining for me the word gene. So much is now known about genes that any simple definition is likely to be inadequate. How much more difficult, then, to define a biological term when rather little is known about it.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This is an odd standpoint because any brief review of the ideas of philosophers shows that a good deal is known about phenomenal consciousness. The problem lies in explaining such a bizarre experience, not in defining it.

He then elaborates a further four points covering general features of consciousness and avoiding various types of speculation about consciousness. Excluded are: &quot;what consciousness is for&quot;, speculations about consciousness in lower animals and the &quot;self-referential aspect of consciousness&quot;; included are the concept of consciousness in &quot;higher mammals&quot;.

As a guide for the scientific investigation of consciousness he puts forward three basic ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;1. Not all the operations of the brain correspond to consciousness.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;2. Consciousness involves some form of memory, probably a very short term one.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;3. Consciousness is closely associated with attention.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

The operations of the brain that do correspond to consciousness are the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot; a term that probably predates Crick's work. Crick shows the openness of ideal science when he concludes with:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis may be proved correct. Alternatively some view closer to the religious one may become more plausible. There is always a third possibility: that the facts support a new, alternative way of looking at the mind-brain problem that is significantly different from the rather crude materialistic view many neuroscientists hold today and also from the religious point of view.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

==David J Chalmers==
===Review of &quot;The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory&quot;. Oxford University Press. 1996.===

[[Image:David_Chalmers.jpg|thumb|left|Chalmers]]Chalmers is perhaps most famous for the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... I find myself absorbed in an orange sensation, and ''something is going on''. There is something that needs explaining, even after we have explained the process of discrimination: there is the ''experience''.&quot;p xii&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....&quot;This might be seen as a Great Divide in the study of consciousness. If you hold that an answer to the &quot;easy&quot; problems explains everything that needs to be explained, then you get one sort of theory; if you hold that there is a further &quot;hard&quot; problem then you get another.&quot;p xiii&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers describes mind as having &quot;phenomenal&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; aspects.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;At the root of all this lie two quite distinct concepts of mind. The first is the ''phenomenal'' concept of mind. This is the concept of mind as conscious experience, and of a mental state as a consciously experienced mental state. ... The second is the ''psychological'' concept of mind. This is the concept of mind as the causal or explanatory basis for behaviour.&quot; p11 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers proposes that consciousness can be explained by a form of &quot;Naturalistic Dualism&quot; that is supported by the following argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In particular, the failure of logical supervenience directly implies that materialism is false: there are features of the world over and above the physical features.  The basic argument for this goes as follows:
# In our world there are conscious experiences.
# There is a logically possible world physically identical to ours, in which the positive facts about consciousness in our world do not hold.
# Therefore facts about consciousness are further facts about our world, over and above the physical facts.
# So materialism is false.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers describes his naturalistic dualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The dualism implied here is instead a kind of ''property'' dualism: conscious experience involves properties of an individual that are not entailed by the physical properties of that individual.  Consciousness is a ''feature'' of the world over and above the physical features of the world.  This is not to say that it is a separate &quot;substance&quot;; the issue of what it would take to constitute a dualism of substances seems quite unclear to me. All we know is that there are properties of individuals in this world - the phenomenal properties - that are ontologically independent of physical properties.&quot; p125&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To substantiate his argument he proposes that &quot;zombie&quot; worlds, in which people would behave like us but not be conscious, are logically possible and that worlds that are physically identical to ours, but where conscious experiences are inverted, are logically possible. 

Chalmers' argument about the possibility of zombies runs as follows:

A zombie is defined as &quot;...someone or something physically identical to me (or to any other conscious being), but lacking conscious experiences altogether&quot;. Chalmers considers that silicon based devices or an entity based on the population of china could lack conscious experience although being able to perform the same functions as a person. He then makes a logical leap to suggest that these examples show that something physically identical to a conscious person could not be conscious:

&quot;But given that it is conceptually coherent that the group-mind set-up or my silicon isomorph could lack conscious experience, it follows that my zombie twin is an equally coherent possibility.&quot;p97&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the inverted spectrum argument Chalmers argues that it is logically possible to imagine a world that is physically identical to ours yet where conscious beings experience an inverted spectrum.  This assertion is defended on the basis of the elementary science of colour vision.

Unfortunately, without any definite proposal for how conscious experience is realised it seems premature to declare that the zombie and inverted spectrum arguments are correct. Chalmers approaches the problem of the realization of conscious experience when discussing &quot;information&quot;.

Chalmers is aware that phenomenal consciousness includes information that is related to information in the physical world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A conscious experience is a realization of an information state; a phenomenal judgement is explained by another realization of the same information state. And in a sense, postulating a phenomenal aspect of information is all we need to do to make sure those judgements are truly correct; there really ''is'' a qualitative aspect to this information, showing up directly in phenomenology and not just a system of judgements.&quot;p 292&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately he does not explain what a phenomenal &quot;realization of an information state&quot; means.  This leads him to consider any information state as potentially capable of conscious experience. He notes that &quot;We find information everywhere, not just in systems that we standardly take to be conscious.&quot; and asks whether a thermostat could be conscious.  He poses the question &quot;As we move along the scale from fish and slugs through simple neural networks all the way to thermostats, where should consciousness wink out?&quot;.  

He answers the objection that there may not be any ''room'' for consciousness in a thermostat by saying that &quot;If consciousness is not logically supervenient, we should not expect to have to find &quot;room&quot; for consciousness in a system's organization; consciousness is quite distinct from the processing properties of the system&quot;. He concludes the thermostat article by declaring that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;While it ''could'' be the case that experience winks in at a particular point, any specific point seems arbitrary, so a theory that avoids having to make this decision gains a certain simplicity.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This set of ideas leads to the possibility of panpsychism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If there is experience associated with thermostats, there is probably experience ''everywhere'': wherever there is a causal interaction, there is information, and wherever there is information there is experience.&quot; p297&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Chalmers states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Personally, I am much more confident of naturalistic dualism than I am of panpsychism.  The latter issue seems to be very much open. But I hope to have said enough to show that we ought to take the possibility of some sort of panpsychism seriously...&quot; p299&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then postulates that &quot;Phenomenal properties have an intrinsic nature, one that is not exhausted by their location in an information space, and it seems that a purely informational view of the world leaves no room for these intrinsic qualities.&quot;. This leads him to suggest that the world is more than just information, that we &quot;''need'' some intrinsic nature in the world, to ground information states&quot;.  This leads him to propose that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;So the suggestion is that the information spaces required by physics are themselves grounded in phenomenal and protophenomenal properties. Each instantiation of such an information space is in fact a ''phenomenal'' (or protophenomenal) realization. Every time a feature such as mass and charge is realized, there is an intrinsic property, or ''microphenomenal'' property for short. We will have a set of basic microphenomenal spaces, one for each fundamental physical property, and it is these spaces that will ground the information spaces that physics requires.&quot; p305&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Chalmers takes the proposal of panpsychism, based on the idea that all information spaces might be conscious, to &quot;ground&quot; the information space. Again, any description of how phenomenal consciousness is actually realized in an information space is missing.

Chalmers' explanation of information seems to mystify it, in physics information is arrangements of things, in maths or digital transmission it is usually arrangements of the same thing. For instance 11011 is an arrangement of ones and zeroes along a line - the information has not replaced reality it is simply a way of using reality to represent something else.  As Zurek put it: &quot;there is no information without representation&quot;. Hence it is difficult to see why microphenomena should be required to instantiate information when the information is already instantiated.

The concept of information as something that can be transmitted from place to place and also as a property of a substance is at the heart of Chalmer's analysis. He states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We have no way to peek inside a dog's brain, for instance, and observe the presence or absence of conscious experience. The status of this problem is controversial, but the mere ''prima facie'' existence of the problem is sufficient to defeat an epistemological argument, parallel to those above, for the logical supervenience of consciousness. By contrast there is not even a ''prima facie'' problem of other biologies, or other economies.  Those facts are straightforwardly publically accessible, precisely because they are fixed by the physical facts.&quot; p74&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The patterns of things that comprise &quot;biologies&quot; are, according to this,  &quot;physical facts&quot;. But from the argument about panpsychism above, physical facts are not grounded, they are information that must be instantiated in some way through &quot;microphenomenal&quot; properties. Chalmers seems to be arguing that nothing logically supervenes on the physical because nothing logically supervenes on mind and physical things are mind. 

He introduces the idea of ''organizational invariance'' as the key feature of a conscious system and declares that a set of beer cans could be conscious:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I claim that conscious experience arises from fine-grained functional organization. More specifically, I will argue for a ''principle of organizational invariance'', holding that given any system that has conscious experiences, then any system that has the same fine-grained functional organization will have qualitatively identical experiences. According to this principle, consciousness is an organizational invariant: a property that remains constant over all functional isomorphs of a given system. Whether the organization is realized in silicon chips, in the population of China, or in beer cans and ping-pong balls does not matter. As long as the functional organisation is right, conscious experience will be determined.&quot; p249&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:constudbeer.gif]]

If two systems have entirely the same fine grained '''form''' and function as each other are they not identical systems? Although Chalmer's arguments stress ''function'' is it the sleight of hand of arguing for fine grained equivalence of ''form'' that makes the argument difficult to gainsay?  Is a statement of identity an explanation?

==Thomas Nagel==

Review of: [http://web.archive.org/19990218140703/members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/Nagel_Bat.html What is it like to be a bat? The Philosophical Review LXXXIII, 4 (October 1974): 435-50].

Thomas Nagel is one of the leading defenders of the concept of phenomenal consciousness, in his article ''What it is like to be a bat'' he wrote:

&quot;..fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is to be that organism—something it is like for the organism.&quot;  

In particular Nagel points out that there are likely to be states within a bat that cannot be imagined by humans:

&quot;But bat sonar, though clearly a form of perception, is not similar in its operation to any sense that we possess, and there is no reason to suppose that it is subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine. This appears to create difficulties for the notion of what it is like to be a bat. We must consider whether any method will permit us to extrapolate to the inner life of the bat from our own case,5 and if not, what alternative methods there may be for understanding the notion.&quot; 

He considers that reductionism leaves out something essential in our understanding:

&quot;Most of the neobehaviorism of recent philosophical psychology results from the effort to substitute an objective concept of mind for the real thing, in order to have nothing left over which cannot be reduced. If we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done. The problem is unique. If mental processes are indeed physical processes, then there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo certain physical processes. What it is for such a thing to be the case remains a mystery.&quot;

{{thetop|bd=beige|cp2=10px|ha1=center|fs2=1em|cs=5px|bd2=ivory|br2=3px solid lightgrey|__TOC__|&lt;h2&gt;Indents and Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
In common with word processors, Wikitext allows the use of paragraph indents and various kinds of bullet and numbered lists.  The few examples below show how it is done.

Indents are broadly similar to the idea of ''tabs'' on a word processor, though they can be used only at the ''start'' of a line.

Numbered lists find use in formal listings such as legal documents, and in specifications and other texts where   paragraph reference numbers might be quoted. Bullets are much used in lists of hyperlinks, and in many summaries.

An introduction to HTML lists has been included, since this method alone allows the use of the alphabet and Roman numbers for list labels.
|[[image:GaramondStempel.png|border|center|240px]]}}
{{Block|ff=inherit|ta=left|background=linen|1=&lt;h2&gt;Indentation&lt;/h2&gt;
'''Indentation means increasing a paragraph's left margin'''.  In wikitext this TAB character is the ''colon''.  When a colon is added before the start of a paragraph, the ''whole paragraph'' will be moved in by one TAB stop.  To move the paragraph further, simply add more colons. Here is the text to indent three short paragraphs:

{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;:This was given ''one'' indent

::This was given ''two'' indents

:::This was given ''three'' indents&lt;/pre&gt;}}
and the result of doing so is:
{{block|background=white|ta=left|ff=inherit|
:This was given ''one'' indent

::This was given ''two'' indents

:::This was given ''three'' indents}}

Note that indents are often used in combination with other symbols such as bullets; when they used in this way the indents should be written first, ''then'' the bullets.}}
{{block|background=floralwhite|ff=inherit|ta=left|1=&lt;h2&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

The table of contents found on each page is handled automatically by the software and is not accessible using the list syntax.  This subject refers to user-made lists within the text.

Lists are useful for short comments and summaries and are easy to make.

&lt;h3&gt;Numbered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

To make an automatically numbered list of the first order, just add a hash symbol, sometimes called an ''octothorp'' or ''number sign'', before each line of the list.  It looks like this:

{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
#The First Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result is this:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
#The First Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item}}

To add a second order of numbering to the list, give the sub-items ''two'' hash symbols.  The sub-item will then indent itself beneath the level one list item that resides above it.  Additional levels of listing are made by adding more hash symbols.  Here is an example:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
#The First Item
##Sub Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
##Sub Item
###Sub-sub Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}   
The result of this wikitext coding is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
#The First Item
##Sub Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
##Sub Item
###Sub-sub Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item}}
&lt;br&gt;
}}
{{block|ff=inherit|background=lavenderblush|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Bullet Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
Bullet lists are used more often than numbered lists, perhaps because they are less formal.  The bullet lists make blue square bullets against each item in the list.  It is done by adding an ''asterisk'' before each list item.  Additional levels of listing are made by adding more asterisks.  Using the same theme as above, consider the following text:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
*The First Item
**Sub Item
*The Second Item
*The Third Item
**Sub Item
***Sub-sub Item
*The Fourth Item
*The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result of this text listing is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
*The First Item
**Sub Item
*The Second Item
*The Third Item
**Sub Item
***Sub-sub Item
*The Fourth Item
*The Fifth Item}}

Since lists are made up of paragraphs, it is a simple matter to add ''colons'' for indentation ''before'' the list code to shift each list item further across the page.  Colons need added to ''each'' list item for this effect.}}

{{block|ff=inherit|background=lemonchiffon|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Definition Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
Definition lists are usefully formatted for their purpose.  They have a bold heading, followed by a normal text section on the lines that follow.  Their name is self explanatory, for these lists are ideal for defining terms.  They can be made in both HTML and Wikitext but only the simpler wikitext version is explained here.  Note that the method needs only the ''semi-colon'' and the ''full-colon'' for its effect.  The following text entry shows how to make list items:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
;Mono-spaced fonts:A mono-spaced font is so-named because every glyph in the set has equal width...
;Proportional fonts:Proportional fonts are made with glyphs of different width...
;WikiBooks house font:The WikiBooks house font is 9 point ''Arial'' roman, a proportional font with a particularly clear style...The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result of this text listing is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
;Mono-spaced fonts:A mono-spaced font is so-named because every glyph in the set has equal width...
;Proportional fonts:These fonts are made with glyphs of different width...
;WikiBooks house font:The WikiBooks house font is 9 point ''Arial'' roman, a proportional font with a particularly clear style...The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.}}

Note that wrapped lines  are also indented.

{{block|ff=inherit|background=lightyellow|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Other Ordered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
'''Alpha and Roman lists need HTML formats.'''  These other list types are easily made in HTML, as well as the more usual numbered lists.  In addition, their starting points can be preset.

The rules for making these alternative lists are as follows:
*Ordered lists are enclosed in the tags '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.
*Each list item must start with the tag '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.
*&lt;u&gt;The list ''format''&lt;/u&gt; is set as follows in the leading '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag with the ''type'' attribute.  See the drop-box for examples.
**'''Numbering''' is set with ''type=1''; ''the number one''.
**'''Lower case alphabet''' is set with ''type=a'' 
**'''Upper case alphabet''' is set with ''type=A'' 
**'''Lower case Roman''' numbers are set with ''type=i'' 
**'''Upper case Roman''' numbers are set with ''type=I''; ''the capital letter.''

*&lt;u&gt;The start value&lt;/u&gt; is also set in the leading '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag, with the ''start'' attribute.  See the drop-box for examples.
**'''Numbered lists''' use the intended start integer as a value. If omitted, the default is always equivalent to the first character of the intended set, as decided by ''type''.
**'''Alpha lists''' use the alphabet position value; e.g. ''start=3'' for 'c'.
**'''Zero and negative start values have no meaning''' except for numbered lists.

*&lt;u&gt;Arbitrary list labels&lt;/u&gt; can be set in any '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag with the ''value'' attribute.  The label must belong to the selected ''type''.  For example, if ''type'' is for an alphabetic list, an arbitrary Roman number would be inappropriate.
**'''Values are numbers''' representing the position in the ''type'' set; ''e.g. 3 for 'c' ''.
**'''The start attribute''' should be omitted for this method; ''avoids confusion''.
**'''List items without values''' will ''follow-on'' from the previous label.

In the event that list-making adversely affects follow-on text, ensure that there is a blank line or a break tag between the two.  Examples of HTML list formats can be found in the drop-box below.

Consider the following example.  The sample code uses ''type=a'' to choose lower case alpha listing and the entry ''start=2'' sets the starting point as the second letter of the alphabet; the letter ''b''.
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; These listing labels use lower case alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; This list starts with the ''second'' letter of the alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; Change ''type'' and ''start'' value for different formats.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
When the code runs it looks like this:
{{block|background=white|ta=left|ff=inherit|1=&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; These listing labels use lower case alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; This list starts with the ''second'' letter of the alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; Change ''type'' and ''start'' value for different formats.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Proper reversed lists will become a part of HTML5.  See [http://blog.whatwg.org/reverse-ordered-lists  '''Reversed Lists'''].
}}

The various listing options are easily changed, and an alternative method for simple numbering of lines can be found in [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#Numbered_Prose|'''Numbered Prose''']].  Although ''bullet'' lists can be made in HTML by setting the list items in '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags instead of '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags, the rendering is likely to afford only the default bullet type instead of the three types that are theoretically possible.

==Introduction==
Pictures, or images, are common on wiki pages.   You can add them to your pages, and this series is intended to explain how it is done.

Image layouts are numerous.   Most images in Wiki are positioned at the left or right margins and the text is allowed to wrap around them.   Others are positioned in a line across the page.   Some are intended for the top of a page, along with a table of contents.   Galleries can contain many images, and in a wide range of formats, and drop controls can contain any or all of these.

Whether the writer is new to image placement or experienced in their use, he will find something in these pages that is useful.   Select from the links below, according to your area of interest.    

*'''To position images in a basic way''' then read '''[[/The Quick Course/]]'''.

*'''To provide a lineup of tiled images across the page''' or to overlap them, then be sure to read '''[[/Tiled Images/]]'''.

*'''For more complex image placement''' read '''[[/Images in Containers/]]'''.   This page deals with image placement in tables, galleries, and drop controls, and touches on the best use of top-section white space.

Writers within a wiki are encouraged to make use of templates in their work, and several useful templates are mentioned throughout the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are typically four different types of poker player:

* Loose-Passive
* Loose-Aggressive
* Tight-Passive
* Tight-Aggressive

'''Loose''' means that a player's requirements to put money into the pot are lower than average.  For example, a loose player may like to play hands like K3s (suited) preflop in Holdem, and could be seeing anything from 30 to 100% of flops in that game type.

'''Tight''' is the opposite.  A tight player plays fewer hands per hour than his opponents average.    This can result in only seeing anywhere from 10% to 25% of flops in Holdem.

'''Passive''' players are those that rarely bet.  They are happy to call and fold, but they are not often seen making raises of their own.

'''Aggressive''' players on the other hand, are those that raise and reraise significantly more than the average.  They may be perfectly willing to reraise you whilst on a flush draw, or whilst holding second pair.

Obviously the degrees of aggressiveness or tightness vary from player to player, but the vast majority will fit quite neatly into these classifications.  Coupled with issues like how weak or strong a player your opponent is, you will have a powerful tool to help you decide what your opponent is holding in each situation.  Classifying other players is also an extremely important aspect when considering your strategy for a specific table, tournament or hand.

==In-Depth Strategies==

There are many different types of poker players. The two broadest categories are those of successful and unsuccessful players. A player who is successful does not just look at what is in his hand and on the board. Players who are unable to read other players or do not make it a point to watch even when they are not in a hand are often unsuccessful as Poker players. Under the category of successful players, a successful player is able to group someone into one of many different categories. The first category is:

'''Aggressive:'''   Aggressive players will play almost any starting hand. The cards in their hand may be 2 7 of hearts and clubs and they will play it. They are the players who will contribute to some of your biggest wins and biggest losses because they are very hard to bluff out of a hand. If you are at a rock garden (table where everyone appears afraid of what others have) and one player is betting big every hand or every other hand and winning about every hand it is suggestible that if you have mid-pair you call their bluff at least once, to gain an accurate characterization of their betting patterns and because it is likely you have them beat. If someone is betting it up every hand and constantly winning and mucking it is suggestible to &quot;look them up&quot; if you think you might have it. These are the players that you don't want to try to bluff, because as bluffers themselves they will often turn the tables on you or look you up.

'''Passive Aggressive''':    Passive-Aggressive players are often the most experienced of all players, are able to get a good read on who is a rock and who is aggressive and will not throw their chips away. Passive Aggressive players often call the blind to the flop if their hand seems decent enough (middle cards or high) and will do their fair share of bluffing, but not as much as a player who is purely aggressive. These are the players who will go after you hard and smash into the aggressive players when they get a hand. Often times Passive-Aggressive players will be the big-stack at the table because they rarely call large bets into hands they don't have a good chance of winning and rarely make mistakes. The worst enemy of a Passive-Aggressive player is a &quot;River Rat&quot;.

'''River Rat''': A River-Rat is often considered the worst poker player at the table. A river rat will usually bet before the flop if they have good cards and upon seeing a flop they don't like they will call ANY bet you throw at them just hoping desperately for that miracle at the end of the river. It is a common misconception among weak poker players that you will have a tougher time making money off of these types of players, when in fact quite the contrary is true.  Profit in poker comes when your opponents make mistakes, and '''River Rats''' are constantly calling bets when they do not have the odds in their favor. 

'''Rocks''': A rock is an extraordinarily tight, patient and reserved player at the table. When they do not get a premium hand pre-flop they won't even call the blinds. When you are involved in a hand with these characters you can almost tell immediately that they have either got two high cards, an ace and a high or middle card, or a pocket pair 8 or higher. These guys rarely play hands but when they do they will bet big. Their worst enemy is an aggressive player who might scare them out of a hand. While they will normally go far they won't go as far as most passive-aggressive players or very good aggressive players. River Rats give them a very large chunk of their change because they don't realize that when a rock is betting they have little chance of winning. The worst enemy of these players is themselves. They lose a lot of money to blinds for hands that they don't play.

'''Passive-Rocks''':  Passive Rocks are the guys who will bet very very rarely. These guys will get a premium hand and will call bets with it, with an almost certain chance to win the hand will only call and will not bet. Passive Rocks are the most dangerous when they are involved in a hand with an aggressive player or a player who misreads them. Thinking that they are &quot;chasing&quot; cards because they are calling rather than betting, someone may bet an all-in on them and they will call, putting a bad hurt on whoever it is that raises them all in. Passive-Rocks generally do worse than pure rocks.

'''Slow-Players''': These are some of the craftiest players. Slow-Players have unlimited restraint on betting on a good hand in order to allow somebody to think they have the best hand. These guys know how to read others and know exactly how to look and bet like they have a bad hand or are chasing. Slow-Players are good at drawing as much money out of a hand as they can, especially when involved with aggressive players. These guys are the worst enemy of any aggressive player because of the toughness of getting a read on them. A slow-player may catch three of a kind aces on the flop and check, just to draw another player into betting so that they can either A.) Raise them, B.) continue their play, acting as if they have a weak hand and meekly calling or C.) if they have plenty of chips and want to mislead other players as to how they play they will fold this hand and show the table then saying something like &quot;I KNOW you have the straight&quot; simply to make other players think that they are rocks or easy to get out of a hand and therefore making it easier for them to bluff.

'''The Perfect Player''' This guy can read you by your actions, he knows exactly what kind of hands you play by observing you when he is and is not in hands with you and other players and he knows how you chat or how you bet, etc. when you have a hand, including whether you are notorious for slow-playing or not. This guy will not give any money to rocks because he knows if they are in a hand they almost certainly have an advantage over his hand and know when an aggressive player is bluffing and when he truly has a hand. He has elements of a slow-player, playing certain hands to draw money from someone who he knows will fold to a bet, has elements of a passive-aggressive player, betting big when its all river rats and aggressive players sitting around him, and a rock in the sense that he doesn't play bad hands in bad positions or with a &quot;family table&quot; meaning close to everyone at the table is in the hand. This guy has elements of every class in him. These are the players you should fear. It is hard to predict the betting pattern of these guys because it is modified depending on who they are in a hand with. The best way to learn how they play is to watch every single hand they are in and see how they act for each and every person, including yourself, because it will be modified when he is playing against you. You may even want to call some of his small bets just to learn what type of hand he will bet certain ways against you with so that he does not have a chance to muck his hand and leave you in the dark about him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bluffing is a seriously overrated concept in poker.  Yes, it is important, and yes every good player is a good bluffer.  But it is not the be-all and end-all of the game.  Certain types of players will make frequent bluffs - perhaps every 4 or 5 hands they play.  This is a high variance way of playing, and only the truly great players are significant winners in this manner.  

The mathematics of bluffing dictate this.  For example, let's say that the pot is currently $10.  I have nothing at all, and you have a moderate hand, a top pair ace kicker.  I bet $5 as a total bluff.  Whether this is profitable or not depends on the chance that you will fold.

I am betting $5 to win $10.  I must therefore succeed one time from three to make this a positive expectation move (see [[../Expected_value|expected value]]).  If you fold 30% of the time, it is a losing move from me.  If I bet $10 into the $10 pot, you must fold 50% of the time - folding 45% of the time loses me money in the long run.

== Optimal bluffing frequency ==
The reason for bluffing can be explained using a branch of mathematics called ''game theory'', which also gives an insight into the optimal frequency for bluffing (though it's usually only possible to work out the math in simplified situations).

Suppose you are playing 5-card draw poker against a single opponent. There is $10 in the pot from antes, and after the draw you have the opportunity to bet another $10 (no raises or other bet sizes are possible, to keep this simple). Your opponent gets:

[[Image:Poker-sm-21A-5s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-229-6h.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-238-7d.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-217-8s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-246-9c.png|80px|border]]

for a made straight, while your hand is:

[[Image:Poker-sm-214-Js.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-224-Jh.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-22C-3h.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-24C-3c.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-242-Kc.png|80px|border]]

Your opponent stands pat, so you know he has at least a flush or straight to beat your two pair. You have four cards in the deck that can help you, so you are roughly a 11 to 1 shot to improve to a full house and beat your opponent's straight. Ignoring the possibility of your opponent betting or either of you raising, you have two options: bet only if you make your hand, or bet whether you make your hand or not. Your opponent also has two choices: call or check and fold. The expected payoffs are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
! You bluff !! You don't bluff
|-
! Opponent calls 
| &lt;math&gt;20 \times {1 \over 12} - 10 \times {11 \over 12} \approx -$7.50&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;20 \times {1 \over 12} \approx $1.67&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Opponent checks or folds
| &lt;math&gt;$10&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;10 \times {1 \over 12} \approx $0.83&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If you bluff and your opponent calls, you will win $20 some of the time but lose $10 the majority of the time, so you end up with a negative expectation (the wost outcome here). If you bluff and your opponent folds you win $10 every time, giving you the best outcome here. Not bluffing gives a much lower expectation, but on the other hand it can't be negative, since you'll never put money into the pot with a hand that risks losing.

The trouble is, if we assume that your opponent is smart and knows the way you play, he can always choose the option that makes your expectation the worst: if you bluff he'll call you, but if you don't bluff he'll check or fold. If you assume that your opponent reads you correctly, then the best you can expect to make from this is 83 cents. Other than playing stupider opponents, there's no way around this.

But hold on: you can actually do better than this, if you notice that you have more than just the two options mentioned above (always bluff or never bluff). Suppose you bluff with probability &lt;math&gt;1 \over 20&lt;/math&gt;. If your opponent always folds to a bet, then you make more than if you hadn't bluffed:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Expected gain} = 10 \times {1 \over 12} + 10 \times {1 \over 20} \times {11 \over 12} \approx $1.29
&lt;/math&gt;

If your opponent calls all your bets, then you still do better:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Expected gain} = 20 \times {1 \over 12} - 10 \times {1 \over 20} \times {11 \over 12} \approx $1.21
&lt;/math&gt;

Your opponent will choose to call rather than fold to your bets, since this minimizes your gain (and his loss), but notice that this is a much better outcome than the 83 cents you would average if you never bluffed. To optimize your expectation, you want to choose your bluffing probability so that your opponent's loss is the same whichever of the two options he chooses. It doesn't matter how well your opponent knows you or how well he has read your hand, he can't worsen your expected gain by his choice of action.

== The semi-bluff ==
''Semi-bluffing'' is a less well understood but vital concept.  A semi-bluff is when you bet a draw to the hand that will win the pot, but you do not have anything yet.  For example, suppose you are playing hold 'em with:

[[Image:Poker-sm-235-Td.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-236-9d.png|80px|border]]

The turn comes:

[[Image:Poker-sm-23A-5d.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-241-Ac.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-219-6s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-232-Kd.png|80px|border]]

You are very unlikely to have the best hand as it stands. You have four cards to a flush, with around a 20% chance to hit your flush on the next card. If the pot is very small (say against a single opponent) you may not be getting sufficient odds to make a call profitable. However, if you judge that the other player has a 20% chance of believing you have a pair of aces to his pair of kings and folding, the combined expected gain of either making your opponent fold, or making your hand if he doesn't, may make the bet profitable.

To simplify the math, we will assume that if you hit your flush you will win the pot without any further betting, and if you miss your flush but your opponent stays in you will check and fold on the river. We will also simplify the probability of hitting your flush to &lt;math&gt;1 \over 5&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that your opponent will not raise your bet.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{expected gain} &amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times P(\text{opponent folds}) \\ 
&amp; \qquad + (\text{size of pot}) \times P(\text{opponent calls and you make your flush})  \\
&amp; \qquad - (\text{size of bet}) \times P(\text{opponent calls and you miss your flush}) \\
&amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times \left [ P(\text{opponent folds}) + P(\text{opponent calls}) \times {1 \over 5} \right ] \\
&amp; \qquad - (\text{size of bet}) \times P(\text{opponent calls}) \times {4 \over 5} \\
&amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times \left [ p + (1 - p) \times {1 \over 5} \right ] - (\text{size of bet}) \times (1 - p) \times {4 \over 5} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that your opponent folds given the hand and community cards he's faced with, then &lt;math&gt;(1 - p)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that he will call, since we've assumed he will not raise. Observe that the value of this is dependent on the value of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which you obviously don't know since you can't see your opponent's hand. However, if you estimate that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is high enough, then the value above will become positive and the semi-bluff will become a profitable play.

For another example, I am again betting $5 into a $10 pot.  You again have top pair with an ace kicker, and I have the nuts (best) flush draw.  Here however, I do not need you to fold 33% of the time.  Even assuming you fold should I hit my flush (rather than pay me more money - implied odds), I now only need you to fold around 25% of the time for my move to be +ve, and thus profitable in the long run.

Bluffing most often now happens in two distinct ways — the BIG bluff, and the small bluff. A continuation bet where you have missed the flop completely is a small bluff. 

Aggressive players will semi bluff a lot more than they make straight out bluffs.  The fact that once you hit you may still get more money from your opponent is a large part of this, and makes the semi bluff a powerful move in any player's arsenal.

Futur Proche in French

== Usage of Near Future ==

This tense is used to speak about something happening in the very near future, as an alternative to either the future anterior (le futur antérieur) or the simple future (le futur simple).

== Formation of the Near Future ==

This tense uses a combination of the verb to go (aller) in its present indicative form appropriate to the subject followed by the infinitive of the verb that will be done.

* Je vais faire du shopping.   I will go shopping, I am going shopping. (I '''am going to do''' the shopping.)

* Nous allons jouer au foot.   We will play football.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Requirement 1 ==
'''First-Aid Preparedness'''

The information covered by the Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class Scout first-aid requirements can help you deal with injuries or illnesses that may arise while you are camping.  The current edition of the ''Boy Scout Handbook'' includes descriptions of the symptoms and treatment of hypothermia, heatstroke heat exhaustion, frostbite, dehydration, sunburn insect stings, tick bites, snakebite, and blisters.  Review those pages to refresh your awareness and ability to help prevent these situations from occurring.  Know the symptoms and be ready to make an appropriate response if you encounter them in a fellow hiker or someone else you meet along the way.


'''Altitude Sickness'''

Camping may take you to high places where ''altitude sickness'' (also known as ''AMS'', or ''Acute Mountain Sickness'') can be a concern.  Fortunately, altitude sickness is seldom a problem for people at elevations of less than 8,000 feet above sea level.

Going to a place that is higher than you are accustomed may leave you short of breath because the atmosphere around you becomes thinner and contains less oxygen.  Within a few days, your body will ''acclimate'' to higher altitudes by producing extra red blood cells to carry more oxygen to your tissues and organs, and you should feel fine.

Taking steps to help prevent altitude sickness is far better than suffering from it during a hike.  The following suggestions can make your &quot;high&quot; adventure more comfortable and more fun, too.


-'''Drink plenty of fluids.''' As a rule, take in enough water so that your urine remains clear rather than dark yellow.

-'''Ascend gradually.''' Permit your body to acclimate gradually as you go higher.  Spend a few days at 5,000 to 7,000 feet and then a few more at 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

-'''&quot;Climb high, sleep low.&quot;''' Use this standard practice of mountaineers.  While adjusting to thinner air, after hiking upward during the day, decend to a lower camp for a good night's rest.

- '''It is also more difficult to boil the higher you go'''  so if you don't need to go up higher , cook low it saves gas. 


'''WARNING SIGNS'''

Watch for any of all of these symptoms of altitude sickness:

- Headache

- Nausea

- Unusual tiredness

- Loss of motivation


These symptoms can also be warning signs of ''hypothermia,'' a far more common first-aid emergency among hikers.  Begin treatment for hypothermia by making sure that the person is warm, is wearing dry clothing, is sheltered from the wind and chilly or wet weather, and has had enough to eat and drink.  If the person does not rapidly improve and the elevation is above 8,000 feet, treat for altitude sickness as well.


'''TREATMENT FOR ALTITUDE SICKNESS'''

''Descend, descend, descend!'' Going down a few thousand feet in elevation will almost always relieve the symptoms of altitude sickness. Rest, fluids, and food may also help.  If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical assistance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:cursive; font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold; text-align:center&quot;&gt;A critique of Wikibooks&lt;/p&gt;

This is a document I am building up during the time I spend on Wikibooks. It mostly consists of a collection of current problems with the Wikibooks system, some solutions to these problems, and some provisional policies to help implement these solutions. Many of the problems and solutions listed here are ones which I have read from other users on the hundreds of talk pages on Wikibooks, and some are ones I have personally discovered. I have not distinguished between the two, since they are still problems for everyone, regardless of who identified them.

This will almost certainly remain a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future, and consequently may be internally inconsistent. I don't mind if other users make minor edits to correct obvious typos, but more substantial changes and other comments are more welcome on the [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|talk page]].

== Abstract ==

Wiki is an ephemeral community in the sense that many of its users don't remain active for very long. There are a hardcore of long-term residents, but they are comparatively few in numbers. Basically, at any one time, there is an active community, but the members of it change quickly over time. Any procedures must bear this in mind, especially in the sense that it can take a long time to get any meaningful feedback from another user, so some users are being held back by the occasional desolation of pages such as [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. Consequently, I think standards need to be more pro-active, rather than discussional (i.e. the procedure would favour the writers own passion for the subject).

Many of the pages here remind me of the hilarious scene from [[w:Life of Brian|Life of Brian]], where the inactive 'activists' known as the ''People's Front of Judea'' suddenly learn that one of their number is to be crucified, and are informed to come quickly to help, by which their leader passionately declares, &quot;This calls for immediate discussion!&quot;. We need to define certain common issues which occur (e.g. VfD), and come up with better criteria, to minimize the amount of discussion required. All the time wasted on discussion is perhaps time that could have been spent writing good educational content. I think it's mostly due to users being too scared to [[m:be bold|be bold]].

== The goal of Wikibooks ==

First of all, I should define the goal of Wikibooks. The first definition I can find is the first meaningful revision of the [[Main page]] made on 10th July 2003. It states:

* The '''Wikimedia Free Textbook Project''' intends to cooperatively write textbooks of various fields and topics.

The same page currently (almost exactly two years later) states:

* Welcome to '''[[Wikibooks:About|Wikibooks]]''', a collection of [[Why use open textbooks?|open-content]] textbooks that [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|'''anyone&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;edit''']].

Pretty much the same meaning, so that much seems clear. Moving on to [[Wikibooks:About]], we are told:

* '''Wikibooks''' is a collection of [[w:Free content|free]] [[w:textbook|textbook]]s with supporting book-based texts, that is being written collaboratively on this website.

Note that the word 'textbooks' is linked to the Wikipedia entry for that word, so we can only assume that this entry is an adequate definition for the types of content permitted on this site. The Wikipedia page appears to begin with a brief dictionary-length definition:

* '''Textbooks''' are defined as &quot;''a manual of instruction, a standard book in any branch of study''&quot;. They are further defined by both the age of the person who is to study the text and the classification of the subject matter itself. Textbooks are published by speciality printers to serve every request for an understanding of every subject that can be taught. It is a big business that requires mass volume sales to make the publications profitable. Although most textbooks are only published in printed format with hard covers, some can now be viewed online.

To be fair, the NPOV policy means it's fair to look at other dictionary definitions:

* A book used in schools or colleges for the formal study of a subject.
* A volume, as of some classical author, on which a teacher lectures or comments; hence, any manual of instruction; a schoolbook.

There seems to be a common connection with the academic establishments, so it would seem that anything commonly used there ought to be appropriate. e.g.:

* Generalized books about a traditional academic discipline, such as:
** Languages (English, French, etc.)
** Mathematics
** Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)
** etc.
* More specific books, but still commonly used by students:
** Dictionaries/encyclopedias specific to a single discipline (e.g. a dictionary of medical terms).
** In-depth guides, often crossing into multiple disciplines (e.g. electronics is also generally covered in physics and computer science courses)
** Biographies of famous people in a particular discipline (e.g. Shakespeare), perhaps with annotated texts. These are commonly used in disciplines such as history, and literature, but generalized to include any famous person in a particular discipline.

More generally, the following types of content seem to be allowed:

* Guides to computer games (lots of these, not traditionally used in any academic subjects)
* Recipe book (arguably a 'textbook' in a 'home economics' or 'cooking' course)

I consider these to be perfectly valid. Perhaps 'students' should be extended with 'enthusiasts'. Who else is going to be reading these books? My own opinion is that any book you'd find in the 'non-fiction' section of a library (i.e. those which have a dewey decimal classification) ought to be allowed.

These are commonly denied:

* 'Fiction' - Basically, any book you'd expect to find in the 'fiction' section of your local library, as opposed to the 'non-fiction' section. There is currently no official Wikimedia wiki for this sort of content.

Thinking about it, since Wikibooks is currently host to Wikiversity and Wikijunior projects, then anything in that scope ought to be okay, providing it is clearly marked as such. It's possible Wikijunior may allow educational fiction? Are these books allowed?

* [[An_Unexpected_Visitor]] - Not listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]
* [[Ardvark_the_Aardvark]] - Listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]

These are always denied, because they belong on a sister project:

* Ephemeral (news) articles. These belong on Wikinews.
* A book of quotations. These belong on Wikiquote
* A book about the taxonomic classification of species. This belongs on Wikispecies.
* A generalized encyclopedia. This belongs on Wikipedia.
* A generalized dictionary. This belongs on Wiktionary.
* Previously published works by another author, with no intention of annotating the text. These belong on Wikisource.

== Common problems ==

The idea is to gradually convert this section into some simple procedures which serve to eliminate them.

=== Unreliable administrative system ===

'''Note''': This section should not be interpreted as a perjorative statement about actual Wikibooks administrators, but rather a statement about the 'system' in which they act. The actual administrators tend to do their jobs well, but there just aren't enough of them. See also [[#Badly defined scope for acceptable content|Badly defined scope for acceptable content]] and [[#NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)|NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)]].

There has always been an issue that some users will create non-NPOV material or other meaningless nonsense in the main namespace. Due to the current open nature of the Wikibooks project, there is no way to prevent this. Only an administrator can delete these pages, and in order for them to do so without getting into trouble, the pages must go through a voting process (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]), with the exception of obvious [[Wikibooks:Glossary#vandalism|vandalism]] and [[Wikibooks:Glossary#newbie experiment|newbie experiments]]. Consequently, the administrative system only really works where there are a sufficient number of users participating in these votes, and enough active administrators to get things sorted out in a reasonable amount of time.

Until this is sorted out, it's most practical to pretend there are no administrators, and to find solutions which any user is capable of implementing. There are murmurings on Meta to address this too. Looking at the latest beta of MediaWiki, if seems as if a new voting system is being worked on as well, although this may be for a different purpose.

Also, there has always been the general feeling that a user's pages (e.g. [[User:Aya]] and [[User talk:Aya]]), and any subpages thereof do not have to be NPOV, and that the user may maintain a strict editorial control of those pages. For example if I were to add the comment &quot;Some users believe this user to be a complete ass&quot; to a user's personal page, it couldn't really be argued to be non-NPOV, but changes of this nature are generally reverted.

; Solutions

The obvious solution would be to allow this non-NPOV material providing it's housed in the originating user's own pages, and in fact many users already do this, to start work on a community project, before it is ready to be transferred to the main namespace, and continued by the community.

This is the paradigm I have tried to propagate, and in the process, I have separated these projects on the [[Main page]] into &quot;Community Projects&quot; and &quot;Personal Projects&quot;. As to whether or not these personal pages deserve to be linked from the main page is another issue, but if they are ultimately intended to become community projects, I don't see this as a problem, since it helps the material to become more NPOV, by allowing other users to comment on it.

=== Newbies ===

Newbies experimenting with the system, unaware of the damage they are causing.

; Solutions

The current [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] solution really only allows them to experiment with editing a single page. This is by no means the entire scope of the wiki-experience. They may still accidentally create loads of pages that just need to be cleaned up later. Perhaps they want to experiment with the &quot;move page&quot; feature on an important page. Perhaps they've been directed here from another site, and have no idea what it's all about. Get them off the site, and onto a safe sandbox site ASAP. Arguably there should be a link in the 'navigation' panel just for newbies. Try to direct them to another Wiki system to play around in like a beta version. In fact, they are the ideal candidates to thoroughly test the error-cases for the MediaWiki software, so getting them to help beta-test the next version would be a bonus.

* Suggested sandbox wiki: http://test.leuksman.com/index.php/Main_Page
* Controlled by [[m:User:Brion VIBBER]] (allegedly)

If that site can be guaranteed to remain up 24/7, that's exactly what we need. If we can get the DNS name sandbox.wikimedia.org to point to the same IP address, and co-ordinate with the developers to ensure that this site always contains the latest bleeding-edge release of MediaWiki, we can get some free beta-testers, while minimizing site damage. We also need to make sure all WikiMedia sites include this link. This could prove more difficult, since there are hundreds of them.

=== Vandals ===

Vandals, intent on deliberately sabotaging the site.

; Solutions

User blocks and IP blocks help, but we could never stop a determined vandal without seriously compromising the ease of use of the site for the genuine contributor. The only real solution seems to be for other users to keep their eyes open, and regularly check out the 'Recent changes' list. Perhaps a formalisation of this process would help.

=== Unnoticed vandalism / newbie experiments === 

If a page is not obviously covered with nonsense, but content has been removed, or changed to be incorrect, no one may spot it, and the offending changes will not be reverted. A future editor may not spot it either, and make their additions. The more edits which then subsequently occur, the more awkward it will be to reverse the damage.

This can be quite irritating. You can't just revert back to the version prior to the damage, since you would be accused of vandalising the page yourself by removing the content of subsequent edits.

; Solutions

Two possibilities come to mind, one changing software, the other wetware (i.e. the brain):

* We could implement a system allowing you to reverse-apply the context-diffs from the offending edit or range of edits, with a single click, where possible, in the same way that CVS automatically merges in changes made by other users, while you are editing a document (this would also be neat). The offending edits will remain in the history, but a new revision will be added which appears as if you removed the offending edits by hand. This will not be possible in all cases, but would work with many common offenses such as linkspamming and blanking of sections.

* We could make the user more responsible for the complete document they submit, rather than just the edits they've made. So, if you want to edit a page, you must first revert any vandalism before you add anything new. If you don't, you'll be considered a vandal yourself, and might get your account/IP blocked. Do people feel this is too harsh?

=== Policy visibility ===

A potential author, wanting to 'play by the rules', but can't/won't look to see what the rules are.

; Solutions

The rules/standards/policies/whatever pages need to be much more visible. Not currently sure as to the best implementation for this. The page [[Help:Editing]] is quite visible, since it's linked to from every edit page. Perhaps this should contain a warning that the user should check out the site policies before continuing, if they wish to avoid the possibility that their edits will be reverted or deleted by another user. 

=== Badly defined scope for acceptable content ===

e.g. 'no original research' from [[WB:WIN]].

Obviously a user would be wasting their time, as well as the admin's time, to add something which is only going to be subsequently deleted.

; Solutions

Can people please forget about the phrase 'no original research', and mentally revert it to the original 'no primary research' (less vague), or even something even less vague. See also: [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Be bold]]. I'll wait to see if [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] wants to sort it out before I change anything.

'Primary research' refers to the sorts of theses published by graduate students to propose a genuinely new theory. It would be used, perhaps, to refer to, say, ''Newton's Laws of Universal Gravitation'', at any point prior to it being commonly accepted in Physics. These theses often involve coining new words and word-phrases which are not commonly used elsewhere, in order to refer to the new concepts they describe. There's nothing wrong with this, per se, but if everyone did it, then the language use could easily become too confusing to be of any practical benefit. (q.v. [[Neo]]). This is the primary reason that these things should not be allowed. Surely, devising a strategy for a mission in, say, GTA:SA, is 'original research' and 'primary research' in the sense that you have devised it yourself. The important distinction is that it is done using commonplace terms (within its own scope), and is focused on a very popular computer game (the bestselling of all time IIRC), rather that some wacky new theory that someone like Eddie Izzard might come up with, say, that bees are actually made of jam.

Personally I don't have a problem with this stuff either, and arguably it has sneaked in to a lot of other documents already. In fact, I'd go as far to say that I interpret almost everything I read as 'primary research', unless it clearly fits in with 'common sense', which I will define as the sorts of things commonly taught in schools. So [[Physics]] is almost certainly not 'primary research', whereas the mission walkthroughs section of [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] almost certainly is.

Maybe the policy should be phrased &quot;this site should only contain factual infomation&quot;, with the standard dictionary definition of 'factual', then allow memetic evolution to allow the users to decide what that actually is. Arguably this appears to be the common goal of all Wikimedia projects. The policy would allow any user to correct/revert/delete anything which has been agreed to not be 'factual'. I've tried to avoid using the term 'fictional', since this has different connotations than simply being the antithesis of 'factual'.

=== NPOV (Neutral Point Of View) ===

See: [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]
See also the much more comprehensive [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]].

Would it be sufficient to link the former to the latter?

Arguably, just a special case of the previous problem. Based on some lengthy discussions from other users in the past, and my own interpretation, I think this requires a better definition.

; What is a 'neutral point of view' anyway?

To think from a neutral point of view, to me, almost requires you to imagine you are an alien visitor from another planet, trying to make an objective analysis of the human race, and their beliefs and customs.

; Bias

Take the more biased point of view:

* Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

If you see that in a Wikibooks module, and do not agree, just remember you should really interpret that as:

* The user who wrote this believes that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

So you could replace it with:

* At least one person believes that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

But since it's likely that any opinion is shared between at least a few people, you could also word it with the more vague:

* Some people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

If you're vaguely aware of the statistics, you could even replace it with one of:

* Most people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.
* Most people don't believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

And if you happen to know the exact statistic (I just made this statistic up):

* 63% of people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Note that now, you are primarily talking about people, not an operating system.

; True by definition

What about this:

* A human being is a mammal.

Again, you could apply the same logic as the previous example, but it would seem a bit ridiculous to do so. You'd probably end up with:

* More than 99% of people believe that a human being is a mammal.

The difference here is that this statement is 'true by definition'. That is that the word-phrase 'human being' is defined in most dictionaries to include it within the bounds for the definition of the word 'mammal', at least as long as the species retains its mamma. This is not the case for the MS Windows example, at least not in any dictionaries I've ever read.

; Ambiguous statements

Back to the MS Windows example:

* Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

In addition to bias, it also suffers from ambiguity. How is the word 'best' defined within this context? To keep it vaguely factual, I'd probably intepret that as:

* Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system.

That is to say used by the most people. This is a common definition of 'best' within a similar context, but others might interpret it as:

* Microsoft Windows is the most stable and user-friendly operating system.

At which point it becomes slightly more contentious. Probably best to avoid the word 'best' anyway. :-)

; But, 'I believe'

What if the user had instead written:

* I believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Well. It's hardly a neutral point of view, but arguably, shouldn't be deleted, but (as before) replaced with:

* Some people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Thus making it neutral.

=== Indecisive deletion policy ===

It's actually a good idea to bring suspect pages into 'Staff lounge', rather than just adding them to VfD. If something is contentious enough to warrant a VfD, then perhaps it needs to be discussed first to ensure everyone interprets it in the same way. Consequently many VfD's end up forever in voting while the users try to see if they are 'on the same wavelength'.

=== [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] ===

It's akin to a talk page, but it has far too broad a scope for what is acceptable there. Consequently, the page invariably becomes massive, there are no standards for when the archive the page, and it ends up being too overwhelming for new users.

; Solutions

A set of pages in the same vein, only more akin to the popular web-forum convention of subdividing different topics into different pages. Provisional subdivisions (incomplete):

* General forum - A place for all questions which don't neatly fit into any other category. Questions could be moved at a later date, but this may be offputting to 
* Wiki markup forum - For questions relating to wiki markup, and the correct use of HTML on a wiki.
* Votes for deletion - This is in effect a talk pages already. Adding it to a list of these forum-like talk pages could only serve to make it more visible.
* Votes for undeletion - Ditto

=== Stub books ===

It's important to distinguish more objectively the differences between books, modules, and pages. It seems that many are interpreting a 'book' to mean the same as 'an article on Wikipedia'. I guess they're similar, but modules should be reserved for things beyond the scope of Wikipedia (although this is also poorly defined - perhaps it should be &quot;anything more than 32k of text on as many subpages as you like&quot;). 

=== Bookshelves out-of-date ===

See: [[All bookshelves]], etc.

These should be updated to link to the main page of all new books. These indices are already inaccurate, and need an overhaul. Create more taxonomical and normative categories to remove duplicated entries. Make it obvious which pages represent the main page of a distinct book.

The definitive book listing ought to be one where everyone can agree where books go. For this reason, I suggest using the [[w:Dewey Decimal Classification]], since it was created entirely for this purpose, and is extremely comprehensive.

Someone has already made a start with:

* [[Template:Dewey 000]]
* [[Template:Dewey 100]]
* [[Template:Dewey 200]]
* [[Template:Dewey 300]]
* [[Template:Dewey 400]]
* [[Template:Dewey 500]]
* [[Template:Dewey 600]]
* [[Template:Dewey 700]]
* [[Template:Dewey 800]]
* [[Template:Dewey 900]]

The dewey index page at page site http://isbndb.com/ could be useful.

; Problems

The dewey system is not quite standard across the world. It is apparently the most internationally recognised, but at least the section pertainting to religion varies depending on the most popular (government-imposed?) religion in that country. The DDC was written by a US citizen, so most of the religion section is devoted solely to Christianity (too much of it in my view), whilst a very small subsection is provided for alternate religions and ideologies. In countries where Christianity is not the primary religion, the vast majority of this section is devoted to the primary religion, and the smaller subsection is used for Christianity and other religions.

Another problem is with evolution. The DDC is not designed to evolve well. The generalities section (circa dewey 000) generally houses books pertaining to computers. I have also seen these classified in the physics and maths section in some libraries (circa dewey 500). As computers become more important in our day-to-day lives, these books will become increasingly common and popular.

The existent bookshelf alternative may prove to be be more successful in the long term. Its top-level categories are almost identical to those of the DDC system already. Furthermore, it is better able to evolve than the DDC. Perhaps DDC is not such a great idea after all.

=== [[Main page]] out-of-date ===

See: [[Talk:Main Page]]

=== [[Wikibooks:Browse]] out-of-date ===

Also it contains many red links, which is generally a bad thing.

=== Stub pages ===

I'm not sure why people have a problem with this. It seems reasonable to me that a user may take several days to try to get all their content into a meaningful place, so these should be permitted to exist for at least a certain amount of time.

=== Skeletons ===

A ''skeleton'' is a Wikibook which consists of a contents page linked to many other non-existent pages. The user who creates them will often be overwhelmed by the size of the scope they have created for themself to fill in, and often abandon the project. Newbies also have a tendency to click on these links, and type in any old nonsense.

; Solutions

Need a good ''policy'' on starting new books. By having a stricter policy, the endless debates in VfD can be minimised. The important thing is that the policy should try to leave the book in a reasonable state at all times, since almost every book is abandoned by its authors before it can be considered complete. See: [[#New book policy|New book policy]]

=== Scope overlap with other wikis ===

Scope overlap with Wikipedia, and forking from Wikipedia.

; Solutions

Make a more tight definition as to the distinction between Wikipedia and Wikibooks. It's obvious that there's going to be crossover, so for subject X:

* If you can't be bothered to put in the effort to create a good book about X:
** If there is a Wikipedia article about X, add it to that
** If not, create a new Wikipedia article about X
* If you can be bothered to put in the effort to create a good book:
** If there is a Wikipedia article already about X, make sure your book contains at least the information present there
** Note heavily on the Wikipedia article that a book now exists on the subject, and all new information should be put there

I shall define a good book to mean one which has more content than is generally acceptable for a Wikipedia article (probably around 32k of text).

Where an extensive and popular Wikipedia article already exists with the same name, I see nothing wrong with forking the content from there, providing it is noted heavily in the Wikipedia article 

=== Double redirects ===

Are they really a problem? Need to check this out.

=== Orphaned pages ===

Including orphaned redirect pages. These are mostly redundant, and are just taking up unneccesary space. Should be speedily deleted.

=== Inconsistent use of capitalization ===

Wiki page names are ''case-sensitive'', so one user can create a book &quot;A history of computers&quot;, and another could create a book &quot;A History of Computers&quot;, and they may never notice they're both writing the same book. Are title caps preferable? Needs to be standardized, or maybe they shouldn't be case sensitive? The problem below is similar.

=== Inconsistent use of naming ===

Similar to the above, what about the two book names &quot;Computing History&quot; and &quot;A History of Computing&quot;, or the endless conceivable permutations which are logically the same concept. Wikipedia simply uses redirects. Is this appropriate for Wikibooks too? Would these all be listed of the bookshelves?

=== Inconsistent use of talk pages ===

Mostly they talk about the page they belong to, but there are the odd cases such as pages like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] which is a talk page in its own right. Also check out the way they've been used in [[Christianity/John 1]], and similar pages.

; Solutions

I believe the logical distinction between a page and its associated talk page is that the page should serve as the information, and the talk page should serve as the reasoning why the information is the way it is. In a way, this reasoning is vital for preventing an edit war of the information page. For works-in-progress, you often see this reasoning in the information page itself. This practise should not be discouraged.

For pages like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] where the informational page is effectively being used as a talk page, perhaps the actual talk page could be used to keep presentable infomation on the ways things are done within that page (i.e. the two pages are conceptually swapped over), although I supposed it could also be used as a meta-talk page. It just seems a bit silly to talk about talking on a different page, when it could all be said on the main page.

As for [[Christianity/John 1]] etc., this practise ought to be frowned upon. It has already appeared in VfD. This is a special case which needs to be tightened up in the annotated texts policy. In my opinion, the main page should not be allowed to exist alone, since it is clearly raw text from the Bible. The talk pages should perhaps be appended to the main page, then cleared, since Wikipedians currently have no place to comment on the content of the page.

=== Archiving talk pages ===

Talk pages, and other pages which serve a similar function have a tendency to get long, and contain discussions which are no longer being monitored by anybody.

=== The 32k page limit ===

What browsers actually have a problem with this? If it really is a problem, it should be addressed in policy.

== Provisional policies and guidelines ==

This is an attempt to standardize, in the style of [[w:nomic|nomic]], what is currently popular convention, in the hopes of converting Wikibooks in something more akin to [[w:direct democracy|direct democracy]] rather than [[w:anarchy|anarchy]]. Another analogy would be perhaps the ''U.S. Constitution'', and its ''Amendments'', although this is [[w:representative democracy|representative democracy]] not direct democracy. The goal is to prevent [[w:edit wars|edit wars]], amongst other things.

=== Outline ===

; Use of terminology

What's a good word for documents of this nature? &quot;Policy&quot; seems to be the wiki standard, as well as &quot;guideline&quot; for more trivial things. It may be worth promoting all guidelines to policies anyway. If people interpret &quot;policy&quot; as &quot;I must do this&quot;, and &quot;guideline&quot; as &quot;I might do this&quot;, then guidelines would clearly be more effective if they were labelled &quot;policies&quot;. The psychological interpretation of language is a key point. Perhaps the word &quot;procedure&quot; is better, since it infers activity, rather than politics.

; Main page

* [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] - This page should contain no actual ''policies'', but instead serve as a useful index to all other ''policy documents''. The definitive index should always be the templated categories. This page will also contain ''guidelines''.

; Policy documents

* [[Wikibooks:Core policies]] - This will contain meta-policies, which are those to serve to indicate how policies are created/modified/removed, but can also be used for policies which don't require a whole document on the subject.

* [[Wikibooks:Editing policy]] - As it is.

etc.

; Alternatives

Maybe the problem is simply that by breaking up the policies into separate documents, users are too lazy to read them, since each page can take a long time to load. Based on the overheads of HTML and HTTP, it is certainly true to say a single larger document will be quicker to load than several smaller ones. Perhaps a single page is better, although each section may have to be extremely terse to make it digestable.

Since there seems to be a lot of policy forking going on between wikis, maybe the whole lot should be copied to meta and deleted from all sites, including policy for individual projects such as Wikibooks and Wikipedia.

; Visibility

I'm thinking of those signs you see on trash bins that say &quot;keep &lt;locale&gt; tidy&quot;; the ''locale'' of course depends on where you happen to be at the time. An image of that, but reading &quot;keep wikibooks tidy&quot; to splat on various pages, assuming we can link it to an appropriate page.

=== How to write effective policy documents ===

; Know your audience

This is en.wikibooks.org, so users here are most likely going to be countries with a large English-speaking population, with reasonable internet access. Using [[w:List_of_official_languages]] and [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html the CIA factbook]:

* India (1,080,264,388 - also Hindi)
* USA (295,734,134 - ~82.1%)
* Pakistan (162,419,946 - &lt;8%)
* Nigeria (128,765,768)
* Philippines (87,857,473 - also Filipino)
* UK (60,441,457)
* South Africa (44,344,136 - ~8.2% - also many others)
* Kenya (33,829,590 - also Swahili)
* Canada (32,805,041 - ~59.3% - also French)
* Australia (20,090,437 - ~79.1%)
* Hong Kong (6,898,686)
* Papua New Guinea (5,545,268 - &lt;2%)
* Singapore (4,425,720 - ~23% - also many others)
* New Zealand (4,035,461 - also Maori)
* Republic of Ireland (4,015,676 - also Irish)

Number in brackets is total population, which is not necessarily the same as English-speaking. Countries less than 2 million people not listed. This list is no indication of internet access. Also, some countries languages are not official languages by law, but only by custom. This distinction is irrelevant within the scope of this document.

; Use unambigious language

Technically impossible, since all people interpret language slightly differently, but bear it in mind. Some useful tricks are:

* Link the word to a definition in [[Wikibooks:Glossary]], and tighten the definition in there.
* Link the word to a page in Wikipedia. Many words and word-phrases already have disambiguation pages there, so this may also get the point across.

; Use examples

So, for example, when describing the correct use of naming, give an example of a book that conforms. This may be far more meaningful than any amount of explanation could ever achieve.

; The 'wall-of-text' effect

When faced with a huge paragraph, people tend to only read the first couple of sentences, then let their mind fill in the rest. Short, bulled pointed sentences are much easier to digest. Use whitespace to break things up, and try to make policies terse, while their justification can be as verbose as is necessary to justify that policy.

; The Bible Metaphor

Easily one of the most influential books in western civilization, and in many ways is like an early version of the, now commonplace, legislative set of rules comprising the ''social contract''. I'm not sure if the 11th commandment was ever intended to be &quot;Thou shalt not infringe on intellectual property rights.&quot;, but that seems to be the way things have become.

It memetic popularity can be attributed to its use of two distinct psychological tools. The first is wording it to make readers believe that they will suffer the torment of burning in eternal damnation if they don't read and follow the rules. The second is wording it to encourage the reader to propagate the meme to the minds of other people.

The practical wiki-equivalent of eternal damnation, would be things like blocking user accounts and IP addresses, and having contributions deleted or reverted. Obviously, only the latter can be performed by a regular user, and since there are relatively few admins at the moment, this may prove to be the most effective deterrent.

; The Selfish Gene &amp; Prisoner's Dilemma Metaphor

The psychological effect of wording the rules, to imply that a positive consequence will occur to the user who follows them, will serve better than to imply that a positive consequence will occur to the remainder of the Wikibooks community. In short, you get better results by appealing to an individual's sense of ''selfishness'' than to their sense of ''altruism''.

=== Core policies ===

; Definition of terms 

This is extremely important. In order to communicate unambiguously, we need to agree on the same terminology. [[Wikibooks:Glossary]] is a good starting point for this.

; Current policy definitions

I had already added some of this to [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]], and created the templates [[Template:Enforced]], [[Template:Proposed]], [[Template:Rejected]] to make it more similar to Wikipedia, but perhaps it was not such a good idea. I shall refrain from making any further changes until this is sorted out.

There are three kinds of ''policy'':

* ''Enforced policy'' - This will be enforced by the Wikibook community.
* ''Proposed policy'' - This is a policy proposed to be an ''enforced policy'', but is still undergoing discussion.
* ''Rejected policy'' - This is a ''proposed policy'' which has been rejected by the community. It should remain to remind people why it was rejected.

When the term ''policy'' is used without one of these qualifiers, it is assumed to mean ''enforced policy''.

A ''guideline'' is the much less formal equivalent of a policy. They generally don't require enforcement, because they're mostly obvious social behavioural guidelines in various situations. If they become problematic in the future, they may be promoted to a full policy document.

; Existing systems

Perhaps we should use the the standards from RFC2119, since they are more tight definitions of commonplace English words:

# MUST - This word, or the terms &quot;REQUIRED&quot; or &quot;SHALL&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
# MUST NOT - This phrase, or the phrase &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
# SHOULD - This word, or the adjective &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
# SHOULD NOT - This phrase, or the phrase &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot; mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
# MAY - This word, or the adjective &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, mean that an item is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

Translated into wiki, this would mean that breaking 1 and 2 would be grounds for banning, 3 and 4 would be grounds for reverting/page renaming/merging, and 5 is just a suggestion.

e.g.

* You MUST NOT vandalise pages.
* You SHOULD sign posts on a talk page.
* You MAY write a new book. :-)

In a way, a wiki is a much better system for &quot;Requests For Comments (RFCs)&quot;, since each page has a talk page precisely for this purpose. Maybe this would be a better metaphor, but it might confuse it with the IETF documents on which it was based.

On the subject of RFCs, the success of the internet tend to suggest the IETF did a good job with writing those documents. They are very precise, and some are so well written, you could have a hard job arguing with them, except perhaps if you beg to differ on the definition of a fundamental principle like an &quot;electron&quot;.

; Provision nomic-esque policies

I will have to change these:

* Every core policy is mutable (i.e. it can be changed).
** ''No legal system can adapt to the changing nature of the universe without being flexible.''
* Every core policy must have at least one justification.
** ''The [[w:tragedy of the commons|tragedy of the commons]] effect would suggest that people are far less likely to follow standards without adequate justification.''
** ''It will prevent newbies from asking, &quot;why is X a policy?&quot;''
* The process for changing the core policies should be by submitting the proposed changes to its talk page. The voting process begins at this time. Each registered user gets one vote, either 'for' or 'against'. The user may in addition specify a justification for their vote, even though it may have the secondary consequence of persuading subsequent voters to vote the same way. The voting period will last for one week. After this time, if the number of 'for' votes is greater than or equal to the number of 'against' votes, the change is considered accepted, and the user who proposed the change may now apply it to the appropriate page. This includes the case where there are no votes at all.
** ''By specifying a time limit for voting, things can still happen even when the site is rarely visited.''

; Issues to resolve

* Is one week a good length of time to allow for voting?
* Should we have another set of less-mutable standards which require a minimum number of votes to ratify?

; Better ideas?

Anything wrong with just:

* If you think it's wrong, just change it
* If your change gets reverted, talk about it
* If you still don't agree, vote on it

Seems about as pro-active as I can think of.

=== Navigation panel policy ===

Since the navigation panel is visible on all pages (is this true for all available CSS pages?), it is a useful tool for helping people find what they are looking for, especially if they have been directed to a specific page on this site, rather than to the main page or portal. These can't be changed by regular users, so perhaps a page should be put in place to specify these links, while allowing its talk page to serve as a place to discuss what they should be. Currently they are:

* Main Page -&gt; [[Main Page]]
* Wikiversity -&gt; [[Wikiversity]]
* Community Portal -&gt; [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]]
* Recent changes -&gt; [[Special:Recentchanges]]
* Random module -&gt; [[Special:Random]]
* Help -&gt; [[Help:Contents]]
* Donations -&gt; http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising

I'm thinking one should link to a page devoted to people who are new to the wiki experience, and that this page should provide an obvious link to the sandbox wiki.

=== Book writing policy ===

''(a.k.a) How to make sure that your edits that won't get reverted by anyone, or your pages deleted by an administrator.''

Obviously, it's a complete waste of time to work on a book which will subsequently get reverted or deleted.

; Writing a new book from scratch

* Before you start a new book, check there isn't one already which covers the scope you have in mind. By adding content to an existing book (especially if you use the correct subpage convention), rather than creating a new 'stub' book, your change will more likely be accepted by the Wikibooks community, and you will be doing a 'good thing' in trying to keep similar content in the same book.

* When starting a new book, the most important thing is to choose a good title for it. Should you subsequently abandon the project, this title will in many ways determine its future scope, since it then becomes up to other users to determine what information belongs in it, based on its title.

* Once you have a title for your book, try to start out with the intention of writing everything on a single page. Perhaps start with a single paragraph to explain the scope of the book. If you don't provide even this much, your work will likely get declared to be a 'stub', and deleted at a later date. To avoid this, you generally have a lot more freedom in the sorts of content you can place in your user page, or a subpage thereof. Some users prefer to start their book as a subpage of their user page, then move it to the main namespace when they think it is of sufficient quality to 'publish'. If you start your book in the main namespace, you will more likely find that other users will edit it, and might be prepared to help out with writing it.

* As ideas for 'chapters' in the book form in your mind, start using the '==' subheading notation to subdivide it, and try to provide at least a sentence for each subheading to explain what should go in that section. Once you have at least three or four of these, the page will automatically generate a table of contents for your book. If you like, you can further subdivide with '===' sub-subheading, etc.

* Once your page reaches the point where some of the sections contain a substantial enough amount of content to warrant a whole page to the subject, then you can start playing around with subpages. Using the '''/' subpage convention'' will save you a lot of effort since it automatically provides links to its parent pages. Try to avoid creating links to pages that don't exist, these often get clicked on by newbies, who seem to think that &quot;fsghfgpouhgp&quot; is good enough for the content. Also try to avoid 'stub' pages which contain only a single sentence. Many wiki users consider these to be evil, and will often mark them for deletion, especially when they do not use the '/' subpage convention to indicate they are subpages of another book.

; Transferring existing content to form a new book

* First, make sure you are legally allowed to put the source onto the wiki at all. See: [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]
* If the source text is already complete, and you have no intention to change it, it should be put on Wikisource instead. This site is for books in development. See also: [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]]
* If the source text needs work to convert it to use wiki markup, it might be worth temporarily housing the page as a subpage of your user page. So called [[Wikibooks:Glossary#data dump|data dumps]] are generally frowned upon.

=== Editing policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Editing policy]]

=== Deletion policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]

* Don't add a page to VfD unless it hasn't been edited for at least 1 week.
** ''Someone trying to build up a book from scratch may take a while to get any significant amount of content in.''

=== Namespace use policy ===

Personally I find the namespacing system to be a little inflexibile, since you can't dynamically add new ones, however, it might worth formalizing things like:

* All pages about Wikibooks itself, rather than actual books should be in the 'Wikibooks' namespace.
* Every page name in the main namespace which clearly contains no ':' and '/' to identify it as a page in a book, should be considered a 'book' in its own right.
* If that page appears to be part of another book, please rename (move) the page to use the bookname/pagename convention.
** ''Point is, if someone can't be bothered to collate the pages of their own book, they clearly need the '/' convention to provide this automatic linking for them.''

There are also some pages in the 'Help' namespace, with no clear distinction as to what belongs in that, compared to what should belong in the 'Wikibooks' namespace.

=== Page naming policy === 

* [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]
* [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]

; On the subject of '/' vs. '&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;'

There are two key differences between the two. The first is a simple typographical distinction, and the other is the way the wiki software behaves when rendering the page. 

Typographically, it may be preferable to use the '/' syntax since:

* It distinguishes it from the ':' used for namespaces, which operate in a different fashion, and may serve to confuse users as to their function. e.g.
** The corresponding talk page for [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] is [[Wikibooks talk:Administrators]]
** The corresponding talk page for [[Programming:C]] is not [[Programming talk:C]], but [[Talk:Programming:C]].

* It's common URL convention anyway. There are dozens of RFCs on the subject.

* On my keyboard, I don't have to press SHIFT to make one appear. Okay. A bit selfish, but I suspect that 99% of en.wikibooks.org have the same keyboard layout as me in that regard.

Behaviorally, however, the two are not nearly as equivalent, since using '/' will create a link to its parent pages, whereas ':' will not. The user may not want this link, since they may be using a far more sophisticated template page for navigation purposes. Unless there is a way to optionally suppress the link added using '/', then you can argue that both systems need to be retained for flexibility. If there is such a system, then I'd argue for the dropping of the ':' syntax, to be used solely as a means to easily identify which namespace a page is in.

There are practical considerations as well. If we do decide to use one over the other, is anyone actually going to change all the existing books to be conformant?

See also: [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The dangers of page naming]]

; On the use of hierarchy generally

There is also a great deal of flexibility in the use of hierarchy generally.

See: [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The dangers of hierarchies]]

=== Category use policy ===

There doesn't seem to be anything about this at the moment, and I've not really put a lot of thought into it, so I'll put in:

* Use categories at your own discretion.

As for hierarchical categories such as...

* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Baby Pokémon]]
* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Cute Charm Ability]]

...or the same, but using a '/' instead of a ':' - be aware that the use of these delimiters is not interpreted by the software in any way, so it is merely a typographical distinction. For the same reasons as page naming, I would suggest the use of '/' rather than ':' to avoid the confusion between concrete namespaces and artificial scopes.

As for the conceptual 'scoping' of categories using this notation, I guess it's reasonable to do so where said categories would otherwise serve to pollute the main category namespace. This may be more necessary when creating categories based on fictional universes such as Pokémon, rather than the one we actually live in. If you merely wish to provide hierarchy to real world concepts, just choose a fairly unambigious name, and use sub-categories to create hierarchy. That is, if you add a category to another category, it is considered a sub-category of that category. Implying hierarchy through the name will only make it more awkward to modify that hierarchy later. A reasonable example might be

* [[:Category:Cooking]]
** [[:Category:Recipes]] - recipes is probably unambiguous enough
*** [[:Category:Fish recipes]]
*** [[:Category:Meat recipes]]
*** [[:Category:Vegan recipes]]
** [[:Category:Kitchen equipment]]

The problem is, categories duplicate the functionality offered by the '/' subpage notation. The same thing could have been achieved by structuring the book thus:

* [[Cookbook]]
** [[Cookbook/Recipes]]
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Fish]] - notice here, the scope allows us to drop the word 'recipes' from the end.
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Meat]]
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Vegan]]
** [[Cookbook/Kitchen equipment]]

I guess it's arguable which is better. You could even write your entire book in the Category namespace I guess, just to exploit its subcategory abilities.

This section has been disputed in the [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|talk page]].

=== Image use policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]]

=== Administration policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]

=== Page protection policy ===

In a perfect world, no pages should need to be protected, in fact, this open attitude should be strongly enouraged. Many users can be trusted to improve the formatting of the page, without changing its content, and update links which become out-of-date. In the world we live in, however, it seems apparent that some pages need to be protected. I think the real problem is not the opportunist vandals, since it probably takes them more time to vandalise a page, than it does for another user to revert it. The real problem occurs when these vandalism attempts are scripted.

So far it seems this is limited to automated linkspamming software that attempts to get higher page rankings for its pages, most likely on the Google search engine. If this is the case, then merely protected high-profile pages such as those displayed for the URLs wikibooks.org, www.wikibooks.org and en.wikibooks.org, should suffice. The first two link to [[Wikibooks portal]] (which is currently not protected, and has been targeted by linkspammers in the past), the second links to [[Main page]] which is heavily protected and monitored.

This kind of scripting could evolve into much more sophisticated vandalism attacks, which could be incredibly annyoing for the average user to revert, and would most likely require a complete database rollback. These sorts of attacks could be detected and prevented, but the current system in place may not be sufficient forever. The future solution would most likely involve the apache server keeping an eye out for many edits in a very short space of time, all coming from a single IP address. Having said that, some of these scripts are quite cunning. I've seen what I refer to as 'distributed linkspamming attacks' which come quite slowly from multiple IP addresses, to make them look like legitimate edits.

In the meantime, the current system of blocking IP addresses will have to suffice. It might be worth formalising a procedure for checking the recent edits for obvious vandalism. See [[#Edit review policy|Edit review policy]]

=== Edit review policy ===

Some sort of simple procedure for those who can be bothered to review edits for vandalism, linkspam, new pages not conforming to naming policy, uploading illegal images, etc.

e.g.: If you can't be bothered to check all edits made, perhaps just checking those made by non-registered users (vandalism attacks will most likely be from these).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== index generation ==

The recipe index is kind of insane. It's a big page, and just getting bigger. Worse, it is unmaintainable. How can one tell if a recipe is missing? By looking, recipe by recipe, in that huge page. Probably a category would be better, but note that recipes really should appear under multiple names. I believe the term for this is a &quot;permuted index&quot;. So a &quot;Spicy Chicken&quot; recipe would also appear as &quot;Chicken, Spicy&quot;, etc. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:24, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Agreed, I was thinking about this but for slightly different reasons. Seems like uber-categorization is the &quot;answer&quot; though it's more difficult for newbies to maintain. So, for instance, we could have categories like so:
::*Category:Cookbook:Ingredient
::*Category:Cookbook:Technique
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Poultry
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Vegan
:: The cookbook seems like an ideal candidate for fairly strict categorization like this. Notice that I put the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace into the category -- I think this makes more sense if other wikibooks want to use the same categories (Category:Recipe, for example might be used in a technical setting like a HOWTO). 
:: Of course, this requires tagging every recipe with the recipe category, but that seems like what we need to do to get an automatic index. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I think we really should have an giant global index for people to browse. I just don't think we should be trying to maintain one by hand. I want to see automatic generation of:

:::*Vegetable Stew and Dumplings
:::*Stew and Dumplings, Vegetable

:::::Odd? No, that's perfect. It's what you need if you half-way remember the name of a recipe.

::::We are facing two problems:

::::For (1), a custom tag which created an index based on the tagged &quot;major&quot; ingredients would be good (so we could have a Chicken section); for (2) I think the existing category tags are enough, we just have to be more strict and thorough with them, which means a set policy to which new users can be pointed.
::::[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:10, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::The category problem is different. Indexing needs to be done automatically. For categories, we could use automatic suggestions. Imagine if it worked like autocompletion in a web browser URL entry area or in an email client &quot;To:&quot; area.

See [[w:List_of_Google_services_and_tools#Google_Suggest|here (Wikipedia article)]], [[w:Image:Google_Suggest_%28Beta%29_blacklist_demo_animation_1.gif|here (animated gif demo)]], and of course [http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en here (Google's beta)]. Tree-structured browsing, as is done on [http://freshmeat.net/ freshmeat.net] for project categorization, could be somewhat helpful as well.

:::*[[Cookbook:Kellen:Fake Recipe 1|Kellen:Fake Recipe 1]]
:::*[[Cookbook:Kellen:Fake Recipe 2|Kellen:Fake Recipe 2]]

:::Unfortunately the automatic links to these categories don't work correctly, but if one goes to the page directly: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Cookbook:Recipe Cookbook:Recipe Category page] it seems to work. I'm not sure about how easy it is for us to ask for/get modifications to the wiki software to fix this, or to customize it to properly alphabetize things with respect to namespaces (i.e. not file everything under &quot;Cookbook&quot;), but seems to me that this could work. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:50, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

==categorization proposal==
After looking at this a bit more, I think that categorizing all of our cookbook pages will be essential to indexing and browsing. I'd propose using a (fake-)namespace-enabled system, like so:
*Category:Cookbook
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Breakfast
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Bread
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Diet:Gluten_Free
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Diet:Kosher
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:African
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:Caribbean
*Category:Cookbook:Cooking_Technique
*Category:Cookbook:Equipment
*Category:Cookbook:Ingredient
This requires that:
#All existing pages in the cookbook be tagged with the approprite category (e.g. all recipes should minimally be in Category:Cookbook:Recipe)
#To be useful, all these category tags must be aliased properly 
(2) means to have the correctly set the sort-order name; for &quot;Chicken Salad&quot;, the link would be &quot;Category:Cookbook:Recipe|Chicken Salad&quot;

I realize that this is a very labor intensive process, but I believe it'll help readers immensely. The initial conversion of adding Category:Cookbook:Recipe to all pages linked from Cookbook:Recipes could be done with a bot.

[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 20:19, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:We're seeing some rather serious problems with caching, and with the use of &quot;:&quot; in a category name. Until somebody fixes all the bugs, we should stay away from anything likely to trigger problems. Also, namespace problems have not been a problem with categories. It's better to keep things short and simple if we can. Before we start using lots of categories, we should have some sort of an autocompletion and suggestion mechanism in place. Otherwise, there's no way people will get something like Gluten_Free right on all the recipes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:28, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::I see the caching problem, what's the problem with &quot;:&quot; in a category name?
::I don't think I was clear on my reasoning: I wanted to categorize things like this because it would allow us to have an automatically generated index listing for each item. For example, my [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread]] recipe could be tagged with:
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:Scandanavian
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Bread
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Vegan
::And if a user browses to the main Category:Cookbook:Recipe, they'll see it linked in the main listing. If they browse to the &quot;Vegan&quot; or &quot;Bread&quot; subcategory, they'll see it listed there, and if they browse to &quot;Cusine&quot; then to &quot;Scandanavian&quot;, they'll see it listed there.
::The main advantage of this is that it centralizes the categorization of a recipe. Right now, we add a recipe, then add it to up to the bread page, to the recipes page, to the vegan_cusine page, etc. Using categories, we can just edit the page for the recipe and add it to all these places at once.

::::I do, for several reasons. First, no other category is named like that. Conflicts have not been a problem. Second, that's a ''lot'' of edits. You'd better get near-unanimous agreement that this is right before proceeding. Third of all, will this get us a friendly index? It won't be permutated. Fourth, over on the Commons, people have been saying nasty things about the performance of categories and the effects they have on the wiki servers. Perhaps using a template might be wise.

::::::It seems that [[:Category:Recipes]] is meant to hold sub-categories, not recipes. You should either choose a different name, like [[:Category:Recipe]] (no '''s''') or [[:Category:Index]], or move the sub-categories out. Other than that I guess it is kind of a nice idea. I'd like to see a few other people (maybe Redlentil and Gentgeen) show enthusiastic support before you start though. The nice thing about the current setup is that the boilerplate overhead is small enough that I can easily type it all in from memory. Maybe you should do this as a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template at the top, in place of the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' wikitext we put there now.

:::::::Kellen, thanks for inviting my comments but I'm pretty clueless about categories. I'm never entirely convinced of their value. As I understand Albert's view, excessive use of categories can cause server problems, particularly when they include colons. Is that right? If so, I think detailed categories as you earlier suggested, although very useful are impractical.  Using a thick category like Category:Recipe is OK, but I can't see it would make anything any easier. This may be just my ignorance.

== Work-around for non-updating category listings ==

You erase completly the category from the article and you save the page... then you link again the category with the new asigned word after the '''|''' sign.

Solution from mediawiki bugzilla:

I have just noticed that someone on en.wikipedia started to remove categories
from articles with one edit only to revert the change with the next edit. That
seems to be the current work-around for this bug. Needless to say, I agree that
fixing it is a rather high priority.

A bug has been filed [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2166 here]

::Yes, I noticed that and did that on a couple of my categories and test pages. Thanks for encoding it here though! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

::Hey, glad you filed a bug, looks like [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2166] it's already been fixed by [[User:Brion_VIBBER|Brion_VIBBER]] Yay for him! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:24, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

== cool feature examples ==

Recipe scaling exists. You type in how many servings you want, and the recipe is scaled.
Unless the info is in a cookie, [http://www.recipezaar.com/114266 this] and [http://beef.allrecipes.com/az/PnFridFiltswithMshrmSc.asp this] should be fine
examples of how it works. Just change the number of servings.

Also, look at this [http://beef.allrecipes.com/directory/2233.asp category] page. It shows ratings and has links to reviews. Anybody can post a review. I don't think people have to understand wikitext markup. :-/

Better than simple ratings would be ones like those used by a music recommendation service, where a recipe is ranked by how it pleases people who rate recipes similarly to yourself. (and by how it displeases people opposite to yourself) The same software feature used to ensure a heavy-metal fan doesn't get suggested country and western should work to make sure that I never get suggested to eat habaneros on tofu. (and I know, some of you are thinking &quot;Yum!&quot;)

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 12:03, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

::Neat! The scaling is nice (and relatively easy). What I like is the conversions between US and metric -- they must have some DB of the weight per tablespoon/cup/whatever of various ingredients. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:14, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

== move featured recipe template ==
I'd like to move &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{featured recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for a main navigational template (Cookbook, Recipe Index) and category inclusion (into Category:Recipe). I will do the migrations. Objections? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 05:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

:Good idea. There's an &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ingredient}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; one too, probably deserving the same treatment. The other major article classes are tools (pot, stove, fork), techniques (boiling, pickling, chopping), and geographic cuisines (Russian, Spanish, Mexican). I suppose the rest (oven temperatures, vegan stuff, contributers) go in &quot;misc&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:03, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

::I moved the featured ingredient and recipe to [[Template:Featured recipe]] and [[Template:Featured ingredient]] respectively. The second word is lowercase so that if you do &lt;nowiki&gt;{{featured ingredient}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; it still works (since it's common to lowercase the template names).[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:12, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

::I made the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. I tried including a [[:Category:Recipe]] in it, but that leads to a weird sort order that doesn't please me too much. See [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread]] for an example. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 05:55, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

:::A pipe rename in the category tag (Is that what it's called?) would keep things from always sorting under &quot;R&quot;.

Supplying the recipe name as a parameter would work, but usage is not as nice. Renaming a recipe would require an edit. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:36, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::Oh neat, a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; macro. That's fun! It at least gets everything in alphabetical order in the right spot (not renamed to &quot;Recipe&quot;).

::::: Well according to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pagename#Variables_PAGENAME_and_PAGENAMEE] if &quot;Cookbook&quot; were a proper namespace, we'd be able to use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to get the name we wanted, alternatively a variable to strip off all preceding false namespaces would also work.

We could also (as you noted) use a piped variable &lt;nowiki&gt;{{1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to our template, but we'd have to update that when the name of a page changed.

== advertising ==

A while back I added a bunch of info about vegan ingredient substitutes, with specifics of brand names and links to their respective webpages [[User:The_bellman]] did some amount of purging of these with a NPOV complaint. I responded both on [[User_talk:The_bellman|his user talk page]] and the [[Talk:Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine]] page, with no replies on either. I am going to reinstate these links for the reasons I have written in both places. If somebody can think of a better format, I am open to suggestions, but I think the info itself is useful. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I have no problems with product recomendations.  Our NPOV policy is much looser than our big sister's, and specifying specific brand name products is common for a cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:08, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::Agree that recommendation of specific brands - particularly for tricky things like vegan substitutions - is OK. A similar thing would perhaps apply to kitchen equipment, where someone might want to suggest that Acme Food Processors are a reputed product, etc. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 17:36, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Classic Recipes ==

I think that certain 'classic' classes of recipes should be dealt with differently. Take, for instance, [[Cookbook:Lasagna|Lasagna]]. Right now there is a - no doubt lovely - specific lasagna recipe. The problem is that these recipes are added on a sort of first come, first serve basis. There are a thousand different lasagna-recipes that could just as well take this place. I think it should be general practice to move these to a more specific name like &quot;Ricotta Lasagna&quot; and use the &quot;Lasagna&quot; page for a lasagna recipe that is as generic as possible, with not so much a recipe as a general description and notes and tips that apply to all lasagna's.

I think this would provide a way to transition smoothly between 'information pages' and recipes. For instance, the &quot;Pasta&quot; page gives information on pasta, with tips and notes, the &quot;Lasagna&quot; page does the same, but with more of a recipe structure on how lasagna's are basically made and some tips on ingredient combinations and finally the &quot;Eggplant Lasagna&quot; gives a specific lasgna recipe.
For an example of what I mean, check the [[Cookbook:Risotto|Risotto]] page.

I may be stating the blindingly obvious here, in which case I apologise. :)  [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:18, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: You are correct. In wikipedia these are generally turned into disambiguation pages. In our case, of course, we're disambiguating between some relatively similar things, but I think that's OK. I say if you find something like this, move the old recipes and link them from your new disambiguation page. Also consider creating a &quot;____ recipes&quot; category for it if there's enough need, e.g. &quot;Category:Lasagna recipes&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 06:33, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Once more, from the top ==

'''Note''': This section copied from one of my posts on [[Talk:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]], which, I guess, is where all this started. Note that some of my conclusions were subsequently altered. I shall merge in the more pertinent parts when I have time. Please don't add replies to this section. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 18:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

Okay. I think we both have different interpretations of what Wikibooks actually is, and the most effective means of using it. I guess it was rather a dumb idea of mine to choose some standards without adequately justifying those choices. This almost always fails to produce standards which get adhered to, in any system where people are not rewarded for following said standards. e.g. In a company, you get paid money to follow their rules. On a wiki there is no obvious financial reward at all. But I hope you at least agree that standards are important on collaborative projects, if only to the extent that we interpret language in the same way. i.e. We share a common 'dictionary'.

For what it's worth, I'm a 28-year-old software developer, and during some of the projects I've had to 'endure', I came across various pitfalls of the processes commonly used within those projects. Most of these don't really pertain to wiki, but some do. I also fairly new to the wiki community, but I really like the idea, because it does to information what web-forums and newsgroups can only dream of.


=== The dangers of page naming ===

I've finally read through all the material I can find about page name delimiters, and I'll just summarise what I've found here:

N.B. I use the character '*' to represent any amount of whitespace, including no whitespace. Valid whitespace characters seem to be: '_' and '%20', but not ' ', since this is an illegal character in a URL. All browsers convert it to '%20'.

'''page name -&gt; wiki interpretation'''

&quot;*GTASA*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*Talk*:*GTASA*&quot; -&gt; a page in the &quot;Talk&quot; namespace named &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA:Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA:Ryder&quot;

&quot;*GTASA:_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA:_Ryder&quot;

&quot;*GTASA/Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA/Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA/_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA/_Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA_/_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA_/_Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

Notice the last three are conceptually identical, but will return three different pages. Not really what we want.


=== The dangers of hierarchies ===

Hierarchies are probably most familiar in things like URLs. The idea is to use them when something is conceptually a 'child' element of another element. This is great for some applications, but the problem is that with a bunch of disparate concepts, as you might find in a guide for GTA:SA, it's nigh impossible to get everyone to agree which means of arranging things in a hierarchy is best.

e.g. I noticed above that the page 'Vehicle Missions' is a child of the 'Vehicles' page, whereas since it's ultimately talking about missions, and not vehicles, I might have decided to make it a child of the 'Missions' page.

The same is true for most classification schemes. Let's take an example for movies. If I decide on some categories like 'Action', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi', etc.

The problem now is that when I want to add a movie to one of these categories, which one should I choose? The movie 'Pulp Fiction' surely belongs to more than one of these categories.

The error here is defining categories which are not mutually-exclusive. A good example of categories might be 'A', 'B', 'C', etc., in which case, there could be little argument that the movie 'Pulp Fiction' should belong in the 'P' category.

Categories also fail where the category names are poorly defined, as they are right now.

Furthermore the hierarchy might change as new content is added, and if this hierarchy is included in the page name, then the page name will have to change also. From my experience, it's a lot easier to change the content of a page, than it is to change the page's name.

Another problem with using the '/' notation is the implication that the parent node MUST exist. I might want to have a page &quot;foo/bar&quot;, but not a page &quot;foo&quot;.


=== Conclusions ===

To avoid confusion, I shall define the following terms:

;bookshelf:Conceptially, an index of one of more categories of '''books''' on Wikibooks.
;book:This is perhaps analagous to a paper book. This '''book''' may belong to any number of '''bookshelves'''.
;page:This is perhaps analagous to a chapter in a paper book. Note that one of the design goals of Wikibooks was to allow many '''books''' to share the same '''pages'''. e.g. Most of the Wikibooks relating to computer programming, tend to include the global '''page''' containing the ASCII chart.
;page name:The suffix of the URL used to retrieve a '''page'''. i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''page name'''. Note that many similar suffices may be used to reference the same '''page''', so I shall define it to mean the shortest suffix required to retrieve the '''page'''.
;content page:Conceptually, perhaps, a leaf-node '''page''' which contains mostly useful content pertaining to its '''page name'''.
;index page:A '''page''' whose primary reason for existence is to provide an index to other '''pages'''. The index could be hierarchical, alphabetical, or whatever. A '''bookshelf''' page is an example of such a page.

* Use '''page names''' solely to uniquely identify discrete concepts within the scope of the '''book'''. They should not be used to denote hierarchy.
* Keep the '''page names''' as short as possible, while making every effort to avoid namespace collision, by using scoping or disambiguation where necessary.
* To provide a hierarchical model of all the '''content pages''' relevant to the '''book''', use an '''index page''' to index the existing content. This is the current purpose of the 'Contents' page. If the conceptual hierarchy should need to change, you only need to modify that one '''page'''. This also allows you to apply multiple conceptual models to the same information, simply by having multiple '''index pages.''' e.g. the 'Index' page will ultimately provide an alphabetical index of the same '''content pages''', and the FAQ page is starting to link back into the main content.
* To provide a hierarchical model of all the '''content pages''' relevant to a smaller scope (e.g. all missions in Los Santos), use another '''index page'''.
* Try to avoid changing the '''page names''' of existing '''pages''', or creating too many new '''content pages''' until there is a clear page naming standard.

Perhaps it would be clearer if I specified how I ultimately expect the pages to be named. The string &quot;GTASA&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;:-

* Index pages
** &quot;GTASA&quot; - Main page, linking only to other index pages.
** &quot;GTASA: Contents&quot; - Full hierarchical contents, linking to every content page.
** &quot;GTASA: Index&quot; - Full alphabetical index, linking to every content page.
** &quot;GTASA: Frequently Asked Questions &quot; - This page is a little hairy, since it contains both indices and content, but I shall put it in here in the hope that ultimately it will only contain links to other pages.
** &quot;
* Content pages
** &quot;GTASA: Mission: Ryder&quot; - Anything pertaining to the 'Ryder' mission.
** &quot;GTASA: Mission: End of the Line&quot; - Anything pertaining to the 'End of the Line' mission.
** &quot;GTASA: Character: Ryder&quot; - Anything pertaining the the character 'Ryder'
** &quot;GTASA: Vehicle: Infernus&quot; - Anything pertaining the the vehicle 'Infernus'
** &quot;GTASA: Item: Night-vision Goggles&quot; - Anything pertaining the the item 'Night-vision Goggles'

If you think having only a single index to all missions is too much of a 'spoiler', then you could create another index page, say, just for Los Santos missions, which would link to the 'Ryder' mission, but not to the 'End of the Line' mission.

The means used to disambiguate the page names is arbitrary. I merely chose the colon (as used typographically rather than in a scoping context. i.e. &quot;foo: bar&quot; rather than &quot;foo:bar&quot;), because this seemed to be the way that the content was already organised. Some other examples:

* &quot;GTASA: Ryder (mission)&quot;
* &quot;GTASA: Mission - Ryder&quot;

I really don't care which method is used, providing it's agreed upon. Maybe the colon is a bad idea because it implies a namespace where none exists.

Okay. It's 8:00pm here, and I'm off to the pub for a while.

[[User:Aya|Aya]] 18:56, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I wasn't aware that there was a misunderstanding at all, but now I finally see what you're getting at! Yes I did think of the hierarchy of the Vehicle Missions--''after'' I'd moved it! Certainly it should go under missions.
:But what other examples are there of multiple-location pages like the Pulp Fiction example you gave? From a quick look at the list, pretty much everything might as well stay right where it is until such time as good names are found for &quot;collectible hidden things&quot; and such. For neatness' sake the Burglary guide should go under the Vehicle Missions page, but, again, that's minor.
:As for implying the parent exists, in the currently applicable situations I can't think of a parent directory that would be unwanted, except for /Cheats/ but I've got plans for content there too.
:The colons as they look nice and make nicer-looking page auto-titles than the slashes do, but they still imply an upper directory exists. Brackets make users less inclined to think there is a higher level, but as a downside they generate ugly URLs (&quot;Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas_%28Contents%29&quot;).
:I'm interested in using slashes because that is the standard for nested pages both in many of the other books here and the pages on other Wikis. Also, and more importantly, the MediaWiki engine will eventually support a TOC link on each page that will generate a list of its child pages, but this will not however support colon-based directories. Therefore for future-proofing and overall cohesiveness with the style adopted by the rest of the Wikibooks projects it seems the slash should be the way to go. Hmmm...
:But hang on, I've got an idea, I'll just post this and do that :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 14:22, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

From the main page: ''The problem is, categories duplicate the functionality offered by the '/' subpage notation.''

This is incorrect. In the cookbook, the recipes fit into many different categories, e.g. a recipe in [[:Category:Vegan recipes]] and in [[:Category:Bread]] (see: [[Cookbook:Cardamom Bread]]). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: You're correct of course. We really need a good policy on use of categories. They're just too flexible for their own good. Maybe it's no big deal, and &quot;Use categories at your own discretion&quot; is about all we can say. I guess they can always be moved or renamed later on if there's a conflict. It was so much easier on Wikipedia, since there could be fewer arguments about the correct use of categories. It's almost as if each book on Wikibooks would benefit from having its own namespace, with its own pages, categories, images, and templates in that namespace. Another way of saying it is, perhaps with the current software implementation, each Wikibook needs its own wiki, in the same way that Wiktionary and Wikipedia are effectively separate books in their own right, but both theoretically could have been separate Wikibooks projects on this site. I suspect there would be many advantages from having all WikiMedia projects sharing the same wiki, providing the MediaWiki software could keep them all separate. Intra-wiki-linking feels much more professional than inter-wiki-linking. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

Where hierarchical categories come into play is where there are managment issues in the categories. In the main wikipedia this is not so much a problem since everything belongs to the same &quot;book.&quot; In the cookbook we have lots of stray categories with only one or two things, many of which are not subcategories of the &quot;main&quot; cookbook categories. If we make sure that we prefix everything category for the cookbook with &quot;Cookbook:&quot;, this mangment becomes much easier. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: I can't see a conceptual difference between making those categories subcategories of the 'main cookbook' categories, and altering their names to make it look like they are subcategories (regardless of whether you subsequently add them to be bona fide subcategories too.) Having said that, and based on my previous reply, it might be worth prepending them anyway, to serve as a scoping tool to prevent namespace collision, rather than implying a hierarchy. Perhaps the following might be useful:

:: For a book entitled &quot;foo&quot;, the following page prefixes are reserved for that book:

 (Main:)Foo[/*]
 (Main:)Foo[:*]
 Talk:Foo[/*]
 Talk:Foo[:*]
 Image:Foo[/*]
 Image talk:Foo[/*]
 Template:Foo[/*]
 Template talk:Foo[/*]
 Category:Foo[/*]
 Category talk:Foo[/*]

:: Only use pages outside these prefixes where they are conceptually designed to be shared between multiple Wikibooks. It may also be worth listing these generic pages on another page, so people are aware of them, and don't accidentally create a fork.
::: This is part of [[WB:NC]] (although images, templates, and categories are in recommended use only), although it is not strictly enforced because little effort has gone in by users to enforce them. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
:::: Wow. I accidentally came up with the existing policy without having read it. &quot;Great minds think alike&quot; or just &quot;blindlingly obvious&quot;? Yeah. It's obviously not a followed convention for those who have never read it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:25, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: In a way this seems like common sense, but it's not written down anywhere. Note that I only allow the ':' syntax for pages in main and talk namespaces, since it's the only one which provides different wiki behavior. I still believe the '/' is typographically preferable. I already used this convention with the page header template [[Template:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Header]] for the book [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

My inclination is that categories probably shouldn't be shared across wikibooks anyway, though maybe entire wikibooks could be categorized together (Category:Physics books). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: Again, you're probably correct. I guess there has to be a distinction between the categorization of books, and the categorization of pages within a single book. &lt;s&gt;Back to your original question, I'd go ahead and create categories of the form 'Category:Cookbook/Meat recipes', etc. I guess it's probably worth including them all as subcategories of 'Category:Cookbook'. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; Check out [[#The movies example|The movies example]] to see if we are even talking about the same thing. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:35, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== Test Wiki ==

You can find a test wiki here.

http://test.leuksman.com/index.php/Main_Page

It's running MediaWiki 1.5, indeed was running it long before any other project. So that's basically one BIG sandbox to make use of.

There, one problem solved already! :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:54, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: Cool. If that site can be guaranteed to remain up 24/7, that's exactly what we need. If we can get the DNS name sandbox.wikimedia.org to point to the same IP address, and co-ordinate with the developers to ensure that this site always contains the latest bleeding-edge release of MediaWiki, we can get some free beta-testers, while minimizing site damage. We also need to make sure all WikiMedia sites include this link. This could prove more difficult, since there are hundreds of them. I'm beginning to think [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]] was right, and that I should move all this stuff to meta.wikimedia.org. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:37, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

== The movies example ==

See: [[#The dangers of hierarchies|The dangers of hierarchies]]

Talk moved from that section:

In your example here for movies, my current view of things would be to make the movie pages distinct from any hierarchical page naming except for the top-level namespace (e.g. Movies:The Blob), then have your structural book pages as necessary (e.g. Movies/Horror and Movies/Sci-Fi), have appropriate categories (e.g. Category:Movies:Horror and Category:Movies:Sci-Fi), include Movies:The_Blob in both these categories and link to the category listings from the structural pages. This is not without its problems -- say if you wanted extended descriptions of the movies on the listings page, or you wanted to have more defined categories.

: I agree with &quot;Movies:The Blob&quot;, but I might prefer &quot;Movies/The Blob&quot; to get the auto-link. The use of categories is obviously correct for this example, although I would've chosen the names &quot;Category:Horror movies&quot; and &quot;Category:Sci-Fi movies&quot;, and added them both to the category &quot;Category:Movies&quot;. But I don't understand why you need the pages &quot;Movies/Horror&quot; and &quot;Movies/Sci-Fi&quot;.  - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

::In the current paradigm you'd want &quot;Movies/Horror&quot; or &quot;Movies/Sci-Fi&quot; as detailed descriptions of the genre, but you'd have &quot;Category:Horror movies&quot; to actually catalog all of the horror movies. In reality, you could put your detailed description on the catagory page, but that doesn't seem to be current practice. I'm actually inclined in some instances in the cookbook to make the category pages more like these &quot;normal&quot; pages, especially where on the pages there are listings of recipes [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine]] for an example. If the &quot;Vegan cuisine&quot; page was actually a category page, you'd automagically get the listing of recipes and subcategories below. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:50, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::I'd be inclined to agree with your idea of adding more detail to the category pages, rather than creating new pages for the detail. I'm sure this was how they were intended to be used, since otherwise, I wouldn't see the point of the software forcing you to create the category page solely to list the entries in that category. It subsequently occurred to me that if category pages can be used in this way, and also have the benefits of subsetting, why would you ever need a regular (non-category) page? A regular page strikes me as being a category page that you can't add subcategories to. I also wonder as to the reasoning behind having a separate template namespace, although it may be purely for performance reasons (i.e. changing a template page forces the software to flush its cache for all pages which include that template). - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::::&quot;changing a template page forces the software to flush its cache for all pages which include that template&quot; is '''not''' true in the case of categories. You must do a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing#Dummy_edit null edit] on each page which includes the template in order to flush the cache. See the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Template#A_category_tag_in_a_template.3B_caching_problem meta help page] for more info. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 08:57, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

You may want a movie to be in Category:Movies:1980s and Category:Movies:Horror, but as far as I know, there's no category intersection pages... /ramble [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 18:02, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: This may be the point of confusion between us, since as far as I was aware, there is such a feature, and its unique to categories. As well as adding a category tag to a regular page, you can also add the tag to a category page. In this case, the category for the page you added the tag to, is considered to be a sub-category of the category name specified in the tag. When you subsequently click on the super-category, it will list not only the pages in the category, but also all it's subcategories. If you were unaware of this, it was the reason I gave for why category names should not imply hierarchy. See [[:Category:Science]] for an example. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I mean something different. 
::First, some other observations: When you make a category a subcategory of another category (yeesh), you're essentially including all the pages in that category in the supercategory. The pages in the subcategory '''do not''' show up in the pages listing in the supercategory. It is implied that they would also belong there, but there's no way to view all of them at once (so far as I know). This is problematic for, say, recipes, where you might sometimes '''not''' care about the category structure, and you just want to see all the recipes that fall under [[:Category:South American recipes]], for example. The interim solution for us is to add everything to [[:Category:Recipes]] to create a big index. This is getting unweildy though, so I think I might move them all into [[:Category:Recipe]] and leave the subcategories under [[:Category:Recipes]].
::What I was specifically referring to above is that if I have two distinct categories which have pages in common, there is no way to filter my view so that I see only the recipes that belong to both. This comes into play in the cookbook where we have [[:Category:Soups]] and [[:Category:Vegan recipes]]. There is currently a [[:Category:Vegan soups]], but this seems wrong to me. The correct way would be to file the recipe under both &quot;Soups&quot; and &quot;Vegan recipes&quot; and then get a view which is limited to things in both of these categories instead of replicating all of the possible food types (Soups, Desserts, Mains, Peruvian recipes, etc) with &quot;Vegan&quot; prefixed to them. I realize that &quot;Vegan soups&quot; can be categorized under both &quot;Vegan recipes&quot; and &quot;Soups&quot; but that still strikes me as redundant work. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:03, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Ahh. I see. Perhaps substituting the word 'category' for the word 'set' might make things clearer (i.e. formal set theory). Thus you can have a set of soups and a set of vegan recipes, but there no way to automatically generate an intersection of the two sets (i.e. the set of all vegan soups). In addition, you can have a set of meat recipes and a set of fish recipes, but you can't generate a union of the two sets (i.e. the set of all meat or fish recipes, probably equivalent to the set of all non-vegitarian recipes). Furthermore, the elements of a subset are not shown in a superset, which might be considered more 'correct' in set theory.

:::This would no doubt require a software change, and a new syntax for creating unions/intersections, and perhaps an option to show entries in all subcategories. Sounds like a neat idea, and might be worth suggesting to the dev team, although I suspect you probably know better than I how to do this. I'm beginning to think I'd be better off joining the dev team, and fixing things in there, rather than creating extensive documents to workaround these issues.

:::Regardless, I still don't think that implying hierarchy in categories by their name is a good idea, since it conceptually duplicates the behavior of subcategories. The original Pokemon example is perhaps a special case, since it deals with a fictional universe. I see that more as 'scoping' to prevent namespace collisions, rather than 'hierarchy', although they can be argued to be conceptually equivalent. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::::Agreed in most instances. The main thing I am concerned about is whether the categories should be scoped to the book or not. I tend to think that they should, but that the books should be categorized (mentioned this before). A potential problem with this approach is that at some point someone may wish to categorize related chapters in different books, but I think this is a rather minimal downside for having a clean category space. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 08:57, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

== Be bold ==

Having said what you said in your critique, why don't you be bold and try to fix some of these problems that are plaguing Wikibooks? [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: The point of writing the document was to mostly to serve as justification for any subsequent changes I make, so that when my actions get questioned (as they no doubt will), I don't have to tediously explain the same point to several different users, but rather give a link to the document. Futher, as I stated in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], I was going to make some changes, but it would be fair to consult other Wikibookians before doing so, which I'm hoping this talk page will become. It just seemed logical to keep a record of my train of thought, to make it easier for other users to identify any flaws in my reasoning.

: The fundamental problem I have identified is that the current policy documents are numerous, invisible, vague and self-contradictory. That is why people keep discussing their meaning so much. In order to solve the problems, I figured the best procedure would be:

# Identify the problems with policy
# Identify the causes of the problems
# Solve the problems, by eliminating the cause where possible
# Devise new policy to implement the solutions in a practical fashion
# Make sure people agree with the new policy, to prevent my edits getting reverted
# Update the policy documents to prevent future misunderstanding
# Make sure the policy is more visible to new users, especially those creating new books
# Retroactively apply new policy to existing books

: There seems little point in performing the final step as long as the policy is unclear. New books are being created all the time, and I just don't have time to fix them all. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

:: So far, the only policies actively enforced are [[WB:WIN]] (the constitution if you will), [[WB:FP]], and [[WB:AT]], although there is an increasing amount of [[WB:NC]] enformcement.  Other policies are pretty much common to all MW wikis (deletion, editing, etc). [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:39, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

::: Aha. I think I've found one of the sources of confusion. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_Wikibooks_is_not&amp;diff=129510&amp;oldid=129062 this diff], made by yourself. You completely changed the meaning of the document, by changing the more specific term &quot;primary research&quot; (adequately defined), with the incredibly vague term &quot;original research&quot;. Its new definition arguably covers every existing book on the site. This needs to be fixed. WB:FP is common sense, especially for software-engineering people link myself, but needs to remain, and ought to tightened up (especially forking from Wikipedia). WB:AT should probably be merged into WB:WIN. WB:NC is a bit more fuzzy at the moment, especially as it starts with a link to WB:HNS. WB:WIN is a bad idea for a 'constitution' anyway. It's much more effective to define what something is, rather than define what it is not. I'm thinking of something more akin to [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The goal of Wikibooks]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 08:16, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: Perhaps the diff you have shown introduces ambiguity, but the current version of [[WB:WIN]] does not have it (thanks for [[User:Dovi]] who pointed it out in the talk page).  It should still reflect the spirit of what it is meant.

:::: Most of the policies are fuzzy because they are not well fleshed out (or in dire need of enforcement).  Historically, I believe [[WB:AT]] is separate due to this being an agreed-upon policy between Wikibooks and Wikisource.  I will be the first to admit that perhaps [[WB:WIN]] is a &quot;bad idea&quot;, but we need a series of pages that will define what Wikibooks is (of course, I will ask you to contribute in a big manner, seeing you have your ideas and seem to be willing to implement them).
::::* [[Wikibooks:Books]] for what consitutes book material.
::::* [[Wikibooks:Instructional material]] for what constitutes instructional material.  The two together will define what is a proper Wikibook.
::::* [[Wikibooks:Bookshelf]] and [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Librarian]] (&quot;the first Wikibooks WikiProject&quot;) for how Wikibooks defines a bookshelf and how users can contribute to stocking these shelves with new books as they are created.

:::: Of course, with radical changes to Wikibooks as we know it, we may have to relent on existing policies and introduce.  I admit that I can be considered &quot;old guard&quot; as these changes may change the mission of Wikibooks, but if the public likes the wiki to go that way, they may force our hand.  Among these we would need:
::::* [[Wikibooks:Reference material]] for what constitutes general nonfiction books (as opposed to, say, Wikipedia articles or books of a nonfictional material).  This would form the third part of defining what appropriate Wikibooks should be.

:::: [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

We could sure use someone to enforce [[WB:NC]] to [[General Chemistry]] or determine through [[WB:FP]] what parts of [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] to keep in a merged book (both long debacles that has existed since well before I was a user, let alone an admin). [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: I was aware of these problems, and they do need to be addressed, but the problem will only get worse as new users create more pages making the same errors. I already made to effort to apply the new naming conventions to the [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] guide, as well as all the other tidying up required to cope with the changes, and it can take a long time. Feel free to 'be bold' yourself if you want these other books changed more speedily, but I would probably first devise a scripting system for a bot to make these changes. Probably only needs 50 lines of perl (not that I recommend perl, but it is well known). - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: To be fair, that template stuff was probably a mistake. It's no worse than it was before, but it's only marginally better. Since most of the policies here have been (inappropriately) forked from Wikipedia, I figured I'd copy Wikipedia's current system for policy, hoping it might make a difference. I was wrong. Problem is there are far too many policy documents, they are not always clearly identified as such, and no-one has actually read them all. I feel a massive merge and delete operation coming along soon.

: First of all, a sincere thankyou for your extensive, and well thought out contribution.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

In the same vein, Wikibooks may have to do exactly this as well.  We know the founding principles of what got Wikibooks going, and I don't want to betray that at all.  At the same time, this is not Wikipedia, and there needs to be a way to &quot;declare independence&quot; from Wikipedia and its policies as well.  We are still under the umbrella of the Wikimedia Foundation, but it is only the Wikimedia board that we should be obligated to please.

Furthermore, there has been a couple of years of hard won experience here at Wikibooks.  What has worked, what hasn't, and where should we go?  In this regard you are doing us all a big favor Aya, by taking this issue by the horns and trying to make something of this work.  The #1 issue that I would see, however, is that something of this scope needs to include more than just en.wikibooks.  We need to get the other languages involved in setting general broad policies governing Wikibooks and its relationship to the other Wikimedia sister projects.

I've long complained (for a couple of months or so, I guess) that Wikibooks has become the dumping ground for projects that the other sister projects don't want to deal with.  The 1911 Encyclopedia is a classic example of this, and was (unfortunately) suggested by one of the participants on Meta.  By establishing firm policies as to what is and is not proper content that can be placed on here, we can clean up Wikibooks and make it a jewel that it can become.

Wikibooks is also at a transition.  New blood is coming into Wikibooks, and there seems to be a slight clash of cultures going on right now.  As for myself, I would not have been involved with Wikimedia projects if it weren't for Wikibooks.  I looked at Wikipedia several years ago (more than one), and even poked around at the content, but never felt compelled to get involved.  After reading several Wikipedia entries from Slashdot, and an article about Wikibooks, I finally had a book idea that was digging into me and I had to write.  [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] is the result of that initial effort (and I'm not done). - [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

: Seems as if you've pretty much come to the same conclusions as I. I had taken a slight break from writing this document, while I did some research on other Wikimedia projects, to see how they deal with these problems. During this time I discovered extreme content overlap with other wikis, and have tried to address these by creating [[m:Directory]] as an authoritative index of Wikimedia projects, languages, wikis, and appropriate content. As for authoritative policies, I've made a start on [[m:Policy]]; the idea being to move all policy, and debate thereof, from each individual project, to Meta. I feel as if this was the intended purpose for Meta anyway (read [[m:Meta:About]]). In effect, this would mean that most pages in the 'project namepace' (e.g. the Wikipedia namespace on the Wikipedia project) ought to be moved to Meta.

: The main problem I am now facing is the classic 'tradition' vs. 'evolution' conflict. (e.g. [[w:Wikipedia talk:Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense#Votes for Transwiki]]). It seems people would rather carry on in the current tradition of chaotic scope and policy, rather than allowing it to evolve into something more meaningful and well-defined; the reason being that for convenience, long-term users would prefer things to stay the same, whereas new users would prefer the content to be in more obvious locations. In this particular case, perhaps the correct thing to do would have been to just ignore what other people think, be bold, and just do it, but I have a feeling my changes would be reverted, and it would thus be a waste of my time.

: The other problem is that Meta is a complete mess. There are too many pages which are out-of-date, and too many on the same subject which contradict each other. I'm beginning to think Meta needs to be redesigned from the ground up, but I don't think it's something I can get done by myself. I'm still pondering various ideas, but in the interim, I'd be grateful for any suggestions you might have on the subject. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

Carry on, Aya.  I'll try to make some comments about some specific points you have raised later.  - [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

: That would also be appreciated. I stick by the idea that even where pages should contain all users POVs, it should retain a single editor (preferably one who is well-versed in the finer points of language) to ensure it has a meaningful structure, and maintains consistent language use throughout. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

'''Low-carb diet''' is a general term referring to numerous specific diets which advocate for a reduction of [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] intake, as a healthier balance of foods. The concept is based in the fact that [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|grain]]-based foods cause the body to store the fat it consumes, rather than to burn it for fuel. Low-carb diets, in various prescriptions, favor &quot;complex carbs&quot; (vegetables) over &quot;simple carbs,&quot; (grains and starches), while also reducing the consumption of saturated fat in favor of [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|unsaturated fat]].

The [[Cookbook:Atkins Diet Cooking|Atkins Diet]] is the most well-known and heavily marketed low-carb diet, though its specified prescriptions for regimented protein intake are controversial. The [[w:South Beach diet|South Beach diet]] is also well known, though more generalized. The [[Cookbook:Zone diet|Zone diet]] is controversial because it prescribes a balance between carbs, fat, and protein according to a &quot;40:30:30&quot; ratio. 

It's important to note that both the Atkins and Zone diets are controversial, due to the specific claims or prescriptions they make. Further, both are business trade names for diets, and are considered proprietary and licensed franchises (though to a different degree). However, the basic general principles of low-carb dieting are not intellectual property, and likewise the general ideas about proportions and balance in these specific diets are free to examine and learn from.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{IPA notice}}

Portuguese alphabet, like in other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] has a natural evolution from Latin and so it is not strictly phonetic and has some features inherited from its history. Although, compared to English or even French it is easy to read and not so hard to write. 

==Letters==

The sounds are better explained in the next chapters.

Glossary:
* '''Coda''': the sounds in a syllable after the vowel, for example '''t''' in spi'''t''';
* '''Onset''': the sounds in a syllable before the vowel, for example '''sp''' in '''sp'''it;
* '''Nucleus''': the vowel of a syllable;
* '''Glide''': the sounds /j/ and /w/;
* '''Stressed''': (of a syllable) which is pronounced more emphatically, for example com'''poun'''ding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''fraction''' is most easily thought of as representing some ''portion'' of a unit.

The simplest fractions to think about are numbers like &quot;one half&quot; or &quot;one tenth.&quot; For example, ''one third'' is the number you get when you divide ''one'' into three equal parts and take one of them.

We write ''one third'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every fraction looks like that, having an integer on top, which we call the '''numerator''', and an integer on the bottom, which we call the '''denominator'''. This ''fractional notation'' represents the number that we get when we divide the numerator by the denominator. In our simple examples we had a numerator of 1.

So, what do we mean by the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;?

When we read this in English, we say &quot;two thirds.&quot;  That sounds like we have &quot;two&quot; of something, namely two &quot;thirds&quot; or two of: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, which we naturally think of as &lt;math&gt;2 * \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.  But in our more technical definition of a fraction we said it was a number we get by dividing a pair of integers, so that &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;2\div3&lt;/math&gt;.

Well fortunately for our intuitions, it will turn out that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thinking about a fraction as some portion of a unit works nicely so long as the numerator is less than the denominator.  But what do we mean by &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt;?  Well, intuitively, we think of having four of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, which, thinking about huge slices of cake, must surely be equal to &lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. And, sure enough, if you do the division of 4 by 3 you'll end up with 1.33333..., which is 1 + 0.3333... or &lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Fractions can represent whole numbers, too.  Nothing but our boring desire for simplicity and clarity keeps us from writing 12 as &lt;math&gt;\frac{120}{10}&lt;/math&gt; whenever we like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Division can thought of a reverse multiplication of sorts, where you find how many numbers go into another numnber. 

Division is usually in the format:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; (two divided by four) OR
&lt;math&gt;2/4=x&lt;/math&gt;

For an example:

We want to find out what 100 '''divides by'''. We start with 1. 
We know that &lt;math&gt;1*100=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 1.

And we find that &lt;math&gt;2*50=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 2.

But &lt;math&gt;3*33.33=99.99&lt;/math&gt; So 3 isn't. We can't divide 100 by 3 to get a straight answer.

So we go onto 4. &lt;math&gt;4*25=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 4. 

And so on for each number. But this format takes too long, so we go:

&lt;math&gt;100/4=25&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a right angled triangle, Sine is the opposite side of the angle needed divided by hypotenuse; so:
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\frac{o}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
An equation with Sine would be the following, when the opposite is equal to 5 and the hypotenuse is equal to 10:
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta = \frac{o}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
= 
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta\ = \frac{5}{10} = .47942&lt;/math&gt; 


Sine is usually used for triangle with the angle in the corner of lower point of the hypotenuse.

Sine can also be reversed, to find out the length of the sides when you have the angle already.

This can be used by going &lt;math&gt;\sin ^-x =\frac{2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;, where x is the angle you have, and h is the side you want to get.

Why merge this almost empty article? Shouldn't it better just be removed?

:This was part of an edit conflict, but in general the philosophy is that this is to become a reference manual, while the Serial Programming Wikibooks is more of a step-by-step textbook.  There is an important distinction between the two, and the textbook is much harder to write, to be honest.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

I love Science Fiction, especially Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clark. 
I enjoy programming in several languages, such as C++ and python for applications, XHTML, XML, CSS and PHP for web development and lisp and C for some nostalgia.

I am constantly adding to my already impressive hardware dungeon type room with more computers and geek items.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cosine in trigonometry is the adjacent divided hypotenuse, in the form of 
&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta=\frac{a}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
An equation with Cosine would be the following when the adjacent is equal to 5 and the hypotenuse is equal to 10:
&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \frac{a}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
= 
&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta\ = \frac{5}{10} = .877562&lt;/math&gt; 


Cosine is usually used for triangle with the angle in the corner of lower point of the hypotenuse.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia]] 

'''Damper''' is Australian bushman's bread, made while camping or &quot;waltzing matilda&quot; (carrying a swag around looking for work). It is meant to be made outside by a campfire.

==Ingredients==

* 1 large cup [[cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]]
* generous pinch of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[cookbook:water|water]] [[Image:Mustering camp.jpg|250px|thumb|Damper and camp oven used, Walcha, NSW]]

==Procedure==
# Add salt to flour.
# Add scant 1/4 cup water (more and it will be as tough as an old boot).
# [[cookbook:Mix|Mix]] and form into a round loaf.
# Dig a foot-deep hole near a fire and add 2 shovels of hot coals and ash. 
# Add damper mixture to a greased [[cookbook:Dutch Oven|camp oven]] (traditional cast iron round pot with lid).
# Cook for maximum of 40 minutes. If undercooked it will be flat and rubbery.
# Your first try may be inedible. Keep trying, you'll soon be an expert.

==Variations==
* This cookbook also has a [[Cookbook:Drover's Damper|Drover's damper]] recipe.
* You can do this in a barbecue grill with mixture in greased metal foil as well. During cooking, damper increases volume by 1/3 to 1/2, so allow room for expansion.
* If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to  greased oven tray and cook in a moderate oven for 30 - 40 minutes.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australian Cuisine]] 

'''Drover's Damper''' is Australian bread, made by stockmen while taking care of or rounding up stock. It is meant to be made outside by a campfire. This is the &quot;flash&quot; version, made when butter and milk is available.

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups [[cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 2 teaspoons [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 cup [[cookbook:milk|milk]] [[Image:Mustering camp.jpg|250px|thumb|Damper and camp oven used, Walcha, NSW]]

==Procedure==

# Add salt to flour
# Add sugar
# Rub in butter.
# [[cookbook:Mix|Mix]] in milk to make a medium-soft dough.
# [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] lightly on flat surface until smooth.
# Pat into a round shape.
# Place damper mixture on coals or hot ash.
# Cook for maximum of 40 minutes.  
# Discard burnt outside and eat the inside.
# Serve with [[cookbook:butter|butter]], ([[cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]]) or [[cookbook:jam|jam]].

==Variations==
* This cookbook also has an [[Cookbook:Damper|&quot;ordinary&quot; damper]] recipe.
* You can do this using a hole near the fire in a greased [[cookbook:dutch oven|camp oven]] or greased [[cookbook:aluminium foil|aluminium foil]] in a barbecue.
* If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to greased bread tin, [[cookbook:glaze|glaze]] with [[cookbook:milk|milk]] and cook in a hot oven, reducing heat until cooked (20 minutes).
* You can add dried [[cookbook:fruit|fruit]] - then it's &quot;[[cookbook:Johnny Cake|Johnny Cake]]&quot;.
* As a variation, add grated [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]].
* Use [[cookbook:beer|beer]] instead of milk for &quot;Beer Damper&quot;.

    1.  General considerations 
        a.  Evaluation of patients for interventional  proceduresrequires a knowledge  of appropriate  indications and contraindications, objectives, alternatives,  and possible  complications.  Coordination with the  referring physician is essential to ensure appropriate  patient selection and, for biopsy, appropriate approach.

Often, your script will need to get information from the user, such as parameter settings, before performing its action. You can do this in two different ways: either present a modal popup that the user has to deal with before doing anything else, or alternatively you can take over the entire Scripts Window with a custom display that the user can freely switch to and from while doing other things.

==A Modal GUI==
The simplest way to add a GUI to your script is to pop up a simple menu with some items to choose from. Let’s add an option to our Tetrahedron Maker script to generate the tetrahedron upside-down. Displaying a menu is as simple as calling &lt;TT&gt;Blender.Draw.PupMenu&lt;/TT&gt; and passing it a string containing the menu items separated by “|” characters. Put a “%t” at the end of the item that defines the menu title:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Orient = Blender.Draw.PupMenu(&quot;Add Tetrahedron%t|Right Way Up|Upside Down&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
The value returned from the call will be the index of the selected menu item (starting from 1, ignoring the menu title), or -1 to indicate that no selection was made.

When you execute the above line, it displays this:
[[File:Blender249PopupMenuExample.png|center]]

We will use the menu selection to negate a scale factor which will be applied to the Z coordinate of the vertices of the tetrahedron. But only the last vertex has a nonzero Z coordinate, so this is the only one that needs a change in its computation. So the body of our script now looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Orient = Blender.Draw.PupMenu(&quot;Add Tetrahedron%t|Right Way Up|Upside Down&quot;)
if Orient &gt; 0 :
    Scale = -1 if Orient &gt; 1 else 1
    NewMesh = Blender.Mesh.New(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
    NewMesh.verts.extend \
      (
        [
            (0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0),
            (0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
            (-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
            (0, 0, Scale * math.sqrt(2 / 3)),
        ]
      )
    NewMesh.faces.extend \
      (
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
      )
    TheObj = Blender.Object.New(&quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
    TheObj.link(NewMesh)
    TheScene = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
    TheScene.link(TheObj)
    TheScene.update()
    Blender.Window.Redraw()
#end if
&lt;/source&gt;

==A Modeless GUI==

It is very easy to create a GUI for your script, and that way make it easy to change aspects of it for everyone.

The command to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is:

&lt;pre&gt;Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)&lt;/pre&gt;

This command registers the functions:
* draw - to draw the GUI
* event - to action mouse and key presses
* button - to action GUI button presses

'''However, this command will NOT work by itself !!!'''. You first need to define these 3 functions.


First we will import Blender's library of built in functions:
&lt;pre&gt;import Blender&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the draw function'''.
&lt;pre&gt;def draw():&lt;/pre&gt;
Inside this function we will draw the GUI.  Here is an example of a drawing function we can use.  It will clear the current window.
&lt;pre&gt;	Blender.BGL.glClear(Blender.BGL.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)&lt;/pre&gt;
And the next command will draw a button.  Note that the first number in the command, '1' identifies the button as '''button 1'''.  We will refer to this button later.
&lt;pre&gt;	Blender.Draw.Toggle(&quot;Clear origin&quot;,1,10,20,100,20,0,&quot;Tooltip&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the event function'''.  The code of a key pressed on the keyboard is passed into the function as the variable '''evt'''.
&lt;pre&gt;def event(evt,val):&lt;/pre&gt;
Now we will test to see if the escape key is pressed:
&lt;pre&gt;	if evt == Blender.Draw.ESCKEY:&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is pressed, exit the script, and return from the function:
&lt;pre&gt;		Blender.Draw.Exit()
		return &lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the button function'''.  This function will perform an action if the button is pressed.
&lt;pre&gt;def button(evt):&lt;/pre&gt;
Now test the variable '''evt''' which holds the button number that we previously identified.
&lt;pre&gt;	if evt == 1:&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is pressed, we will move the selected object in the 3d window back to the centre and redraw the screen:
&lt;pre&gt;		Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)
		Blender.Window.Redraw()&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Lastly, we can create the Graphical User Interface''' by typing the command:

&lt;pre&gt;Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)&lt;/pre&gt;


That's it !!! To enter the script yourself, type the following into the Text Editor window in Blender, and then press '''alt p''' to execute the script.  Here's the entire script.  Everything after the hash # is a comment and can be left out.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import Blender  # This will import the library of blender functions we will use

def draw():     # Define the draw function (which draws your GUI).
	Blender.BGL.glClear(Blender.BGL.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) # This clears the window
        # Add here drawing commands to draw your GUI, for example:
	Blender.Draw.Toggle(&quot;Clear origin&quot;,1,10,20,100,20,0,&quot;Tooltip&quot;)
	# The line above will draw a toggle button.
	# Note the first number, '1' means this is button number 1
	
def event(evt,val):  # Define mouse and keyboard press events
	if evt == Blender.Draw.ESCKEY: # Example if esc key pressed
		Blender.Draw.Exit()    # then exit script
		return                 # return from the function

def button(evt):     # Define what to do if a button is pressed, for example:
	if evt == 1: # If button '1' is pressed, set active object to centre:
		Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)
		Blender.Window.Redraw() # This will redraw the 3d window.

# You can now run the Graphical User Interface by typing the command:

Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)

# End of script&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Noob Note: When I tried to run that script it came up with an error: Attribute Error: 'Scene' object has no attribute 'getActiveObject'. I changed &quot;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)&quot; to &quot;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()&lt;b&gt;.objects.active&lt;/b&gt;.loc = (0,0,0)&quot; and it worked.

A changed kbcheck that will check all connected keyboards and will sort out some invalid devices that appear to be keyboards.

It should be noted that this script will stop and return on the first keyboard that has a key that is pressed. Perhaps this could be modified so that the sum of all checked keyboards is returned and so if you are pressing a key on one keyboard you can also be pressing another key on another keyboard and get both responses.

&lt;pre&gt;
function [keyIsDown,secs, keyCode] = KbCheck(deviceNumber)
% [keyIsDown,secs,keyCode] = KbCheck([deviceNumber])
%
% Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and
% keyboard scan code (keyCode).
%
%    keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as &lt;shift&gt;,
%                   &lt;control&gt; or &lt;caps lock&gt; is down. 0 otherwise.
%
%    secs           time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
%
%    keyCode        Mac: a 128-element logical array.  Each bit within the
%                   logical array represents one keyboard key. If a key is
%                   pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit is clear. To
%                   convert a keyCode to a vector of key numbers use
%                   FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber use KbName
%                   or KbDemo.
%
%                   Win: a 256-element array. It seems that the first
%                   128 elements correspond to the
%                   ascii sequence of the characters, and may be consistent
%                   with the Mac key codes.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
% meta keys: &lt;caps lock&gt;, &lt;shift&gt;, &lt;command&gt;, &lt;control&gt;, and &lt;option&gt;. The
% only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
% computer.
%
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
% KbCheck will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
% return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
% first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by

% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% KbCheck uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
% reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
%
% OS 9: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Command-Period causes an immediate exit.
%
% The Mac OS Event Manager detects and queues typed characters in the
% background. GetChar will return any characters typed before the  call to
% GetChar. FlushEvents can be used to clear the character event  buffer
% read by GetChar. Unlike GetChar, KbCheck only reports keys  depressed at
% the moment KbCheck is called.  FlushEvents has no effect  on KbCheck.
%
% Hitting CapsLock makes KbCheck and KbWait think that you're holding the
% shift key down. They will continue to think so (returning 1) until you
% release the shift by hitting CapsLock again.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait detect that a key is down by using the low-level Mac
% OS call GetKeys. It's not clear what temporal accuracy this provides, but
% it's much better than going through the higher-level Event Manager. Our
% impression from reading the documentation in Dan Costin's KeMo package
% web http://psychtoolbox.org/kemo.html
% &lt;ftp://ftp.stolaf.edu/pub/macpsych/KemMo_1.5.sit.hqx&gt; is that this
% low-level call still has uncertainty on the order of 11 ms because of the
% way the Mac OS polls ADB devices. Someone clever could probably use his
% advice to develop MEX files that timed keypresses more  accurately than
% KbCheck does.

% TO DO:
%
%  - Mention that on USB systems there the USB bus is sampled at 100hz

      </contributor>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is how I installed SugarCRM on a new PC:

* Download the four Fedora Core 4 image files and make install CD’s
* Install Fedora Core 4 using the standard “Workstation” settings ( don’t use the Server setup as it will put all the Apache, PHP, and MySQL files in the wrong place.  Enable Firewall, Enable SELinux, Install Default Software Packages )
* Finish Installing, Reboot, Login as ‘root’
* After booting, click Desktop -&gt; Security -&gt; Security Level ( if using Gnome GUI ), check the box next to WWW (HTTP), click OK to close.
* Launch WEB browser
* From http://www.mysql.com/ download the v4.1.12 MySQL Linux x86 RPM Files, you will need the Server, Client Program, Libraries &amp; Headers, and Dynamic Client Libraries.
* From http://www.php.net/ download PHP 4.3.11 (tar.gz)
* From http://www.apache.org/ download Apache 2.0.54 (tar.gz)
* Copy downloaded files to /usr/src directory
* Open a terminal window,  Applications -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Terminal
* Type the following in the terminal to install MySQL
 #cd /usr/src
 #rpm -i MySQL* 		( don’t worry if MySQL fails to start )
 #mysql_install_db
 #mysqld_safe &amp;
 &lt; hit enter again &gt;

* Now set the root password for MySQL
 #mysqladmin –u root password ‘enter-new-root-password-in-single-quotes’

* Now check to see if install was successful
 #mysqlshow –p
 Enter Password:

You should see something like:

 Databases
 ---------
 mysql
 test

* Now we need to set the ‘root’ password to the old password format and delete the blank user that was created automatically when MySQL was installed.
 #mysql –u root –p
 Enter Password:
 mysql&gt;SET PASSWORD FOR ‘root’@’localhost’=OLD_PASSWORD(‘New-Password’);
 mysql&gt;use mysql
 mysql&gt;delete from user where User=’’;
 mysql&gt;quit

* Now MySQL is installed and we need to install Apache and PHP. Type:
 #gzip –d httpd-2.0.54.tar.gz
 #tar xvf httpd-2.0.54.tar
 #gunzip php-4.3.11.tar.gz
 #tar -xvf php-4.3.11.tar
 #cd httpd-2.0.54
 #./configure --enable-so
 #make
 #make install
 #cd ../php-4.3.11
 #./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \        (hit enter key)
  --with-mysql-sock=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
 #make
 #make install

* Now copy the php.ini file to the correct place
 #cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini

* Edit the php.ini file
Search for: memory_limit = 8M,   change 8M to 16M
Save &amp; Close file

* Look for libphp4.so file in /usr/local/apache2/modules/ to make sure it’s there.
* Edit the Apache configuration file in /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

Find '''loadmodule''' and make sure this line was added, ( or add )

 LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so

Find '''addtype''' and add 

 AddType application/x-tar.tgz
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
 AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

Find '''directoryindex''' and add '''index.php''' to the line:

 DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.html.var

* launch apache by typing in the terminal
 #/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

If you get the following error: “ Cannot load /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so into server: /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so : cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission Denied”  
Type:
 #chcon –t shlib_t /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so

now try and start:
 #/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

* Test Apache by opening a web browser and typing in http://localhost/ . You should see an apache success screen.
* Test PHP
Create a file in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ named test.php and enter the following line in the file:

 &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;

Save and close.
Set permissions on file to 755.
Now in a browser type http://localhost/test.php You should see a PHP information screen with your current settings.

* Edit MySQL’s my.cnf file
Edit or create the /etc/my.cnf file, make it look like the following:

 [mysqld]
 #use old password encryption method ( needed for 4.0 and older clients ).
 old-passwords
 basedir=/var/lib/mysql

Save and close file.

* Edit the MySQL startup file /etc/init.d/mysql

Find: '''basedir=/''' and change to:
 basedir=/var/lib/mysql

* restart MySQL by going clicking Desktop -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Server Settings -&gt; Services
select mysql, click restart

* create '''sugarsuite''' folder in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
* copy the contents of the SugarCRM 3.0.1 folder ( or latest ) to the sugarsuite folder
* Set permissions on all files to 777 for installation. Type in a terminal :
 #chmod -R 777 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite

** alternate instructions that worked great for me...
**
 #cd ..  [now in htdocs folder]
 #chown -R apache sugarsuite    [change file owner to the apache webserver]
 #cd sugarsuite   [back to sugar webroot]
 #chmod -R 775 cache custom data modules
** alternately #chmod -R 775 ./cache/ ./custom/ ./data/ ./modules/
 #chmod 664 config.php
**

* To install SugarCRM, open a browser and type http://localhost/sugarsuite/ 
* Follow install instruction: Create User, Create Datbase. Finish Installation.
* Set SugarCRM directory permissions in terminal window.
 #chmod -R 755 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite
 #cd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite
 #chmod -R 777 ./cache/ &lt; does not work!
 #chmod -R 777 ./custom/
 #chmod -R 777 ./data/
 #chmod -R 777 ./modules/
 #chmod -R 444 config.php

* Sugar install is finished!

* Now let’s add apache to the startup process. First. Let’s copy the apache startup file to the startup directory. Type in the terminal:
 #cp /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl /etc/init.d/

* Edit the /etc/init.d/apachectl file: Add the lines in bold.

 #1/bin/sh
 #
 '''#chkconfig: - 85 15'''
 '''#description: Apache is a Web server to serve HTML files and CGI.'''
 #
 #copyright (c) 2000-2004 The Apache Software Foundation

* To enable httpd to start automatically. Type in a terminal:
 #/sbin/chkconfig --add apachectl

* Reboot server to see if everything starts up and works!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

The osteochondroses are a motley group of entities that were initially lumped together due to morphological similarity.  They often occur in children are associated with apparent fragmentation of bone in an epiphysis or apophysis.  With the perspective of time, we can now divide these entities into one of three rough groups: post-traumatic, osteonecrosis and normal variants of ossification.

== Kienböck's Disease ==

'''Definition:''' Avascular necrosis of the [[Wikipedia:lunate|lunate]] bone, one of the bones in the most proximal [[Wikipedia:carpal|carpal]] row.  It is also known as lunatomalacia.

Etiology: Idiopathic or secondary to repetitive trauma. Has been associated in the past past with negative ulnar variance, however this has been recently questioned.  The condition was first described in 1910 by a Viennese radiologist, Dr. Robert Kienböck.

'''Clinical Findings:'''

Many people with Kienböck’s disease believe they have a sprained wrist at first, usually after some form of trauma to the wrist, such as a fall. This type of trauma can disrupt the blood flow to the lunate. In most people, two vessels supply blood to the lunate, but in some people there is only one source. This puts them at greater risk for developing the disease. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms are noted, including:

* A painful and sometimes swollen wrist
* Limited range of motion in the affected wrist (stiffness)
* Decreased grip strength in the hand
* Tenderness directly over the bone (on the top of the hand at about the middle of the wrist)
* Pain or difficulty in turning the hand upward

'''Stages of Disease:'''

Kienböck’s disease follows a specific progressive pattern through four stages.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;width:180px;&quot;|Stage 1: 
|style=&quot;width:1000px;&quot;| Symptoms similar to those of a wrist sprain. X-rays may be normal or show a line indicating a possible fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be helpful in making the diagnosis in this early stage.
|-
|Stage 2: 
|Radiographs may demonstrate lunate sclerosis. Either an MRI or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be used to assess the condition of the bone. Recurrent pain, swelling and wrist tenderness are common.
|-
|Stage 3: 
|The avascular bone begins to collapse. The surrounding bones may begin to shift position. Patients experience increasing pain, weakness in gripping, and limited motion.
|-
|Stage 4: 
|The surfaces of adjoining bones are affected, resulting in arthritis of the wrist.
|}


'''Treatment:'''

In its early stages, Kienböck’s disease may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are so similar to those of a sprained wrist and radiographic findings are often negative. Splinting or casting the wrist for two to three weeks is often attempted initially, as well as anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen for pain relief.

Surgical options include bone grafting, bone leveling, proximal row carpectomy and eventually fusion procedures, but none are curative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Substitution methods are really applicable anywhere you can find a differential equation.  However, there's very few instances where you will always give a certain substitution.  You generally pick one and plug it in as needed.  So I'll give situations where you could use a substitution method, although you may later learn better methods.

== Parametric equations ==

One time where you may need it is when solving parametric equations.  Lets say we're given functions for velocity in two dimensions-  &lt;math&gt;v_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  If we want to solve for &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;, you have to divide &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_y}{v_x}&lt;/math&gt;.  This works out to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{dv_y}{dx}}{\frac{dv_x}{dx}}=\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.  When you do this, you will frequently (although not always) get a chance to use &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; substitution.

=== Constant velocity ===

Lets say we're swimming across a river with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The river has no current.  We start swimming at an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the shore.  Solve for &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The first thing we need to do is break the velocity into x and y components.  This is fairly simple.

:&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_0cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_0sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Using simple trig, we can remove the theta.

:&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_0\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_0\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we divide the two to find &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{v_0\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}}{v_0\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}}=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Now this is simple to solve separably.  It could also be solved via substituion.  This is a trivial example, but it can be made more complicated.


=== Motion against a current ===

Imagine the same swimmer.  Now there is a current with speed r going straight up the river (positive y direction).  How does this change our example? 

The x component is still the same. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=v_0cos(\theta)=\frac{v_0x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

And in the y direction we also have a term due to the current.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=v_0sin(\theta)+r=\frac{v_0y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}+r&lt;/math&gt;

You can get &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the two equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{v_0x}&lt;/math&gt;

We can move the x into the root to simplify the equation a bit

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{x^2}+\frac{y^2}{x^2}}}{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r}{v_0}\sqrt{1+\frac{y^2}{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


Well, this complicated equation looks like a case for &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; substitution.

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y'=v+v'x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+v'x=v+\frac{r}{v_0}\sqrt{1+v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v'=\frac{r}{xv_0}\sqrt{1+v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

That looks like a nice, easily solved separable equation.  Let solve it.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}=\frac{r}{xv_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}=\int \frac{r}{xv_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The left end is an ugly integral.  Just trust me on it.

:&lt;math&gt;ln(v+\sqrt{1+v^2})=\frac{r}{v_0}ln(x)+C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+\sqrt{1+v^2}=e^{ln(x^{\frac{r}{v_0}})+C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+\sqrt{1+v^2}=Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Lets try to get rid of that root.  Isolate it, and square both sides.

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+v^2}=Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}-v&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1+v^2=Cx^{2\frac{r}{v_0}}-2vCx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}+v^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2vCx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}=C^2x^{2\frac{r}{v_0}}-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}{2}-\frac{1}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in for v, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}{2}-\frac{1}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for y by multiplying through by x

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}+1}}{2}-\frac{x}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{C}{2}x^{\frac{r}{v_0}+1}-\frac{1}{2C}x^{\frac{-r}{v_0}+1}&lt;/math&gt;


This complicated equation does make sense-  the bigger the current, the further you go in the y direction as a portion of the x.

If you ever find an equation this evil in real life, do yourself a favor and buy a computer program to solve it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When you think of the ancient cultures and the beginning of man, one of the first to come to mind are the Ancient Egyptians. Their culture still affects us to this day. You can find references from their religion and culture everywhere, whether it be the movies or the bible. The Egyptian culture has left us with great stories, tales and epics. The Egyptians started a lot of beliefs and traditions that we still practice to this day. They were probably the first civilization that believed in an afterlife, and the first to have any positive belief about it.

This page details some of the factors to take into account when choosing a new or used car.

[[Image:Ford Focus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Ford Focus, a car which scores highly under many criteria.]]

==What type of car do you need?==
Think carefully about what you actually need in a car. Do you need a sedan or would an SUV be sufficient? Will you use a four-wheel drive system? If you're covering long distances, fuel economy will be important. Will it be a statement of your personality?  Will you be using it to pick up your kids? Or do you just need a cheap runabout that goes (skip to the last section)? Read on to find out more.

==Points to consider==
Evaluate these points on a scale of personal preference. In other words, which features are more important for you and which ones matter less?

===Performance===
*What is the volume of the [[w:Internal_combustion_engine|engine]], in liters or cubic inches? How many cylinders does the engine have?
*Note the peak [[w:horsepower|horsepower]] and [[w:torque|torque]] ratings and at what [[w:Revolutions_per_minute|RPM]] the peaks occur. Note the top speed of the car.
*Does the car have a manual or automatic [[w:Transmission_%28mechanics%29|transmission]]? Is it a three-, four-, five- or six-speed? A greater number of gears in the transmission mean greater fuel efficiency at high speeds (due to lower RPMs) and faster acceleration times (due to the engine spending more time near its power peak.) Is it a [[w:Continuously_variable_transmission|continuously-variable transmission]]?
*Does the car come with four-wheel [[w:disc_brake|disc brakes]] or front disc and rear [[w:drum_brake|drum brakes]]?

===Safety===
*What safety equipment does the car have? Note the presence of [[w:crumple_zone|crumple zones]], pre-tensioning [[w:seat_belt|seatbelts]], number and locations of [[w:airbag|airbags]], child safety locks, integrated child seating and so on.
*How well does it score in the [http://www.euroncap.com Euro NCAP] test or the [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ NHTSA] crash tests?
*Does the car possess [[w:Traction_control|traction control]] or a [[w:Vehicle_Stability_Control|stability control]] systems?
*Does the car come with [[w:Anti-lock_braking_system|anti-lock brakes]]?
*If the intended driver is petite, does it have adjustable pedals to place them a safe distance away from the airbag?

===Equipment===
*Is the car well equipped for its price?
*Do you prefer cloth or leather seating surfaces?
*Note the presence of power accessories, such as power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and power seats.
*Does the car come with air conditioning? Is the [[w:climate_control|climate control]] system manual or automatic? Are there dual temperature controls?
*Examine the car's [[w:Car_audio|audio system]]. Note presence of AM/FM radio tuner, cassette deck, and/or CD player or changer. Some audio systems may have a line-in jack for external equipment such as an [[w:Mp3_player|MP3 player]]. How many speakers does the car have? Is there a subwoofer? What is the wattage rating of the audio system?
*Note the presence of other comfort and convenience features that are important to you. Note their cost if they are available as options.

===Quality and aesthetics===
*Does the manufacturer have a reputation for building quality vehicles that are not plagued by malfunctions?
*Do you like the design of the automobile? Is the exterior pleasing to the eye? What about the interior?

===Costs===
*Taking into consideration the car's size, class, and feature packages, is the car's price competitive with similar automobiles on the market?
*What kind of warranty does the manufacturer offer? Common warranty periods include 3-year/36,000 mile, 5-year/60,000 mile, and 10-year/100,000 mile. Be sure to note the difference between bumper-to-bumper warranties, which cover all parts in the automobile, and powertrain warranties, which only cover the engine and transmission. The latter will usually have longer warranty periods.
*How expensive will the car be to maintain and service? Are parts easily available?
*Does the car require [[w:synthetic_oil|synthetic oils]] and/or premium (high-[[w:octane_rating|octane]]) fuel?
*What will be the cost of insuring the car?
*Will the car depreciate significantly over a 3 or 5 year period, or does it hold its resale value well?

===Environmental impact===
[[File:Eletroposto Prius Insight1.jpg|thumb|3 hybrid cars: an early model Toyota Prius (far left), an early model Honda Insight (center) and a late model Toyota Prius (right).]]
*Is the car [[w:fuel_efficiency|fuel-efficient]]? Note its fuel consumption, in miles per gallon, or liters per 100 kilometers. Higher fuel efficiency results in lower fuel costs, but may also require a sacrifice in performance.
*Cars with [[w:hybrid vehicle|hybrid engines]], such as the Toyota Prius (right) have greater fuel efficiency in city cycles. However, it usually takes several years to recoup the hybrid car's price premium via saved fuel costs. 
*Is the car diesel-powered? Modern diesel engines are about 15% more efficient compared to gasoline engines and possess a greater amount of low-end torque, which aids in acceleration and towing. However, they generally have higher particulate emissions, such as soot.
*Consider the amount of emissions, such as [[w:carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]], and [[w:NOx|oxides of nitrogen]], that are produced by the engine. In some countries, including the UK, cars with cleaner engines incur lower road tax charges.

==Test drive==
Once you think that a certain car may be right, go to the dealer and ask for a test drive - it shouldn't cost you anything. If possible drive on a range of roads - the motorway, in town, country lanes, and off-road if you're going for an SUV.

During the test drive, pay particular attention to these points:

===Performance===
*Note the car's acceleration. Is it satisfactory for your driving style? Do you feel you can safely merge onto a freeway?
*Evaluate the car's handling characteristics and whether they suit your driving style. Does the car possess [[w:understeer|understeer]] or [[w:oversteer|oversteer]] when turning into corners? Is the car steady at high speeds? Is the steering communicative and on-center or is it vague?
*How well does the car brake? How well does the car perform in panic stops?

===Quality and aesthetics===
*Observe the exterior of the car. Are the body panels flush with respect to each other? Are the gaps between panels small or large? Does the paint show signs of fading?
*Observe the interior of the car. Are the panels closely fitted? Do the plastic materials feel hard and cheap or are they soft to the touch? Do the controls feel cheap or do they have good tactile response?
*Is the instrumentation well-designed? Are all important controls located at a comfortable arm's reach?
*Do you find the seats comfortable?
*On the road, does the car feel solid or does it rattle over bumps? Observe noise, vibration, and harshness while coasting and accelerating.



==Comparing potential choices: an example==
One way to make your final choice is this:
#Make a list of three or four possible models within your budget.
#List all the qualities which are important to you, such as safety, equipment, boot / trunk space, and so on.
#Then award 3 points to the car best in each category, 2 to the second best, and 1 to the worst. If there were four cars you would award 4, 3, 2 and 1 point from best to worst.

If certain categories are more important (such as economy) you could award double or triple points , so the winner would get 6 or 9.

Here is an example, based on a choice between a &quot;VW Padro&quot;, a &quot;Holden Frisk&quot; and a &quot;Mitsubishi Morning Tea&quot;, rated under ten criteria. All the details, like the cars, are entirely fictitious.

*The Padro gets    1+2+1+1+3+3+1+3+2+2=19 points
*The Frisk gets  3+3+3+2+2+3+2+2+1+2=24 points
*The Morning Tea gets 2+1+2+3+1+3+3+1+3+3=22 points
And so in this test, the '''Frisk''' is the best buy with 24 points. All three gained 3 points for safety as this was a draw; both the Padro and the Frisk gained 2 points for the warranty because they both offered a 3-year warranty.

==Renting a car before buying it==
Regardless of your initial opinion of a vehicle, it might be a good idea to rent the same model for a few days before deciding to buy it. This precaution has several advantages:

#No hassle from dealership sales people. Renting allows you to drive the car when you want, how you want, and where you want. You have the freedom to take the time to &quot;learn&quot; the car: it's positives and negatives. You'll be able to determine whether the vehicle will meet your needs. You will also know whether you will have the visibility and the confidence and comfort to drive the vehicle.
#You'll be making a minimal investment in a rental vehicle. You will be making a financial commitment to another vehicle over the next two or three years or even longer (depending on whether you purchase or lease).
#If something should break down while driving the rental vehicle, most rental companies will be able to assist you. At the dealership, all you'll hear will be excuses about why the car broke down.
#You can make an objective evaluation of the vehicle without the pressure from a salesperson. Typically, rentals are a minimum of one day or even for a weekend so you'll have lots of time to determine whether this is the vehicle for you.

Once you've chosen the vehicle you (and your family, if applicable) feel most comfortable with, go to the dealership and test drive the new model to reinforce why you are choosing that particular vehicle. And if it's a used vehicle, be sure to arrange to have your mechanic do an inspection to ensure you aren't buying &quot;someone else's problem(s)&quot;.

==Cheap and older cars==
If you are a student, or are on a limited budget, sometimes the main issue can be the mechanical condition of the car. In this case, you will want a car that will pass safety testing and not break down, while not breaking the bank. Different countries have different safety standards that the cars must pass; It may be a good idea to find a list of things your country tests before allowing a car on the road. This will eliminate any nasty surprises. There are also quite a few things to check, so prioritisation may help.
Some of this advice may also apply to motorbikes.

===Traps for newbies===
The number of kilometers or miles that a vehicle has done does not indicate its condition. A car that has done a lot of city driving with 100,000km on the clock may be a lot more worn than a car that has done 300,000km of highway driving. A question you might ask the seller is &quot;how often was the car serviced?&quot;, &quot;do you have the receipts to prove it?&quot;. If the car has been well looked after, especially if the owner is a car enthusiast the owner may tell you a bit about the history and repairs the car has undergone. Of course this is a big unknown if the seller didn't own it for very long. The world record for the longest number of miles a car has done is 2.6 million miles, accomplished in a Volvo 1800. The owner claims he simply services the car regularly.

It is also a good idea to ask if the car has been in an accident.  You may or may not get an honest answer.  However, if the owner tells you that the car was in an accident, ask about the extent of the damage, how it was repaired, and if the owner has the estimate or the bill from the company that made the repairs; this will give you a better idea of the extent of the damage.  Be cautious if you learn that the car's frame was bent, however slightly, in an accident.  A bent frame cannot usually be fully repaired, and it can become worse as the car ages.
Be aware that the car you are interested in may have been involved in a major accident or event. Written off by insurance companies as total losses due to salt water damage (Katrina) or rebuilt from salvage using several cars.

===Engine condition===

====Mechanics====
Generally there are a couple of things that can go wrong.

* Loss of compression due to burnt valves or very worn piston rings
* Damaged bearings (on the crankshaft)
* Cam belt breaks (yikes!)

Loss of compression will cause the engine to stall if not idled at unusually high revs. This is usually caused by burnt valves or very worn piston rings. Burnt valves are usually not expensive to repair, but may indicate poor maintenance elsewhere.
Damaged bearings are caused by the car running low on oil.
Ask the owner when the cam or timing belt was last replaced. Cam or timing belts usually last around 80,000km or 5 years. Check the owners manual for specific belt replacement times.
If you are lucky and have &quot;''Free running''&quot; valves, a broken timing belt will only leave you stranded on the roadside. If you have &quot;''Interference''&quot; type valves a broken timing belt may can cause the heads of the valves to impact the tops of the piston often resulting in very expensive repairs. It is advisable to check with the dealer or manufacturer to check which type of valve is used. '''Always''' change the timing belt on engines with interference valves at the recommended interval.

====Exhaust====
Put your hand on the exhaust. There should be a good pressure build up, or there is a leak/hole in the exhaust somewhere. (Basically your hand should be forced off)

After doing this, sniff your hand (Sniffing the exhaust directly is not recommended!).
If there is a smell of petrol, the car is running rich. If it wasn't already, try this again later when the car is warmed up (5-10 minute drive usually does it). If the exhaust still smells you could get better fuel economy by getting it tuned.

If the car is emitting white smoke, this is normal (it is actually steam). If the car is emitting blue tinged smoke, then the car is burning oil. This indicates significant engine wear. Ask the owner how often they have to top up the oil. If it uses all its oil within a couple of thousand kms or miles, the engine may be on its last legs. If you don't use it much and it's a really cheap car it may still be worth it, however.

If the car burns oil continuously, then the piston rings are worn. If you, for example, take your foot off the accelerator while going downhill and then accelerate at the bottom and a puff of smoke comes out the back, then the valve guides are worn. (Get a friend to follow you in another car to confirm the latter.)

Piston rings are expensive to replace, valve guides can usually be ignored. But do ask the owner how often they top up the oil and how much they put in. If they never check the oil, check it yourself! It might be empty or very dirty! (Which could lead to a lot of expensive wear)

====Engine noise====
There are a lot of normal engine noises. If there is a noise that sounds suspicious (such a loud rattling) use your judgement, or ask a mechanic. A roughly running engine may only require a tune up or it may have expensive damage. If the seller claims it only requires a tune up, ask why they haven't done so, and be very suspicious without a second opinion. Claiming an engine only requires a tune up is a very common excuse for much more serious damage.

A rattling noise can mean the cam chain (if the car doesn't have a cam belt) is loose. It may require adjusting or replacement. If you think of an engine as a rectangular shape, the cam chain is at one of the ends.

A ticking noise can simply mean that the tappets require adjustment. This is usually normal if a car has not been serviced in a long time. Tappet adjustment is not a difficult task if you are into fixing things.

A rumbling noise in the bottom of the engine can indicate worn bearings. This can be expensive to replace.

Knocking noises are hard to distinguish. They indicate a lean fuel mixture or the car running on a lower octane fuel than it was designed. This can lead to burnt valves.

===Car condition===

====Springs====
To make sure your springs and dampeners (shock absorbers) are in good condition, push the car down HARD on each of its four corners. If the car acts like a spring, i.e. it bounces up and down, then the shock absorbers are worn. The car should rise back up after pushing down, but bounce very little or not at all. 

If the car has been lowered, ask the owner if the springs have been cut. In order to lower a car, a common trick is to cut a section out of the springs. This makes the springs shorter, thus lowering the car. This is very cheap and arguably dangerous, especially if a poor job was done.

====Brakes====
If the car has vacuum braking (or 'power' brakes) the brake pedal should depress easily for a bit and then harden up.
If the car doesn't have vacuum braking, then the brakes will not be extremely easy to depress for the first bit.
If the brake pedal feels soft, kind of spongy, there may be air in the brake lines. You can basically 'pump up' the brakes if this is the case. Try pumping the brakes several times, and they will go from spongy to hard. This is usually easily fixed, take a note to see a mechanic; ask them if the brakes just need bleeding.

If the car squeals when you brake, it could mean the brake pads are worn to the bone so to speak. If the car has disc brakes (most cars do, at least on the two front wheels) you will see a metallic disc behind the wheel with a brick shaped clamp around it. If you take a close look from behind the brick, you will see the disc in the middle, and two plates on either side. If you get a friend to press the brakes, the plates will push onto the middle disc.
If the plates have a smaller piece of material sticking out in between them and the disc (looks a bit like solid sandpaper) that's the pads themselves and it means there's some left.

====Wheel Bearings====
If the car's wheel bearings are worn, there will be a rumbling sound audible from the tire when the car is rolling.

====C.V. Joints====
If the car makes a click click noise when you turn with the steering wheel fully locked, it indicates wear of the CV joints. This can be comparatively expensive to fix if the car is cheap.
This only applies to front wheel drive or 4 wheel drive vehicles.

====Rust====
This totally depends on the safety test of your country. Generally cars that have noticeable amounts of rust are going to get worse, fast! The exception is if they are garaged which may slow the process.
Some specific areas prone to rust that may become safety concerns should be investigated these are:
-brake lines especially in locations where salt and sand accumulates. 
-gas tanks. Look for rust along the top of the tank and any welded seams where salt and sand will sit. Wet areas and the smell of gasoline will indicate seepage. 
- holes in the body that access the passenger compartment. Lift up carpeting and liners especially in the trunk area and look for signs of road dust. 
-front and rear suspension towers. These are the large pockets in the car body that house and provide support points for the coil springs and struts. When these become seriously rusted they may collapse. Repair is often expensive or impossible.
- areas around the pillars (these hold the roof up)and are difficult to repair
- areas of the frame or reinforcing channels on unibody cars exposed to salt and sand.
If in doubt get an expert opinion. If there is a bit of general minor rust you're probably ok, but if there is significant rusting, you may not pass the safety inspection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What I think makes Gambas hard to use.==

The only thing I find hard about Gambas is the lack of good
tutorials.

Take the &quot;goto&quot; tutorial for example.
I think this it is a very bad example on how to use the goto command.

Why? Because after studying it I still have trouble using the goto command.
What would have been better is if the example just showed me how to goto a certain part.

like this:

*a = print &quot;hello&quot;
*goto a

or 

*a = print &quot;hello&quot;
*b = print &quot;gamabs&quot;

*goto a then b
*goto b then a



Edit 10/3/06


First be aware that goto is bad programming practice. It is a holdover from the old days of GWBasic with its line numbers and lack of proper control structures.

Using goto creates code that is hard to follow and debug and lacks logical structure - so called spaghetti code.


That said, goto works like this


goto a
 
a:

Print &quot;Hello World&quot;

b:

Print &quot;Hello Wicked World&quot;


The output of this will be BOTH print statements because goto simply branches to the defined label and then continues to the end of the sub/function.

Change the goto to 'goto b&quot; and only the second statement prints.



This example will not work in Gambas, but it wasn't meant to, I just wrote this to help you understand what I mean.
I think all Gambas tutorials should start with very simple examples and work their way up to advance examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ATI Radeon Slowdown Problems===

Go the ATI site driver downloads section and select the appropriate OS/graphic card. This will (most likely) link you to the d/l for the current Catalyst 4.4 drivers.

At the bottom of that page is a link to &quot;Previous driver versions&quot;.

D/L the Catalyst 3.7 driver package. Run the EXE and it will extract the driver install package to:

C:\ATI\SUPPORT\

In this directory will be a directory named (for XP/Win2K users:
\wxp-w2k-7-93-030812a1-010735c-efg\

This is where the driver install package is located.
DO NOT RUN THE SETUP. You don't need to install the old driver.

Navigate down thru the dir structure to the following dir:
C:\ATI\SUPPORT\wxp-w2k-7-93-030812a1-010735c-efg\2KXP_INF\B_10679

In this dir you'll find a file called:
atioglxx.dl_
This is a &quot;packed&quot; version of the ATI OGL driver.

The next step specifies how you can extract these files to your hard
disk using the 'expand.exe' utility included on the cd.

The 'I386' folder on the Windows XP CD contains a utility
'expand.exe' that can be used to uncompress all compressed dll files.
It is a commandline utility, so you have will have to run it from
either the command prompt or the Run dialog. Some examples of
its usage are:
            expand X:\I386\ADROT.DL_ C:\ADROT.DLL
            The above command decompresses the compressed DLL
ADROT.DL_ on the WinXP CD, copies it to C:, and changes the extension
to .DLL .

Just extract that file (atioglxx.dll) to your Blender install directory.
Usually C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\

Launch Blender....
no more slowdown.

Addendum: I found this solved a problem of crashing on start up after updating my Catalyst driver from 7.2 to 7.8, that is expanding the old 7.2 atioglxx.dl_ to atioglxx.dll and copying it to the Blender directory.

===For people who the above solution leads to Blender crash at start up===
:Thanks to Xenobius at Blenderartists Forum


This solution is tested on ATI radeon express 200 (x200) integrated video card. However it should
work on other ATI card.

Download the Nvidia 53.03 Driver [http://www.megagames.com/news/redir.cgi?http://download.nvidia.com/Windows/53.03/53.03_winxp2k_english_whql.exe HERE]

Extract the driver to C:\NVIDIA

Copy the nvoglnt.dll from the C:\NVIDIA folder to your blender program folder (i.e. C:\Programs Files\Blender 2.40\)

Rename nvoglnt.dll (the one in the blender program folder) to atioglxx.dll

Run blender...voilà!  Blender runs like it should!


[This works, because it can't use proper gl calls and uses no hardware acceleration so speed goes crappy...]

      <comment>/* Etiology */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|frame|right|X-ray of the legs in a two-year-old child with rickets]]
'''Rickets''' is a disorder of infancy and early childhood of multiple etiologies. Rickets, causing soft [[bones]], may occur if enough [[Wikipedia:vitamin D|vitamin D]] is not present to assist in [[Wikipedia:calcium|calcium]] absorption. When enough calcium is not absorbed by the bone, it does not harden properly, and is too soft to support the weight of the growing body properly. The disease of rickets takes its name from the Greek word for spine, ''rhakhis''.

== Etiology == 

[[Wikipedia:Vitamin D|Vitamin D]] is made by the body when it is exposed to [[Wikipedia:ultraviolet light|ultraviolet light]] (which is found in sunlight). [[Wikipedia:Vitamin D|Vitamin D]] is also added to [[milk]], milk products, and multi-vitamin pills through a process originally [[Wikipedia:patent|patent]]ed by [[Wikipedia:Harry Steenbock|Harry Steenbock]].  Some people who do not get enough sun exposure, milk products, or green vegetables may also develop the disease. Deficiency of calcium can also cause rickets, particularly in some developing countries where the intake of calcium-rich products such as leafy greens, nuts, and seeds is low.

Hereditary rickets, is caused by an inherited disease that interferes with the resorption of renal tubular phosphate in the [[Wikipedia:kidney|kidney]]. Rickets can also be caused by certain [[Wikipedia:liver|liver]] diseases.

A similar disorder can occur in adults, and is called [[Wikipedia:osteomalacia|osteomalacia]]. Then, it is caused by the inability of bone cells to calcify, or harden. Less frequently, nutritional shortage of calcium or phosphorus may produce rickets.

== Manifestations of disease ==

Rickets causes bone pain, slowed growth in children, [[Wikipedia:dental|dental]] problems, [[muscle]] loss and increased risk of [[Wikipedia:fracture|fracture]]s (easily broken bones). Medical problems seen in children with rickets are

#Vitamin D deficiency,
#Skeletal deformity,
#Growth disturbance,
#Hypocalcemia (low level of calcium in the blood),
#Tetany (uncontrolled muscle spasms).

The [[Wikipedia:X-ray|X-ray]], or [[Wikipedia:radiograph|radiograph]], in the article is the classic image of advanced rickets sufferers: bow legs (outward curve of long bone of the legs) and a deformed chest. Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive &quot;square headed&quot; appearance. These deformities persist into adult life.

== Treatment and prevention == 
Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium, [[phosphate]]s and Vitamin D. Exposure to sunshine, [[Wikipedia:cod liver oil|cod liver oil]], halibut-liver oil, and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D.

A sufficient amount of sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets. Darker-skinned babies need to be exposed longer to the ultraviolet rays.  The replacement of Vitamin D may correct rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light and medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a &quot;short end&quot;?==

A &quot;short end&quot; is a can of unexposed filmstock that low-budget filmmakers can use as free filmstock.

==Why do they exist?==

Well, consider any typical film shoot.  They will load the camera with filmstock and shoot.  If they finish the day before finishing the film loaded in the camera then they'll split the film loaded in the camera: the exposed footage will go off to their lab for developing whilst the unexposed footage will go into a can to be used at a future date.

==But why doesn't the production company in question re-use the short end?==

Because they won't get negative insurance (insurance which will pay for a re-shoot if the negative film turns out to be duff).

==Oh, and what's a &quot;re-can&quot;?==

A re-can is filmstock that has been loaded into a magazine but never used in the camera.  Re-cans contain as much filmstock as a new can would (i.e. either 400 or 1000 foot).

==Great, how do I get short ends?==

Spend a day on the phone calling up your local production companies.  If you want to be clever then find try to find companies which only shoot on film.  Say &quot;Hi, my name's blah and I'm producing a low budget film.  I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you happened to have any 16mm short ends kicking about?&quot;  Most will say &quot;no&quot;.  One or two will say &quot;um, what's a short end?&quot;.  And about 1 in 100 will say &quot;sure, come over later&quot;.

Make sure you're very polite and thankful.  Make sure you credit the people who helped you out.

When you go to collect the short ends, take a big bag and a friend.  You don't want to have to turn down any short ends just because you can't carry enough.

==Where do I find lists of hundreds of production companies?==

===UK===
* http://www.kftv.com/product-4410.html
* http://www.theknowledgeonline.com/
* http://www.4rfv.co.uk/

==How to I test my short ends?==

You do a dip test at a developing lab.  They will take a few foot from each can and test it.  About half your cans will probably fail.  Don't chuck this stock away though - it's useful for learning to load a camera.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Introduction_to_Philosophy|Introduction to Philosophy]] &gt; [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Logic|Logic]] &gt; Formal Logic

Logicians describe various formal systems of logic which are intended to match a precise but limited range of reasoning.  Each such system defines a formal language.  A scope of such a system&amp;mdash;and the corresponding expressability of its formal language&amp;mdash;matches the range of reasoning it is supposed to describe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Setup and Installation =
Since PHP is a server-side technology, you should naturally expect to invest some time in setting up a server environment for production, development or learning. To be frank, PHP is quite easy to set up compared to other monsters like J2EE. Nevertheless, the procedures are complicated by the various combinations of different versions of web server, PHP and database (most often MySQL). Below I will introduce the steps needed to set up a working PHP environment with MySQL database.

== Linux ==

If your desktop runs on Linux, chances are that Apache, PHP, and MySQL are already installed for you. This wildly popular configuration is commonly referred to as LAMP, i.e. '''L'''inux '''A'''pache '''M'''ySQL '''P'''HP, or '''P''', the latter 'P', can also refer to '''P'''erl another major player in the opensource web service arena. If some components are not installed, you will likely have to manually install the following packages:

* Apache or Lighttpd
* PHP
* MySQL or Postgres
* The PHP integration plugin for the database.

=== Debian or its derivatives ===
On Debian or its derivatives, Ubuntu included{{ref|Ubuntu}}, you can use the corresponding commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install php5

## Server
#### If you wish to use Apache
apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
a2enmod php5
service apache2 restart
## -or-
#### If you wish to use Lighttpd
apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi
lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi fastcgi-php
service lighttpd restart

## Database
#### If you wish to use Postgres
apt-get install postgres-server    postgres-client    php5-pg
## -or-
#### If you wish to use Mysql
apt-get install mysql-server       mysql-client       php5-mysql
&lt;/source&gt;

{{note|Ubuntu}} If you chose to use Ubuntu with Apache and MySQL you might wish to utilize the Ubuntu community site for such a configuration [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP ubuntu lamp wiki].

=== Gentoo ===
For Gentoo Linux users, the gentoo-wiki has this HowTo available: [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Apache2_with_PHP_MySQL Apache2 with PHP and MySQL].

In general, you'll want to do the following under Gentoo:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
emerge apache
emerge mysql
emerge mod_php
&lt;/source&gt;

=== RPM-based ===
The exact procedures depend on your Linux distribution. On a Fedora system, the commands are typically as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
yum install httpd
yum install php
yum install mysql
yum install php-mysql
&lt;/source&gt;

It's impossible to cover all the variants here, so consult your Linux distribution's manual for more details, or grab a friend to do it for you.

One sure-fire way of getting PHP up and running on your *nix system is to compile it from source. This isn't as hard as it may sound and there are good instructions available in the [http://au.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.php PHP manual].

== Windows ==

PHP on Windows is also a very popular option. On a Windows platform, you have the option to use either the open source [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] web server, or the native Internet Information Services (IIS) server from Microsoft, which can be installed from your Windows CD. When you have one of these servers installed, you can download and install the appropriate PHP Windows binaries distributions from [http://www.php.net/downloads.php PHP download page]. The installer version requires less user-interaction.

For increased performance you will want to use FastCGI. There is a wikibook that will assist you on [[IIS and FastCGI|Setting up IIS with FastCGI]].

=== Databases ===
On Microsoft Windows you must always install your own database. Two popular choices are the open source Postgres, and MySQL. Postgres is more liberally licensed, and is free to use for commercial purposes. 

==== Postgresql ====

Official Zend documentation: [http://us.php.net/pgsql http://us.php.net/pgsql]

Postgres is simple and easy to install, browse to [http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/binary/v8.3.0/win32/ http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/binary/v8.3.0/win32/] and download the exe and double-click.

==== MySQL ====

Official MySQL documentation: [http://us.php.net/mysql http://us.php.net/mysql]

You might wish to install the MySQL database. You can download the Windows version of [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ MySQL], and follow the installation instructions. If you have PHP 4, you do not need to install the equivalence of php-mysql on Linux, as MySQL support is built-in in Windows distributions of PHP. In PHP 5 you will need to uncomment the following line in your php.ini file (that is, remove the ';' at the beginning of the line):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
  ;extension=php_mysql.dll
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Bundled Package ===

If you find all the above too much a hassle, you have another option. Driven by the eternal desire to do things the safe/easy way, several conveniently packaged AMP bundles of Apache/MySQL/PHP can be found on the net. One of them is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad/ PHPTriad]. Or, you can try [http://www.uniformserver.com Uniform Server]. It is a small [[WAMP]] Package. (The acronym ''WAMP'' refers to a server stack where Microsoft Windows is the operating system, Apache is the Web server, MySQL handles the database components, and PHP, Python, or PERL represents the dynamic scripting languages). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/WAMP.html&lt;/ref&gt; Uniformserver is packaged as a self-extracting zip archive, and is easy to use. After trying it out you can simply delete the directory and everything is clean.  
[http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html XAMPP for Windows] is another WAMP server that is easy to use. In addition, is has an installation option that allows you to install it on a computer if you have administration rights. XAMPP has options to run PERL and JAVA (on a tomcat server). A number of other portable Windows AMP package choices are summarized at [http://www.portablefreeware.com/?sc=125 List of portable Web Servers].

Also, a package installer called '''WAMPserver''' is available. It simply installs Apache, PHP and MySQL on windows with ease. [http://www.wampserver.com/en/ http://www.wampserver.com/en/]

=== Easy Windows Setup Instructions ===

1) PHP authoring environment
* Any text editor will do, but I recommend one with syntax coloring especially for someone new to coding or PHP. Notepad++ is my favorite so far with its ease of use, customizability and the ability to collapse tags. All editor help will be in reference to Notepad++
* Install Notepad++. Download the binary file from here: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm

2) PHP running environment
* Now that you have the ability to create and save PHP files you need an environment that can process them and generate the output that your browser displays. There are two ways to accomplish this.
# Get a web host that supports PHP and upload your files every time you make a change.
# Use your own computer as a personal server with PHP support, and only upload final versions to a web host.
* Accomplishing 2. above is actually easier than you think (assuming you are running Windows).
# Download The uniform server. Here is the link to the latest version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/miniserver/files/
# Run the self-extracter UniServerX_Y_Z.exe. Copy the directory to your &quot;C:&quot; drive so the full path is &quot;C:\UniServer&quot;.
# In the directory where you had it extract hit the &quot;Start.exe&quot; file to get the server running
# Place any files and subfolders you want the server to read and process in the &quot;www&quot; folder.
# Your web browser should open to &quot;http://localhost/index.php&quot;
* Now you have the resources to effectively edit PHP documents and process them on your own computer.
* Here is how to create a test page
# Inside &quot;C:\UniServer\www\&quot;, create a webpage called &quot;test.php&quot;
# Edit &quot;test.php&quot; with Notepad++, and copy the following

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;Description&quot; content=&quot;Test Page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;Keywords&quot; content=&quot;Test,Page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
  $string = 'Hello world! &lt;br/&gt;';
  echo $string;
  
  print $string;
  
  printf('%s', $string);  
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

# Save the webpage as &quot;C:\UniServer\www\test.php&quot;
# Open &quot;http://localhost/test.php&quot; in your web browser to view the page. You should see:
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
# (Optional: Follow these instructions for how to make PHP code work with webpages that end in &quot;.html&quot; in addition to &quot;.php&quot;: [http://www.desilva.biz/php/phpinhtml.html http://www.desilva.biz/php/phpinhtml.html])

== Mac OS X ==

Mac OS X comes with Apache server as standard, and enabling it is as simple as checking the box next to 'Personal Web Sharing' in the 'Sharing' section of System Preferences. Once you have done this you can place files in /Library/WebServer/Documents to access them on your server. Mac OS X does come with PHP but the installation lacks any significant quantity of extensions, so if you want any you're going to have to install PHP yourself. You can do this by following the instructions in Apple's [http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/php.html Developer Connection], or you can download an automatic installer such as the ones available at [http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/ Entropy]. Once you've done one of those, you'll have a server with PHP running on your Mac.

To install MySQL just download and run the [http://www.serverlogistics.com/mysql.php OS X installer package] or use [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html XAMPP for MacOS X].

If you use unix or learning it, however, compiling might be the way to go for all three, or just the ones you like. The advantage is that you can choose exactly which extensions you want for PHP and Apache. Also you can choose which versions to compile together. To do this make sure you have the Developer Tools installed. They are shipped with OS X.

= How Do I Know My Setup is Working? =

After you have successfully completed the previous section, it's time to make sure that everything went well. You also get the chance to write your very first PHP scripts! Open your favourite ''plain'' [[w:text editor|text editor]] (''not'' Microsoft Word or another [[wikipedia:word processor|word processor]]), and type the following magical line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Save it as phpinfo.php in your web server's root document directory. If you are using a web hosting server, upload it to the server to where you would place HTML files. Now, open up your web browser, and go to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/phpinfo.php&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;http://your-web-hosting-server.com/phpinfo.php&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you are using a web hosting server, and look at the output.

Now scroll down that page and make sure there is a table with the title &quot;mysql&quot;, and the top row should read: &quot;MySQL support: enabled&quot;. If your output does not have this, your particular installation of PHP does not have MySQL support enabled. Note that this test doesn't tell you whether MySQL server is running. You should fire up your MySQL client and check before you proceed.

Some dedicated php or script editors even have color coding of different words which can be very useful for finding mistakes. A free implementation of this is the powerful Notepad++, available from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus Sourceforge] and licensed under the GPL.

The main portion of Statistics is the display of summarized data.  Data is initially collected from a given source, whether they are experiments, surveys, or observation, and is presented in one of four methods:

; Textular Method : The reader acquires information through reading the gathered data.
; Tabular Method : Provides a more precise, systematic and orderly presentation of data in rows or columns.
; Semi-tabular Method : Uses both textual and tabular methods.
; Graphical Method : The utilization of graphs is most effective method of visually presenting statistical results or findings.

The previous chapters dealt with DC. This chapter gives a brief introduction to AC or Alternating Current. Although most people associate AC with the 120V or 230V outlets, it also involves any other electric signal which change polarity periodically e.g. audio signals.&lt;BR&gt;
This chapter will address a small subset of AC signals: single phase AC as it's produced by the electricity company and delivered through the outlets in your home. 

'''A note on safety:''' This chapter doesn't contain experiments. There are 2 reasons for this. First any interesting experiments would require the use of an oscilloscope. Secondly, experimenting with electricity from an outlet is dangerous in so many ways: Death through electrocution, 3rd degree burns from electricity, house fire after a short circuit,... Schools have special infrastructure to be able to do such experiments in relative safety. Most of them would use a variable AC power supply rather than AC outlets anyway. 

=== What is AC? ===
[[File:Ac basic.png|center|thumb|250px|AC]]

This image shows a typical AC signal. How this signal changes over time is shown. If you've had trigonometry you'll notice the typical shape of the sinus function. 

[[File:Ac param.png|center|thumb|250px|AC with period and amplitude]]


This image shows the '''amplitude''' of the AC signal, denoted as '''Um'''. This is the highest value the signal reaches.

If you look at the 2 lines marked with the T, you'll see they connect 2 identical points on the sine curve. The time it takes to get from the first to the second point is called the '''period''' and is indicated with the symbol '''T'''. This is a time and therefore expressed in seconds (or more likely milliseconds ms).

'''Frequency''' is the inverse of the period: f = 1 / T and is expressed in Hertz (Hz). It's defined as the number of periods per second.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Aim of book:''' To make it possible for people to read this and start creating their own electronic devices and understanding them. Introducing theories only when they apply to what the reader is doing (follow the Keep It Short and Simple rule).

Although the [[Electronics]] wikibook has about the same goal, it introduces too many 
theories that don't apply to beginners and no hands-on experience, making it impossible to learn out of that book. Links to some theories in that book may be added so they are not replicated on both books, unless it needs to be shortened.

'''2. Prerequisites:''' Some knowledge of physics and math is assumed

'''3. Materials:''' You may want to consider getting the following materials: [[w:Breadboard|Breadboard]], and a source of voltage to start with. (under construction)
=Sources of [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|Direct current (DC)]] Voltage=

*For simple hands-on experiences to learn about Electronics it is best to start with [[Electronics/Batteries|'''BATTERIES''']] as a simple source of electricity. All sorts of types of batteries are available, and it is important to select the correct type for the particular usage.
** AN EXAMPLE:
I have 2 sets of 3-volt (two 1.5 volt each in series) D-size batteries, one new, call it black, and the other used, call it red. The open-circuit actual measured voltages are approximately Red=2.75 Volt, Black=2.97 Volt. Each of these sets of batteries has an internal resistance which can be calculated as follows:

..... Use a load resistance, but which? My ammeter has a range with a full-scale deflection of 0.5 Amperes, which I could get by using a resistor having about 3/0.5 = 6 Ohms (6 Ω). But I do not have such a resistor.

..... Using a 25 Ω resistor as a load, I get a current flow of 95 milliamperes (mA) from the black batteries. Calculating the total approximate resistance in circuit (internal plus external) 2.97/0.097=31.3 Ohms (total). Deduct the external 25 Ω, and get approximately 6 Ω for the internal resistance of the black battery set.

..... Using the same 25 Ω external resistor, I get a current flow of only 60 mA from the red batteries, which indicates an approximate internal resistance of (2.75/0.060) - 25 = 46 - 25 = 21 Ω.

*Another simple source of DC is a [[w:Battery charger|'''BATTERY CHARGER''']]. This gets its energy from one of the sockets usually available at the bottom in every room. A battery charger starts off with Alternating Current (AC) derived from the mains/line via that socket, and, using one or more [[Electronics/Rectifier|rectifiers]], converts it into Direct Current (DC) whose voltage keeps changing very quickly all the time from zero to maximum and back again. Often a [[Electronics/Capacitors|Capacitor]], also sometimes called a Condenser, is used to &quot;smooth&quot; the available DC voltage, and the resulting DC. It is connected across the DC voltage source.
**&lt;U&gt;An example&lt;/U&gt; of a [[w:Battery charger|battery charger]] with 3 different output circuits described on the label: 
***1) for two or four  AA, two or four C or two or four D rechargeable batteries (2.9V, 100 mA for two in series)
***2) for only one 9V rechargeable battery (9V, 5 mA), and
***3) for only one(?) AAA rechargeable battery (5.8V 18mA).
*** Some manufacturers have on the battery label their instruction showing for how long their rechargeable battery should be charged. Never attempt to &quot;charge&quot; any battery not labelled as being rechargeable - it may be dangerous.

*Many different types of [[Guide to Electrical Equipment for Travellers|adapters]] are available that supply either AC or DC for toys, players/recorders, etc. at the correct voltage as required. The correct adapter must be used for each purpose.

=Sources of [[Electronics/AC Voltage and Current|Alternating current (AC)]] Voltage=
*'''CAUTION! Using the wall socket as source can be very dangerous, and should be postponed until much is known about electricity, its uses, and safety measures associated with it.'''
*The voltage available at the wall socket is too high for elementary experimentation, but transformers are available that will reduce the voltage to non-dangerous levels. Look for [[Guide to Electrical Equipment for Travellers|adapters]] that also are available in many different types and AC voltages.

== Introduction ==

This wikibook is about the development of historical writing. 

=== Prolegomena ===

There are many ways in which such a history could be organized for individuals. For example, we could organize
the narrative spatially, discussing the historians of the individual countries. Or we could
identify the principal forms of historical writing, such as the chronicle, the annal, the
monumental inscription, the monograph, the treatise, the legend, the biography and its cousins, 
and so on and so forth. Or we could enumerate the different forms of philosophy of history 
and the conceptions of history, and then exemplify these forms by correlating them with 
their styles and representatives. And these are just a few of the possible approaches.

However, historians have a gentle preference for chronological arrangements, and that
with good reason. For each of the different organizing principles we have just named
&amp;mdash; countries, historical forms of writing, philosophies and conceptions of history &amp;mdash; 
are themselves historical. Countries change; their boundaries move; their territories are
renamed; their rivers change their courses or stop running altogether. Equally literary forms:
they are invented, they undergo development, they fall out of fashion, they get rediscovered. 
The process for philosophies of history is not dissimilar.

The intention is now clear: Organizing a historical narrative along forms that are themselves
historical complicates the matter considerably. It is therefore appealing to use time, that is, 
an idealized linear chronological sequence of time, as a common reference system, in which all 
the changes of the other principles can be put into relation to each other and described. 

Unfortunately, a chronological sequence is merely a start. Most of what historians work 
with beyond just time is itself historical. This is especially  true for many of the 
words with which historians write and for many of the concepts that  historians use. 
At the same time, we would prefer not to be restricted to those words that
the historians of a particular time knew or employed. 

The method historians employ to get around this apparent contradiction of wanting to
use the concepts and words of their subject matter but also use the conceptual tools since then
developed is to use the [[wikipedia:Hermeneutics|hermeneutical circle]]. 
Basically, the hermeneutical circle says that as one studies and re-studies evidence from 
the past, one comes to a deeper understanding of its meaning by realizing the assumption 
the reader made and the assumptions that the author made, and reflecting them explicitly.

Finally, we must briefly think about the problem of historical interest. Almost
any event of significant size is so rich in detail that one could not enumerate
the detail completely. At the same time, not every little detail is in fact &quot;relevant&quot;
in all situations. That is why in historical writing we find &quot;historical interest&quot; 
at work, namely the observation that the authors of historical
texts will choose from the multitude of details those details that they consider 
relevant to the stories that they want to tell. 

The problem is that people can and will disagree on what the important details
of an event are. In addition, rhetorical devices such as the &quot;lie of omission&quot; 
indicate that manipulating the amount of information can seriously distort the 
impression that one gets of an event. At the same time, historical interest is
itself historical and influenced by socio-political conventions. 

Thus, with the above said in mind, we will attempt a chronological reconstruction of 
the history of historical writing. The following briefly sketches the contents of the 
individual chapters.

=== Archaic Historians ===

In our modern information society, it may be surprising to learn that historical writing 
was a relative late development. But people who could write were few; and since they were 
writing, others had to provide food and shelter for them. Consequently, it was not until 
the first bureaucratic states, such as [[wikipedia:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and 
[[wikipedia::Ancient_Egypt|Ancient Egypt]], that the surplus of food and labor was 
sufficient to make historical writing possible.

At the same time, the historians writing for the pharaos, priests and kings of the 
ancient civilizations are rarely known to us by name. There was little interest in their
authorship; the focus of their writing was on the deeds and tribulations of their masters,
states, people or colleagues. Indeed, initially I was tempted to call this chapter not the
archaic, but the anonymous historians, for this seems to be one of their key characteristics. 

Their stylistic repertoire was equally limited. Often, these early historians were primarily 
[[wikipedia::Chronicler|chronicler]] of events, that is, they wrote a form of historical 
writing that simply enumerates the individual events but provides no overarching narrative or
structure.

=== Ancient Historians ===

With the beginning of the 5&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; century BC, 
we begin to encounter the first historians
who are authors in the modern sense of the word, that is, people who are associated with their 
works in the mind of their audience. 

For the Mediterranean world, this means writers like [[wikipedia:Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]], [[wikipedia:Thukydides|Thukydides]], [[wikipedia:Livy|Livy]], [[wikipedia:Plutarch|Plutarch]] 
or [[wikipedia:Flavius Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], to name just a few of the more well-known names.

The majority of the writing that was produced at the beginning of this period was still 
intended for public reading to the audience. The authors might travel from settlement to settlement 
and read from their stories. As the period progressed, the number of people with literary training in 
society increased. As a result, historical writings for a more personal consumption
were produced. Writers like [[wikipedia::Xenophon|Xenophon]] come to mind, who not only wrote books
intended for public, that is, political consumption, such as his [[wikipedia::Anabasis|Anabasis]], 
but also books to be circulated among good friends, such as his 
[[wikipedia::Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]. 

The situation is more complicated for the Far East. 
Take China, where during the period of the [[wikipedia:Warring States|Warring States]], 
some form of historiography must have taken place, as the [[wikipedia:Five Classics|Confucian Classics]] 
include both a &lt;I&gt;Book of History&lt;/I&gt; and an [[wikipedia::Annals|annal]], the [[wikipedia:Spring and Autumn Annals|Spring and Autumn Annals]] of the State of Lu. Unfortunately, the authors of these works
remain anonymous, assuming that [[wikipedia:Confucius|Confucius]] primarily functioned as their editor.  
It is not until [[wikipedia:Sima Qian|Sima Qian]]'s [[wikipedia:Shiji|Records of the Great Historian]]
that we can associate a name and a biography with a great Chinese history.

Toward the latter third of this period, we see the rise of Christian [[Church Historiography]], 
a topic that would deserve its own Wikibook.


=== Medieval Historians ===

The state of historical writing in the West changes very drastically with the fragmentation of the 
Roman Empire at the end of the 5th century AD, and the invasion of the Germanic tribes. 
In the western half of the empire, local pockets of both the ability to write and the ability 
to deal with existant sources remain, especially in the larger cities and on the more secure
island of [[wikipedia:Ireland]]. Administrators of the Roman state or the Christian churches, 
such as [[wikipedia:Gregory of Tours|Gregory of Tours]], [[wikipedia:Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] or
[[wikipedia:Asser, Bishop of Sherborne|Bishop Asser]] continue to write historical records of their
times, often with heavy theological interpretative agendas. The new potentates of the former
Roman provinces sponsored annals and chronicles, such as 
the [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicles]], and eventually also [[wikipedia:Biography|vitae]], that is descriptions of their life. Two mid 9th-century examples would be [[wikipedia:Einhard|Einhard's]] &lt;I&gt;Vita Caroli&lt;/I&gt; and [[wikipedia:Notker|Notker's]] &lt;I&gt;De Carolo Magno&lt;/I&gt;.

For the [[wikipedia:Byzantine Empire|former Eastern half of the Roman Empire]], most of the
cultural productivity remains focused in the capital [[wikipedia:Byzanz|Byzanthium]]. The production
of historical writing revolves around the maintenance of existing literature and of writing that
is relevant to the imperial court, e.g. the &lt;I&gt;Alexiad&lt;/I&gt; of [[wikipedia:Anna Commena|Anna Commena]], 
one of the first female historiographers we will encounter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Subvocalization''', or silent speech, is defined as the internal speech made when [[reading (activity)|reading]] a word, thus allowing the reader to imagine the sound of the word as it is read (Carver 1990).  This is a natural process when reading and helps to reduce cognitive load, and helps the mind to access meanings to enable it to comprehend and remember what is read.  

There is no evidence that normal non-observable subvocalizing will negatively effect any reading process (Carver 1990)(McWhorter 2002).  At the more powerful rates (Memorizing, learning, and reading for comprehension) subvocalizing is very detectable by the reader.  At the less powerful faster rates (skimming and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable.  For normal competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.  However, [[speed reading]] advocates generally teach lengthy prescriptive practices to eliminate subvocalising when reading as they claim it &quot;places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus, slowing the reading down.&quot;  Normal reading instructors may simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the lips, jaw, or throat (McWhorter 2002). 

It may be impossible to totally eliminate subvocalizing because people learn to read by associating the sight of words with their spoken sounds.  Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the nervous systems, even of deaf people, as they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound.  Subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word, and micro-muscle tests suggest that subvocalizing is impossible to eliminate.  Attempting to stop subvocalizing is potentially harmful to comprehension, learning and memory. At the more powerful reading rates (100-300wpm), subvocalizing can be used to improve comprehension.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== experiments needed ==

This book is quickly turning into a book that you can read but not apply to anything, if you're going to contribute a chapter about a part at least put experiments demonstrating what the part does. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 15:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC) this is a big problem for the electronics wikibook since once it gets to digital circuits there's no instructions about building a digital circuit.

== This book already exists ==

You will be pleased to know that a substantial book on learning electronics already exists as [[Electronics]]. It would be best if you could merge any new content there. Thanks, ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:23, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

:Sorry, I want to do something differnt than that book, as it has no hands on experience, and is full of many theories that don't need to be taught to beginners. There are also no circuits you can make in that book. 04:39, 16 July 2005 [[User:172.146.141.205]]

See [[Wikibooks:Duplicate articles]] policy. I still think that you should, at least, link your book in closely with [[Electronics]]. Your aim appears to be directly compatible with [[Electronics:Aim]], but they simply have not written much of the basic hands on stuff yet, maybe you could help by writing it? ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 01:11, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

:I've been looking into it but it looks as it would be similar to putting a square peg in a round hole. Too many theories that don't need to be taught, it's just much better and faster to introduce things as the lessons advance and the new components/circuits are introduced. at least half of that stuff doesn't need to be taught until the end of the book, but it's introduced first.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 04:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

Okay, how about linking to the theory in [[Electronics]] whenever you need a theoretical explanation (i.e., instead of duplicating the explanation yourself), and making your book a series of practical tutorials. It's desirable to eliminate duplication within Wikibooks, because it allows electronics contributors to concentrate their efforts. You may want to add some links to the appropriate tutorials within [[LearnElectronics]] to Electronics, so that readers of Electronics can benefit from your efforts too. I'll remove the merge tag for now, but please keep Wikibook's duplication policy in mind while writing. Good luck.

:I'll try but i will do some explanation because i want the final product to be able to be printed out and used without the aid of a computer--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 00:05, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== some critics, positive ones ofcourse ;-) ==

IMO it's a good idea to write an beginners book on electronics. The other one is indeed pretty advanced (and I can know I've got a degree in it :-D ).&lt;BR&gt;
I don't know your background in electronics, but I would suspect you're either self taught or still learning. (writting about it is one of the best the learn it throughfully) The reason I suspect this is the part on Ohms law. You going over it pretty fast and this is the law that has more about it than what most people see. A good explaination requires some text, a little math and a drawing. The drawing is essential as it shows exactly how the voltage drop over a resistor appears. This is essential to comprehend this law completely. Most people don't think this is important.&lt;BR&gt;
An second point on this section is that you make it sound as if Ohms law applies to other components, which is not. Ohm's law only applies to resistors. Diodes, coils and capacitors do not follow this law. (For DC. AC is a differend thing. Capacitors and coild follow an extended version of Ohms law for AC.)
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 17:04, 16 July 2005 (UTC)
:I am self taught, but will be attending a program at a vocational school (with classes in electronics) to complete my last 2 years of highschool. It has been a while since the last time i was being taught some very basic electronics, I really don't have a complete knowledge of this so I need people to fix errors like that of the Ohm's law section you mention, and help in writting the book. I'm just trying to set up a structure to the book, each chapter a new concept/part/equation is introduced and explained is what i'm trying for(except for the first few so you can start doing hands on stuff fast). '''I can't get my hands on a good electronics book, my local library is horrible for finding anything of use to you.'''--[[User:172.175.154.216|172.175.154.216]] 23:40, 16 July 2005 (UTC)V2os, forgot to log in.
::I'll try to contribute as time permits. (I'm already contributing to 3 wikibooks, 2 of which I started myself). --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 09:13, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== layout/content ideas ==

Seems you intent to seperate the theory and practice in different chapters. How about linking them closer? e.g. Explain the resistor, then follow with some hands-on experiment demonstrating Ohm's Law in practice, followed by some explaination why the measured values aren't exactly the same as those calculated. IMO small portions of theory followed by small experiments are a very good way to learn this material and it's easy to expand the book this way. &lt;BR&gt;
Also you should cleary note that this is about DC. AC differs very much from DC and IMO should be something like part 2 of the book. &lt;BR&gt;
Ohm's law is very easy to turn in a intresting demo, without expensive equipment. Kirchof's laws are harder to demo (the law about the currents in and out a node would need at least 3 current measurements, idealy at the same time).

:Don't remember any of that, and i don't have any measuring equipment, or know how to use it, it would be nice if you could contribute something about this or find an article about it online and send a link (both how to use the equipment and the ohm's law demo).--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 03:39, 18 July 2005 (UTC)



== Some content suggestions ==

I've had some experience with teaching electronics, but not at this level. The way the book is currently organised requires the reader to learn all of the theory before doing the hands on stuff. Maybe it would be better it interleave the two more closely.

[[User:Geocachernemesis:LearnElectronics/Tmp contents|See my bulky proposed changes to the contents here.]]

You get the idea... ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 06:43, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

:I like it. (makes me realize how little i actualy know about electronics at the moment.)--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 16:23, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I've started to organize the book like this.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 20:38, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

== AC measurements ==

AC is a bit/lot harder than DC. Perhaps we should spend a chapter to it, before moving on to the active components? IMO it's more trouble to split up the AC and DC characteristics of e.g. a transistor than it is to introduce AC first and then explain the transistor. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 08:33, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

:As far as I can see, AC measurements are way beyond the scope of the book. Also, they would be very difficult to arrange without the aid of a signal generator and an oscilloscope. Yes, we could build a variable oscillator, feed it into the circuit under test, then use a small capacitor to store the peak voltage after rectification (that could be used to measure the peak voltage at several points with the aid of a multimeter). I think that anything more than a multimeter is a bit much to ask from any beginner.

:I know that most tertiary courses in electronics simultaneously cover both the AC and DC characteristics of some passive and active components. But, I think that we can do them separately (with the AC characteristics far later, if we do them at all). With only DC (or very slowly changing voltages to measure), the BJT can be seen as a switch or current amplifier, the FET as a switch, the diode allows current to flow in only one direction, and the LED lights up with cool colours. Maybe we could get away with doing a simple oscillator with flashing LEDs, flashing at about 0.5 Hz, but that's about as AC as we can easily get. On the other hand, it would be great if we could do some tutorials for some of the advanced stuff in the [[Electronics]] book, that would bring the two books together nicely. But, this book is currently aimed at the very beginner. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:27, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

== New title? ==

I've just been quickly looking at the basic material in the [[Electronics]] book. I think that we really need to limit the scope of this book so that it accomodates only the very beginner (i.e., people who don't know anything about electronics). Also, the title may be better changed to [[Beginning electronics]] (or at least [[Learning electronics]], to fit with our naming conventions)? Tell me what you think, and I'll move the pages to the new name. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
:That may be a good idea. Perhaps we should keep this book as a page to link to all the electronics books at differend levels. Perhaps a second book covering the harder parts can be written too later and then a link to it can be added here? --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 08:46, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, we could link to it at the beginning of the Electronics book to get people up to speed for the Basic electronics section. I suppose they could run in parallel to some extent though, but using a naive treatment of electronics that doesn't rely on describing what happens to electrons and other theory (I assume that's what [[User:V2os|V2os]] had in mind for this book). But, is it really electronics, or only electricity and magnetism? ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
:This is probably going to be limited to basic electricity and (simple) digital electronics. The hardest subject would probably be the RC circuit. I would avoid magnetism as it's pretty complicated. I would save it for the more advanced book, possible together with AC. Probably we should cover resistors (ohm's Law, That other law to calculate the resistance of a wire), Kirchof, capacitors in DC and the RC circuit. For real electronics I'd say we could cover Boolean logic (easy to test on a bread board) and perhaps a bit on the specs of TTL and CMOS (measuring when the input on a logic gate switches from 0 to 1, that sort of stuff). I don't think I'll have to mention the &quot;what is electricity/voltage/current&quot; part as this is pretty straight forward that we start with such a chapter. For the math and theory: how about we'll add some of that as optional chapters? Either as a new (small) chapter outside the table of content (or how I'm supposed to call it) or as a link to the other electronics books?&lt;BR&gt; Transistors can be covert as a switch, but it's hard to come up with a good introduction without using AC, also experiments would require an oscilloscope to be practical. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 15:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

All great suggestions Patrik, I think you have summed it up nicely. We'll see what V2os thinks when they get back. If only I'd spent as much time writing the book as discussing it, we may have already had part of a chapter. Unfortunately, I'm currently too busy to devote much time to it, but I'll help out where I can. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 21:56, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
:I've put together a ruf TOC with some explaination. I'll add it [[Learn Electronics/Appendix|here]] otherwise this page becomes pretty cluttered. I'll wait to see what V2os has to say about it, before writing anything real. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 11:48, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

I'll be interested to see what you come up with Patrik. V2os' comments earlier seem a bit vague, and they ''don't have any measuring equipment, or know how to use it''. So, that would limit our experiments a bit. But, I think we need to explain how to use a multimeter, otherwise we are limited to flashing (or static) lights for feedback. Maybe it would also be better to substitute LEDs (with roughly appropriate current limiting resistors) for the light bulbs, that would be far cheaper, and we could use the breadboard and a 9 V battery to run it (of course the LEDs would only work in one orientation, but the reason why could be explained far later, along with the reason for using the resistor in series). 12:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

I've just looked at your TOC, and it looks good to me. Maybe we should spend even more time at the bottom end though. It may be better to keep the entire book on one page to begin with, so your TOC could be expanded as it is.

:More chapters on digital electronics? That part is going to be the most intresting part anyway. I guess Part one can be kept short and to the point (with most of it being fun experiments) and we can be more elaborate on the second part. V2os intended to use a lot of hands-on stuff, so we could use the experiments to introduce the theory. (boolean algebra in theory is pretty boring, but if we use a few experiments to demonstrate the methodes of boolean algebra, it'll be more intresting.)&lt;BR&gt;
''I guess V2os is going to have a lot to read when he comes back ;-)''
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 12:45, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, I hope we haven't got totally the wrong end of the stick. Hopefully this book doesn't step on [[Electronics]] toes too much, it would be a shame to have to merge (but, we could also call this book [[Electronics:Beginning electronics]]).

:Don't think the auhors of [[Electronics]] are going to have any problems with this wikibook. IMO [[Electronics]] is aimed at a college level, while this one would be aimed at highschool level. Our prerequisits aren't very extensive. The picture I've got of the content would require some knowledge of basic algebra, but little else more as we don't cover any AC related content and so avoid trigonometry, vectors, complex numbers and any more complicated functions. The hardest part would be drawing the function of a RC circuit and boolean algebra is pretty stand alone.&lt;BR&gt; If/when we would start a simular book/part on AC then we'll going to need a bit more math, however this is still going to be limited to simple functions ( u = U * sin (omega * t + phi) would suffice for explaining much of AC), but we'll deal with that after this book is well on its way to completion.--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 15:29, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

'''Do not want to limit scope of book.''' I will be getting hands on stuff done starting in chapter 2.(sorry for leave of absence) I do want this book to go somewhat far (at least into remote control), and be aimed at high school students. I will be getting measuring equipment. if it were to go as far as all of you are suggesting it wouldn't be better than the books at my library. (the transistor is new in them!) give me some time to read this stuff over some more.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 00:48, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I want this to sort of mirror what i'm going to be learning in school, and the classes that promise that you'll be able to create videogame consoles by the end of the class. (I realize I'm not going to be able to contribute too much more to this book since i don't know much about the subject.)--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 16:33, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

If you provide some sort of table of contents, we'll be able to fill in the parts you aren't familiar with. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:00, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

On Geocachernemesis proposed changes i don't know much (maybe anything) about 4,6,7, and 8. To be clear on the AC thing, yes I think we should be doing stuff with AC. (Also I can't find what TOC means and it's mentioned here a lot. could someone tell me what it means?)

:Patrik and I thought that AC (e.g., audio signals, and not just mains) measurements would be too difficult, because they would require the use of an signal generator and an oscilloscope, and we felt that they would be far too expensive for beginners. Even so, there is plenty that can be done with only a multimeter. TOC means table of contents, and I actually prefer Patrik's to mine in some ways. I've also had second thoughts about the use of light bulbs and sockets in the experiments, because they are quite expensive. If we need a breadboard anyway, then why not use LEDs instead, they would be far cheaper?

:Also, we should consider changing the title of the book (as mentioned above), and keeping the book on one page until it grows a bit more (i.e., limit the number of pages created). ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 03:06, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

If you want to cover AC, it'll be much more theoretical. I've got course notes from a 4th year electricity (compares to high school) which covers basic AC in a quite simple way. It limits to single fase AC and simple AC circuits. (I also have college notes which cover it much more in depth, but those would be way too math-intensive). I've done a few experiments without an oscilloscope or signal generator in those classes, but these all came down to measuring voltage and/or current at particular intervals or in some special way. e.g. measuring input and output voltage/current of a transformer as to demonstrate that the product U*I remains constant in both coils. Or measuring the current in a circuit with a lightbulb to demonstrate the temperature dependent resistance of its filament (the wire inside of it).&lt;BR&gt;But when it comes down to demonstrating frequency effects or phase, you'll need a oscilloscope.&lt;BR&gt;Another thing you should keep in mind is safety. These experiments I mentioned use mains power which is dangerous. Especialy to people trying to do an experiment. You could say to use a transformer to make it safer, but not all transformers are really save, there is a variety which doesn't have 2 magnetic coupled coils, but use an AC voltage divider, these devices are cheap and dangerous for use in experiments.&lt;BR&gt;
To summerize the issues with AC:&lt;BR&gt;
*Expensive equipment. (oscilloscope, signal generator)
*Risk of using main power.
*large amount of theory without really room for experiments in between.&lt;BR&gt;
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 12:32, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

I would like some very basic AC stuff, at least explain what AC means, and simulation of it, i think it probably should all be on one page for a while until it gets bigger. I agree with replacing the light bulb and socket with LEDs.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 05:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

The basic AC is pretty easy. I can fill it in later this week (as time permits). If you could provide a link to where I should place it. I personaly would place it at the end of the current TOC, something like &quot;what is AC&quot;, followed by &quot;simple AC circuits with resistors, capacitors and inductors&quot; and then something on transformers, but not very theoretical, more practical oriented material. It's common to teach magnetisme along with AC, but IMO it would be way too theoretical for this book. The final version would contain a lot of graphics, but that isn't going to be in the first edits. Unless I can borrow some from other free sources I'll have to draw them myself or have other contributers draw them. But we'll deal with that when we get there. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)


----------
I probably can contribute for very young beginners, even making it much too simple(?) on purpose. But it may duplicate some items somewhere else. I'm not going to search for any duplications with other articles, and leave that up to other editors, also to merge with other articles. Also, I don't yet know how to do diagrams, nor mathematical formulae - please feel free to add these to my contributions. Thanks.

this also needs some discussion of how we will actually reconstruct the individual authors, that is, looking at the work along the dimensions of their narrative tradition; the socio-political context of their time; the intellectual discourses in which they participated; and the &quot;logical&quot; development within their own work

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter 1, The Basics ==
'''Electronics''' use [[Basic Electrical Generation and Distribution|electric power]].
* A [[Electronics/Batteries|battery]] is a source of electric power.
* A wall socket is a source of a different kind of electric power.
* [[GCSE Science/Advanced static electricity topics|Lightning]] is also a (very dangerous) source of electric power.
* [[GCSE Science/Advanced static electricity topics|Sparks]] while combing some people's hair is called &quot;[[GCSE Science/Static Electricity|Static electricity]]&quot;. Also some rugs can cause static electricity.

===Voltage and Current===

Electronic equipment operates by controlling the flow of electrons. Electrons are part of the atom. The atom also contains neutrons and protons. The number of protons and electrons in an atom are usually equal, but if it is not the atom is called an ion.&lt;ref&gt;If the atom is missing electrons it is said to be positive (cation); if it has extra electrons it is said to be negative (anion). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric current''' is the flow of '''charge''' from one place to another, reminiscent of the way ocean current is the flow of water from one place to another. Charge is like a tiny indivisible packet of electricity, and is carried by electrons. The charge on each electron is fixed, but if more electrons flow in a given time, then more charge is said to be flowing. An electron is a type of '''charge carrier''' - it carries charge, but it is not the only type. Later we will introduce another kind of charge carrier used in all electronics, so while we talk about electrons as the entity that carries charge, keep in mind that the term &quot;charge carrier&quot; is sometimes more appropriate.

Charge is important when we examine semiconductors, which is what real electronics is all about. Charges of the same sign (- and -, or + and +) '''repel''' each other, just as like poles of a magnet do. Conversely, unlike charges (+ and -) '''attract''' each other. This fact is very important. It is this attraction and repulsion of charge that causes charge to move in a conductor, thus creating a current.

Charge flows when there is a difference of '''potential''' between two points in the '''circuit'''. '''Potential difference''' is measured in '''volts''' and is sometimes called '''voltage'''. The larger the potential difference, the larger the flow of charge, all else being equal. A typical ordinary battery creates a potential difference of about 1.5 volts between its terminals. If the battery is not connected to anything, the potential difference is still there, and can be measured with a voltmeter. Only when a circuit is formed between the terminals of the battery will a path exist for electrons to flow, and electrons will be caused to flow. Current and voltage are linked by '''Ohm's Law''', which is a very simple linear relationship.

Once it was believed that electrons traveled from the positive side of a battery to the negative side. However, when the technology was there to test this it was proven that electrons actually traveled from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal. When talking about circuits and designing them, we use '''conventional current''', which we measure as if charge flows from positive to negative - for practical purposes, the fact that the electrons really go the other way does not make any difference. The rest of this book follows standard practise and always assumes conventional current.

Current is measured in '''amperes''' or '''amps''' for short, though 1 amp is quite a large current so usually milliamps (1 thousandth of an amp) or microamps (1 millionth of an amp) are often used, especially in electronics.

To summarise: Current is the flow of charge. That charge can be thought of as flowing ''along'' the conductor. Voltage or potential difference is the force that gives rise to the current, and appears ''across'' a pair of points in a circuit, such as the terminals of a battery.


'''Conductors:'''
Conductors are materials that are packed full of easily-movable electrons. All metals are conductors. All materials offer some resistance but that shouldn't matter for now as long as you're not using any extremely long lengths of wire.

'''Open/Closed/Short Circuit:'''
An open circuit is one where there is a physical gap in the wire which does not allow charge to pass. A closed circuit is the path charge travels from one terminal of the battery to the other. A short circuit is where something like a piece of metal would fall onto two or more pieces of metal attached to the circuit and change the flow of electricity, resulting in undesired operation of the electronic device.

'''Circuit Diagrams:'''
It would be nearly impossible to take a picture of a complicated electronic circuit and expect people to build the same one. To solve this problem, circuit diagrams are used. In circuit diagrams wires are represented by lines. When lines cross over each other they may be connected depending on how the diagram is drawn.

''Example 1: Lines that intersect each other connect, and wires that have a loop where they cross are not connected'' [[Image:LearnElectronics-Images-Chapter1-diagram1.PNG]]

''Example 2: Lines that intersect each other do not connect. and lines that have a dot where they intersect are connected.'' [[Image:LearnElectronics-images-chapter1-Diagram2.PNG]]

I'll try to make this book use the second example but remember to pay attention to circuit diagrams for things like that.

===Electric power, energy, temperature, heat sinks, thermal resistance, and thermal capacitance===

Light bulbs, for example, are rated at 25 Watt (W), 60 W, 100 W, etc. That is the '''Power''' they use if and whenever they are switched on, never mind the length of time they are on.

A 100 W light bulb that is switched on uses '''Energy''' at the rate of 100 Watthours(Wh) per hour (Wh/h), 100 Wh if one hour, 200 Wh if 2 hours, etc. One Kilowatthour(kWh) is 1000 Wh.
Light from lightbulbs is only one of several forms of energy. Another form is heat. Heat is related to temperature.

There is a close relationship between energy and '''temperature'''. Electronic devices, such as diodes or transistors, have a &quot;rating&quot; of a number of Watts (W) at a given device temperature that must not be exceeded to prevent damage. For example in data sheets for transistors often there is a graph showing the collector current versus the collector-emitter voltage for different base currents. Always add, if it isn't there already, the power curve. For example, if a power transistor is rated at 50 W, then one point of this curve would be 10 Volt (V) x 5 Amperes (A), another 5V x 10 A, etc. If the outside temperature is higher, or there isn't a free flow of cooling air, then the power rating will be lower - this is called &quot;derating&quot;. Often electronic equipment includes an internal fan to keep the temperature down to below rated limits under all reasonable operating conditions.

'''[[w:Heat sink]]s''' are very important; they are used to reduce the temperature of the electronic device. This is done by mounting the device on a heat sink, usually via a heat-conducting chemical paste, and, if necessary, insulating heat-conducting washers, permitting as much heat as possible to be conducted from the device to the heat sink. The heat sink, which has a comparatively large surface area in touch with not only the device, but also with cooling air, then transfers its heat to that air, thus keeping the device's temperature lower than it would be without the heat sink, and also permitting therefore a larger power rating, and a larger current rating, without causing any damage to the device.

Just as electrical resistance (in DC circuits) is voltage divided by current (Volts per Ampere), similarly [[w:Thermal resistance|'''&quot;thermal resistance&quot;''']] is defined as degrees Celsius difference per Watt. Also '''[[w:Heat capacity|&quot;thermal capacitance&quot;]]''' is defined as Wattseconds per degree Celsius.

== Hands On ==

'''Basic light bulb circuit:'''
You will need a battery, low power light bulb with socket, and some wire.

== Understanding the Parts ==

[[image:batteries.jpg|framed|Real batteries]]
'''Battery: '''
Batteries use internal stored chemical energy to push electrons from one end to the other.
The battery will run out eventually when it uses up all its internal stored energy.

Circuit Diagram for battery: [[Image:Battery.png]]
[[image:Solderless Breadboard with LEDs.jpg|right|thumb|200px|solderless breadboard with LEDs and battery]]
'''Light Bulb:'''
(I plan on using an LED for the light as it does not need a socket and works with a breadboard) (what's a breadboard?)
A breadboard is a plastic board with lots of holes, which electronic components pins are pushed into. The holes are electrically connected in lines. (e.g. all the vertical lines are connected together).
([[Practical Electronics/Breadboard]])

'''Wires'''

Wires simply provide a pathway for electric current to travel

== Assembly ==
Now it's time to start building this circuit.

Connect one terminal of the battery to one terminal of the light bulb socket, and the other terminal of the battery to the other terminal of the light bulb socket. That's your first circuit.

[[Image:Resistor symbol.png]][[Image:resistors-photo.JPG|thumb|right|222px|Real Resistors]]

== Materials ==

== [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|Voltage]] Drop ==
* Think of a bucket full of water; nothing happens yet, if there is no hole at the bottom of the bucket. The height of the water in the bucket represents the electrical '''voltage'''.
* If there is a hole at the bottom of the bucket, then water will flow out of it. That water flow represents electric [[current]] [[FHSST Physics Electricity:Flow of Charge|flow]].
* If the source of the '''voltage''' is a battery, then, in time, the battery's '''voltage''' will be reduced until there is no '''voltage''' left, just as the level of the water in the bucket will get lower and lower until no water is left in the bucket, with zero level.
* If the source of the '''voltage''' is the socket in the wall, then the '''voltage''' will remain about the same; normally there will be only slight changes of that kind of '''voltage'''.

The voltage is the source of the current, and the current has some purpose, it flows through what is called a &quot;load&quot;, which may be one or more [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]]. No current flows through a resistor or equivalent, unless there is a voltage acrosss the two terminals of the resistor. If there are at least 2 resistors, or equivalent, in series (like a river flowing via 3 points) then the voltage across each resistor is called '''voltage drop'''. Think of a river passing via points A, B, and C, where A is highest and C is lowest. There is a difference in the elevations/levels, with B minus A representing a '''voltage drop''', and C minus B being like another '''voltage drop'''. The sum of all of the '''voltage drops''' in a circuit always equals the supply voltage, such as the battery voltage.

== [[Electronics/Ohm's Law|Ohms Law]] ==
'''Resistors:'''
[[Electronics/Resistors|Resistors]] &quot;resist&quot; the flow of electricity, reducing the amount of the current (measured in units called amps). Without a resistor in the circuit the current would be too high, you would ruin parts of the circuit, use up the battery too fast, or even blow the battery. Since resistors are too small to print numbers on them they are labeled with color coded bands that have to be interpreted. Resistors have 3 or 4 colorbands on them, but only the first 3 matter for now. The fourth one is either silver or gold. Silver means it is 10% above or below the value shown by the first 3 bands, while gold means 5% above or below. The first 2 bands represent a one decimal number, the third represents the number of zeros that follow.


[[Electronics/Resistors|Resistors]] follow '''Ohm's Law''': '''&lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;''' ('''''V'''=Voltage, '''I'''=Current (in amps), '''R'''=Resistance (in ohms)'')

[[Electronics/Ohm's Law|Ohm's law]] is important to remember since most electronic components have a maximum and minimum voltage and amp rating: if they're too low it wouldn't work, and if they're too high it will destroy the component. As long as you have at least two values you can solve for the last one.

A trick to remember is that the decimal number of a color band is equal to the amount of zeros added to the end if it's the third band.

== Series &amp; Parallel ==

(need circuit diagram of resistors in parallel and in series)

Definition of series: In electronics when something is connected in series like a resistor it means that you have resistors that are in a &quot;line&quot;. The resistors are connected end to end.

Definition of Parallel: The same wire is connected to one end of all the parts in parallel and another wire is connected to the other end of all the parts in parallel.

(Math for resistors in series and parallel):

Resistors in series: Add their values (in Ohms) to obtain the total resistance of their combination.

Resistors in parallel: The reciprocal (means: one divided by) of the total resistance of the combination of two resistors R1 and R2 is
           1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2,    also l/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3  if there are 3, and so on.

Resistors are very useful in electronic design.

== My guide ==

I created a personal guide for creating new books at [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide]]. This guide represents my own personal opinions on the matter, but I think it is a helpful resource nonetheless. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:46, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

== Can I do this...? ==

I currently run an Open Source C++ project, and I was wondering if I would be allowed to start a new book documenting the usage of functions and methods in this project. It could be considered a way to make users familiar with the code. Thanks. --[[User:XTZGZoReX|- Zor]] ([[User talk:XTZGZoReX|talk]]) 08:26, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

: This is a gray area. Please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for more information. You should raise this in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General|general reading room]] with more details about this project. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:36, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

== Can I do this? (2) ==

Would I be allowed to put together a collection of homework questions and their explained answers? Many of these questions are from textbooks (not verbatim, but close enough), and sometimes pictures are included from the textbook, or the online homework problem. Would I be allowed to include the questions, the pictures (from a book or online source), and (obviously) the answers? Also, if I'm not allowed to use their pictures, would I be allowed to reconstruct my own, and use those? [[User:Maslen|Maslen]] ([[User talk:Maslen|talk]]) 14:04, 4 November 2010 (UTC)
:Copying any other material unless it is appropriately licensed to allow copying, or public domain, is forbidden by copyright law. The same applies to images. Even if the text is free to copy, often the images are not. As a book, your idea is fine, but you need to find a way of constructing it without breaching somebody else's copyright. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for more information. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

::Could you please give a yes/no answer in regards to whether I'd be allowed to add the questions from other sources ( if not verbatim, with my own pictures)? [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] doesn't seem to be particularly clear on this topic. [[User:Maslen|Maslen]] ([[User talk:Maslen|talk]]) 14:59, 4 November 2010 (UTC)
:::[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] and the [[Scouting]] book both incorporate verbatim questions from a published source and provide answers created by the community.  The amount of text in the answers far exceeds the amount in the questions.  Illustrations are a more dodgy topic.  I have seen images deleted from the Commons because they were reproductions of some other copyrighted work.  Wikibooks hosts few images (we limit that to fair-use images, because the Commons won't host them).  Wikibook's upload page redirects to the Commons where there are people well-versed in those questions.  You could take that up with them and see what they say. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:23, 4 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

=Lesson 1 - Alphabet and pronunciation=
The Slovio language can be written either using Latin alphabet based on English, which is purely ASCII, or using a cyrillic alphabet, which is based on Russian. This guide will mostly use the Latin alphabet for simplicity and not to overwhelm learners, but you should familiarize yourself with cyrillic as well. This is the basic Slovio alphabet, both in Latin and the corresponding cyrillic:

 A  B  C  Cx  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  R  S  Sx  T  U  V  Z  Zx
 А  Б  Ц  Ч   Д  Е  Ф  Г  Х  И  Й  К  Л  М  Н  О  П  Р  С  Ш   Т  У  В  З  Ж

 a  b  c  cx  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  r  s  sx  t  u  v  z  zx
 а  б  ц  ч   д  е  ф  г  х  и  й  к  л  м  н  о  п  р  с  ш   т  у  в  з  ж

cx, sx, and zx are always represented by two characters in conjunction and form only one letter each.

&lt;div style=&quot;width:25%;font-size:x-small;float:right; border:1px solid black;padding:0.5em;background:#FFFFE5&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;font-weight:bold;font-size:large&quot;&gt;! TIP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Slovak and Polish speakers
* '''cx'''  = '''ч, č, cz''' 
* '''sx'''  = '''ш, š, sz'''
* '''zx'''  = '''ж, ž, ż'''  
* '''gx'''  = '''дж, џ, dž, dż'''
* '''wx'''  =  '''щ, шт, шј, št, ś, ć, šč, szcz'''
&lt;/div&gt;

Vowels are pronounced the same way they would be in German or  Polish.

{|cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0
|'''a''' || - || c'''a'''r
|-
|'''e''' || - || b'''e'''t
|-
|'''i''' || - || s'''ee'''
|-
|'''o''' || - || b'''o'''ld
|-
|'''u''' || - || f'''oo'''t
|}

Consonant pronunciation:

{|cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0
|'''b''' || - || '''b'''old
|-
|'''c''' || - || ca'''ts'''
|-
|'''cx''' || - || '''ch'''eese
|-
|'''d''' || - || '''d'''og
|-
|'''f''' || - || '''f'''ood
|-
|'''g''' || - || '''g'''old
|-
|'''h''' || - || '''h'''ome
|-
|'''j''' || - || '''y'''es
|-
|'''k''' || - || '''k'''ing
|-
|'''l''' || - || '''l'''etter
|-
|'''m''' || - || '''m'''oon
|-
|'''n''' || - || '''n'''oon
|-
|'''p''' || - || '''p'''encil
|-
|'''r''' || - || '''r'''oll
|-
|'''s''' || - || '''s'''un
|-
|'''sx''' || - || '''sh'''oe
|-
|'''t''' || - || '''t'''eam
|-
|'''v''' || - || '''v'''anilla
|-
|'''z''' || - || '''z'''oo
|-
|'''zx''' || - || plea'''s'''ure
|}

As in most Slavic languages, '''r''' should be rolled. 

'''J''' is used only in some cases:
# When '''j''' sound is at the beginning of the word.
# In suffixes like ''-ju'', ''-just'', etc.

Otherwise, '''i''' is used to represent that sound.

Slovio also includes several optional letters, mainly for expressing sounds of foreign words:
:Gx  Wx  X
:Дж  Щ   Кс

'''Gx''' is used to present the sound that would be formed by &quot;dzx&quot;, as in '''''G'''eor'''g'''e''. '''Wx''' is used to present the &quot;sxcx&quot; sound, as in ''Yu'''shch'''enko''. '''X''', if used apart from '''cx''', '''sx''' or '''zx''', is equivalent to &quot;ks&quot;, as in ''bo'''x'''''.

== Pronunciation and stresses ==

In cases of vowel combination (like ''ai'', ''oi'', ''io'', ''uo'', etc.) it is recommended to pronounce the combination as one diphthong. 

It is recommended to accent the penultimate syllable (the syllable before the last one).

      <comment>/* Understanding C++ */ +wouldn't mind throwing some ideas around</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding C++ ==

I see you've decided that you'd like to contribute to the Understanding C++ book. I definitely want to encourage you to contribute and hope we can work together. To that end I'd like to inform you a little bit about the intention of the book. The book is intended to be for people who already know how to use a computer fairly well. Like how to navigate whatever OS they use, run programs, and know how to get new programs on there computer. So basic computer knowledge in other words.

What the book doesn't assume though is the reader know what programs consist of, how they do their work and why they would need to learn a language like C++ if they want to learn to make programs, which is what [[Understanding C++/Introduction]] is for. I think that might be similar in purpose to the Computer and Programming languages chapter. However the main difference is that I didn't think it would be helpful to people who've decided to learn C++ to be distracted by material about other programming languages.

The different programming paradigms wasn't really something I had thought about covering because I thought that could be distracting as well, and thought if they were to be covered at all they would be covered as the book progresses. Like functional programming might be touched a bit in the chapter on Functions.

You may have also noticed the focus is on standard C++ only, this is intended to keep this book very focused and helpful for beginners. I hope this book can made to be both fun to read and interesting to read at the same time. In my own experience with programming book, when they are not too dry, have a lot of illustrations and provide a lot of fun examples, I learned quicker, and that is what my hope is for this book too.

I saw what you said in the reading room and I do agree with most of it. I just don't think the C++ for dummies book is a good example to follow, because I like a lot of people that I'm aware of in the C++ community, don't think that book teaches how to use C++ correctly. I don't intend to have any specific size limit for this book, but I do know there are some well written C++ programming books that are less than 1,000 pages, and some poorly written C++ programming books over 1,000 pages, so to me size isn't a good measure or indicator of how good a book is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:22, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

Oh also, I wouldn't mind discussing and throwing ideas around about how to approach teaching standard C++. I only have a few basic things in place that I'd like to keep. The Core section, which to me is intended for things like variables (which includes arrays and pointers), functions, classes, control flow, templates, exceptions, etc. with a taste of the standard library and other concepts important to C++ programming. The advance section for things like lists, trees, hash tables, basic ways to optimize program that don't depend on what compiler is used and the like, etc. The standard library section for understanding how to use everything in the standard library like string, map, stacks, queues, sets, etc. which hopefully by the time a person reads this section they will have already a pretty good grasp of how they work. Besides what each section of the book should contain I haven't really figured out yet where to begin with teaching C++, as can be seen by how basically the only thing present being an introductory to programming. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:48, 16 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

=Lesson 2 - Introducing youself=

Please take a look at how Ana might introduce herself:

:&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Imenijm Ana. Ja es ucxnik.''&lt;/span&gt;

Vocabulary:
 imenit - name (verb, &quot;to be named&quot;)
 ja     - I
 es     - to be
 ucxnik - student

Ana introduced herself with &quot;imenijm Ana&quot;, meaning &quot;my name is Ana&quot;. ''Imenijm'' is the first person singular form of the verb &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''imenit''&lt;/span&gt; in the present tense. In this case, it was unnecessary to use personal pronoun ''ja'' (I), as it would be in most Slavic languages, as it is assumed that subject is &quot;ja&quot; from the verb suffix ''-ijm''.

== Verb conjugation (delaslovju koniugenie) ==

Verbs are conjugated by adding a suffix to the stem of the word. Stems are formed by removing the infinitive ending '''-t''' (if the stem ends in ''o''), '''-it''' (if it ends in a consonant) or '''-vit''' (if it ends in ''a'', ''e'', ''i'' or ''u''). The verb endings for the present tense are: ijm, ijsx, ijt, ime, ite and ijut, if the word ends in a consonant as seen in this example:

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;| Slovio
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;| English
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijm'''
| width=&quot;50%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |my name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijsx'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |your name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijt'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |her, his, its name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ime''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |our name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ite'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |your (plural) name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijut''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |their name is
|}

So, for example:
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC&quot; &gt;Mlodic imenijt Dusxan.&lt;/span&gt; - Boy is named Dushan. (literal translation)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC&quot; &gt;Imenime Vikibuks.&lt;/span&gt;      - Our name is Wikibooks.

Words that end in a vowel lose '''i''' in the ending, so the endings are: -jm, -jsx, -jt, -me, -te and -jut. The use of '''i''' in such cases is optional, but it is easier to omit it. For example: dela'''t''' (to work), would be delajm, delajsx, delajt, delame, delate or delajut.

== Pronouns (zamenslovis) ==

Pronouns in Slovio appear in three forms:
# Subject (nominative)
# Object
# Possessive

This is a table of pronouns when they are in the subject position:

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Singular
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Plural
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ja''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |I 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''mi''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |we
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ti'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |you
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''vi'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |you (pl.)
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''to''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |3rd person 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''oni'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |they
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''on'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |he
|
|
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ona'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |she
|
|
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ono'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |it
|
|
|-
| colspan=&quot;4&quot; bgcolor=&quot;antiquewhite&quot;|Please take a look at '''to'''. It is a gender neutral form of third person singular, and can be used to designate either he, she or it. Plural equivalent, '''oni''' is also gender neutral.
|}

== Verb 'to be' (delaslov 'but') == 

Conjugation of the verb 'to be' in slovio is very easy, it is '''es''' in every case. If the verb is used without a pronoun, verb personal ending (see above section) is added to the stem '''es'''.

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Slovio
!  bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|English
!  bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Without pronoun
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; width=&quot;33%&quot;|ja es 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; width=&quot;33%&quot;|I am 
| bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot; width=&quot;34%&quot;|esijm
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ti es 
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | you are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot; | esijsx
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |to es 
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | he/she/it is 
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |on es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | he is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ona es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| she is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ono es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| it is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |mi es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | we are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esime
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |vi es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | you are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esite
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |oni es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| they are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijut
|}

For example, Ana said:
:&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Ja es ucxnik.''&lt;/span&gt;

Meaning ''I am a student.'' She also could have said &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Esijm ucxnik''&lt;/span&gt;.

Could you have a look at [[:pl:Hiszpański]]. It is the base for language textbooks, which might help you with building this student's book, and making it easy to understand, etc. [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 09:36, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

{{book title|Civil Procedure|Overview of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (with selected Arizona Rules)}}

Most law school students learn the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted in their entirety by many States, although a significant number US states (including California, New York and Pennsylvania) have distinctively different Rules of Civil Procedure. Even if the text of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not adopted in its entirety by a state, the state may end up using the same numbering system. Even though the Federal Rules allow lawyers to easily adapt to practice in new jurisdictions, it is important to read the local rules of civil procedure.    

Most law schools teach civil procedure by teaching the concept of jurisdiction before teaching the technical rules. 

Wikibooks asks for discussion of this topic, but there really isn't much to discuss.  Civil Procedure, or CivPro as it's known to law students, simply describes the process by which civil (not criminal, that's a different set of rules) cases are brought into the court system and how they are handled procedurally once they are in the system. CivPro gives detailed rules for such issues as how to start a law case, what sort of notice you must give to the other party and how, how to tell the judge that you want him or her to do something, what information you are entitled to get from the other party or parties and how to do it (the process called discovery), how to conduct civil trials, and the like.  

A civil case is one in which one party or group of parties, usually not the government, sues another party or group of parties claiming they did or about to do something wrong.  The wrongs sued about are generally in three categories: tort, contract, and other.

Contract actions are, as the term suggests, about enforcing (or not enforcing) contracts.  Often these are written contracts, but oral contracts are perfectly legal and enforceable IF the court can decide exactly what the terms agreed on were: the problem with oral contracts is not whether they are enforceable, but what the actual contract was, since usually party A says one thing and party B says another.

Tort actions are seeking redress for some wrong done by another person (legally a person includes corporations, governments, etc.)  Tort claims can range widely, from suing over damages from a dog bite to auto accidents to a branch from your tree falling on my roof to your borrowing my lawnmower and not returning it to almost anything you can think of, including asking the courts to award you millions of dollars for a business temporarily losing a pair of your pants.  (Don't laugh, it happened.)

The civil courts also deal with many sorts of cases that are neither contract or tort.  The list is almost endless, but includes such things as divorces, paternity cases, landlord-tenant disputes, probate (settling estates), ordering a parent to force a child to undergo medical treatment the parents are resisting, injunctions (asking the court to order someone to stop doing something they are doing or not to do something they plan to do), and on and on.  

Basically, any action that isn't the government bringing criminal charges against a person is a civil action.  

The Rules of Civil Procedure, by the way, are only one of the sets of rules that govern the practice of law.  Most (maybe all except Louisiana) states have many sets of rules, governing for example criminal courts, appellate courts, general rules applicable to all situations, and many other sets of rules.  And most local courts have their own set of rules which supplement the state rules.  

== Jurisdiction ==

Federal courts have two forms of jurisdiction.  General jurisdiction covers normal civil litigation subject to two conditions.  One, the two parties must come from two different states.  Two, the damages claimed in the lawsuit must exceed $75,000.  What this means is that, so long as both participants are US citizens, a general jurisdiction case can be heard in at least one state court as well.  Either party can move for removal of the case to Federal court, which they may do for a variety of strategic reasons.  Federal courts often have a shorter docket, meaning that the case may be heard more quickly than in state court.  

Courts also have subject matter jurisdiction, which means that the federal courts have the power to hear the particular type of case regardless of the requirements of general jurisdiction.  A short list of the type of claims that can be heard in federal court because of subject matter jurisdiction: copyright claims, civil rights claims, bankruptcy cases, and admiralty claims.

Once jurisdiction is found, the claim advances to the pleading stage of the pre-trial.

== Pleadings ==

Unlike many state courts, the federal courts have a simplified pleading system called notice pleading.  Notice pleading requires a “short and plain statement of claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief” in the complaint.  The complaint is met with the answer, which is a document that admits or denies the allegations made in the complaint, as well as making any counter-claims the defendant may have against the defendant (any counter-claim, though it is required that any counter claim arising from the same incident be litigated in the same trial).

A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint in writing before the trial court '''(Rule 3).'''  
The filing is made at the trial court clerk's office.  
A complaint is one of the allowed pleadings.  
The plaintiff's claim against a defendant is contained in the complaint.  
There are two types of pleadings: reclamatory and responsive pleadings.  
The complaint is a reclamatory pleading.  
The answer to the complaint is a responsive pleading.&lt;br&gt;
A pleading must contain a short and plain statement '''(Rule 8(a)):'''
* of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, unless it already has jurisdiction and needs no new grounds to support it
** Subject matter jurisdiction is based on: 
# Federal nature of the claim (claims “arising under” the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the U.S.) 
# Diversity of citizenship
; Venue : place of trial
; Personal jurisdiction : the court must have the power to render judgment against a defendant
* of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief
* a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks

UNLESS you are alleging fraud or mistake - then you must plead the specific circumstances '''(Rule 9(b)).'''

A pleading must be:
* in numbered paragraphs by allegation '''(Rule 10(b))'''
* signed by at least one attorney of record '''(Rule 11(a))'''
* certified by the attorney that it is presented after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances '''(Rule 11(b))''' and
** it is not being presented for improper purpose, such as to harass, delay, or add costs '''(Rule 11(b)(1))'''
** the claims, defenses, and legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension of the law or establishment of new law '''(Rule 11(b)(2))'''
** the allegations and factual contentions have evidentiary support – or are likely to have support after discovery '''(Rule 11(b)(3))'''

A pleading does not have to be consistent, it can contain alternative theories '''(Rule 8(e)(2)).'''

Service of the summons and complaint must be made within 120 days after filing '''(Rule 4(m)).'''


'''SUMMONS AND WAIVER OF SERVICE – RULE 4'''

Upon or after filing complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal '''(Rule 1(b)).''' 

Summons shall be served together with a copy of the complaint '''(Rule 4(c)(1)).'''

OR 

Plaintiff can notify defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waiver service '''(Rule 4(d)(2)).'''

The notice and request must:
* be in writing and addressed directly to the defendant '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(A))'''
* be dispatched through first-class mail or other reliable means '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(B))'''
* be accompanied by a copy of complaint and identify the court in which it was filed '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(C))'''
* inform defendant the consequences of compliance or refusal '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(D))'''
* set forth the date on which the request was sent '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(E))'''
* allow a reasonable time for return – 30 days from which it was sent '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(F))'''
* provide an extra copy of notice and request and pre-paid means of compliance in writing '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(G))'''

If defendant refuses waiver, he must pay plaintiff costs, including reasonable attorney fees to collect costs.

Defendant must answer within 21 days after being served with complaint '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(A)).'''

If service of summons is waived – the defendant must answer within 60 days after the request for waiver was sent '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(B)).'''

 
'''DEFENDANT PRE-ANSWER MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Defendant may make these pre-answer motions:
* Motion for more definite statement '''(Rule 12(e))''' – (if granted, plaintiff must reply 10 days after notice of order) 
* Motion to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter '''(Rule 12(f))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)

Also, the following defenses may, at the option of the pleader, be made by motion '''(Rule 12(b)):'''
* lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter '''(Rule 12(b)(1))'''
* lack of jurisdiction over the person '''(Rule 12(b)(2))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* improper venue '''(Rule 12(b)(3))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* insufficiency of process '''(Rule 12(b)(4))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* insufficiency of service of process '''(Rule 12(b)(5))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted '''(Rule 12(b)(6))'''
* failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''' '''(Rule 12(b)(7))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost.  EXCEPTIONS: '''Rule 12(b)(6):''' failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted AND '''Rule 12(b)(1):''' lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter - (these can be raised at any time)).

Defendant must answer within 10 days after denial or postponement of motion '''(Rule 12(a)(4)(A)).'''


'''DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM FAILURE TO ANSWER – RULE 55'''

If defendant fails to answer, the plaintiff may bring an affidavit of this fact to the clerk of the court, who will enter the party’s default.

Plaintiff must show that:
# the complaint was served properly, and
# the defendant did not answer '''(Rule 55(a))'''

If claim is for a sum certain, the clerk can enter default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(1)).'''

If claim is for uncertain amount, the party entitled to judgment by default must apply to the court for damages '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

However, the court can set aside the entry of default for good cause with a motion filed within one year under '''Rule 60(b)''' - '''(Rule 55(c))''' [Reasons: mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect or fraud].

If the defendant has appeared in the action – s/he is entitled to a 3-day written notice of the application for default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''
 
Defendant must answer within 21 days after being served with complaint '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(A)).''' (was 20 days, prior to 2007 amendments; is also calculated as calendar days unless final day falls on a court holiday/weekend; then it's due the next court day). 

If service of summons is waived – the defendant must answer within 60 days after the request for waiver was sent '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(B)).'''

Defendant must answer within 21 days after denial or postponement of motion '''(Rule 12(a)(4)(A)).''' (was 10 days, before 2007 amendments)


'''ANSWER – RULE 8'''

Defendant must state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted in the complaint '''(Rule 8(b)).''' - (UNLESS you are alleging fraud or mistake - then you must state the specific circumstances '''(Rule 9(b))''').

Defendant must specifically admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge or information to each of the allegations upon which the plaintiff relies '''(Rule 8(b)).'''

General denials are not allowed – must specify which part is denied and which part is admitted '''(Rule 9(b)).'''

Without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth = denial '''(Rule 9(b))''' &lt;br&gt;
Failure to deny = admittance '''(Rule 8(d))'''

Answer must set forth affirmative defenses (“true, but…”) such as: accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel (issue preclusion), failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, ''res judicata'' (claim preclusion), statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense '''(Rule 8(c)).'''

An answer does not have to be consistent, it can contain alternative theories '''(Rule 8(e)(2)).''' 

 
'''POST-ANSWER PLAINTIFF MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Plaintiff may make these post-answer motions:
* Motion for judgment on the pleadings = (&quot;so what?&quot;) – (cannot include matters outside of the pleadings.  If you do, then it is treated as '''Rule 56''' summary judgment '''(Rule 12(c))''')
* Motion to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter '''(Rule 12(f))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost). 


'''POST-ANSWER DEFENDANT MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Defendant may make these post-answer motions:
* Motion for judgment on the pleadings = (&quot;so what?&quot;) – (cannot include matters outside of the pleadings - if you do, then it is treated as '''Rule 56''' summary judgment '''(Rule 12(c))''')
* lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter '''(Rule 12(b)(1))'''
* failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted '''(Rule 12(b)(6))''' – (cannot look beyond the pleadings, cannot attach evidence - if you attach documents, then it will be treated as a motion for '''Rule 56''' summary judgment)
* failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''' '''(Rule 12(b)(7))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost.  EXCEPTIONS: '''Rule 12(b)(6):''' failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted AND '''Rule 12(b)(1):''' lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter - (these can be raised at any time))


'''COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM – RULE 13'''

Compulsory Counterclaims: A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which, at the time of serving the pleading, the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require, for its adjudication, the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction '''(Rule 13(a)).'''

Permissive Counterclaims: A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim '''(Rule 13(b)).'''

Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading: A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading '''(Rule 13(e)).'''

Omitted Counterclaim: When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may, by leave of court, set up the counterclaim by amendment '''(Rule 13(f)).'''
 
At least 21 days before a scheduling conference is held or scheduling order is due under '''Rule 16(b).''' 


'''RULE 26(f) CONFERENCE – PLANNING FOR DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY'''

Parties must confer to consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, to make or arrange for the disclosures required by '''Rule 26(a)(1),''' and to develop a proposed discovery plan that indicates the parties' views and proposals concerning: 
# what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement for disclosures under '''Rule 26(a)''', including a statement as to when disclosures under '''Rule 26(a)(1)''' were made or will be made; 
# the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused upon particular issues; 
# what changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed; and 
# any other orders that should be entered by the court under '''Rule 26(c)''' or under '''Rules 16(b)''' and '''(c)'''

Parties must attempt in good faith to agree on the proposed discovery plan, and submit a written report outlining the plan within 14 days after the conference. 

Pre-Discovery Disclosure must be within 14 days after the '''Rule 26(f)''' conference.


'''FEDERAL PRE-DISCOVERY DISCLOSURE – RULE 26(a)(1)'''

Each party, without waiting for a discovery request, must provide to the other parties:
* (A) the name, address, and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment (note, however, that you are rolling the dice that the judge will agree that it is solely for impeachment and not, instead, an affirmative defense), identifying the subjects of the information; 
* (B) a copy of, or a description by category and location of, all documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment; 
* (C) a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party, making available for inspection and copying, as under '''Rule 34''', the documents or other evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from disclosure, on which such computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and 
* (D) for inspection and copying, as under '''Rule 34''', any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. 

Disclosure of Expert Testimony '''(Rule 26(a)(2)):'''

* An expert witness is someone who is specially employed to provide testimony '''(Rule 26(a)(2)(B))'''
* Must disclose the identity of expert witnesses '''(Rule 26(a)(2)(A))'''
* Must include written report signed by witness.
** This report must contain:
*** a complete statement of opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefore,
*** the data and other information considered by the witness in forming the opinion,
*** any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions,
*** the qualifications of witness,
*** a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years,
*** the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony,
*** a listing of any other cases in which the witness has testified at trial or by deposition within the preceding four years
* There is work product protection for the non-testifying expert, unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

Disclosures of expert witnesses must be made at least 90 days before the trial date – or if used solely to contradict, within 30 days after the disclosure is made by the other party.
 
[Arizona pre-discovery disclosure must be made within 40 days after defendant’s answer (AZ Rule 26.1(b)(1)).]


'''ARIZONA PRE-DISCOVERY DISCLOSURE – RULE 26.1(a)'''

(1) The factual basis of the claim or defense. In the event of multiple claims or defenses, the

reasonable understanding of the claim or defense, citations of pertinent legal or case authorities. &lt;br&gt;
(3) The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any witnesses whom the disclosing party
expects to call at trial with a fair description of the substance of each witness' expected testimony. &lt;br&gt;

information relevant to the events, transactions, or occurrences that gave rise to the action, and
the nature of the knowledge or information each such individual is believed to possess. &lt;br&gt;
(5) The names and addresses of all persons who have given statements, whether written or
recorded, signed or unsigned, and the custodian of the copies of those statements. &lt;br&gt;
(6) The name and address of each person whom the disclosing party expects to call as an
expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, a summary of the
grounds for each opinion, the qualifications of the witness and the name and address of the
custodian of copies of any reports prepared by the expert. &lt;br&gt;
(7) A computation and the measure of damage alleged by the disclosing party and the documents
or testimony on which such computation and measure are based and the names, addresses,

(8) The existence, location, custodian, and general description of any tangible evidence or relevant
documents that the disclosing party plans to use at trial and relevant insurance agreements. &lt;br&gt;
(9) A list of the documents or list of the categories of documents, known by a party to exist whether or not in the party's possession, custody or control and which that party believes may be relevant to the subject matter of the action, and those which appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and the date(s) upon which those documents will be made, or have been made, available for inspection and copying. Unless good cause is stated for not doing so, a copy of each document listed shall be served with the disclosure. If production is not made, the name and address of the custodian of the document shall be indicated. A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business. &lt;br&gt;

If feasible, counsel shall meet to exchange disclosures; otherwise, the disclosures shall be served as provided by Rule 5 - (AZ Rule 26.1(b)(1))

The duty shall be a continuing duty, and each party shall make additional or amended disclosures whenever new or different information is discovered or revealed. Such additional or amended disclosures shall be made seasonably, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the information is revealed to or discovered by the disclosing party (AZ Rule 26.1 B)

(AZ Rule 26.1 F)

Each party must serve the other a copy of all medical records relevant to the condition, which is the subject matter of the action. (Rule 26.2 A)
 
Parties may not seek discovery until Rule 26 (f) conference. (Rule 26 D)


'''DISCOVERY – RULES 26, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, and 45'''

Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party (in pleadings).  Relevant information need not be admissible at trial '''(Rule 26(b)).'''

Parties may obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property under '''Rules 34''' or '''45(a)(1)(C)''', for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission '''(Rule 26(a)(5)).'''

* The Rule above '''(Rule 35(b)(1))''' also applies to examinations made by agreement between the parties and not by motion of the court – unless the agreement between the parties expressly provides otherwise '''(Rule 35(b)(3))'''

 
'''DISCOVERY (Continued) – RULES 26, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, and 45'''

Requests for admission – '''Rule 36:'''
* Only for parties to the action '''(Rule 36(a))'''
* Once admitted, the issue is no longer in dispute '''(Rule 36(b))''' 
* Failure to respond is the same as admission '''(Rule 36(a))'''
* Admissions can only be used for the pending action and may not be used for any other proceeding '''(Rule 36(b))'''
* Admissions must be made within 30 days '''(Rule 36(a))'''

* Sanctions are limited under '''Rule 37''' to attorney fees and costs; however, if the opposing party has not responded at all to discovery, then the court may order additional sanctions '''(Rule 37(c))'''

Defenses to Discovery requests '''(Rule 26(c)):'''
* Discovery that is only for annoyance, embarrassment, oppression '''(Rule 26(c))'''
* Discovery that causes undue burden or expense '''(Rule 26(c))'''
* Privileged information – must file motion for protective order '''(Rule 26(c)):'''
** Physician-patient information
** Attorney work product '''(Rule 26(b)(3))''':
*** Documents or tangible things prepared by other party’s attorney, consultant, agent, or insurer in anticipation of litigation 
*** Test to see if it is attorney work product = First, &quot;is it relevant?&quot; If yes…
**** Is it prepared in anticipation of litigation?
**** Was it prepared by or on behalf of attorney?
***** If yes, it is the attorney’s work product and is protected.
****** Even so, the other side may get it discovered if the other party shows it has substantial need of the material; and is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain equivalent information - UNLESS, it contains the mental impressions, conclusions, or opinions of the attorney = then it is still protected.
******* Attorney-client privilege does not extend to underlying facts of issue, just the communication.
******* In all cases, must file motion for protective order to prevent discovery '''(Rule 26(c))'''

Subpoena of non-party – '''Rule 45'''

Must get a subpoena to force non-parties to: (1) give testimony, (2) request documents, and (3) permit inspection of premises '''(Rule 45(a)).'''

Subpoenaed person may make motion with court to quash or modify subpoena '''(Rule 45(c)(3)).''' 

Failure by a person to obey subpoena may be deemed a contempt of court '''(Rule 45(e)).'''
 
Plaintiff: May make motion after the expiration of 20 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment by defendant.

Defendant: May make motion at any time.


'''SUMMARY JUDGMENT – RULE 56'''

A party may move for summary judgment with or without supporting affidavits '''(Rule 56(a)).'''

The motion shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.  The adverse party prior to the day of hearing may serve opposing affidavits '''(Rule 56(c)).'''

The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

Affidavits must set forth specific facts (who, what, when, where) showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  One needs more than mere conclusion '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

When affidavits are unavailable, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or discovery to be had or may make such other order as may be just '''(Rule 56(f)).'''

If it is made in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall order the offending party to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged as guilty of contempt '''(Rule 56(g)).'''

If the adverse party does not so respond, then summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

A factual issue defeats summary judgment.  (It does not matter if you have 50 witnesses to 1).  Summary judgment does not weigh the evidence.  The question is: &quot;Is there a genuine issue of material fact?&quot;

 
'''VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL BY PLAINTIFF – RULE 41(a)'''

An action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court by '''(Rule 41(a)(1)):'''
* filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment
* by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action 

Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action based on the same claim '''(Rule 41(a)(1)).'''

If dismissal is WITHOUT prejudice, the complaint CAN be refiled.


'''INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL BY MOTION OF DEFENDANT – RULE 41(b)'''

A defendant may move for dismissal of an action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute '''(Rule 41(b)).'''

An involuntary dismissal, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''', operates as an adjudication upon the merits (so the dismissal is with prejudice). 

If dismissal is WITH prejudice, the complaint CANNOT be refiled.

 
'''DEFAULT JUDGMENT – RULE 55'''

Plaintiff may ask for default judgment when the defendant fails to plead or otherwise defend.  Plaintiff must make this fact by affidavit to the clerk of the court.

Affidavit must show that: 
* the complaint was served properly, and 
* the defendant did not answer '''(Rule 55(a))'''

Upon receipt of a valid affidavit, the clerk shall enter the party's default.

If the claim is for a sum certain, and the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear, then the clerk shall enter default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(1)).'''

If claim is for an uncertain amount, or if the defendant has appeared before the court, then the party entitled to judgment by default must apply to the court for damages '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

If the party has appeared in the action, then they must be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

The court can set aside the entry of default for good cause '''(Rule 55(c)).'''

The court can set aside the entry of default or default judgment for good cause, in accordance with '''Rule 60(b) (Rule 55(c)).'''

Default can come into effect if the answer is stricken under '''Rule 37''' – (as if the defendant had never appeared).

Service of Complaint: within 120 days of Complaint filed

'''Creating a frame for a picture''' can be an expensive and confusing task. This Wikibook attempts to address this by providing instructions to allow you to do it yourself!

The book is currently broken into pages, which attempt to address the various stages required to produce a basic, though gallery quality, picture frame. There are additional pages which address special techniques and outline methods to handle complex items (such as boxing gloves).

This book began life as a summary of experience from someone new to the area, and will hopefully be built upon to become a useful reference and guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Equipment suggested for picture framing ==
*Sharp pencil (2B recommended, as it will leave clear sharp lines)
*Notebook (for recording colours for matboard, frame types and measurements - and for calculating costs)
*Retractable tape measure
*Metal ruler
*Sharp knife
:Retractable snap-off bladed knife works well.

=== Frame cutting and assembly ===
*Mitre saw, or guillotine
*Bounding tape thing
*Corner tacking gun, with tacks

=== Glass cutting ===
*Oil filled glass cutter
*Cotton gloves

=== Mat cutting ===
*Square and rightangle ruler based cutter
:Note: a ruler and a knife just doesn't cut it ;)

== Advanced stuff ==

=== Sample mat board collection ===

=== Storage ===

==== Mat board ====
The spare mat board is easy to store in an old map drawer cabinet. These can be often be picked up at ex-government furniture stores.

==== Glass ====


==== Frame material ====
Standing against the wall, or up in the rafters.

      <comment>/* Choosing a frame */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When choosing the appropriate surround for artwork, it is helpful to keep in mind several variables:

*Do you need to crop the picture?
*Is the piece destined for a single location?
*What materials do you have on hand?
*Will you need to re-use the frame?

And finally, and probably most importantly:
*Will your partner agree with your choice?

      <text xml:space="preserve">When selecting a frame, decide on the colour, window size and area of the mount. (A pale colour makes the picture look larger; a dark colour makes the picture look smaller). Normally, a frame is sold in a long strip which needs to be cut to size.

You will also need:
* Glass
* Matt board
* Foam core
* Sealing tape
* Wood glue
* Pins for securing the backing to the frame
* Eyelets
* Nylon cord

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Editing Wikitext|bd=linen}}
{{thetop|bd=beige|ha1=center|cs=5px|fs2=1em|ff2=Arial,Sans-serif|cp3=0px 5px 5px 20px|bd2=ivory|cp2=10px|br2=3px solid lightgrey|__TOC__|&lt;h2&gt;Text Headings&lt;/h2&gt;
Formal heading styles are used in nearly all WikiBooks pages and for that matter, for all of the sister projects' pages as well.   They clearly show a degree of organization in the work, and they are absolutely essential if the user intends to take advantage of the automatically generated table of contents, (TOC).

The following notes explain how to make wiki headings, and introduces the table of contents.  Notes are provided on moving the TOC around, and constraining its behavior.   For those who intend to put the TOC into a table cell at the top of a page, refer to [[../Pictures/Images_in_Containers|Images in Containers]], and [[../Templates_Ready_to_Use|Templates Ready to Use]].|[[image:CourierWC.png|200px]]|trailer=&lt;br clear=all&gt;&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|ff=1em|background=linen|&lt;h2&gt;Heading levels&lt;/h2&gt;
There are six levels of heading styles and all of them are made by surrounding the heading text with an appropriate number of equals signs.   The HTML heading styles are equivalent and so optionally, the heading text can be surrounded by the HTML tags instead.   As an example; to make a level two heading, the largest practical heading, write either of the following at the left margin:

{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading Text==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

To make smaller headings just increase the number of equals signs, or use larger numbers in the HTML tags.   It was stated above that there are six levels but the first level is usually reserved for the page heading, and making a table of contents with more that three levels can be messy.   As a result it is most common to stick to levels two, three and four, or to use the HTML equivalent, h2, h3 and h4.   By insuring that smaller headings come below larger headings in the text, the TOC will indent the sub-levels accordingly, and automatically insert the required links. 

At times a heading is needed for text in a table.  Wikitext heading codes can have an adverse effect on tables and templates.   When this happens, changing to the HTML versions of the heading will often solve the problem.   

The level two heading style inserts a line across the page whether it is needed or not, but to add a similar line with the other headings, just type four hyphens at the left margin as follows:

{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|background=floralwhite|ff=inherit|1=&lt;h2&gt;Summary of Headings&lt;/h2&gt;
The following table contains a summary of the headings that can be made.

&lt;table  border=0 align=center cellspacing=0 cellpadding=9px                       style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:black;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;

 &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black;&quot;&gt;
    '''h6''' is rarely used&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiding Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
As was mentioned above, the headings are used to make the table of contents, (TOC).   Sometimes, when the TOC is looking a bit full, or when a heading does not seem to warrant listing, it would be useful to have the benefits of the heading's formats, but to miss it out on the TOC.

A set of templates has been made to do this.   They are the six templates [[Template:Hiddenh1|Hiddenh1]] through [[Template:Hiddenh6|Hiddenh6]].   The way to use say, a level three heading style without a TOC listing is just:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{hiddenh3|Hidden Heading Here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Just choose a different template for other heading sizes.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;       


&lt;h3&gt;Numbered Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
Numbered headings are made only by typing them yourself, and the nested heading sizes are made in usual way. 

The conventional numbering method is to assign a separate number sequence to each level of heading.   Although an automatic method purports to exist in the user's preferences, it affects only the ''local'' view and will not be seen by others.   A fairly standard approach for numbered headings is seen below, but the indentation that is preferred for numbered sub-sections cannot be obtained with a simple use of tags or wiki code.   Templates could be made to indent the sub-sections properly, setting left margins for the paragraphs accordingly, and for those who might attempt it, the existing CSS styles for headings have been provided below.     

{{block|ff=inherit|ta=left|background=white|{{hiddenh2|1 Some Flowering Plants}}
{{hiddenh3|1.1 Monocots}}
{{hiddenh4|1.1.1 Orchids}}
{{hiddenh4|1.1.2 Onions}}

{{hiddenh2|2 Trees}}
etc.
}}      

&lt;h3&gt;Drop Capitals&lt;/h3&gt;
Drop capitals are used for work where heading styles are intrusive, though the rules for their use are by no means clear.

{{drop|T}}here is no drop capital code in Wikitext at this time, but a template exists.   The drop capital at the start of this paragraph was added using the [[template:drop|'''Drop''']] template.   Users who need a different drop capital can find the basic coding on the template's editing window.    The code used to call this template into use was just:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Drop|T}}here is no drop capital...&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}    
Notice that only the first character of the paragraph was included within the double curly brackets, and that the remainder of the text was dressed tightly to the left.  


&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|background=lavenderblush|ff=inherit|&lt;h2&gt;The Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
The table of contents habitually resides at the top-left of the page.   In fact, it will position itself at the left margin and just above the first heading that is made.   The TOC lists all of the headings and makes links to their positions in the page.   Selecting a link causes the page to shift so that the selected heading is at the top of the screen.   A table of contents will not be generated unless at least four headings are made.

The width and length of the TOC adjusts as more heading text is added.   The width adjusts to the longest heading and the box extends downward as more headings are added.   At some point the text is wrapped rather than continuously widening the box.  The automatic behavior of the TOC is not always welcome, and various methods to constrain it have been devised.   See the comments below.

It is possible to remove the TOC by typing;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
anywhere on the page. (Note that there are ''two'' underscores on each side).   The usual Wiki page includes a table of contents, but it is unclear how strict the convention is.  Note the section above on ''Hiding Headings'' to avoid headings being added to the TOC.    

To ''include'' the TOC in a place that it would not normally appear, for example, in a table cell at say the top of the page, just type the following code in the cell as if it were text;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}                 
Such a method can be used to position the TOC with some accuracy, as well as running text or images level with it in the top section. The &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; word overrides a previous &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction though only one TOC can appear on a page.

The template [[template:tocright|'''Tocright''']] can be used to place a table of contents at the right side of the WikiBooks page.   The TOC will appear adjacent to the position on the page that the template is called.   To call the template into use just type;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tocright}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Other templates , that display the TOC with images and text at the top of a page include [[template:imageontop|'''Imageontop''']], [[template:Textontop|'''Textontop''']], and a number of similar templates.   Another table-based template for top-sections is [[template:thetop|'''Thetop''']], and the table of contents is easily be added to it, as can be seen in the top section of ''this'' page. 

The colors of the TOC are fixed; in fact they are set by the '''Toccolours''' class.   So far, the TOC itself has resisted any modification.

&lt;h2&gt;CSS Heading Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
At times, for example for templates, users need to know the details of certain wiki styles.   These can be found in the wikibooks style sheets.   An example of these styles for the main wiki headings can be found in the drop-box below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{displaytitle|title=SQL/400}}
'''SQL/400''' is a proprietary dialect of SQL for the IBM AS/400, which was later rebranded as iSeries and finally as SystemI, business eServer Computer Platform.  It comes in several flavors, or ways that SQL can be run.

* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Interactive_SQL.2F400 Interactive SQL/400] which can be run from the Command line.  Invoke STRSQL {Start SQL/400} and get at what looks like another command line, where we can key in SQL statements for immediate execution, and/or use the F4 Prompt function to navigate IBM DB2/400 data base, which is a version of UDB, IBM's Universal Data Base to get at the 400'ds files (tables) and their fields (columns), for incorporation in the SQL statement. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Interactive_SQL.2F400 Interactive SQL/400] is often used to identify statements needed to perform various programming actions.  When exiting an Interactive SQL/400 session, we have the option of saving a log of our activity, from which our successful SQL/400 statements may be copied into one of the other flavors of SQL/400. 
*SQL Query Manager is used to design and store SQL queries used to extract information, generate reports, and create procedures.  Query Manager is an interface to SQL in which end users, unfamiliar with SQL, the programming language, can be prompted through what is needed to create inquiries and reports that are more sophisticated than what can be created by other tools, and can be rerun as needed.
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Static_Embedded_SQL Static Embedded SQL] involves SQL statements hard coded inside another high level language program, such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#SQL_embedded_in_RPG RPG/400],  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#SQL_embedded_in_Cobol Cobol/400], C/400, and REXX.  This is done because there are some areas where SQL is more powerful than other languages, but there are some things they can do that SQL can not.  See Comparative Computer Languages.  So the AS/400 programmer can pick and choose the Computer Language that is best suited to the needed function, with programs in different languages calling code in other languages a variety of ways.
*Dynamic Embedded SQL 
All the AS/400 languages that support [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Static_Embedded_SQL Static Embedded SQL] also support Dynamic Embedded SQL. 
*Other SQL/400 Applications.  Suppose you connect to the AS/400 using a Personal Computer which has many PC Applications, such as Microsoft Excel.  You can put SQL statements inside an Excel cell which will access the AS/400 data base.  When you open the Excel, it immediately shows you the latest data from the data base.  You can then change the statements to change what data is selected for the Excel.

== Interactive SQL/400 ==
== SQL Query Manager ==
== Languages that support Embedded SQL ==
* C/400
* Cobol/400
* RPG (many different versions of RPG on the 400)
* REXX
* PL/1
* Fortran/400

== Static Embedded SQL ==

Static Embedded SQL statments are written into the source code of the high level language program, then an SQL Precompiler converts the SQL statements to a form that is acceptable to the high level language compiler.  

Dynamic SQL Statements are composed, prepared and run when the program is run.

=== SQL embedded in RPG ===
SQL statements can be placed within the calculations of an RPG program ... detail calculations, total calculations, or an RPG Subroutine.  RPG identifies what section of a program, using a character in position 6 with a C for calculations.  Here is how SQL statements are usually embedded in RPG program calculations.

  C/EXEC SQL
  C+ SQL Statement
  C+ SQL Statement
  C+ SQL Statement...
  C/END-EXEC

There can be any number of SQL Statements.  Notice the slash at beginning of the first and last lines, that delineate the beginning and end of the SQL statements embedded in the RPG code.  Notice the plus sign at the beginning of each SQL statement.

Conventional RPG uses files which are to be specified in F-spec of the program code. SQL statements can have files which may not be specified in F-spec of the program code.

Beginning with Release V5R4 embedded SQL can be used in (RPG) free format notation either. An embedded SQL statement starts with EXEC SQL which can be positioned at any place between postion 8 and 80. The SQL statement can be coded immediately after the EXEC SQL but also can start in the next row. The SQL statement can be splitted into multiple rows, but must be specified between positon 8 and 80. An embedded SQL statement in free format ends like any other free format RPG statement with a semi colon (;)

 /Free
     Exec SQL  SQL Statement;

     Exec SQL  
       SQL Statement;

     Exec SQL  SQL Statement 1st Row
       SQL Statement 2nd Row
       ...
       SQL Statement nth Row;

Example:
  /Free
     Exec SQL  Select Coalesce(Max(OrdPos) + 1, 1) into :NewPos
                  From OrderPosition
                  Where OrderNo = :ParOrderNo;

=== SQL embedded in Cobol ===

In Cobol, SQL statements are embedded in specific program sections.  The END-EXEC must be terminated with a period.

 EXEC SQL
   SQL Statement
   SQL Statement
 END-EXEC.

There can be any number of SQL statements.

=== Static SQL SELECT Modes ===
Static SQL offers two modes of operation, with secondary options.
* SELECT one row of a table, at a time.
* SELECT multiple rows of one or more tables into a Cursor.
** A Serial Cursor is when each row of the results is to be fetched only once per open of the cursor, going through the data sequentially.  Each time a row of data is read into the program, the cursor is moved to the next row of the result table.  This is repeated until reaching end-of-data, when the cursor should be closed.  To use the cursor again, close the current use of it, then re-issue the open statement.  We cannot back up in a Serial Cursor.
** A Scroll Cursor supports alternatives to going through the data sequentially.  Access defaults to the Serial Cursor method, while the Fetch statement can position the cursor where to do the reading.  When it is not specified that the Scroll Cursor is Dynamic, access is read-only.  This kind of Cursor is usually in a program to display parts of the data base on screen of end user, who can then key in something to navigate the data, leading the Scroll Cursor to be positioned elsewhere in the data, to get what the user wants to see.
** A Dynamic Scroll Cursor permits the update of rows that are accessed.

==== SQL Cursor ====
There are several ways this can be programmed.  One way is to define a Data Structure which defines all the data elements that will be selected with each occurrence of executing the multiple rows.  It reads in the data from the joined files very similar to reading a record from one file in RPG or Cobol.

Unlike many other AS/400 programming languages, where Variables can be defined wherever needed, such at the beginning of some Subroutine that will be using them, SQL/400 requires that anything, to be used in the program, where the SQL is embedded, be defined earlier in the program source code than where ever it is subsequently used.  Thus, the sequence of processing an SQL cursor, embedded in another high level language, is:
# Declare Cursor
# Open Cursor
# Fetch Rows using Select
# Optionally Delete or Update
# Close Cursor

== Dynamic Embedded SQL ==
select *
from table.campo, table1.campo1
where table.campo = table1.campo1

== Other SQL/400 Applications ==

I’m not exactly sure why the generic (and apparently correct) term ‘dish soap’ was replaced by the specific use of a brand name detergent (dawn) in the latest edit. For the moment I’ll leave it be, and hope for an explanation. --[[User:Artic|Robert Engelhardt]] 06:14, July 17, 2005 (UTC)</text>

I live in Cape Town, South Africa, and yes, I'm the same Greenman from the [http://en.wikipedia.org English] wikipedia, as well as who tinkers with the [http://af.wikipedia.org Afrikaans wikipedia], hopefully without causing too much damage.

I'm very keen to see Wikipedia's in the other South African languages - anyone who can help please contact me.

You can get a pretty good idea of my interests by looking at the articles to which I've contributed - mostly South African interest. 

I also have a [[http://www.greenman.co.za/b2evolution/blogs/index.php a blog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Financial status is generally viewed with four basic quadrants. 
# Income
# Expense (Spending)
# Assets 
# Liabilities

One have to manage these four quadrants in a way that he/she can survive today and also in future (ie after retirement) The way one manages these four quadrants

== Liabilities ==

This module reviews liabilities in your life. Liabilities by definition generates an expense (or spending). As you might see from the following list these are cause of the out flow of money.

:[[/Loans/]]
:[[/Credit Cards/]]

== Saving ==

Saving in view of personal finance is more of the discipline. Small amount of money saved regularly can build bigger kitty. This is because of compounding interest. The earlier you start to save, the more interest your money will gain over time if you dont touch your savings. In general savings can be classified by the purpose for which it is done.

First purpose of saving is for saving rainy day. Based on the individual he/she needs to identify the amount which will be needed on short notice in case of emergency. This saving amount must be available in a bank account in such a way that you can withdraw at your will. Once you are saving beyond this amount it must become part of your investment. Second purpose for saving is that once you retire, the person has hopefully saved enough money to live on. The third purpose of saving is to leave a legacy to a family member or a friend. A legacy is where a person saves up money and when they die, the money goes to the family member. 
 
:[[/Tax Advantaged Savings/]]
:[[/Automatic Savings/]]
:[[/Paying Debt/]]

== Investing  ==
{{see also|Investing}}

Investing involves using your money (or borrowed money that you control) to earn more money. Investments are classified based on the risk and return matrix. 
Most people base their investments on how soon they expect to retire, how long they want that money to last, and how they want to live after they retire. The average retired person that has money invested plans on really never touching the money invested but rather living off the interest their money is making them. For example if a person is retired and wants to live off $50,000 for the rest of their life, they might have 1 million dollars invested trying to earn 5% on the investments. That way at the end of the year they have made 50,000 which can be withdrew and they still have that 1 million dollars invested.

Following are the possible categories :

High Risk = High Return
   This formula is stating that a person that is willing to invest in riskier assets expects a higher return on those assets. A good example of high risk investments are:
Single stocks
Small cap stocks
Large cap stocks
Volatile stocks 

Low Risk = Low Return
   This formula is showing that a person that want to have safe guaranteed investments show expect a low return. People that usually invest in safer options tend not to trust the market and have considerable doubts. 
Examples of low risk options are:
Mutual funds (diversified with stock and bonds)
Treasury bills
Triple A rated bonds


In general one should be able to put their investment in above two class. A person doesn't want to put all of their money into investments. Most people want a safety net so they should keep a certain percent of their money in cash. The best thing an investor can do for retirement planning is to diversify their portfolio (dont put all your eggs in one basket). Diversifying a portfolio makes is less risky to the investor but can still have a decent return. This is because the investor can expect the total percentage of your portfolio not to change has much as one stock alone. 

Ratio in which one's investment should be distributed between the two categories is based on the person's risk appetite. One's risk apatite can be a function of age and total assets. If a person is younger, he/she can invest more in riskier avenues since he/she can recover from the loss. If the person already has very high assets he can increase his/her exposure to the riskier investments to gain more returns. If a person is already retired, they might want to consider investing in safe investments that produce a low guaranteed income because they dont have any other source of income coming in so they wont want to take the chance on losing it.

This is just an attempt to shift the more generalized areas of ''[[../A critique of Wikibooks|A critique of Wikibooks]]'' into a separate document. The word 'wiki' in the title should be considered synonymous with 'MediaWiki'. I may include other wiki systems over time.

== Abstract ==

MediaWiki is a recent and popular implementation of the 'mind-map' concept. I've seen this as far back at the late 1980s, designed for use either as a personal database, or a means of explaining language. The success of the internet means this can now be done collaboratively with people from all over the world, but this introduces new problems.

With a single user editing the whole thing, they can use whatever terminology they desire, but when working with such systems collaboratively, shared language must be agreed upon. This is, in effect, the system-wide NPOV policy, which is arguably the only policy you really need. The effect of applying this policy to the definitions of words and concepts you might find in Wikipedia, you end up having no choice but to agreed to shared language.

== Q&amp;A ==

; What are the problems with the use of language?

* Obvious things like the existence of many incompatible languages and dialects thereof.

These have mostly been addressed by splitting wikis into language codes, but even within a single language code, many dialects exist. q.v. dispute on UK/US English, amongst various other arguments on [[m:Requests for new languages]]. When is a dialect considered unique enough to warrant its own language code?

* Other problems with both written and spoken language

e.g. category logic errors, metaphor vs practical definition, meaningful statements.

Note that the use-mention distinction has already been pointed out somewhere in [[w:WP:MOS]]. In fact, this may already contain many solutions.

* Intonation in spoken language

The practise of changing one's tone of voice when saying something, to hint at an alternate interpretation of what they are saying, doesn't translate well when written. I notice a lot of subtitled TV shows use the tokens '(!)' and '(?)' at the end of a sentence to imply a 'sarcastic' tone.

* Body language

i.e. actually doing something rather than talking about something

The ultimate language, which if taken 'literally' lacks any ambiguity, although this is probably beyond the scope of a wiki.

; Could a natural language ever evolve into the use of fully discrete concepts?

By which I mean, all ambiguity is removed.

Modern high-level computer programming languages are not far off, since they effectively let you define your own language of 'identifiers' to keep it meaningful. Low-level languages that use numbers to represent operations and data (verbs and nouns) might be more accurate.

I don't think this type conversation will ever become commonplace:

 Fred: 287 10 1879?
 Bob: 3!

That is to imply that each number represents a fully discrete concept, although many geek-conversations do approach this level of disambiguation.

; What are the conceptual differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc?

It seems you can translate between them quite easily. Might be worth investigating [[w:Lojban]] to see what they came up with.

; Are there examples of natural languages which do not have these distinctions?

I'm wondering about pictographic languages like the Kanji. Need to check this out.

Also, languages of other life-forms. Body language?

; What exactly is the canonical mapping of English words to their referent?

e.g. OED, Brittanica, etc.

I use the term 'dictionary' to include 'encyclopedia'.

But what happens when competing dictionaries disagree, or provide alternate meanings that others do not? How can a paper dictionary ever be future-proof? Is an evolving dictionary like Wikipedia the only solution?

; Are all the Mediawiki wikis actually trying to achieve the same thing in a different way?

e.g. scope overlap with Wiktionary/Wikipedia/Wikibooks

; What words are dangerous?

An argument from [[w:Talk:Words to avoid]] even suggests that the verb 'to be' is dangerous, since it argues that other verbs are almost always more accurate. This may be true, but it's such a common verb, it's not practical to simply stop using it. Perhaps its meaning just needs to be tightened up. e.g.

* X am/are/is Y

If 'X' and 'Y' represent concepts invented by people, which are generally well-defined to be objectively distinguisable regarding their accuracy. q.v. boolean algebra, set theory, etc.

If 'X' and 'Y' are, instead, commonly used words to represent philosophically undefinable concepts (e.g. truth, morality, etc.)

There ought to be some sort of measure of meaningfulness, based on how many other concepts are required to understand in order to understand it. q.v. concrete nouns.

* Is X Y?

Again, depends on X and Y, but does this really mean:

* Please define X in terms of Y, or Y in terms of X.

; Should self-contradictory words be deprecated?

For example: the word 'atom', literally means 'indivisible'. Popularly, it means one of those things physicists keep banging on about, but those are not indivisible (metaphorically speaking, I guess). Therefore, just by using the word 'atom' in the latter sense, are you implicitly (and erroneously) saying that an atom is atomic? The flip side of this is you can quite correctly say &quot;an atom is not atomic&quot;. Does it strike anyone that this might be somewhat confusing from a typographical perspective? Do we have some subconscious desire to deliberately obfuscate our language?

== Completely unfounded assertions ==

For want of a better place for now.

; The Wikimedia projects should define the MediaWiki software, not vice versa.

This is probably already true, but having investigated the latest betas of Mediawiki, I feel a case of [[w:feeping creaturism]] coming on shortly. I guess the project can cope, since it runs more off wetware than software.

; Need better distinction between words and concepts.

Wikipedia has already bumped into this problem, and created disambiguation pages to solve it. I suspect in many cases of words and word-phrases, a disambiguation page is not necessary, but as the amount of discrete concepts increase on Wikipedia, so will its ambiguity.

Why couldn't a wiki contain a master index of concepts, then attach the various typographic and phonetic language 'codes' (i.e. written and spoken words) commonly used to refer to each concept. Problem is that in order to define the concepts, you need some language in which to do so. I guess real-life photos, sound-samples and other sensory cues could be substituted for text where possible, since they arguably provide more meaning than text in any case.

I argue that this is the only goal of language. It would seem that almost everyone agrees on the concepts of the universe, but merely argue about the language used to refer to them, and the boundaries of the conceptual cases that they cover. For example, the concept generally referred to by the word &quot;God&quot; could perhaps also be referred to by the words &quot;the laws of physics&quot;, in that they both refer to a conceptual entity which is allegedly responsible for the creation of the universe. Does this mean that the two phrases may be used interchangably? Perhaps not, since the &quot;God&quot; concept implies something of a vaguely humanoid form, but if I apply this to the first sentence of the Old Testament (UK edition), I end up with:

* In the beginning when the laws of physics created the universe, the earth was formless and desolate.

A physicist might argue that the earth did not exist at the beginnings of the universe, but I suppose the word &quot;when&quot; in that sentence could be reasonably argued not to read as &quot;at the exact instant that&quot;, but rather &quot;during the period when&quot;. Point is, it's arguably correct.

What if a physics student studying gravity was asked by student of religion:

* What did you learn about today?

Allowing for a certain amount of metaphor, could he, in all honesty, reply:

* And the Lord spake, &quot;what goes up must come down&quot;.

Is this merely a translation of the same concepts into a different dialect of the English language?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is digital music?==

In the context of this book, [[w:Digital|digital]] music refers to music made using digital hardware or software, typically with a computer workstation.

If you have heard music produced while you were alive, you have almost certainly heard music that has been produced digitally. Music in the digital domain is often associated with [[w:Electronic music|electronic music]]; however this is not always the case. The foundation of electronic music is based on work done in the [[w:Analogue Electronics|analog]] domain, from analog [[w:Synthesizer|synthesizers]] to [[w:Tape loop|tape loop manipulation]]. These techniques are still popular today, even though computer-based [[w:Sequencer|sequencing]] and [[w:Digital Signal Processing|sound modification]] / [[w:Synthesis|generation]] are industry standard. Computers are, however, regularly used to produce digital equivalents of analog instruments and effects, making the distinction increasingly less important.

==Brief History==

Synthesized instruments began to appear relatively soon after music became [[w:Sound recording|recorded]], in the early 20th century. The exact technology used varied, but the primary lesson to learn is that they used an [[w:Oscillator|oscillator]] to generate a tone at varying frequencies. Amplitude, when mapped out as a function of time, produce a [[w:Waveform|waveform]] that tells a speaker what point to be at at a given instance. What an oscillator does is produce an indefinitely repeatable pattern that can be directed to the speaker. Through the combination of multiple oscillators, distortions of the waveform, and other techniques, unique sounds may be produced.

Digital techology works with [[w:Binary|bits]], which have only a &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; state. So, to represent the waveform in computer memory, the waveform is divided into discrete [[w:Sampling|samples]], where each sample represents the amplitude of the waveform at a given moment in time. Sound streams use many bits for each of these variables, to achieve a very fine precision in the waveform's representation. Digitalization means that audible artifacts can appear if care is not taken to keep the sound at the highest level of precision possible, and a poor conversion to analog(which often occurs on computers with low-cost integrated sound) will always make what comes through the speakers sound weak and &quot;tinny&quot;.

Early synthesizers had no standardized control mechanism; this led to problems and additional hassle in the studio. But after the advent of the [[w:MIDI|MIDI]] standard in the 1980s, control was greatly simplified. MIDI is a digital protocol that allows one machine(such as a piano keyboard, or a computer) to control another over a cable, triggering the other machine's events. At first, that meant a hardware synthesizer, but much of the hardware used when MIDI was invented has been reduced to software versions today. MIDI files are simply sequences of MIDI events using the &quot;General MIDI&quot; (GM) standard instruments, whose actual sounds are up to interpretation by the playback mechanism; their derision by many is the result of GM's limitations. MIDI is showing its age today, but is still a commonplace and useful tool.

[[w:Sampler|Samplers]] also appeared in the 1980s. These machines store recordings and play them back; the difference between them and tape recorders are that samplers allow for great variation in the manner of playback. Digital technology makes effects such as reversing, looping, instantaneous restarting, and variable playback speed easy to accomplish. Modern computer sound cards work like a sampler that the computer can control and feed data to on-the-fly. The first sampling computer was the Commodore Amiga, released in 1985. From this computer, [[w:Tracker|tracking]] was born, introducing digital music composition to the home consumer and started a new generation of musicians and genres.

== Chess problems ==

Before I do exponential amouts of damage to the [[Puzzles:Chess problems|Chess problems]] section, what do you think a &quot;non-pathologically meaningless title&quot; for [[Puzzles:Chess_problems:Chess_directmates:Fourteen-move_chess_directmate_1]] and similar pages in that section be? --[[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 20:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

: That title isn't too bad by itself, though I'd be inclined to make it a little less redundant.  Maybe [[Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Fourteen-move directmate 1]].  Hmm.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 10:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

: I see you've started moving them around a bit.  Just a small suggestion: I tend to do it top-down.  That is, first move section pages, starting with those at the highest level, before moving the individual puzzle and solution pages within them.  That way, it will be quick and easy to update the navigation header while at each one.  True, there are also links from the section pages to the puzzles to update, but updating these later will be a little easier as there are fewer pages to update them on. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Omelet ==

It's a valid spelling, just as grey and gray are both valid spellings.

I rather like using a mix of spellings just to drive home the point.

Especially in terms like &quot;Denver omelet&quot; and &quot;Spanish omelet&quot;, the simple
spelling is the norm.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:43, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

: I'm inclined to agree with you. I suppose the page titles should always have redirects, one way or the other, and the choice of spelling in the text can on the whim of the author. As a rule of thumb I think that recipes that have a clear French origin (like the French omelette and Omelette du whatever) should use omelette, and recipes that don't have anything to do with France (Denver, Spanish, Japanese, Fritatta) should use omelet.

Yes, you're totally right. I space out pretty bad when I'm doing more than one similar update. I've fixed them. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:39, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo]] ==

Hello Risk, how are you? I saw your Wikijunior logo submission, and I really like it a lot! For some reason, not maky people are submitting logos for Wikijunior, at least not as many as for Wikibooks. Are you planning on submitting a Wikibooks logo as well?

One thing that people were trying to avoid is different language projects from using different wording on the logo itself. If there is no text on the logo, there is no need for it to be localized for each project, which in turn can produce better cohesion between the various language projects. Would you mind uploading a version of your logo with no text on it? I dont know how uptight people are going to be about the text issue, but I would hate to see your great design lose because of that detail. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:37, 15 December 2007 (UTC)
: Thank you, I'm glad you like it. I am thinking about submitting a design for wikibooks, but I'm little busy at the moment. That's also the reason I just submitted something I hacked together in photoshop, instead of taking the time to redo it properly in SVG. If I can find some time, I'll redo the logo in SVG and try to make a version without text. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 15:39, 19 December 2007 (UTC)
::Definitely take your time. We have not specified an end to the logo submission stage yet (i would like it to continue for another month or two at least). Also, while the final logo must be SVG, there is no reason why the logos in this stage must be in that format. We can always convert them as the process moves forward. Good luck on being busy, and I hope to see your Wikibooks submission! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:53, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== [[Template:SeasonalitySpec]] ==

Hi Risk,

I just did some changes on [[Template:Seasonality]] that merge the functionality of [[Template:SeasonalitySpec]] into it. The latter isn't used anywhere. Do you think there is a use for a separate template? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:39, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
: Hi, nice work. I guess I wasn't aware of default arguments in mediawiki templates when I made those. You're right that SeasonalitySpec can be deleted now. There may be a reference to it on one of the cookbook pages on how to use the templates. That'll need to be updated. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 22:11, 15 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What You Need ==
* Audacity
* Modplug Tracker (or another tracker program)

== Make a sound ==

# Open Audacity.
# Generate &quot;Silence&quot; so you have something to start with.
# Change the view to &quot;Samples.&quot; You can see how many samples make up the waveform on the lower status bar by rolling over the end of the waveform.  Note: if you are having trouble doing this, go to the View menu, then Set Selection Format to &quot;samples (snap to samples)&quot;.  The number of samples you have selected will be displayed in the lower status bar.
# Cut down most of the silence. Zoom in.
# Repeat until you've cut the number of samples down to a power of 2 (64, 128, and 256 are good values.)
# Now select the &quot;Draw&quot; tool.
# Paint something with the mouse on the silence. A smooth, slow curve will sound &quot;hollow&quot; while a jumpy, irregular pattern will sound &quot;noisy.&quot;
# Make sure your sound is on, but keep it turned low for the next part.  (This is so that if your sound wave sounds particularly unpleasant, your ears will be spared.)
# Shift-click on the Play button to loop-play your sound.
#. Save it when you're happy with it.

== Import the sound ==

# Open Modplug.
# Click the Samples tab.
# &quot;Open&quot; your sound.
# Turn on &quot;Loop&quot; and set the loop length to the size of your sound.
# Your sound's ready for use; now you can enter the tracker.

== A combination of {{tl|Test}} and {{tl|joinus}} ==

While not strictly necessary I think it would be a good idea to have a &quot;less harsh&quot; version of {{tl|Test}} that is somewhat combined with {{tl|joinus}}. It would be targeted at anons that make a single sandbox-type edit. It should be fairly short, containing at a minimum:
*A suggestion that they register
*A link/description to the sandbox
*A ''brief'' statement outlining the facts that yes, you can edit the page, and this is considered disruptive, but you're not in trouble (which is what {{tl|Test}} seems to convey) as long as you make constructive edits.
That might be a bit much to keep brief but I think if it's short and to the point and clear that they can 'redeem' themselves in a way might get us some useful contributors out of people doing random testing. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 09:24, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

{{msg:GeneralChemTOC}}

Current accounts of atomic structure are the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation.  What follows is a very brief history of the development of atomic theory.

==Early Propositions==

===Atoms according to Democritus===
The earliest known proponent of anything resembling modern atomic theory was the ancient Greek thinker Democritus. He proposed the existence of indivisible atoms as a response to the arguments of Parmenides, and the paradoxes of Zeno.

Parmenides argued against the possibility of movement, change, and plurality on the premise that something cannot come from nothing.  Zeno attempted to prove Parmenides' point by a series of paradoxes based on difficulties with infinite divisibility.

In response to these ideas, Democritus posited the existence of indestructible atoms that exist in a void.  Their indestructibility provided a retort to Zeno, and the void allowed him to account for plurality, change, and movement.  It remained for him to account for the properties of atoms, and how they related to our experiences of objects in the world.

Democritus proposed that atoms possessed few actual properties, with size, shape, and mass being the most important.  All other properties, he argued, could be explained in terms of the three primary properties.  A smooth substance, for instance, might be composed of primarily smooth atoms, while a sour substance is composed of rough or sharp ones.  Solid substances might be composed of atoms with numerous hooks, by which they connect to each other, while the atoms of liquid substances possess far fewer points of connection.

===Alchemy===
Aristotle proposed that there were four elements, air, earth, water, and fire and that everything else was a mixture of these. This belief was very popular in the medieval ages and introduced the science of alchemy. Alchemy was based on the belief that since everything was made of only four elements, you could transmute mixtures into other mixtures of the same type, the most famous of which being lead into gold. 

Alchemy's problem was exposed by Antoine Lavoisier when he heated metallic tin in a sealed flask. A grayish ash appeared on the surface of the melting tin, which Lavoisier heated until no more ash formed. After the flask cooled, he inverted it and opened it underwater. He discovered the water rose one-fifth of the way into the glass, leading Lavoisier to conclude that air itself is a mixture, with one-fifth of it having combined with the tin, yet the other four-fifths did not, showing that air was not an element.

Lavoisier repeated the experiment again, substituting mercury for tin, and found that the same happened. Yet after heating gently, found that the ash released the air, showing that the experiment could be reversed. He concluded that the ash was a compound of the metal and oxygen, which he proved by weighing the metal and the ash, and showing that it was heavier than the original metal.

Lavoisier then stated that combustion was not an element, but instead was a chemical reaction of a fuel and oxygen.

==Dalton's Atomic Theory==
Holes in alchemy led the British chemist [[w:John Dalton|John Dalton]] to revive the atomic theory of matter. Dalton's atomic theory from about 1803 is the basis of today's chemistry, this theory consists of five parts:
#All matter is composed of atoms.
#An element is a type of matter always composed of only one kind of atom, which retains certain specific properties.
#Atoms can not be created or destroyed
#A compound is matter composed of two or more atoms of two or more elements chemically combined in specific ratios.
#A chemical reaction is the rearrangement of atoms to form new compounds.

==Thomson and the Discovery of the Electron==
In the year 1889 the British physicist [[w:J.J. Thomson|J.J. Thomson]] discovered the electron.  Thomson conducted a number of experiments using cathode rays.  Cathode rays are constructed by sealing two electrodes in a glass tube and removing the air from it.  When the electrodes are attached to high voltage, a beam of radiation is emitted from the negative electrode.  These beams are called cathode rays.

Thomson discovered that cathode rays travel in straight lines except when they are bent by electric or magnetic fields.  Because the cathode rays bent away from a negatively charged plate, Thomson concluded that these rays are made of negatively charged particles; today we call them electrons.  Thomson found that he could produce cathode rays using electrodes of various materials.  He then concluded that electrons were found in all atoms.

==The &quot;Plum Pudding&quot; Model of the Atom==
Soon after the discovery of the electron, Thomson began speculating on the nature of the atom.  He suggested a &quot;plum pudding&quot; model.  In this model the bits of &quot;plum&quot; were the electrons which were floating around in a &quot;pudding&quot; of positive charge to match that of the electrons and make an electrically neutral atom (a modern illustration of this idea would be a chocolate chip cookie, with the chips representing negatively charged electrons and the dough representing positive charge).

==Rutherford's Nuclear Atom==
Ernest Rutherford proved Thomson wrong through further experimentation and another theory in 1911. In his experiments Rutherford used alpha particles from a radioactive element such as radium.  Rutherford aimed the alpha particles at metal foils.  He found that most of the particles passed directly through the foil; however some were deflected nearly backward.

According to the plum pudding model all of the particles should have slowed as they passed through the &quot;pudding&quot; but none should have been deflected. Rutherford then concluded that every particle must have a nucleus, that is, a small hard positively charged core which takes up little space but contains the majority of the atom's mass. According to Rutherford's model the positively charged nucleus would attract the negatively charged electrons. Today we recognize that the atom consists of a positively charged core with a number of electrons moving around it.

I'm glad to see that this is progressing slowly and steadily.  Thank you for continuing to improve Wikibooks.  You might want to address the question raised on [[Talk:EverQuest]].

::Hmm, the main EQ page has transwikified.... I didn't see any discussion of it... and of course the time I was able to spend on the work was during coffee and lunch, at work, through a firewall that disallows my access to the stratwiki or whatever it is.

I will ask the guys over on the strat. wiki... :-( what makes me kind of sad is, that finally there seems somebody (you, Tendiin) who is able to put in a bit work regularly, and now he might not be able to anymore...sugar :-/ --[[User:Kajolus|Kajolus]] 12:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programming independence from language ==

&quot;The page is &quot;off topic&quot; - Computer programming should be independent of programming lanugage&quot;

=== RPG ===

In my opinion, the structure of language can be so different or similar, that a person writing about programming, who only knows a group of languages with similar structure, cannot help but describe computer programming using human language and examples that are foreign to other programming environments.  Thus it is really important in any such text to reference what languages this text is relevant to. [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 13:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Programming:RPG]] ===

Well done. Just one observation: there is actually a WikiBook called [[Programming:RPG]] - which might be more suited for your text.

Or prehaps you want to try a side by site chapter. See 

* [[Programming:Ada#Computer_Programming]]
* [[Computer_programming#Key_concepts]]
* [[Programming:Python#Computer_Programming]]

They are difficult to make but when finished very rewarding. i.E. I very much like the [[Computer programming/Statements]] Chapter.

If you do the beginning I fill in the [[Programming:Ada]] pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gauss's Analysis of Curved Surfaces - The Origin of the Metric Tensor==

It became apparent at the start of the nineteenth century that issues such as Euclid's parallel postulate required the development of a new type of geometry that could deal with curved surfaces and real and imaginary planes. At the foundation of this approach is Gauss's analysis of curved surfaces which allows us to work with a variety of coordinate systems and displacements on any type of surface.

Suppose there is a line on a surface. The length of this line can be expressed in terms of a coordinate system. A short length of line &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s in a two dimensional space may be expressed in terms of Pythagoras' theorem as:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;y&lt;SUP&gt; 2

&lt;/SUP&gt;Suppose there is another coordinate system on the surface with two axes: x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;, &lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, how can the length of the line be expressed in terms of these coordinates? Gauss tackled this problem and his analysis is quite straightforward for two coordinate axes: 

'''Figure 1:'''

It is possible to use elementary differential geometry to describe displacements along the plane in terms of displacements on the curved surfaces:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

The displacement of a short line is then assumed to be given by a formula, called a metric, such as Pythagoras' theorem

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;S&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Or some other metric such as the metric of a 4D Minkowskian space:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;S&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;X&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

This type of analysis can be extended to any number of dimensions. It is then possible to express the short length, &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s, in terms of the coordinates. The full algebraic analysis is given at the end of this appendix. In 3D the expression for the length is:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;SS&lt;/FONT&gt; (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;X/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;X/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;) &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; 

(for i=1 to 3 and k=1 to 3)

and so, using indicial notation:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Where

g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;)

If the coordinates are not merged then &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s is dependent on both sets of coordinates. In matrix notation:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;B&gt;g&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;

becomes:


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=264&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1 &lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
Times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
a&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
b&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
c&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
d&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Where a, b, c, d stand for the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt;.


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;32%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;a +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;34%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;b +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;d&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
Times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;16%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;32%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;34%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;16%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which is:

(&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;a +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;c)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;b +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;d) &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;a + 2&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(c&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;b)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;d

So: 

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;a + 2&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(c&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;b)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;d

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is a &lt;B&gt;bilinear form&lt;/B&gt; that depends on both &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;. It can be written in matrix notation as: 

&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt; A &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;

Where &lt;B&gt;A&lt;/B&gt; is the matrix containing the values in g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt;. This is a special case of the bilinear form known as the &lt;B&gt;quadratic form&lt;/B&gt; because the same matrix (&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;) appears twice; in the generalised bilinear form &lt;B&gt;B = x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt;Ay&lt;/B&gt; (the matrices &lt;B&gt;x&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;y&lt;/B&gt; are different).

If the surface is a Euclidean plane then the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; are:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;51%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;49%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;51%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;49%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which become:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

So the matrix &lt;B&gt;A&lt;/B&gt; is the unit matrix &lt;B&gt;I&lt;/B&gt; and:

&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt; I &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x

&lt;/B&gt;and:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem.

If the surface is derived from &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; then the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; are:


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-(&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;-(d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;-(d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;-(d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which becomes:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which allows the original 'rule' to be recovered i.e.: &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

===The Space-Time Interval===

The fundamental assumption of modern relativity theory is that the space-time interval is invariant. The space-time interval is given by the following equation rather than Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

The origin of the negative sign in front of &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t is of considerable interest. It could originate from an assumption that time is imaginary, that time is real and the metric has a negative sign for time, or that time is mixed real and imaginary with a Pythagorean metric.

====Imaginary Time====

Suppose that Pythagoras theorem applied to the space-time interval and:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt; t&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;)

For a flat surface &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 and all other coefficients are zero therefore:

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


Which means that the time interval must be imaginary if the assumption of relativity is to be supported i.e.: &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;DT&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;&amp;Ouml;&lt;/FONT&gt; -1)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;

So that &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; becomes &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

This form of time is not supported in General Relativity Theory

====Real Time====

If real time is used then the expressions for each displacement along each coordinate axis remain the same e.g.:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;

etc.

But when they are combined the formula &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is used instead of Pythagoras' theorem (see above for a fully worked example in 2D). This results in the following metric tensor:

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Where g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is given by -1 times (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;.

====Mixed Real and Imaginary Time====

There is a third possibility that is not generally discussed. The 'plane' in figure 1 is a plane in the observer's coordinate system and the surface has its own coordinate system. If the time coordinate on the surface were 'imaginary' and that on the plane were real (or vice versa) then using Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;Dt&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

where &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;t&lt;/FONT&gt; equals (kt), k being a constant that is yet to be determined. In flat space-time g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is given by (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;. But t is imaginary so g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; equals -1. This then gives exactly the same metric tensor as the assumption of real time.

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

===The Modern Formulation of the Metric Tensor===

The modern formulation uses the following mathematical expression for the space-time interval:

s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = g&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;mn&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SUB&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;m&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 

where the values of s, x represent tiny displacements in each of the four coordinate axes and 'g' is the metric of the space. It is '''assumed''' that g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is opposite in sign to the other constants on the principle diagonal (i.e.: real or mixed real and imaginary time are assumed). With this assumption the expression becomes: 

s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

The expansion is shown below. In matrix notation this is:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;38%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

(Where t is time in metres, i.e.:c times time in secs). The numbers -1,1,1,1 are the values of the combinations of differential cofficients that were described above.

Evaluating the first matrix multiplication this becomes:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-T x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
T&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which resolves to: s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Which is the metric of space-time and applies to quite large values of s,x and t in the absence of accelerations and strong gravitational fields. Notice how the computation is more like a squared norm than a simple square and carries with it the physical implication of a product of a vector with its reflection (!).

The metric is normally expressed in differential form so that it can be used with a curved space-time and with displacements that are not measured relative to the origin.

ds&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = dx&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dx&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dx&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dt&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Or, equivalently:

ds&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = dt&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;(0 + 1)D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;+ (0 + 0)D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + (0 + 0)D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;+ (1 + 0)D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

so &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem. 

However in the most general case the small intervals may not be related by Pythagoras' theorem:

Suppose 

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

So, as before:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y = &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Z = &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Z/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Z/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

So:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;-D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;/FONT&gt;

This chart is incomplete. It is missing certain compound characters and voiced characters. - 67.169.44.125
: Could you point out which ones? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 16:38, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
::According to [[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson 6#Games|one of the training programs]] ''Kye'' and ''wi'' for example are used. It also lists different Romaji transliterations of the voiced form of ''chi'', namely ''dzi'' in stead of ''ji''. The last character of katakana ローマ字 (Romaji) isn't even listed at all. I would say this table needs some work. I suggest you take a look at [[w:Katakana]], which lists several updates to this table. [[User:Redge|Redge]] 13:55, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
::# &quot;Used&quot; is a relative term. &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are occasionally used for their old-fashioned look, and of course appear in older literature. Not sure what you mean about &quot;kye&quot;.
::# You won't find 字 in the table because it's kanji, not katakana.
::# You're right, the missing &quot;foreign sound&quot; katakana should be added.
::# There are several Romanization conventions, and we shouldn't try to cram them all into one table. The contributors to this wikibook have adopted a convention that they judged to be best.

::::Perhaps it is simply a matter of Slime Forrest and this wikibook using different standards, but it's frustrating of having to decide between the lessons you learn here and the ones rehearsed in Slime Forrest. Anyway, Forrest lists キエ as kye in stead of ki e, is what I ment. Excuse me for jumping to conclusions here. [[User:Redge|Redge]] 09:10, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
:::::I tried the game just a few minutes but it seems that I don't have enough time to find (nor patience to wait for it) キエ as kye. Probably it's キェ (small ェ, not large エ). Er..., if the game uses &quot;kye&quot; for キエ (not キェ), it's simply wrong. キエ is &quot;kie&quot;.
:::::Although this is my personal feeling, I don't think it's a good idea to practice *typing* ヰ and ヱ so many times (even in a few minutes play, I was made to type them several times). If you are able to read them, that's enough. In what occasion do you need to ''type'' them? At least I've hardly used them. Perhaps just two or three times, including now. In fact, they are so rarely used that the old version of ATOK I use did not know &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; for ヰ and ヱ, thus I had to find them from character table it includes (ATOK is one of Romaji to Kanji converters; it's possible newer versions know them). Well, if you're going to study Japanese classic literature, the ability might be useful, but if not... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 10:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC) mod.

==Bolded sounds==
Why are some of the letters (both Katakana and Hiragana) for certain sounds bolded?

== Breaking up the girl ==

I really like this table, but how about revamping it still. I'm unsure about the benefit of listing the kana together and find the romaji stands out too much with it in bold. It still needs some distinction but the kana in bold might not render very well for everyone. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:44, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

: The reasoning to have the kana in bold was ridiculous.  This is a kana chart and should be used as a reference, and not as a tutorial.  This could go into the actual hiragana/katakana pages, where the information is easily assimilated than in this crowded table.

: I'm not sure how to revise the chart other than making two separate charts.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 19:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:: &quot;''The reasoning ... was ridiculous.''&quot; Ouch. I apologise for failing seeing things the same way as you do. Perhaps we can try to see where the other is coming from before calling things ridiculous?
:: I would sincerely be interested in learning for what sort of situations such a reference would be of great use. Since all seem agreed that learning the syllabaries should be one of the first steps, I'd expect that rather than needing to look up the sound to find the kana character, the student might on occasion wish to find which sound a character makes. In such cases, highlighting the character being looked for would make sense.
:: I might experiment with splitting these tables up on seperate pages and then just transcluding them here. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:01, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

::: Roomaji is a poor reference to show something is pronounced.  This chart shouldn't be used as such.  It should be used as a lookup/reference to remind the student on the consonant+vowel, y-medial compound, and other special characters.  It should not be used as a tutorial.
::: Furthermore, this chart shouldn't be making special notes on how often a word starts with characters and/or how often the character is used within the language's vocabulary.  This information should be used within other means.  Jamming too many concepts onto this chart is going to ruin its use.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 00:27, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::: I agree that romaji is a poor reference to show pronunciation. I don't think I was arguing otherwise.
:::: I agree that the table shouldn't be intended as a tutorial. I didn't suggest that it be one.
:::: I simply asked in which situations a student might wish to refer to a table indexed by romaji, given that learning the syllabaries would be one of the first steps. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:23, 27 June 2008 (UTC)
::::: My biggest problem isn't the roomaji.  I was just stating that roomaji isn't a good source to show a sound of a kana character.  My problem is the combination of bolding the roomaji and the kana.  The former to help the user focus on the roomaji characters and the latter to illustrate infrequent characters.  The latter is not needed.  It could go elsewhere, like individual kana pages. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 17:29, 27 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To form a Japanese sentence, you just need to remember few simple rules:
* Personal pronouns are mostly omitted, or replaced with names:
*: すき　だ - I like it/you
*: ほんだくん　が　すき　だ - I like you (when talking to Honda-kun)
* A normal (full) sentence always ends with a verb (even if it is an attributive verb, usually called verbal adjectives or the Japanese true adjective; we will discuss this more thoroughly later) and, optionally, special sentence-ending particles (mostly used to convey emotions and emphasis) after it. One verb alone may be treated like a full sentence. No other parts of speech can form a sentence alone. To end a sentence which does not have any action, and simply describes qualities of objects (&quot;a person is sitting&quot; is not a description of a quality, but rather a continuous action), copula verb で　ある (or any of its forms, including だ) must be used.
*: すごい - It's great
*: いく　ぞ - I am going
*: これ　は　ほん　だ - This is a book
** Note that there are some exceptions when another particles are overtaking the だ copula (this note only applies to this only copula verb form; other で　ある forms do not have such exceptions) functions (for example, だ　か cannot end sentence, か is considered to possess verbal functions in this case).
**: それ　は　ほん　か - Is that a book?
** Another exception is that the subject of the sentence may sometimes be placed right after the end of a sentence (after the verb with all sentence-ending particles), but no particles may be added afterwards. This construction although rarely used, is acceptable in spoken language for emphasizing the person you are talking to or talking about:
**: すごい　ねえ, ほんだくん - It's great, Honda-kun!
* If you want to give focus to an object or expression, put a が after it. If you want to give focus to what an object or expression does (to an action), put a は after it:
*: ぼく　は　いく　ぞ - I'm *going*
*: ぼく　が　いく　ぞ - It's *me*, who is going
*: わたし　は　あなた　が　きらい　だ - I hate you.
* Time of the events is usually put at the beginning of the sentence:
*: きょう　とうきょう　に　いく - Today I am going to Tokyo.

[[Image:Brühwürfel-1.jpg|thumb|Various stock cubes]]

A '''bouillon cube''' (US) or '''stock cube''' (UK and Australia) is dehydrated broth (''bouillon'' in French) or stock formed into a small cube about 15 mm wide. It is made by dehydrating vegetables, meat stock, a small portion of solid fat (such as hydrogenated oil), salt (usually well over 50%) and seasonings (usually including monosodium glutamate) and shaping them into a small cube. Dehydrated broth is also available in granular form.

Broth made from rehydrated cubes is different in taste from fresh broth because of its higher salt content and flavors changed by the boiling process. Bouillon cubes are convenient and inexpensive. The cubes are widely used in English cooking to add flavor.

Common brands include Oxo, [Knorr, Rose Hill, Jumbo brand (Gallina Blanca), Maggi, Hormel's Herb-Ox, Wyler's, Goya and Kallo.</text>

ETF is a direct port of a Quake III mod called Q3F (which has ceased in development) to Enemy Territory. This wiki covers the use of entities in ETF map making. It is apparently adapted from the Q3F Map Entity Documentation.

== Overview ==

=== What it's all about ===

The ETF entities are intended to be an extension to existing entities rather than replacing the current entities (at least, as far as possible). Currently, they're both incomplete and potentially bug-ridden. Many features we'd like to add haven't yet been added, and some entity types will not coexist happily with the extensions. 

Initially the entities info_notnull, func_goalitem, func_commandpoint and func_goalinfo defaulted to a 30 second wait when there was NO wait field given. This default wait has been removed since Beta1f to stop some serious issues and make the entities more logical. If your map was based around this default wait, a recompile is needed. 

Some of the worldspawn fields have changed, to make them shorter. Q3 couldn't parse the long keys and gave errors on compile. Finally, the ammo_bullets is now called ammo_nails, which is more logical, too.

You can now use the mapinfo files to set atmosphere and class names, names, team names, allied teams, etc. throughout the whole map or for a specified gameindex.

=== Basic Principles ===

Essentially, each entity has a 'state', as follows: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Invisible'''
| This entity is not triggerable, nor is it visible (although this has some odd side effects, e.g. invisible doors still stop people from walking through them).
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Disabled'''
| This entity is not triggerable.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Inactive'''
| This entity is idle (and can be thought of as 'touchable'). For goalitems, this means 'back at base'. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Active'''
| This entity is active, and (depending on its settings), will go back to inactive after a set time. For goalitems, this means 'lying on the ground'. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Carried'''
| This state only applies to goalitems.
|}

When successfully touched by a player, an entity will attempt to go to carried/active state. After a set time, active entities will automatically go back to inactive. 

Entities can also trigger other entities in a 'cascade' of triggers, by using &lt;state&gt;target keys, e.g. on a flag entity you might have &quot;carriedtarget&quot; &quot;alarms&quot; - that would activate all 'alarms' entities when a flag became carried. 

There are a set of criteria checked before an entity can be triggered (although triggers can also be 'forced' to ignore criteria, more on this later). 

In addition to this, players can be 'given' bonuses, and teams can be given scores, as well as having messages and sounds played.

=== What it can do ===

*It can be used to create complex map effects and the like (think of Team Fortress), as well as some degree of 'scripting'.

=== What it can't do ===

*It can't be used as a language in its own right - it will maintain no variables, parse no scripts. This may become available in a future release, but not right now (also, there would be performance questions in a scripting language).

== Examples ==

=== Trigger Types ===

There are six main sorts of triggers you'll use:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Brush triggers'''
| This is something like a trigger_multiple - an area brush that triggers when you walk over it.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Point triggers'''
| These are used as func_goalinfo entities, and can have mins and maxs set to define their actual size. They trigger when you walk into the defined area surrounding the entity - they can also do other effects, such as showing a model that becomes invisible while active, etc. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Untouchable triggers'''
| These are usually set as info_notnull, and act as relays or simply alternative triggers (i.e. two entities with the same name, one only triggerable by blue and one only triggerable by red). 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Flags'''
| These are used as func_goalitem entities (or func_flag, same thing), and are 'carried' by the player when successfully touched. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Standard entities'''
| These are things like func_door, or info_player_start entities - they act in more or less the usual fashion, but the criteria and cascading triggers still operate. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Special entities'''
| These are things like the func_commandpoint - new entities that have special behaviour defined by the entity. (More on these later).
|}

=== Sample Flag ===

A 'flag' is a carryable entity that can only be carried by one team, and does various effects when carried. 
&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // The red flag 

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_goalitem&quot;
    // this one is set by the editor when you position the entity:
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;1248 1984 -328&quot;

    // What it looks like    
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;models/flags/r_flag.md3&quot;    // Model to use    
    &quot;light&quot; &quot;200&quot;                        // Dynamic light
    &quot;color&quot; &quot;1 0 0&quot;                      // Pure red
    &quot;sparkle&quot; &quot;1 0 0&quot;                    // Generate smoke puffs around carrier

    // Wait 45 seconds before going inactive (i.e. back to base):
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;45&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Capture Point ===

Now we have a flag, we need somewhere to capture it. 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // The capture point in the blue base

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;trigger_multiple&quot;
    // Origin/size defined by brush (never set)
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;*10&quot;

    // Criteria
    // Only trigger if activator holds redflag:
    &quot;holding&quot; &quot;redflag&quot;

    // Messages
    // Centerprint message to everyone:
    &quot;active_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has CAPTURED the ^1RED^* flag!&quot;
    &quot;active_message&quot; &quot;You have scored 2 frags for capturing the flag.&quot;
    // Play sound to activator:
    &quot;active_sound&quot; &quot;~sound/teamplay/voc_blue_scores.wav&quot;
    // Play sound to activator's team (apart from activator):
    &quot;active_team_sound&quot; &quot;sound/teamplay/flagcap_blu.wav&quot;

    // 'Give' bonuses
    &quot;give&quot; &quot;score=+2,health=+100,armor=+200,ammo_shells=+200,ammo_nails=+200,ammo_cells=+200,ammo_rockets=+200,ammo_medikit=+50,gren1=+4,gren2=+2&quot;    
    // Give activator's team 10 points (the teamscore, not the players on the team):
    &quot;teamscore&quot; &quot;10&quot;

    // When activated, force redflag to inactive (back to base),
    // trigger scorer (optional extra 10 points entity):
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;redflag=~inactive,scorer&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Command Point ===

To make things a little more interesting, why don't we have a 'scorer' command point that gives players an extra 10 points when they capture the flag? 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // A button to press to claim the command point

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_button&quot;
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;*1&quot;
    &quot;angle&quot; &quot;-2&quot;
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;5&quot;
    // Trigger the scorer command point when activated:
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;scorer_cp&quot;
}

{
    // The scorer command point (no model, so must be triggered by another entity)

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_commandpoint&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;448 832 -128&quot;

    // Misc
    &quot;groupname&quot; &quot;scorer_cp&quot;

    // Messages
    &quot;active_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has claimed the\ncapture bonus for the %T!&quot;

    // On activation (i.e. touch if we have a model, or trigger by a button
    // or something otherwise)
    // All entities named 'scorer' are locked to activators team:
    &quot;teamset&quot; &quot;scorer&quot;
    // Set scorer to inactive (i.e. ready to be activated):
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;scorer=inactive&quot;
}

{
    // An untouchable 'scorer' entity
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;info_notnull&quot;    
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;444 828 -84&quot;         // Hardly 'essential' in this case...

    // Misc
    &quot;groupname&quot; &quot;scorer&quot;           // So other entities can reference
    // Prevent scorer from being triggered initially
    // (i.e. until command point is claimed):
    &quot;initialstate&quot; &quot;disabled&quot;

    // On activation
    &quot;teamscore&quot; &quot;10&quot;               // Give the activator's team 10 points
    // Go inactive after 1 second (the chances of someone capturing twice
    // in under a second are pretty slim...):
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;1&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Hud ===
We've forgotten something - we need to show a player if he's carrying the flag or not, or he's liable to get confused (and upset if he finds he's had it for the last 5 minutes without capturing). We need a HUD entity. 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // A HUD entity shown to the red flag carrier
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_hud&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;1252 1980 -292&quot;

    // Entity never actually activates, just show this model:
    &quot;inactive_model&quot; &quot;models/flags/r_flag.md3&quot;
    &quot;slot&quot; &quot;1&quot;            // Display it in slot 1 (top left)
    &quot;holding&quot; &quot;redflag&quot;   // Only player holding redflag can see this entity
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Reference ==

=== Entity States ===
Essentially, each entity has a 'state', as follows:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Invisible'''
| This entity is not triggerable, nor is it visible (although this has some odd side effects, e.g. invisible doors still stop people walking through them).
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Disabled'''
| This entity is not triggerable.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Inactive'''
| This entity is idle (and can be thought of as 'touchable'). For goalitems, this means 'back at base'.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Active'''
| This entity is active, and (depending on its settings), will go back to inactive after a set time. For goalitems, this means 'lying on the ground'.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Carried'''
| This state only applies to goalitems. 
|}

When a player touches an entity and the criteria are passed, it will be triggered to carried (if it's a carryable entity), or active. 

Unless forced (see targets), only certain state changes are permitted (note that you cannot change state to the current state (nothing at all will happen): 

{|border=&quot;1&quot;

|}

When an entity changes state, it will trigger any messages or sounds for that state, as well as executing give (only when in carried/active state, depending on whether it can be carried), teamscore (again, only in carried/active) and &lt;state&gt;target (see targets). 

An entity can have its state changed a maximum of 5 times (currently) per-frame single frame - this is to prevent infinite loops from hanging the server - but you would be wiser to avoid any situations where this kicks in (since you cannot always be sure what state the entity will end up in, particularly if the limit changes).

=== Messages ===
When an entity changes state, messages and sounds can be sent out to various players, optionally with the 'force' flag (prefixing the string with a ~ symbol). The force flag causes messages to be centerprinted and sounds to be global (i.e. no attenuation). Messages can be sent to four different groups: The activator, the activator's team (excluding activator), all players not on the activator's team, or all players. 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''&lt;state&gt;_message'''
| Send a message to the activator. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_team_message'''
| Send a message to the activator's teammates. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_nonteam_message'''
| Send a message to all players not on the activator's team.  
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_all_message'''
| Send a message to all players. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_sound'''
| Play a sound to the activator (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_team_sound'''
| Play a sound to the activator's teammates (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_nonteam_sound'''
| Play a sound to all players not on the activator's team (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_all_sound'''
| Play a sound to all players.
|}

&lt;state&gt; in the above strings means the state to play on, e.g. active_message. For sounds, currently only sounds everyone can hear (&lt;state&gt;_all_sound) can be played 'unforced' (i.e. fades with distance from the entity). 

Additionally, there is another prefix that is not a state. This is the kill prefix. It is used just as the other messages, but useful for o.a. trigger_hurt entities. Example: &quot;kill_all_message&quot; &quot;%n shouldn't have been here.&quot; as a keypair on a trigger_hurt will display &quot;Dummy shouldn't have been here.&quot; as a deathmessage when the player called Dummy gets killed by the trigger_hurt. 

Messages can also contain tokens that are expanded as required. Tokens in UPPERCASE represent the activator (if present). Tokens in lowercase represent the entity itself: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''%H'''
| Health 
|-
| '''%A'''
| Armor 
|-
| '''%L'''
| Location (returns 'unknown location' if unable to work it out) 
|-
| '''%D'''
| Location of last death. 
|-
| '''%R'''
| Last reported location (i.e. identical to last %L) 
|-
| '''%T'''
| Team name (e.g. &quot;Red Team&quot;, &quot;Blue Team&quot; etc.) 
|-
| '''%C'''
| Team colour (e.g. red, blue etc.) 
|-
| '''%G'''
| Disguise (returns 'not disguised' if not wearing a disguise) 
|-
| '''%N'''
| Name (player name / entity groupname (or one of them) 
|-
| '''%E'''
| State (e.g. &quot;active&quot;, &quot;carried&quot; etc.) 
|-
| '''%S'''
| Class (e.g. &quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;medic&quot; etc.) 
|}
For example, you could say: 
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;active_flaginfo&quot; &quot;The ^1RED^* flag has been dropped at $l.&quot;
// $l is used for locations of the goalitem entity dunno why but it is.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Incidentally, you can use these tokens in communications as well (case does not matter), save that you require $ instead of %. If you want to annoy everyone on the server, just say &quot;Hello $r, I'm $n of the $t.&quot; (I wouldn't really recommend it, though). $r is readers name now instead of $n.

=== Flaginfo ===
Flaginfo is sent to players who execute a \flaginfo command. All entities that have a &lt;state&gt;_flaginfo will have that info sent to the client. Normally, it's flags and the like that keep flaginfo, hence the command name. For flags, you'd expect a carried, active, and inactive flaginfo string, e.g. 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''carried_flaginfo'''
| &quot;%N has the red flag at %L (and only %H health left)&quot;
|-
| '''active_flaginfo'''
| &quot;The red flag is lying in the field at $l&quot; (note the lowercase and $, there's no carrier!)
|-
| '''inactive_flaginfo'''
| &quot;The red flag is safe at base&quot;
|}

=== Give ===
Entities can 'give' bonuses to affected players when set to carried (if a carryable entity) or active (if not). The give string is of the form &quot;give&quot; &quot;stat=value,stat=value,stat=value&quot;. The following stats are available: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''health'''
| Health
|- 
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''armor'''
| Armor
|- 
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''damage'''
| Deal damage to the target 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_shells'''
| Shells
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_nails'''
| Nails
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_rockets'''
| Rockets 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_cells'''
| Cells 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_medikit'''
| Medikit ammo 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_charge'''
| HE Charge 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''score'''
| Player score (not teamscore) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gren1'''
| Grenade type 1 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gren2'''
| Grenade type 2 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''quad'''
| Seconds of quad damage 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''regen'''
| Seconds of regen 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''flight'''
| Seconds of flight 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''battlesuit'''
| Seconds of battlesuit 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''invis'''
| Seconds of invisibility (shimmer invis, not agent invis) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''haste'''
| Seconds of haste 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''invuln'''
| Seconds of invulnerability 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aqualung'''
| Seconds of aqualung 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ceasefire'''
| Seconds a player is unable to shoot 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gas'''
| Seconds of gas 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''stun'''
| Seconds of stun 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''flash'''
| Seconds of flash 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''tranq'''
| Seconds of tranq 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''fire'''
| Amount of fire counters, every counter does a certain amount of burn damage every few seconds 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''armortype'''
| Armour type (as a number from 0-100). This is the amount of damage the armour saves you from* 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_shell'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against shells (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_bullet'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against nailgun / sniper rifle (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_explosive'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against explosions (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_shock'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against emp/electrical attacks (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_fire'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against fire and prevent burning (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_all'''
| If true, set all armour classes (otherwise, remove all armour classes) 
|}

If not forced (with a ~ prefix), these values are limited to player maximums. If + or - is prefixed, they're added or removed from existing values rather than set, e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;give&quot; &quot;health=~500,armor=+50,score=+3,quad=10,haste=10,aclass_fire=1&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Would give a player 500 health (no matter their class max), 50 more armour (up to class max), 3 points, ten seconds of quad and haste (no matter what they had before), and fire-resistant armour. 

If armortype is not specified and armour is given (i.e. the player gets more armour than they had before the command), it is automatically assumed that their armour type should be set to the maximum. If you want their armour type to remain unchanged, put in a key like &quot;armortype=+0&quot;. 

There are also a set of entity keys that affect the command: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''affectteams'''
| Affect the named teams, (e.g. &quot;red,blue&quot;) regardless of which team activated this entity 
|-
| '''effectradius'''
| Affect only those players within the specified radius 
|-
| '''holding'''
| Affect only those players holding these goalitems 
|-
| '''notholding'''
| Affect only those players not holding these goalitems 
|-
| '''clientstats'''
| Affect only those matching these clientstats 
|}

Note that the way the criteria work, it first checks affectteams and the affectteam/affectnonteam flags for players to affect, and them limits this based on the lineofsight/environment flags.

=== Flags ===
An entity's key &quot;flags&quot; can be used to specify a comma-separated list of boolean flags that affect the entity's behavior in multiple areas, as follows. These can be categorised as criteria/effect/command flags: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''hideactive''' (cmd)
| Cause the entity to be invisible while active (e.g. for refill goalinfos).
|-
| '''affectteam''' (eff)
| Cause the 'give' command to affect everyone on the activator's team. 
|-
| '''affectnonteam''' (eff)
| Cause the 'give' command to affect everyone not on the activator's team. 
|-
| '''dropoff''' (eff)
| 'give' values 'drop off' with distance (requires a 'range' key in the entity). 
|-
| '''lineofsight''' (eff)
| Only entities in line of sight will be affected. 
|-
| '''environment''' (eff)
| Only entities in the same environment will be affected. 
|-
| '''shootable''' (cmd)
| Allow shooting the entity to be equivalent to touching it (only for func_doors). 
|-
| '''reversecriteria''' (cri)
| Causes the entity to only be triggered if the criteria are NOT met. 
|-
| '''orclientstats''' (cri)
| Causes the clientstats criteria to be OR instead of AND. 
|-
| '''revealagent''' (cmd)
| If triggered, the activator will lose his disguise. 
|-
| '''showcarry''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, cause it to be shown above the player, as with CTF flags. 
|-
| '''chargeable''' (cmd)
| Allow HE charging the entity to be equivalent to touching it. 
|-
| '''rotating''' (cmd)
| Cause the model to rotate and bob like an item (only for goalinfo/goalitems). 
|-
| '''noshrink''' (cmd)
| Goal does not grow or shrink when appearing/disappearing.
|-
| '''nodrop''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, stop the 'dropflag' command affecting it. 
|-
| '''keepondeath''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, don't drop on death. 
|-
| '''usegauntlet''' (cmd)
| Entity must be axed instead of touched. 
|-
| '''allowdead''' (cmd)
| Allow dead players to be selected in target_cycle use. 
|-
| '''allowsame''' (cmd)
| Allow same player to be selected in target_cycle use. 
|-
| '''faildirection''' (cmd)
| Forcefield direction field applies to those failing the criteria. 
|-
| '''allowsentrylock''' (cmd)
| Sentry is allowed to lock on through forcefields (bad idea :).
|-
| '''disguisecriteria''' (cri)
| Criteria work on agent's apparent team/class rather than real.
|}

=== Targets ===
The targeting system is what binds all the entities together into something more. When an entity changes state, it checks for &lt;state&gt;target and then attempts to set each named target to the specified state (default state if not specified is always 'active'). If forced by prefixing the state with a ~ character, criteria (and 'give'/'teamscore') are ignored, e.g.

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;carriedtarget&quot; &quot;redalarms,escapedoors=~disabled&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

Will cause the alarms to go to active (default if not specified), and forces all escape doors to be disabled, even if they're currently active (i.e. open).

To be targetable, entities must have either a targetname or a groupname key, the differences are as follows:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| targetname
| Can only hold a single name, affects some entities - e.g. targetname will stop doors opening when players touch them, and teleporters will only look at targetnames for a destination, etc.
|-
| groupname
| Can hold any number of names, separated by commas, and will respond to triggers on any of them - this allows much more complex entity interactions. It will not affect entities as having a targetname will.
|}
Wherever possible, please use groupname instead of targetname - it's much more flexible and less prone to side-effects.

Please note that unforced triggers (i.e. without a ~) will pass the same activator on to the triggered entity (i.e. the player rather than the entity passing the trigger on). Also, the criteria are still check against the activator).

If you find yourself having problems with this, try setting g_mapentDebug to 1 at the console - be warned that you'll get a lot of junk out of this, and it may not help much.

See the Entity States section for more information.

=== Criteria ===

Criteria are checks on whether or not the activator can actually trigger this entity. The following fields apply, as well as some flags:
{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| allowteams
| Only the specified teams (e.g. &quot;red,blue&quot;) are allowed
|-
| allowclasses
| Only the specified classes (e.g. &quot;recon,grenadier,agent&quot;) are allowed
|-
| holding
| Only players holding all the specified entities (e.g. &quot;redkey1,redkey2&quot;) are allowed.
|-
| notholding
| Only players not holding all the specified entities (e.g. &quot;redkey1,redkey2&quot;) are allowed.
|-
| clientstats
| Only players matching the specified clientstats (e.g. &quot;health&lt;50,gren1=0,armour&lt;!&quot;) are allowed (see below).
|-
| checkstate
| The trigger is only valid if at least one of each named entity is in the specified state, e.g. &quot;redalarms=inactive,redflag=carried&quot;). If you want want to ensure all named entities are in a certain state, simply give each entity a unique group and check those.
|-
| disguisecriteria
| Criteria work on agent's apparent team/class rather than real.
|}

The clientstats value is a list of evaluators build up like this: [keyword][evaluator][value], with the evaluator being '=', '&lt;', '&gt;', '&lt;=' or '&gt;='. The value is an integer or '!' (indicates activators' class maximum) and the keys can be the following: health, armor, ammo_shells, ammo_nails, ammo_rockets, ammo_cells, score, gren1, gren2, quad, regen, flight, battlesuit, invis, haste, ammo_medikit, ammo_charge, invuln, aqualung, gas, stun, flash, tranq, fire, skill.

If the criteria fail (after the reversecriteria flag is applied), the 'failtarget' key will be executed - note that there's no 'wait' on failures, so don't do anything processor intensive.

=== Map Info ===

Each map should be accompanied by a &quot;mapinfo&quot; file, which lives in the maps directory with its map, e.g. maps/etf_map.bsp should be accompanied by a maps/etf_map.mapinfo file.

The mapinfo defines assorted properties describing the map, as well as overriding world-spawn attributes. The file format is something like:

&lt;pre&gt;
mapinfo {
	map		&quot;etf_map&quot;;					// BSP name
	longname	&quot;Mapname&quot;;					// Long name for map, general description of it
	type		&quot;etf&quot;;						// Game it is for (all etf maps are marked with &quot;etf&quot;)
	gameindices	&quot;1,2,3&quot;;					// Available gameindices
	atmosphere	&quot;T=RAIN,B=5 10,C=0.5,G=0.5 2,BV=0,GV=0 100,W=1 2,D=300&quot;;	// Atmospheric effects

	gameindexDef 1 {						// Gameindex Definition
		longname	&quot;Mapname CTF&quot;;	// Long name for this gameindex

		// Map info (former .mpi)
		mapinfo		&quot;Blablabladebladebla&quot;;

		// Class limits etc
		green_limit		&quot;0&quot;;
		yellow_limit		&quot;0&quot;;
		sniper_limit		&quot;2&quot;;
		grenadier_limit		&quot;3&quot;;
		red_soldier_limit	&quot;5&quot;;
		blue_soldier_limit	&quot;6&quot;;

		atmosphere	&quot;T=SNOW&quot;;
	}

	gameindexDef 2 {
		longname	&quot;Mapname 1-flag CTF&quot;;
		mapinfo		&quot;Blablabladebladebla&quot;;
		green_limit	&quot;0&quot;;
		yellow_limit	&quot;0&quot;;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Entries in gameIndexDef blocks override the default entries (which are not associated with any particular gameindex, and apply to all). Note that the gameindices field is required, and will default to &quot;1&quot; if not specified (however many gameIndexDef blocks there are).

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| map
| The name of the map it is associated with (not used, merely for completeness).
|-
| longname
| The &quot;human&quot; name of the map.
|-
| mapinfo
| A brief description of the map and how it is played.
|-
| type
| Should always be &quot;etf&quot;.
|-
| gameindices
| Should indicate all valid indices.
|-
| minplayers
| The minimum number of players recommended on the map.
|-
| maxplayers
| The maximum number of players recommended on the map.
|}

Each map+gameindex combination is treated as a completely separate map in voting lists. gameindexes should be a single digit from 1 to 9.

Any fields not mentioned here will override worldspawn keys instead (for example atmosphere).

=== Gameindices ===
Gameindices make it possible to have multiple scenarios in one map. Basically, all entities with a 'gameindex' key spawn only when the server has g_gameindex set to the same value.

For example, when an entity has &quot;gameindex&quot; &quot;1,2&quot;, it will only spawn when g_gameindex (which defaults to 1) is 1 or 2 on the server.

Also, for the server to know which gameindices are allowed for this map, there is a new key for the .arena file. This key is called 'gameindices' and has as value an array of the allowed gameindices. For example &quot;1,2,3&quot;, which results in g_gameindex 1, 2 and 3 being valid for this map. If it has a different value during the loading of the map, it defaults to 1.

=== Custom Infoparms ===
Q3F uses the -custinfoparms parameter of q3map 1.1-TA-beta and newer being distributed with GtkRadiant to extend Quake3's shader language.

Current custom infoparms:

particleclip 	Particles collide with this surface.
forcefield 	Used in combination with the func_forcefield entity to create forcefields.
footprints 	If a client walks over a shader with the footprints parameter set, he leaves a trail of footprints.
stone 	Stone footstep and ricochet sounds.
wood 	Wood footstep and ricochet sounds.
seethrough 	Translucent surface a sentry can track through even if it's solid.

To use these parameters, you need to add a 'custinfoparms.txt' file to your scripts directory (where your shaders live) and execute the bsp stage of the compile process with the additional -custinfoparms command line parameter.

The contents of the textfile used with Q3F:

&lt;pre&gt;
// Custom Surfaceparms file

// Custom Contentsflags
{
	particleclip 0x2000
	forcefield 0x4000
}
// Custom Surfaceflags
{
	footprints 0x80000
	stone 0x100000
	wood 0x200000
	seethrough 0x400000
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

FUNC_* ENTITIES

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_bobbing (0 .5 .8) ? X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that oscillates back and forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the brush in the axis in which it's bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis (up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the &quot;noise&quot; key is set. Will crush the player when blocked.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32). 
phase : sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav - See Notes).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : entity will bob along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : entity will bob along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_button (0 .5 .8) ?
When a button is touched by a player, it moves in the direction set by the &quot;angle&quot; key, triggers all its targets, stays pressed by an amount of time set by the &quot;wait&quot; key, then returns to it's original position where it can be operated again.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : determines the direction in which the button will move (up = -1, down = -2).
target : all entities with a matching targetname will be triggered.
speed : speed of button's displacement (default 40).
wait : number of seconds button stays pressed (default 1, -1 = return immediately).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 4 units).

alphamap : this is the path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
layers : this integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
shader : this is the path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity.

/*QUAKED func_pendulum (0 .5 .8) ?
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : angle offset of axis of rotation from default X axis (default 0).
speed : angle of swing arc in either direction from initial position (default 30).
phase : sets the start offset of the swinging cycle. Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default &quot;0 0 0&quot; - See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if &quot;height&quot; is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the &quot;height&quot; key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the &quot;lip&quot; key. Using the &quot;height&quot; key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.*/

speed : determines how fast entity rotates (default 100).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/bitch/fembotbig.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default &quot;0 0 0&quot; - See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

/*QUAKED func_static (0 .5 .8) ?
Static non-solid bspmodel. Can be used for conditional walls and models.

origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
targetname : NOT SUPPORTED BY RENDERER - if set, a func_button or trigger can make entity disappear from the game (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.*/

In genuine bot arena matches, the podium for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place players at the end of the match is generated by this entity. The podium's origin will automatically be located 128 units in the direction of the camera's view and 84 units down from the y height of the view line at that point. It will also always be generated on a level plane regardless of the pointing angle of the camera so if that angle is too steep, part of the podium model might not be visible. Make sure you leave at least 106 units of free space in front of where the camera points to otherwise the podium model won't be visible at all.*/

So if one of the items in the team has it's &quot;wait&quot; key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played (&quot;random&quot; key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from &quot;wait&quot; delay (&quot;wait&quot; key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the &quot;noise&quot; key can be replaced by the implicit folder character &quot;*&quot; for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a &quot;bottomless pit&quot; in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the &quot;noise&quot; key to &quot;*falling1.wav&quot;. The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create &quot;player-specific&quot; triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the &quot;wait&quot; and &quot;random&quot; keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the &quot;random&quot; key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

/*QUAKED func_forcefield (.5 .5 0) ?
ETF-only
Forcefields are conditional walls, which are only solid to players/weapons failing criteria. The criteria can be anything that would apply to a trigger (team/class/entity states/holding/notholding/clientstats, etc.), as well as directional barriers. 

The forcefield should be created as a func_forcefield entity, with all faces of brush marked with: 

	surfaceparm nonsolid
	surfaceparm forcefield

(Where forcefield is specified as forcefield 0x4000 in the custinfoparms.txt file.) 

-------- KEYS --------
&quot;angles&quot;: Specified as pitch yaw, fields with this key will only allow players through in the specified direction.
&quot;wait&quot;: number of seconds before the forcefield can activate again (default 2).
&quot;give&quot;: See entity docs for a complete documentation of give
&quot;flags&quot;: See entity docs for a complete documentation of flags

The forcefield is not suited for normal state setting - states should always be forced to ensure they go into the desired state, although it's not required. 

Invisible: Forcefields have no effect, all players can pass through.
Disabled: Forcefields act as normal, but fail to trigger.
Inactive: Forcefields act as normal, and trigger when someone passing the criteria passes through.
Active: See above, drops back to inactive after a default of 2 seconds). 

-------- NOTES --------
- All normal activation criteria apply: allowclasses, allowteams, checkstate, clientstats, holding, and notholding.
- Flags of interest: faildirection,allowstentrylock
- Weapons can travel through forcefields if their owners can, and in the same directions.
- Only team/class/direction prediction is possible client-side, any other criteria will cause the client to mispredict (and a 'jitter' effect will occur) - clients cannot finesse this to pass through the field.
- Pulse and Flash grenades are still effective through forcefields.
- Players within a forcefield who fail the criteria will be trapped as long as the forcefield is present.
- Players travelling through an 'upward' forcefield will rise up until they're standing on the surface, or cannot rise any further.
- Forcefields can be used to support player's weight, and form, e.g. one-team bridges. 
- You must compile the bsp stage of your map with the -custinfoparms option.
- custinfoparms.txt must exist in /scripts.

/*QUAKED func_door (0 .5 .8) ? START_OPEN - CRUSHER
Modified for ETF

Normal sliding door entity. By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : determines the opening direction of door (up = -1, down = -2).
speed : determines how fast the door moves (default 100).
wait : number of seconds before door returns (default 2, -1 = &quot;never return&quot; (in ETF) or &quot;return immediately&quot; in quake3) (ETF-modified)
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 8)
targetname : if set, a func_button or trigger is required to activate the door.
health : (default 0) if set to any non-zero value, the button must take damage (any amount) to activate.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of door (default 4). Door will reverse direction when blocked unless CRUSHER spawnflag is set.
team: assign the same team name to multiple doors that should operate together (see Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OPEN : the door will spawn in the open state and operate in reverse.
CRUSHER : door will not reverse direction when blocked and will keep damaging player until he dies or gets out of the way.
-------- NOTES --------
Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_multiple (.5 .5 .5) ?
Modified for ETF
Variable size repeatable trigger. It will fire the entities it targets when touched by player. Can be made to operate like a trigger_once entity by setting the &quot;wait&quot; key to -1. It can also be activated by another trigger that targets it.
-------- KEYS --------
&lt;state&gt;target: activates when the entity enters &lt;state&gt; (ETF-only).
target : this points to the entity to activate.
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
wait : time in seconds until trigger becomes re-triggerable after it's been touched (default 0.2, -1 = trigger once).

-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/
All normal activation criteria apply: allowclasses, allowteams, checkstate, clientstats, holding, and notholding.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_train (0 .5 .8) ?
Modified for ETF
Trains are moving solids that follow a string of path_corner entities. Trains in Q3A are very basic, they also require an origin brush (see Notes).

ETF Additions
When a func_train reaches a path_corner, it first checks if there is a next path_corner is available. 
This means that the next path_corner exists, and is in state active or inactive. 
Also, when it finds multiple valid targets, it randomly chooses between then. 
With this you can, say, let a train switch between track A and B using a switch.
Next to that, opposed to the standard Q3 implementation of the func_train, the ETF version has proper collision with entities, and will push them forward till they are crushed. Goalitems will return to their spawn position, in other words, go back to their inactive state.

-------- KEYS --------
dmg : amount of damage to do to players who block it (ETF-only).
speed : speed of displacement of train (default 100 or overridden by speed value of path).
target : this points to the first path_corner of the path which is also the spawn location of the train's origin.
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of the train's brush(es) and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
1. Trains always start on in the game.
2. Trains do not damage the played when blocked.
3. Trains cannot emit sound.
4. Trains are not triggerable or toggle-able.
5. Trains cannot be block-stopped just by getting in their way, the player must be wedged between the train and another obstacle to block it.

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

target : point to next path_corner in the path.
targetname : the train following the path or the previous path_corner in the path points to this.
speed : speed of func_train while moving to the next path corner. This will override the speed value of the train.
wait : number of seconds func_train will pause on path corner before moving to next path corner (default 0 - see Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------

== More to explore ==

This section discusses additional noteworthy features of ETF mapping (not just related to entities) and provides links to further online resources.

=== Compiling with q3map2 ===

Here is the complete manual to q3map2: [[Q3Map2]]

Make sure you use  &lt;code&gt;-fs_game etf&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-game et&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code&gt;-custinfoparms&lt;/code&gt; switches on each phase of the compile (bsp, vis, light)

Example of a .bat used to compile etf_2stoned:
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -v -game et -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -meta -custinfoparms -fs_game etf &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-bsp.log

&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -fs_game etf -game et -vis -saveprt &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-vis.log

&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -fs_game etf -game et -light -fast -q3 -samples 2 -bounce 8 -dirty -patchshadows -shade -v &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-light.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Decompiling BSPs into map files ===

A good way to learn is to examine how specific map features are implemented in an existing map. With the q3map2 tool included with GtkRadiant, you can take a .pk3 archive with the map, extract it and decompile the contained BSP file into a .map file:

&lt;pre&gt;
q3map2.x86 -convert -format map -game et -fs_basepath /path/to/enemy-territory/etf /path/to/etf_map.bsp
&lt;/pre&gt;

The created etf_map_converted.map file is suitable for viewing with GtkRadiant or a text editor.

=== Particle system ===

ETF includes a particle engine for making light effects, sparks, etc. To add a source of particles to your map, create an entity like the one in the example below:

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;misc_particlesystem&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;8 0 80&quot;
    &quot;script&quot; &quot;spirit/maps/muon_blue_sparks.spirit&quot;
    &quot;dir&quot; &quot;90&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &quot;script&quot; attribute refers to a script file in one of the *.pk3 archives available to the game engine. To see examples, extract the *.spirit files contained in the pk3s shipped with ETF.

This &quot;jolly good&quot; dessert was originally created in an old London bakery. At one point in time it was very popular throughout all of England. It has now has spread throughout Europe and the Americas, especially the north-east region of North America (with Bostonians having developed a particular liking for it). The ingredients are simple, the time it takes to prepare is short, and the dessert is simply delicious!

== Ingredients ==
* 2 bananas, peeled and sliced
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* 1 refrigerated can of cinnamon rolls
* 1 cup caramel topping (similar to sundae toppings)
* 2-3 cups vanilla ice cream '''(optional)''' 

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
# In a small bowl, combine bananas, vanilla, and melted butter, until bananas are well coated. On a cookie sheet, unroll two cinnamon rolls, leaving the two triangles attached to form a square. Place 1/4 of banana mixture in the center of each pair of rolls.
# Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Heat the caramel topping and drizzle over dessert. Serve warm. It can also be served with a side dish of ice cream if one chooses.

== [[We ♥ Katamari]] ==

I do not know how to say this politely, so I ask as best I can, why are you working on this?  Wikibooks is not a site for game guides, this is a place for instructional books, educational works, annotated public domain books, things which can be used in a classroom.  Try as hard as I can, I can think of very few situations where what you are doing can be used to educate.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

::  Yes, you worked on it, but you did so on a thing that should not be on this site in the first place.  Further, your sub-pages were formated incorrectly, proper form is to use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[We ♥ Katamari/Cleaning]] or [[We ♥ Katamari:Cleaning]] not [[Cleaning (We ♥ Katamari)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:00, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some Ways to Keep a Meaningful Journal  ==
 
Anyone, at any moment, could walk up to you and tell you the meaning of life.  For everyone it may be different, but regardless of this fact, '''if''' the very next person you were to hold a conversation with were to divulge to you the secret meaning of the universe, chances are you probably wouldn’t understand it at the time.  Meaning is a product of contemplation, and contemplation is something of an aging process; things that start out as simply memorable mature into encounters that are truly meaningful.

A good journal is like a roadmap, a golden thread through the labyrinth of one’s own personal past.  A journal that is kept well and tended well will be fruitful, whereas one that is neglected and kept up out of a false sense of obligation, without any real thought put into it, will not yield any fruit to its writer.

In any Barnes &amp; Noble, Border’s, or even artsy boutique, blank books are a popular item for sale.  People like blank books, people buy blank books, but do people use blank books?  For me, getting to the very last page of any sort of notebook, no matter what it’s filled with, is a very special moment.  At that moment, I come to the realization that what’s in the front of the book is probably mature, so that I can read back over what I’ve written in the beginning and see how my attitude has changed.  A good journal will be rewarding in the writing process and also (especially!) during the re-reading process.  Remember, a journal is for '''you''', and no-one else but you!  So, there's no excuse not to be as honest as possible!

Keeping a journal can improve your happiness, according to academic research, although what you write is important. Negative events in your life may be best written about in analytical fashion, i.e. as an attempt to identify why events unfolded as they did (because writing analytically will increase awareness about external factors that caused the negative event, and thus suppress negative personal feelings). Positive events, on the other hand, might be better off when left unanalyzed, because analyzing could give the journaler awareness of external factors which contributed to the success).  It might be better instead for the writer to simply record the feelings of the moment and attempt to relive the positive events.

One of the most important things for a prospective journaler to remember is that the real value of a journal is the record being created; a proper journal can serve as a set of minutes to life, and so it comes down to the writer to decide what events are worth noting.  Even entries that seem incredibly mundane, filled with details that don't seem to change much from day to day can be interesting years later, and the real key can be establishing a habit of introspection and recollection at the end of each day.  That way, when something that is out of the ordinary and calls for real consideration occurs, the writer already has a set time and method to confront the issue.

=== Exercise ===

Now that everyone is good and inspired, here are a few tips to get started:  At the end of each day, pick one thing that sticks out in your mind.  This thing can be a situation, a person, a feeling, or any other kind of observation.  Pick something that is meaningful to you, and reflect honestly on it—half a page is a good starting length, but eventually you’ll come to have a certain sense of when an entry is completed.  At first this may seem difficult, but there are only 2 key points here- being perceptive, and being honest.

The writing part of keeping a journal is not a time-consuming ordeal-- IF the entry is something that you keep at the back of your mind throughout the whole day.  The cultivation of this attitude is one more beneficial side effect of keeping a journal.  Every day is at least a little bit different, and it is these differences, and moreover our '''reactions''' to these differences, that shape how we live life and experience the world.

== Keeping a diary ==

In order to keep a diary, you must set aside time each day to do so. An ideal time to do this is just before you go to bed. As well as adding the events of the day to your journal, the most important things you could write are your feelings and how events have made you feel.
This can be useful to look back upon, and honest, open diary entries can help you through difficult times.

Mainly working on:

[[Final Fantasy VI]] -&gt; Just about finished, needs media content and tables

[[Quest for Glory]] -&gt; Wide scope of project since there are 5 games in the series, overview and tips may be best.

[[Chrono Trigger]] -&gt; Best game ever, exhaustively researched and evaluated by now, largely want a clear and complete guide. All the info is there, but it could use some more media content and perhaps some more introduction/explanation. Importing the character pages might help too.</text>

Snowboards and Snowboarding gear can be tricky as there are hundreds of different types and technologies.  Of all the boardsports, including skateboarding and surfing, snowboarding probably has the most varied gear, with so much science into each model.

== Buying Gear ==

=== Board ===

The board you buy depends on your weight, height, and type of riding you plan to do.  For freestyle, especially rails, the board's length should come up to your chin or lower.  Pipe and freeride is often a little long, between the nose and chin.  An alpine board can come in many lengths, from the height of your nose to taller than you.  However, more important in choosing a board is your weight.  Each board is designed for a different weight range so check the statistics for recommended weight on different boards.

Also, it is important to check the flex of the board (usually you can find this out through salespersons or manufacturer's description of the board).  A beginner would want a flexier board.  The heavier your are, the stiffer you want it too be.  Also, pipe riders, freeriders, and alpine riders would want a stiffer board.  Rail riders should keep their board rather flexy.

The width of the board should match your boots, taking the angle positions and stance of your boots into account.  For freeride as little of the boot should stick over the board as possible, about 1cm max on the toeside (including the slant up that many boot manufactuers use.  Alpine boards want about nothing sticking out.  For freestyle, it is more lenient, but still try to maintain less than 1cm over the board.

=== Bindings ===

Strap Bindings are a little easier to choose than boards.  Just make sure that the ankle strap is comfy, it fits your boots, and that its stiffness is compatible with your riding style.  Carbon fiber reinforced bindings are generally for the advanced riders.  There are also many little features on the bindings such as toestraps (which go around toes instead of over them), adjustable toe ramps and heelcups, extra high highbacks, and so forth.  These are mostly preferences so ask the salesperson about them and see if it fits your riding.

=== Boots ===

Above all, boots should be comfortable.  That is the number one thing to worry about so try them out in the store like you would for any other shoe.  Also, boots, like everything snowboarding wise, have different stiffness.  Ask the salesperson about different models.  As usual, flexier gear is for beginners or rail riders.  For sizing, it is recommended that the boots fit with little extra room and should be a little tight.  One boot manufacturer known as ThirtyTwo has a liner that molds to your foot with body heat or using specially deisgned ovens as many retailers.  Therefore it is often recommended that you go from a half size to one whole size smaller on those boots, as the molding will give you extra room after a couple days boarding.</text>

Many, if not most, [[Read-only memory|ROM]] images of [[MSX]] games and [[BIOS]]es are
available on the internet. However, their legal status is doubtful (see
[[MAME]]) and somehow many have corrupt data. This is a guide on dumping
your own [[Read-only memory|ROM]] images.

If you would like to dump a cartridge which starts at boot time (like many
games) there is an extra difficulty. There is no software solution for
circumventing this. However, there are slot expanders (expands one slot
to four slots) which allow you to turn off cartridges during boot. If you
do not have such a thing, you can insert it after boot which can be
dangerous (blown up computers have been reported) or modify the hardware.

How the latter can be done depends on the cartridge. However, one type is
very well documented. It was common practice to disable the game in
[[Konami SCC]] cartridges as the sound chip could be used.

==Opening a Konami Cartridge==

Peel of the sticker at the bottom left and right. At both sides, you will find a square hole. Insert a screwdriver in one of the holes, and loosen the notch which is located at the bottom. Try to open the cartridge a
little such that the notch isn't working any more. Insert another screwdriver in the gap you have made. Follow the same procedure for the other hole and
force the cartridge open.

==Disabling Slot Select==

This method disables the entire cartridge, so any SCC sound chip that
is on-board won't work any more, but can be enabled again using the
switch we will add.

Cut the Slot Select line. It runs from pin 4 of the connector. If it is
an SCC cartridge, it runs to pin 10 of the SCC. Connect the Slot Select signal at the cartridge side +5V using an 3.3K - 10K resistor. Make a switch over the cut line.

==Disabling Chip Select on SCC cartridge== 

This method has the advantage that the [[Konami SCC|SCC]] can still
be used without having to switch on the cartridge; only the [[Read-only memory|ROM]]
is disabled.

The largest IC on the board is the [[Konami SCC|SCC]]. The long flat
thing is the D/A converter, which is really a resistor array. The smaller
IC is the [[Read-only memory|ROM]], which has the RC code printed on it.

Find the CS line from the SCC to the ROM. It's easy to locate
because there is a condensor connected to it. It runs from pin 8 on the
SCC to the ROM, pin number:

* pin 20 if it is a 1 megabit ROM (28 pins IC)
* pin 24 if it is a 2 megabit ROM (32 pins IC), [[Gradius|Nemesis 3]] and [[Space Manbow]]
* unknown if it is a 4 megabit ROM, [[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]

Cut the line between the condensor and the [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. Now, this is important
because it is often forgotten: connect the CS of the ROM with resistor
(3.3K - 10K) to the +5V. Make a switch over the cut line to be able to
re-enable the [[Read-only memory|ROM]].

==Saving the ROM image==

'''Roast potatoes''' (also known colloquially as 'roasties') are usually used as the prime starch accompaniment to a [[Cookbook:Roast Dinner|roast dinner]], which is usually made up of a roast meat and several different vegetables. Some people, however, prefer to make and eat them by themselves or with other pairings.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (vegetable, sunflower or olive), [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (goose or duck), or [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Safest procedure==
In a nutshell: [[Cookbook:Parboil|parboil]], shake, coat, roast.
#Pre-heat the oven to 220&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]] (425&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Fahrenheit|F]], [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|gas mark 7]]).
#Peel the potatoes and slice them into quarters or eighths depending on the size of the potato. Smaller pieces tend to make crispier roast potatoes, larger pieces tend to make softer ones.
#Put the potatoes in a saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt if you wish.
#Cover, and bring the saucepan to the boil and then allow to simmer for 10 minutes – one is parboiling the potatoes prior to roasting.
#Drain the potatoes, either removing with a slotted spoon or with a metal colander.
#Replace the lid and shake the potatoes vigorously for 20–30 seconds.
#Lightly coat potatoes with oil or fat, such as by hand tossing in a bowl, and place in tin.
#:A deep tin is safer than a shallow tin, as shallow tins tip easily, spilling any loose oil.
#Sprinkle salt over the top of the potatoes.
#Place in oven, roast for 20–50 minutes – tastes and ovens differ – or until the potatoes are golden brown.
#Remove them from the oven.
#:If there is any excess oil liquid (i.e., not clinging to the potatoes), it is '''''extremely dangerous,''''' because it is '''''hot oil''''' and one risks '''''severe burns''''' – safest is to let potatoes cool to 30–40° in oven before removing, or alternatively to carefully pull the tray partly out, and remove potatoes individually with tongs or a metal spoon.

Serve hot; they can be kept warm in the oven, but should not be piled up much, if at all.

==Crispier procedure==
Between parboiling and the roasting, one can [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep fry]] the potatoes in hot oil, which yields crispier potatoes – like crisps/French fries – but, depending on procedure, this is potentially '''''extremely dangerous,''''' as it involves handling hot oil, and risks '''''severe burns.'''''

You should be familiar with [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]] safety before attempting this, and in case of any cooking oil accidents, immediately call emergency services.

=== Deep fryer ===
[[File:Freidora.jpg|thumb|One may [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep fry]] the potatoes between parboiling and roasting to yield a crispier exterior, as with chips.]]
Safest is to use a deep fryer between the parboiling and the roasting: boil, drain and dry (potatoes must be dried to avoid splatter from boiling water), shake, briefly deep fry, then transfer potatoes to oven and roast.

In a nutshell: heat oil in deep fryer, parboil, shake, deep fry, roast.

=== Fry in tray ===
Alternatively, one can heat oil or fat in a tray in the oven, then add the boiled potatoes to the hot oil, but this is more dangerous.

In a nutshell: preheat oil, parboil, shake, [[Cookbook:Baste|baste]] (fry in pan), roast.

# Preheat oil in '''deep''' tray in oven – deep to prevent spills.
# ''(proceed as above)''
# Leaving the tray in the oven, and wearing an oven mitt, pull the rack out enough to access – '''''carefully,''''' as the tray will be full of '''''hot oil'''''
#:It is safest to stand behind the oven door, and only pull out the rack slightly, to avoid it falling or tipping, thus tipping a tray of hot oil on you, causing '''''severe burns'''''.
#:Transfer the potatoes individually into the tray with tongs, rotating to coat them in oil, or alternatively [[Cookbook:Baste|baste]] in oil with a metal spoon – they will sizzle.
#:Alternatively, one may tip the potatoes from the saucepan into the tin and then  potatoes in oil or fat, so evenly covered, but this risks splashing and spills.
#:One may also read suggestions to remove the tray from the oven, as in Delia (below), but this is '''''extraordinarily dangerous''''' – you should never handle a container of hot oil, as the danger of spills is too great.
# ''(continue as above)''

== Variations ==
* Garlic and herbs may be added to the fat.
*:Garlic should be crushed or minced.
*:Commonly used herbs, which may be used singly or together, include basil, marjoram, thyme, oregano, parsley, or dill weed.
* Animal fat (fat from accompanying roast meat, goose fat, duck fat, or lard) is generally averred to give superior potatoes, but is alas not suitable for vegetarians.

== Notes and tips ==
* Times &amp; quantities are rough and can vary to suit individual tastes.
* The roughing up of the surface of the potatoes is key to a crispy surface – this is the purpose of the shaking, and can alternatively or additionally be accomplished by scraping the surface of the potatoes with a fork. Compare with forking the top of the mash in [[Cookbook:Shepherd's Pie|shepherd's pie]].
* If initially deep-frying, the fat or oil must be hot before adding the potatoes – they should sizzle when added – else they will be greasy rather than fluffy and crisp.
* Some advocate flipping the potatoes half-way through roasting, while others assert that this is unnecessary. You may also wish to (''carefully!'') baste with oil partway through the roast, to ensure an even coating; again, some find this necessary, while others do not.
* Potatoes can also be cooked in the same oven and same roasting tin as the meat or other vegetables if being included as part of a roast dinner; they should go in half an hour before the meal is to be served.
*: Note that the roast and other dishes may require or benefit from different cooking than the potatoes – both different temperature and different time – and hence it may be easier to cook them separately, or at least to take these differences into account.
*: Using the fat from the roast requires a significant amount of fat on the roast and room in the tray – you will often find that cooking separately or with additional fat or oil is better.

== Warnings ==
*The oil in the roasting tin will be well over 100&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]]. Be extremely careful when handling the tin, and safest is to avoid any handling of the hot oil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Spelling ===

: The author of Unilingua, Agapoff, uses a double quote to signal capitalization and thus dispenses with all majuscules.  In this Mirad textbook, however, majuscules (upper case graphemes) are used and capitalization adheres to the American English model.

: In this book, the mostly Cyrillic single-grapheme characters used by Agapoff for yodified vowels are replaced with the following system:

: Pre-yodified vowels, that is, those preceded by a y-glide sound, take an acute accent:

&lt;table align=center border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;plain vowel&lt;th&gt;pre-yodified vowel
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;''' (''ya'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;''' (''ye'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;''' (''yi'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;''' (''yo'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;''' (''yu'')
&lt;/table&gt;

: Post-yodified vowels, that is, those followed by a y-glide sound, take a grave accent:

&lt;table align=center border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;plain vowel&lt;th&gt;post-yodified vowel
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;agrave;''' (''ay'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;egrave;''' (''ey'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;igrave;''' (''iy'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ograve;''' (''oy'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ugrave;''' (''uy'')
&lt;/table&gt;

: Circum-yodified vowels, that is those that are both preceded and followed by a y-glide sound, take a circumflex accent:

&lt;table align=center border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;plain vowel&lt;th&gt;circum-yodified vowel
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;acirc;''' (''yay'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ecirc;''' (''yey'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;icirc;''' (''yiy'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ocirc;''' (''yoy'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ucirc;''' (''yuy'')
&lt;/table&gt;
 
: A pre-yodified vowel always begins a new vowel syllabic nucleus, whereas a post-yodified vowel ends a vowel syllabic nucleus.

: Upper-case vowels take the yodifying accents just as the lower-case values do (thus '''&amp;Aacute;''', '''&amp;Egrave;''', '''&amp;Ocirc;''', etc.

=== Punctuation ===

: The punctuation marks in Mirad are the same as in English.  For example, a question mark (?) is used at the end of a sentence or sentence fragement to signal an interrogation.

=== Nouns ===

==== Structure ====

:All nouns in their base form end in a consonant.  This distinguishes them from adjectives and conjugated verbs, which end in a vowel.

==== Pluralization ====

: Nouns are made plural by adding the suffix '''-i'''.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;singular&lt;th&gt;plural
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''man''&lt;td&gt;'''tobi''' ''men''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dat''' ''friend''&lt;td&gt;'''dati''' ''friends''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''car''' ''instrument''&lt;td&gt;'''cari''' ''instruments''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Femininization ====

: Although nouns do not have inherent gender, the ''feminine'' or ''female-related'' counterpart of a noun can be formed by post-yodifying the ordinal (inner) vowel, that is, by adding the grave accent '''`''' to the vowel.  If the vowel is already pre-yodified (with an acute accent), then the the acute accent is replaced with a circumflex (^) (circum-yodification) to show that it is both pre-yodified and post-yodified.


&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;male-related&lt;th&gt;female-related
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tad''' ''father''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;agrave;d''' ''mother''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''man''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;ograve;b''' ''woman''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;v''' ''sock''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;acirc;v''' ''stocking''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''epet''' ''bull''&lt;td&gt;'''ep&amp;egrave;t''' ''cow''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Case Tagging ====

:Nouns can take the following case endings, which are shortcuts for prepositional phrases:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;case ending&lt;th&gt;category&lt;th&gt;base&lt;th&gt;cased form
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-a'''&lt;td&gt;genetive/possessive/relative/ablative [origin]&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''man''&lt;td&gt;'''toba''' ''of the man, human (adj.), man's, from the man''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-u'''&lt;td&gt;locative/dative [destination]&lt;td&gt;'''tam''' ''house''&lt;td&gt;'''tamu''' ''to the house, (at) home, for the house''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-&amp;agrave;'''&lt;td&gt;comitive [accompaniment]&lt;td&gt;'''at''' ''I, me''&lt;td&gt;'''at&amp;agrave;''' ''with me''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-&amp;egrave;'''&lt;td&gt;instrumental [means]&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;s''' ''work''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;s&amp;egrave;''' ''through / by / via work''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''-&amp;ograve;'''&lt;td&gt;privative [&quot;without&quot;]&lt;td&gt;'''tec''' ''meaning''&lt;td&gt;'''tec&amp;ograve;''' ''without meaning, senseless''
&lt;/table&gt;


:Examples of the ''genetive/possessive'' case:

::'''&lt;u&gt;Meira&lt;/u&gt; zem ce gra ama.''' = ''&lt;u&gt;The earth's&lt;/u&gt; core is very hot.''
::'''&lt;u&gt;Ata&lt;/u&gt; ted tome &amp;iacute;b&amp;agrave;.''' = ''&lt;u&gt;My&lt;/u&gt; father lives far away.''
::'''Ed et te dad &lt;u&gt;ifana&lt;/u&gt;?''' = ''Do you know the language &lt;u&gt;of love&lt;/u&gt;?''


:Examples of the ''locative/dative'' case:

::'''Pu &lt;u&gt;tamu&lt;/u&gt;!''' = ''Go &lt;u&gt;home&lt;/u&gt;!''
::'''&amp;Iacute;t pe&amp;eacute; &lt;u&gt;tamu&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''She is staying &lt;u&gt;at home / in the house / home&lt;/u&gt;.''
::'''At teaco et uda &lt;u&gt;moju&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''I'll see you this &lt;u&gt;evening&lt;/u&gt;.'' (= at this evening)
::'''Buu d&amp;eacute;n &lt;u&gt;atu&lt;/u&gt;!''' = ''Give the book &lt;u&gt;to me&lt;/u&gt;!''
::'''Ev ud ce &lt;u&gt;atu&lt;/u&gt;?''' = ''Is this &lt;u&gt;for me&lt;/u&gt;?''


:Examples of the ''comitive'' case:

::'''Upu &lt;u&gt;at&amp;agrave;&lt;/u&gt;!''' = ''Come &lt;u&gt;with me&lt;/u&gt;!''
::'''Ud ca ekpan &lt;u&gt;tija tuj&amp;agrave;&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''This was a &lt;u&gt;life-and-death&lt;/u&gt; struggle.''
::'''At ube&amp;eacute; uda &amp;eacute;bdren &lt;u&gt;ifan&amp;agrave;&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''I am sending you this letter &lt;u&gt;with love&lt;/u&gt;.''


:Examples of the ''instrumental'' case:

::'''Et vege nacikcer an&amp;agrave; &lt;u&gt;es&amp;egrave;&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''You can get rich only &lt;u&gt;through work&lt;/u&gt;.''
::'''It aksa &lt;u&gt;koen&amp;egrave;&lt;/u&gt; v&amp;aacute;n.''' = ''He succeded &lt;u&gt;by hiding&lt;/u&gt; the truth.''
::'''&amp;Aacute;gpar pa &lt;u&gt;Paris&amp;egrave;&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''The train went &lt;u&gt;through Paris&lt;/u&gt;.''


:Examples of the ''privative'' case:

::'''Et v&amp;ograve; vege akser &lt;u&gt;nac&amp;ograve;&lt;/u&gt;.''' = ''You cannot succeed &lt;u&gt;without money&lt;/u&gt;.''
::'''Tij &lt;u&gt;ifan&amp;ograve;&lt;/u&gt; v&amp;ograve; naze ser.''' = ''Life &lt;u&gt;without love&lt;/u&gt; is not worth living.''
::'''Od et su &lt;u&gt;at&amp;ograve;&lt;/u&gt;?''' = ''What would you do &lt;u&gt;without me&lt;/u&gt;.''

=== Pronouns ===

==== Forms ====

:All animate pronouns (those referring to people) end in '''t''' in their base form, while all inanimate pronouns (those referring to things) end in '''d''' in their base form.  Pronouns can be singular or plural.  All plural pronouns take the plural suffix '''i'''.

=== Correlatives ===

: By &quot;correlatives&quot; is meant a set of functional words in the languages than can be arranged in a matrix, all sharing a set of &quot;deictic&quot; or &quot;specifier&quot; prefixes.  For example, the English words &quot;which, what, where, why, when, how, who, whether, etc.&quot; can be considered part of a matrix of correlatives, because they all ask a question about topics such as &quot;place&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;manner&quot;, and are therefore called &quot;interrogative correlatives.&quot;  The situation is similar in Unilingua.  Note, however, that some of the correlative words in the chart below are slightly different from those invented by the original author of Unilingua.

==== Determiners of Quantity ====

::The noun following the determiner is in the singular if a mass noun ('''odganu dril''' ''how much ink'') or in the plural if a countable noun ('''odganu jubi''' ''how many years'').

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;quantity
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''odganu?*''' ''how much, how many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''udganu''' ''this much, this many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''idganu''' ''that much, that many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''adganu''' ''how much, how many, the amount/number that''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;dganu''' ''no, not any, no amount of''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;dganu''' ''all''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;dganu''' ''any, however much, however many''

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;dganu''' ''a certain amount of, some, some number of'
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ge, geganu''' ''as much, as many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''oge, ogeganu''' ''a different quanity of''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga''' ''more''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''go''' ''less, fewer''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gla''' ''a lot (of), much, many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gl&amp;agrave;''' ''a goodly amount (of), quite a few''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''glo''' ''little, too many''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gl&amp;ograve;''' ''barely, scarcely, hardly''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute;''' ''most''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gro''' ''too little, too few''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;oacute;''' ''as little/few as possible''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;eacute;''' ''a fair amount (of), enough, quite a lot (of)''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;ecirc;''' ''several''
&lt;/table&gt;

: * Literally: ''in what quantity'', as in '''Odganu nac et &amp;agrave;ce?''' ''How much money do you have?''.  Used substantively, '''Odganu''' becomes '''Odgan''', as in '''Odgan et &amp;agrave;ce?''' ''How much do you have?''  If followed by a mass noun, '''gla''' means ''much''; if followed by a counting noun, '''gla''' means ''many''; if followed by an adjective or adverb, it means ''very''.  All of the '''ga...ge...go''' words are multifunctional in this way.

==== Determiners of Frequency ====

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;frequency ('''jig''' = ''rate, frequency''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''odjigu?''' ''how often?''(lit: on how many occasions)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''udjigu''' ''this often''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''idjigu''' ''that often''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''adjigu''' ''as often as, the rate that''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;djigu''' ''never''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;djigu''' ''every time''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;djigu''' ''however often, anytime''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;djigu''' ''so often''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;djigu''' ''with some frequency, sometimes'
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gejigu''' ''as often''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ogejigu''' ''at a different rate''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gajigu''' ''more often''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gojigu''' ''less often''

==== Using prepositions ====

: Prepositions go between the two elements they link, just as in English.  Here are some examples:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Odju et po '''bu d&amp;eacute;ntam'''?(or: '''d&amp;eacute;ntamu''')&lt;td&gt;When are you going ''to the library''?
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Uda bun ce '''av et''' (or: '''etu''').&lt;td&gt;This gift is ''for you''.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dyen ca '''ab cem''' (or: '''cemu''').&lt;td&gt;The book was ''on the table''.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Upu '''bay at''' (or: '''at&amp;agrave;''').&lt;td&gt;Come ''with me''.

=== Personal pronouns and pronominal adjectives ===

: Personal pronouns have three ''persons'' (represented by the ordinal vowels '''a''' (1st), '''e''' (2nd), and '''i''' (3rd).

: The plural forms have the suffix '''i'''.

: There are also three ''case'' forms, which are alternate ways of expressing prepositional relations: Add '''-a''' for the genetive/possessive (''of'', ''from''); '''-u''' for the locative/dative (''to'', ''at'', 'for''); '''-&amp;agrave;''' (short for '''b&amp;agrave;''') for ''with''; '''&amp;egrave;''' (short for '''b&amp;egrave;''') for ''through/by'', and '''&amp;ograve;''' (short for '''b&amp;ograve;''') for ''without''. 

: Note: These are the same case endings that can be added to any nouns.  For example, '''tamu''' (to the house), '''ta&amp;eacute;b&amp;ograve;''' (without hair), '''teda''' (father's).

&lt;/table&gt;

=== Verbs ===

: Verbs in Mirad are conjugated for tense (present, past, future), mood (indicative, conditional/imperative/subjunctive/jussive), voice (active, passive), and finiteness.  The verbal system is perfectly regular and predictable.
: The ''infinitive'', which serves as the dictionary lookup form, always ends in '''-er'''.  The ''stem'', therefore, is the infinitive without the '''-er''' ending.  For example, the stem of the verb '''buner''' (to push) is '''bun'''.  The stem is used as the base of all conjugated verb forms.

==== Finite forms ====

: Finite verb forms are modulated for tense based on the three-way vowel distinction '''a''' (present), '''e''' (past), and '''o''' (future).  
: A fourth ending, '''u''' is used for the equivalent of the English conditionals, subjunctives, and imperatives.
: Verbs can be further modulated for progressive, anterior (perfect), and imminent senses through compounding.
: Endings do not change depending on the subject person.  For example, unlike in English where ''am'', ''are'', and ''is'' are used in the present depending on the subject, the Unilingua verb '''cer''' has one present indicative form of ''to be'' for all persons: '''ce'''.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;igrave;t ce'''&lt;td&gt;''she is''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''id ce'''&lt;td&gt;''that is, it is''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ud ce'''&lt;td&gt;''this is''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ot ce'''&lt;td&gt;''who is?''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ati ce'''&lt;td&gt;''we are''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''eti ce'''&lt;td&gt;''you (all) are''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''iti ce'''&lt;td&gt;''they are''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;ti ce'''&lt;td&gt;''they are''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''oti ce'''&lt;td&gt;''who are?''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;t ce'''&lt;td&gt;''everyone is''

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;d ce'''&lt;td&gt;''nothing is''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''apeti ce'''&lt;td&gt;''horses are''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== Simple tense forms =====

: The simple tense verb forms are generated by adding the tense markers '''a''', '''e''', '''o''', or the conditional marker '''u''' to the stem of the verb.  For example, the stem of the verb '''ter''' ''to know'' is '''t''' and the inflected forms of the simple tenses are as follows:

===== Active voice forms =====

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;''present''&lt;td&gt;'''It te.''' ''He knows.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;''past''&lt;td&gt;'''At ta.''' ''I knew.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''&lt;td&gt;''future''&lt;td&gt;'''Et to.''' ''You will know.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional''&lt;td&gt;'''Iti tu.''' ''They would know.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== Non-indicative forms =====

: The '''u''' ending is not only used for the conditional as above, but also non-indicatives moods such as the imperative and and subjunctive.  The conditional form without a subject is used for imperatives (direct commands).  Positive subjunctives and jussives are expressed with the use of the affirmative jussive conjunction '''av''' (for, so that, let) followed by the subject and the verb in the conditional.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''pattern'''&lt;th&gt;'''meaning'''&lt;th&gt;'''example'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''direct command''&lt;td&gt;'''Aku!''' (short for '''Av et aku!''') ''Win!.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''av N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''may N V''&lt;td&gt;'''Av ati aku!''' ''May we win!.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''av N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''let N V''&lt;td&gt;'''Av it upu.''' ''Let him come.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''av N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''wishes, etc.''&lt;td&gt;'''At v&amp;agrave;ge (av) et piu.''' ''I wish you would leave.''
&lt;/table&gt;

: Negative subjunctives and jussives are expressed with the use of the negative jussive conjunction '''ov''' (against, lest) followed by the subject and the verb in the conditional.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''pattern'''&lt;th&gt;'''meaning'''&lt;th&gt;'''example'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ov Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''direct command''&lt;td&gt;'''Ov oku!.''' ''Don't lose!''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ov N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''may N V''&lt;td&gt;'''Ov ati oku!''' ''May we NOT lose!.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ov N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''lest N V''&lt;td&gt;'''Ov it upu.''' ''Don't let him come.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ov N Vu'''&lt;td&gt;''wishes, etc.''&lt;td&gt;'''At vayge ov et piu.''' ''I wish you would NOT leave (lit: I wish lest you leave).''
&lt;/table&gt;

: Unreal conditionals are expressed with the conditional conjunction '''ev''' (if, whether) followed by the subject and the verb in the conditional ('''-u''') in both the main and subordinate clause..

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''pattern'''&lt;th&gt;'''meaning'''&lt;th&gt;'''example'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ev N Vu, N Vu...'''&lt;td&gt;'''if N were..., N would...'''&lt;td&gt;'''Ev at cu edeb, at &amp;iacute;vsu it.''' ''If I were king, I would free him.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== Illative patterns =====

====== Interrogative ======

: Beginning a sentence with the conditional conjunction '''ev''' (whether, if) makes the sentence into a yes/no question:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''pattern'''&lt;th&gt;'''meaning'''&lt;th&gt;'''example'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ev + VP'''&lt;td&gt;''Is it true that...?''&lt;td&gt;'''Ev et aka?''' ''Did you win?''
&lt;/table&gt;

====== Negative ======

: Use the negative adverb '''voy''' (not) in front a verb to negate it:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;pattern&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;ograve; + V'''&lt;td&gt;''negative''&lt;td&gt;'''Et v&amp;ograve; ako.''' ''You will not win.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ev + negVP'''&lt;td&gt;''negative interrogative''&lt;td&gt;'''Ev et v&amp;ograve; ake&amp;eacute;?''' ''Aren't you winning?''
&lt;/table&gt;

====== Affirmative ======

: Similary, the positive adverb '''vay''' (indeed) is used in various combinations to qualify verbs.  Like '''v&amp;ograve;'' (not), this adverb immediate preceeds the verb form.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;agrave; + V'''&lt;td&gt;''affirmative''&lt;td&gt;'''At v&amp;agrave; aka.''' ''I did win. / I won indeed.''
&lt;/table&gt;

====== Potential ======

: Used the potential adverb '''v&amp;egrave;''' (maybe) in front of a verb to qualify it as potential or possible (like English ''may''):

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;egrave; + V'''&lt;td&gt;''potential''&lt;td&gt;'''It v&amp;egrave; ako''' ''He may win!.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ev + VP'''&lt;td&gt;''negative potential interrogative''&lt;td&gt;'''Ev et v&amp;egrave; v&amp;ograve; aka&amp;uacute;?''' ''Might'nt you have won?''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== Passive voice forms =====

: The passive voice is formed by preceding the tense endings with '''w'''.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''w+e'''&lt;td&gt;''present''&lt;td&gt;'''It twe.''' ''He is known.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''w+a'''&lt;td&gt;''past''&lt;td&gt;'''It twa.''' ''He was known.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''w+o'''&lt;td&gt;''future''&lt;td&gt;'''It two.''' ''He will be known.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''w+u'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional''&lt;td&gt;'''It twu.''' ''He would be known.''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Progressive aspect forms ====

: The progressive or continuous tenses, which are optional and used only where the distinction is useful, are formed from the simple present forms by compounding with pre-yodified tense vowels.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present continuous active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ake&amp;eacute;.''' ''I am winning.'' (pronounced: ''a-KE-ye'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past continuous active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ake&amp;aacute;''' ''I was winning.'' (pronounced: ''a-KE-ya'')
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e+&amp;oacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''future continuous active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ake&amp;oacute;.''' ''I will be winning.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e+&amp;uacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional continuous active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ake&amp;uacute;.''' ''I would be winning.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''we+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present continuous passive''&lt;td&gt;'''At akwe&amp;eacute;.''' ''I am being beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''we+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past continuous passive''&lt;td&gt;'''At akwe&amp;aacute;''' ''I was being beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''we+&amp;oacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''future continuous passive''&lt;td&gt;'''At akwe&amp;oacute;.''' ''I will be in the process of being beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''we+&amp;uacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional continuous passive''&lt;td&gt;'''At akwe&amp;uacute;.''' ''I would be in the process of being beaten.''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Anterior tense forms ====

: The anterior or perfect tenses, which are also optional, are formed from the simple past tense form by compounding with pro-yodified tense vowels.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present perfect active''&lt;td&gt;'''At aka&amp;eacute;.''' ''I have won.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past perfect active''&lt;td&gt;'''Ati aka&amp;aacute;''' ''We had won.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a+&amp;oacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''future perfect active''&lt;td&gt;'''Ati aka&amp;oacute;.''' ''We will have won.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a+&amp;uacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional perfect active''&lt;td&gt;'''Ati aka&amp;uacute;.''' ''We would have won.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wa+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present perfect passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Iti akwa&amp;eacute;.''' ''They have been beaten.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wa+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past perfect passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Iti akwa&amp;aacute;.''' ''They had been beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wa+&amp;oacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''future perfect passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Iti akwa&amp;oacute;.''' ''They will have been beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wa+&amp;uacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''conditional perfect passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Iti akwa&amp;uacute;.''' ''They would have been beaten.''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Imminent aspect forms ====

: The so-called ''imminent'' tenses are formed from the simple future active tense forms in the same way.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present imminent active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ako&amp;eacute;.''' ''I am going to win.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past imminent active''&lt;td&gt;'''At ako&amp;aacute;''' ''I was about to win.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wo+&amp;eacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''present imminent passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Et akwo&amp;eacute;.''' ''You are going to be beaten.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wo+&amp;aacute;'''&lt;td&gt;''past imminent passive''&lt;td&gt;'''Et akwo&amp;aacute;.''' ''You were about to be beaten.''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Non-finite forms ====


&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ending&lt;th&gt;meaning&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''er'''&lt;td&gt;active infinitive&lt;td&gt;'''Et &amp;eacute;ge aker''' ''You must win.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wer'''&lt;td&gt;passive infinitive&lt;td&gt;'''Et v&amp;ograve; vagu akwer''' ''You would not want to be defeated.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''en'''&lt;td&gt;active verbal noun&lt;td&gt;'''Aken ce &amp;aacute;d.'''  ''Winning is everything.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wen'''&lt;td&gt;passive verbal noun&lt;td&gt;'''At v&amp;ograve; ife akwen.''' ''I do not like being beaten.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ea'''&lt;td&gt;active present participle&lt;td&gt;'''Akea ekut''' ''The winning player''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''aa'''&lt;td&gt;active past participle&lt;td&gt;'''Akaa ekut''' ''The player who won.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''oa'''&lt;td&gt;active future participle&lt;td&gt;'''Tob ce tujoa.''' ''Man is mortal (about to die).''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ua'''&lt;td&gt;active conditional participle&lt;td&gt;'''Tob cua deb.''' ''The man who would be king.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wea'''&lt;td&gt;passive present participle&lt;td&gt;'''Akwea ekut''' ''The player being beaten''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''waa'''&lt;td&gt;passive past participle&lt;td&gt;'''Magelwaa taol''' ''Cooked meat.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''woa'''&lt;td&gt;passive future participle&lt;td&gt;'''Teacwoa pancin''' ''the film to be seen''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''wua'''&lt;td&gt;passive conditional participle&lt;td&gt;'''Oteacwua tob''' ''the invisible man''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e&amp;agrave;'''&lt;td&gt;present affirmative gerundive&lt;td&gt;'''At teacibso pue&amp;agrave;.''' ''I will call upon arriving.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e&amp;ograve;'''&lt;td&gt;present negative gerundive&lt;td&gt;'''At ija te&amp;ograve; &amp;eacute;d.''' ''I started without knowing anything.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a&amp;agrave;'''&lt;td&gt;past affirmative gerundive&lt;td&gt;'''Teaca&amp;agrave; at pia.'''  ''Having seen, I left.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a&amp;ograve;'''&lt;td&gt;past negative gerundive&lt;td&gt;'''At pila dom teaca&amp;ograve; &amp;aacute;d.''' ''I left the town without having seen everything.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''en&amp;egrave;'''&lt;td&gt;present instrumental gerundive&lt;td&gt;'''Et akso gla &amp;eacute;sen&amp;egrave;.''' ''You will succeed by working hard.''
&lt;/table&gt;

** Note: The '''-ua/wua''' ending approximates the English ''-able'' ending.  '''oteacwua''' = ''invisible'', '''&amp;iacute;ztijua''' = ''survivable'', '''ogorwua''' = 'indivisible'', '''vegua''' = ''capable'', '''opanua''' = ''immobile''.  Adding an '''-n''' forms the substantive, eg. '''ogorwuan''' = ''indivisibility''.

==== Conditional constructions ====

: In sentences with conditional clauses the conditional clause is in the same tense as the main clause, contrary to the practice in English:

::* '''Ev mamilo at co uva.''' ''If it rains (= will rain), I will be sad.''
::* '''Ev mamila&amp;uacute; at ca&amp;uacute; uva.'''  ''If it had rained (= would have rained), I would have been sad.''
::* '''Ev at cu nasika at ga z&amp;iacute;pu.''' ''If I were (=would be) rich, I'd travel more.''
::* '''Ev et tu dud, (av et) du id atu.''' ''If you (= would) know the answer, (= that you would) tell it to me.''

==== Sequence of tenses ====

: Unlike in English, the tense of a consecutive clause is a real tense, not an adjusted tense relative to the main clause:

::* '''It da ad it ''tadco'' at.''' ''He said he would (= will) marry me.'' 
::* '''It da ad it ''teaca'' it ejipu.''' ''He said he had seen (= saw) it twice.''

==== Impersonal constructions ====

: Impersonal verbs are conjugated without the subject personal pronoun:

::*'''Mamile&amp;eacute;.'''&amp;nbsp;''It is raining.''
::*'''Amco.'''&amp;nbsp;''It will warm up.''
::*'''Eco dropek.'''&amp;nbsp;''There will be a war.''
::*'''&amp;Eacute;ge av et upu j&amp;aacute;.'''&amp;nbsp;''It is necessary that you come early.''
::*'''Ce fia.'''&amp;nbsp;''It's ok.''

==== The verb ''&quot;to be&quot;'' ====

: In Mirad, the verb '''cer''' (''to be'') is not suppressed in the present tense as in some languages like Russian or Agapoff's original version of Unilingua.  Also, there is no existential distinction as in Spanish between '''ser''' and '''estar'''. Furthermore, the progressive forms '''ce&amp;aacute;''' and '''ce&amp;eacute;''' can be used at times as in some of the examples below:

::* '''Ati ce &amp;iacute;va!'''  ''We are free.''
::* '''At co idmu.''' ''I'll be there.''
::* '''D&amp;eacute;ni ca ab cem.''' ''The books were on the table.''
::* '''Cayo e jubi ji at ca dopu.''' ''It will have been two days since I was in the army.''
::* '''Cer ey voy cer.'''  ''To be or not to be.''
::* '''At ca&amp;uacute; uva ev et v&amp;ograve; upa&amp;uacute;.''' ''I would have been sad if you hadn't 
come.''
::* '''Et ce&amp;eacute; gla fua.''' ''You are being very bad.''
::* '''At v&amp;ograve; ce&amp;aacute; ivcla.''' ''I was not being funny.''

==== Reflexive constructions ====

: Verbs can be made reflexive by adding the direct object '''get''' (self).

::* '''At v&amp;iacute;mila get ja per majtulu.''' ''I washed up (washed myself) before going to breakfast.''
::* '''Tobet tuja get.''' ''The boy killed himself.''
::* '''At teasa get cinz&amp;eacute;fu.''' ''I looked at myself in the mirror.''
::* '''Tu get!''' ''Know thyself!''

&lt;/table&gt;

: As you see in the examples above, modal verbs are followed by the infinitive form ('''-er''') of the main verb.

==== Subordinate clauses introduced by &lt;b&gt;ad&lt;/b&gt; ====

: The positive complementizer particle '''ad''' (''the fact that'') is used to introduce a subordinate clause:


::* '''At ta (ad) it upo.''' ''I knew THAT he would come.''
::* '''At ce vala (ad) et v&amp;aacute;de&amp;eacute;.''' ''I'm sure THAT you are telling the truth.''
::* '''Ad mamilo ce valan.''' ''THAT it will rain is a certainty.''
::* '''Ata t&amp;egrave;d da (ad) iyt co tamu ojo &amp;egrave;maj.''' ''My mother said THAT she would be home by noon.''

: As in English, if the ''that'' can be dropped without any loss of meaning, it can be:

::* '''At da at dro.''' ''I said I'd (= I'll) write.''
::* '''Et ta it sa id.''' ''You knew he had done (= did) it.''

: Unlike in English, a relative sequence of tenses is not applied. For example, English &quot;I knew he would come.&quot; is rendered in Unilingua as &quot;I knew he will come.&quot;

: Do not confuse the particles '''ad''' and '''av'''.  Clauses following '''ad''' are facts, whereas clauses following '''av''' are unreal wishes.  '''Av''' should be thought of as ''so that''. 

::*  '''At pana &lt;u&gt;av&lt;/u&gt; it &amp;aacute;btu.''' ''I moved &lt;u&gt;so that&lt;/u&gt; he could (= would) sit down.''
::*  '''At ta &lt;u&gt;ad&lt;/u&gt; it &amp;aacute;bto.''' ''I knew &lt;u&gt;that&lt;/u&gt; he would (= will) sit down.''

==== Subordinate clauses introduced by &lt;b&gt;ev&lt;/b&gt; ====

: The conditional complementizer particle '''ev''' (''whether'') is used to introduce a subordinate clause of the type &quot;whether...&quot;:

::* '''At v&amp;ograve; ta &lt;u&gt;ev&lt;/u&gt; it upo.''' ''I did not know &lt;u&gt;whether&lt;/u&gt; he would come.''
::* '''&lt;u&gt;Ev&lt;/u&gt; it upo ca tesk&amp;iacute;a atu.''' ''&lt;u&gt;whether&lt;/u&gt; he would or would come was not important to me.''

=== Adjectives ===

: Adjectives end in the suffix '''-a'''.  They are invariable in form:

:* '''aga''' ''big''
:* '''oga''' ''small''
:* '''aza''' ''strong''
:* '''oza''' ''weak''
:* '''taba''' ''bodily''
:* '''teaba''' ''ocular''
:* '''tea''' ''aware''
:* '''otea''' ''unaware''


: Adjectives used substantively to describe persons end in '''-t''', while those used to describe things end in '''-c''':


&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;adjective&lt;th&gt;animate substantive&lt;th&gt;inanimate substantive
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''yoga''' ''young / new''&lt;td&gt;'''yogat''' ''youth''&lt;td&gt;'''yogac''' ''novelty''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tuja''' ''dead''&lt;td&gt;'''tujat''' ''dead person''&lt;td&gt;'''tujac''' ''dead thing''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''fia''' ''good''&lt;td&gt;'''fiat''' ''good person''&lt;td&gt;'''fiac''' ''good thing''
&lt;/table&gt;


: Adjectives always preceed the noun they modify:


:* '''aga tam''' ''a big house''
:* '''yaga drun''' ''the long sentence''
:* '''aza tob''' ''the strong man''
:* '''mona maf''' ''a dark cloud''


: Serial adjectives usually go in the same order as in English:


:* '''ujna via jeeba jub''' ''the last beautiful summer day''


==== Degrees of Comparison in Adjectives and Adverbs ====


===== Summary of Comparison Constructions =====

: Note: '''v&amp;eacute;l''' is a preposition that comes from the verb '''v&amp;eacute;ler''' ''to relate'' and is used to signal the object against which a relative comparison is being made (''than, relative to'').

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''more...than''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ge...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''as...as''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''go...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''less...than''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute;...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''the most...in/of''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;eacute;...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''rather...compared to''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;oacute;...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''the least...in/of''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== The Comparative of Superiority =====

: ''More than'' is expressed by the adverb '''ga''', followed by the adjective, adverb, or verb and the preposition '''v&amp;eacute;l''' (in relation to, than, as) preceding the noun, pronoun, or predicate being compared:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ata tadet ce ga aza v&amp;eacute;l et.'''&lt;td&gt;''My brother is stronger than you.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At ga &amp;eacute;se v&amp;eacute;l et.'''&lt;td&gt;''I work more than you.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ita tedet ga aga v&amp;eacute;l ata.'''&lt;td&gt;''His son is taller than mine.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Uda d&amp;eacute;n ce ga ketlea v&amp;eacute;l idac.'''&lt;td&gt;''This book is more interesting that that one.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Mam ce ga aga v&amp;eacute;l et tese.'''&lt;td&gt;''The sky is bigger than you think.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== The Comparative of Equality =====

: ''As...as''' is expressed by the adverb '''ge''', following by the adjective, adverb, or verb and the preposition '''v&amp;eacute;l''' (in relation to, than, as) preceding the noun, pronoun, or predicate being compared.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;Igrave;t ge te v&amp;eacute;l at.'''&lt;td&gt;''She knows as much as I do.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At ge fi deuze v&amp;eacute;l et.'''&lt;td&gt;''I sing as well as you do.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ata tam ce ge aga v&amp;eacute;l eta.'''&lt;td&gt;''My house is as big as yours.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ece ge tobi v&amp;eacute;l tobomi.'''&lt;td&gt;''There are as many grownups as babies.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== The Comparative of Inferiority =====

: ''Less...than''' is expressed by the adverb '''go''', following by the adjective, adverb, or verb and the preposition '''v&amp;eacute;l''' (in relation to, than, as) preceding the noun, pronoun, or predicate being compared.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;Igrave;t go te v&amp;eacute;l at.'''&lt;td&gt;''She knows less than I do.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At go fi deuze v&amp;eacute;l et.'''&lt;td&gt;''I sing less well than you do.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ata tam ce go aga v&amp;eacute;l etac.'''&lt;td&gt;''My house is less big than yours.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ece go tobi v&amp;eacute;l tobomi.'''&lt;td&gt;''There are fewer grownups than babies.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== The Superlative of Superiority =====

: ''The most...of/in''' is expressed by the adverb '''gya''', followed by the adjective, adverb, or verb, and the compared noun or pronoun preceded by the preposition '''vyel'''.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Ud ce gya yobaga miam vyel mir.'''&lt;td&gt;''This is the deepest lake in the world.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At gya fi deuze.'''&lt;td&gt;''I sing the best.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Gya fia ticudi vyel ticudyan akbuyo.'''&lt;td&gt;''The best students in the class will be rewarded.''

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Uda ticud ce g&amp;oacute; tepaza v&amp;eacute;l &amp;aacute;da ticudi.'''&lt;td&gt;''This student is the least intelligent of all the students.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At g&amp;oacute; fi deuze.'''&lt;td&gt;''I sing the least well.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''G&amp;oacute; fia ticudi v&amp;eacute;l ticudyan u&amp;oacute;vfuso.'''&lt;td&gt;''The worst students in the class will be punished.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''At ce g&amp;oacute; ivat v&amp;eacute;l &amp;aacute;ti.'''&lt;td&gt;''I am the least happy person of all.''
&lt;/table&gt;

===== Idioms Using Adjectival/Adverbial Comparison Constructions =====

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mirad&lt;th&gt;English&lt;th&gt;example
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga...ga'''&lt;td&gt;''the more...the more''&lt;td&gt;'''Ga mamile ga ilirke.''' ''The more it rains, the more it floods.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga...go'''&lt;td&gt;''the more...the less''&lt;td&gt;'''Ga iva at ce ga az&amp;agrave; at dae.''' ''The happier I am the louder I speak.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''go...ga'''&lt;td&gt;''the less...the more''&lt;td&gt;'''Go et tile ga fia ce.''' ''The less you drink the better.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''go...go'''&lt;td&gt;''the less...the less''&lt;td&gt;'''Go et &amp;eacute;zbue go et &amp;oacute;zbie.''' ''The less you put in the less you get out.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute;...'''&lt;td&gt;''as much as possible...''&lt;td&gt;'''At tele g&amp;aacute; ida telamu.''' ''I eat as much as possible in that restaurant.''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute; ve&amp;aacute;...'''&lt;td&gt;''the most possible''&lt;td&gt;'''Puo g&amp;aacute; j&amp;aacute; ve&amp;aacute;.''' ''Arrive as early as possible.''

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;ograve;ga...v&amp;eacute;l'''&lt;td&gt;''no more...than''&lt;td&gt;'''At tila oga v&amp;eacute;l jub&amp;eacute;n&amp;agrave;.''' ''I drank no more than usual.''
&lt;/table&gt;


: Note: '''v&amp;eacute;l''', as a preposition, originates from a verb, much like the prepositions '''gal''' ''plus'' and '''gar''' ''times'':


&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;verb&lt;th&gt;preposition
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''galer''' ''to add''&lt;td&gt;'''gal''' ''plus''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''garer''' ''to multiply''&lt;td&gt;'''gar''' ''times''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''goler''' ''to subtract''&lt;td&gt;'''gol''' ''minus''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gorer''' ''to divide''&lt;td&gt;'''gor''' ''divided by''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;eacute;ler''' ''to relate''&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;eacute;l''' ''relative to, than''
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Adverbs ===

==== Formation ====

: Adverbs can be formed from adjectives by post-yodifying the adjectival ending, that is, by changing '''-a''' to '''-&amp;agrave;''', for example:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;adjective&lt;th&gt;adverb
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''fia''' ''good''&lt;td&gt;'''fi&amp;agrave;''' ''well''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ana''' ''single''&lt;td&gt;'''an&amp;agrave;''' ''only''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;iacute;a''' ''easy''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;iacute;&amp;agrave;''' ''easily''
&lt;/table&gt;

: The adverbial ending '''-&amp;agrave;''' is really the same as the comitive ending, meaning ''with''.  So, in effect, nouns in the comitive case are really adverbs.  The same holds true for the instrumental ending '''-&amp;egrave;''' ''by means of, through, by''.

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;noun&lt;th&gt;adverb
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;uacute;an''' ''difficulty''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;uacute;an&amp;agrave;''' ''with difficulty''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;gan''' ''length''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;gan&amp;egrave;''' ''lengthwise, by length''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bik''' ''care''&lt;td&gt;'''bik&amp;agrave;''' ''with care, carefully''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''at''' ''me''&lt;td&gt;'''at&amp;egrave;''' ''by me''
&lt;/table&gt;

: Similarly, a noun in the dative case ('''-u''') can amount to an adverbial expression. 

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;noun&lt;th&gt;adverb
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''uda job''' ''this day''&lt;td&gt;'''udjobu''' ''today''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''oda em''' ''which place''&lt;td&gt;'''od(e)mu''' ''where?''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tam''' ''house''&lt;td&gt;'''tamu''' ''(at) home''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mep''' ''way''&lt;td&gt;'''mepu''' ''en route''
&lt;/table&gt;

: Some words are inherently adverbs:

::* '''&amp;aacute;b''' ''up'' as in ''go up''
::* '''&amp;oacute;b''' ''down'' as in ''come down''
::* '''z&amp;agrave;''' ''ahead'' as in ''run ahead''
::* '''z&amp;ograve;''' ''back'' as ''come back''
::* '''&amp;uacute;z''' ''around'' as in ''spin around''
::* '''ga''' ''more'' as in ''eat more''
::* '''go''' ''less'' as in ''eat less''
::* '''ge''' ''same, as'' as in ''as big'' or ''do the same''
::* '''gla''' ''very'' as in ''very good''
::* '''glo''' ''not so'' as in ''not so bad''
::* '''v&amp;agrave;''' ''indeed'' as in ''He is indeed our leader.''
::* '''v&amp;ograve;''' ''not'' as in ''He is not our leader.''
::* '''v&amp;egrave;''' ''possibly'' as in ''It's possibly true.''

==== Comparison ====

: Adverbs are compared in the same way as adjectives:

&lt;table align=center border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;equalitive degree&lt;th&gt;comparitive degree&lt;th&gt;maximal degree
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ig&amp;agrave;''' ''quickly''&lt;td&gt;'''ge ig&amp;agrave; (v&amp;eacute;l)''' ''as quickly (as)&lt;td&gt;'''ga ig&amp;agrave;''' ''more quickly''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute; ig&amp;agrave;''' ''as quickly as possible''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ug&amp;agrave;''' ''slowly''&lt;td&gt;'''ge ug&amp;agrave; (v&amp;eacute;l)''' ''as slowly (as)&lt;td&gt;'''go ug&amp;agrave;''' ''less slowly''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute; ug&amp;agrave;''' ''as slowly as possible''
&lt;/table&gt;

==== Syntax ====

: Adverbs, like adjectively, normally precede the element in the sentence which they modify, however, this rule is a loose one and can be bent without peril in most cases.

::* '''&lt;u&gt;Ig&amp;agrave;&lt;/u&gt; upu!''' ''Come &lt;u&gt;quickly&lt;/u&gt;!'
::* '''At &lt;u&gt;an&amp;agrave; go&lt;/u&gt; te.''' ''I know &lt;u&gt;only a little&lt;/u&gt;.''
::* '''Uda tam &lt;u&gt;fi&amp;agrave;&lt;/u&gt; ceswa.''' ''This house was built well.''
::* '''Et v&amp;ograve; sa ge fu&amp;agrave;.''' ''You did not do as badly.''
::* '''Upu g&amp;aacute; ub&amp;agrave;.''' ''Come as closely as possible.''
::* '''At v&amp;ograve; te ev it pa &amp;aacute;b &amp;egrave; &amp;oacute;b.'''  ''I don't know whether he went up or down.''

==== Shortcuts ====

: Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in '''-ia''' or '''-ua''' can be shorted to '''-i''' and '''-u''', respectively:

::* '''Pu fi!'' ''Fare well!'
::* '''vi swa''' ''beautifully done''
::* '''&amp;eacute;su g&amp;uacute;!''' ''Work hard!''

      <comment>/* Vowel oppositions in 2nd group root words */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Taxonomic codification of letters ==

: The consonants of root words are taken from a conceptual ontology matrix.  For example, all root words beginning with the consonant '''t''' have something to do with ''human beings''.  Root words containing the consonant '''j''' relate somehow to ''time''.  

: For example, the following words all contain the consonant '''p''', which indicates ''motion'':

:: '''z&amp;iacute;p''' ''travel''
:: '''jap''' ''precedence''
:: '''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;p''' ''step''
:: '''z&amp;ograve;p''' ''regression''
:: '''p&amp;aacute;n''' ''jump''
:: '''teap''' ''visit''
:: '''mamp''' ''flight''

: Similarly, the following words all end in the consonant '''l''', which indicates ''liquid'':

:: '''mil''' ''water''
:: '''vafil''' ''wine''
:: '''mal''' ''gasoline''
:: '''meil''' ''mud''
:: '''vozil''' ''paint''
:: '''teabil''' ''tear''

: Again, the following words all end in the consonant '''m''', which indicates ''place, space, location, or position.'':

:: '''tom''' ''residence''
:: '''cem''' ''table''
:: '''d&amp;eacute;nam''' ''library''
:: '''tilam''' ''bar''
:: '''epem''' ''parking lot''
:: '''mem''' ''country''

=== Semantic codification of vowels ===
&lt;br /&gt;
: The vowels in root words have various qualitative and quantitative values based on the following scales:
&lt;br /&gt;
:
:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;Scale&lt;th&gt;'''o'''&lt;th&gt;'''a'''&lt;th&gt;'''e'''&lt;th&gt;'''i'''&lt;th&gt;'''u'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cardinal&lt;td&gt;''0''&lt;td&gt;''1''&lt;td&gt;''2''&lt;td&gt;''3''&lt;td&gt;''4''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ordinal/hierarchical&lt;td&gt;''zeroth''&lt;td&gt;''first''&lt;td&gt;''second''&lt;td&gt;''third''&lt;td&gt;fourth''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Qualitative&lt;td&gt;''negative 1''&lt;td&gt;''positive 1''&lt;td&gt;''neutral''&lt;td&gt;''positive 2''&lt;td&gt;''negative 2''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vectorial&lt;td&gt;''down''&lt;td&gt;''up''&lt;td&gt;''middle''&lt;td&gt;''left''&lt;td&gt;''right''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Natural&lt;td&gt;''underground''&lt;td&gt;''sky''&lt;td&gt;''land''&lt;td&gt;''water''&lt;td&gt;''space''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:
&lt;br /&gt;
: The opposite of a word can often be produced by simply changing a vowel to the &quot;opposing&quot; vowel. 
&lt;br /&gt; 
: 
::* The vowels &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are opposites in the &quot;series 1&quot;.
::* The vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are opposites in the &quot;series 2.&quot;
:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;positive&lt;th&gt;negative
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ab''' ''on''&lt;td&gt;'''ob''' ''off''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''man''' ''light''&lt;td&gt;'''mon''' ''shade''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''aga''' ''big''&lt;td&gt;'''oga''' ''little''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;n''' ''together''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;n''' ''apart''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''iga''' ''fast''&lt;td&gt;'''uga''' ''slow''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;ga''' ''hard''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;ga''' ''soft''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:
&lt;br /&gt;
: Throughout the Mirad word construction scheme, the vowel '''e''' always has a neutral or medial value:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;medial
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;b''' ''between''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;z''' ''inside''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''eza''' ''moderate''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ge''' ''equal''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''zem''' ''middle''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;eacute;''' ''rather''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ev''' ''if''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''je''' ''during''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''eb''' ''at''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ve''' ''maybe''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
: In hierarchical codification, the vowel '''o''' indicates the zeroth or toplevel element of an organization.  In a qualitative codification, it has a negative slant.  As a prefix, this vowel can also &quot;nullify&quot; a concept as in the following examples:
&lt;br /&gt;
:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;absolute&lt;th&gt;nullified
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tel''' ''food''&lt;td&gt;'''otel''' ''hunger''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gela''' ''same''&lt;td&gt;'''ogela''' ''different''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tadca''' ''married''&lt;td&gt;'''otadca''' ''unmarried''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''es''' ''function''&lt;td&gt;'''oes''' ''malfunction''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:

===  Hierarchical codification with ordinal vowels ===

: Root words related hierarchically or organizationally differ only in their ordinal vowels.  By ''ordinal vowels'' is meant that the vowels have inherent numerical values ('''o'''  0, '''a'''  1, '''e'''  2, etc.).  The zeroth element of any hierarchy always contains the ordinal vowel '''o'''.  For example, the words for royalty differ only by an enumerative vowel which determines the rank: 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;ordinal value&lt;th&gt;royal rank
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;'''adeb''' ''emperor''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;'''edeb''' ''king''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;td&gt;'''ideb''' ''prince''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;td&gt;'''udeb''' ''marquis''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;deb''' ''count''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;deb''' ''duke''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;deb''' ''lord''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: For further illustration, we can look at how the concept ''human being'' is hierarchically codified using ordinal vowels, where the larger the numeric value of the ordinal vowel, the lower the element is in the semantic hierarchy:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;human being
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''human''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tab''' ''body''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''teb''' ''head''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tib''' ''trunk''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tub''' ''arm''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;b''' ''leg''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Scalability With Contrasting Vowels ===
&lt;br /&gt;
:
: Words can be semantically constructed along the qualitative scale of &quot;postive&quot;, '&quot;neutral&quot;, and &quot;negative&quot; through the use of vowels imbued with these values.  In Mirad, there are two qualitative vowel series:
&lt;br /&gt;
:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;number&lt;th&gt;positive&lt;th&gt;neutral&lt;th&gt;negative
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;'''o'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;'''u'''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:
: As implied in the above table, root words with '''a''' contrast as semantically opposite with those with '''o''' and roots words with '''i''' contrast with those with '''u'''.  Words with '''e''' are in the middle between the two extremes.  The second series does sometimes lack a middle value. For example:
&lt;br /&gt;
:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;series&lt;th&gt;positive&lt;th&gt;neutral&lt;th&gt;negative
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;'''va''' ''yes''&lt;td&gt;'''ve''' ''maybe''&lt;td&gt;'''vo''' ''no''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;'''vay''' ''certainly''&lt;td&gt;'''vey''' ''possibly''&lt;td&gt;'''voy''' ''not''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;td&gt;'''aza''' ''strong''&lt;td&gt;'''eza''' ''moderate''&lt;td&gt;'''oza''' ''weak''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;'''zi''' ''right''&lt;td&gt;'''ze''' ''middle''&lt;td&gt;'''zu''' ''left''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;'''fia''' ''good''&lt;td&gt;'''fea''' ''neither good nor bad''&lt;td&gt;'''fua''' ''bad''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;td&gt;'''iga''' ''fast''&lt;td&gt;'''ega''' ''moderate''&lt;td&gt;'''uga''' ''slow''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Vectorial codification ===
&lt;br /&gt;
: On the vectorial (or: directional, geo-spatial) scale, the vowels have the following general values (see later for a more detailed explanation):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow align=center&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''positive'''&lt;th&gt;'''neutral'''&lt;th&gt;'''negative'''
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;''up/north/ahead''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td&gt;''down/south/back''
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td align=right&gt;''in/middle''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''
&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td&gt;''right/east/straight''&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;td&gt;''left/west/crooked''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: Some examples:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow align=center&gt;&lt;th&gt;'''positive'''&lt;th&gt;'''neutral'''&lt;th&gt;'''negative
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;b''' ''up''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;b''' ''between''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;b''' ''down''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ab''' ''on''&lt;td&gt;'''eb''' ''at''&lt;td&gt;'''ob''' ''off''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''zi''' ''right''&lt;td&gt;'''ze''' ''in the middle''&lt;td&gt;'''zu''' ''left''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;ber''' ''to raise''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;ber''' ''to contain''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;ber''' ''to lower''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: In the following examples, the vowels '''i/u''' and '''e''' take on ''directional'' values with respect to the doer of the action:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bier''' ''to take''&lt;td&gt;'''nier''' ''to consume''&lt;td&gt;'''dier''' ''to ask''&lt;td&gt;'''pier''' ''to leave''&lt;td&gt;'''iper''' ''to go away''&lt;td&gt;'''iber''' ''to receive''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''beer''' ''to keep''&lt;td&gt;'''neer''' ''to conserve''&lt;td&gt;'''der''' ''to say''&lt;td&gt;'''peer''' ''to stay''&lt;td&gt;'''eper''' ''to stop''&lt;td&gt;'''eber''' ''to stop''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''buer''' ''to give''&lt;td&gt;'''nuer''' ''to supply''&lt;td&gt;'''duer''' ''to suggest''&lt;td&gt;'''puer''' ''to arrive''&lt;td&gt;'''uper''' ''to come''&lt;td&gt;'''uber''' ''to send''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Natural (geological) codification ===
&lt;br /&gt;
: On the natural scale, the vowels have the following values:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;vowel&lt;th&gt;value&lt;th&gt;examples
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''a'''&lt;td&gt;''sky/air''&lt;td&gt;'''mampar''' ''aircraft'', '''map''' ''wind (current)''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e'''&lt;td&gt;''land/soil''&lt;td&gt;'''mempar''' ''car'', '''mep''' ''road''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''i'''&lt;td&gt;''sea/water''&lt;td&gt;'''mimpar''' ''ship'', '''mip''' ''river''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''o'''&lt;td&gt;''underground''&lt;td&gt;'''mompar''' ''subway'', '''mop''' ''tunnel''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''u'''&lt;td&gt;''outer space''&lt;td&gt;'''mumpar''' ''spaceship'', '''mup''' ''galaxy''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Semantic nuancing ===
&lt;br /&gt;
: Semantic nuances and gradations of quality of words are reflected through the &quot;lengthening&quot;, that is, addition of a harmonic subordinal vowel to the ordinal vowel, yodification (adding '''y''') of the ordinal vowel, or the addition of one in a series of intensifying ('''l''', '''r''') or distinguishing ('''c''', '''s''', '''v''', '''f''', etc.) consonants, or any of the above techniques in combination. In this scheme, pre-yodification signals a semantic intensification, while post-yodification indicates a weakening or mitigation of sense.  A doubling of the vowel usually indicates another kind of lessened strength of the corresponding single-vowel word.  Here are some examples:
&lt;br /&gt;
: Post-yodification deintensifies the semantic value of the base word in much the same way as the suffix ''-ish'' sometimes mitigates the value of an English adjective.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;deintensified
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ama''' ''hot''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;agrave;ma''' ''warm''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''oma''' ''cold''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;ograve;ma''' ''cool''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ima''' ''wet''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;igrave;ma''' ''humid''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''at vage''' ''I want''&lt;td&gt;'''at v&amp;agrave;ge''' ''I'd like''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''at &amp;eacute;ge''' ''I must''&lt;td&gt;'''at y&amp;egrave;ge''' ''I should''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''moza''' ''black''&lt;td&gt;'''m&amp;ograve;za''' ''blackish''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''e''' ''two''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;egrave;''' ''half''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''gla''' ''very''&lt;td&gt;'''gl&amp;agrave;''' ''somewhat''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mar''' ''sun''&lt;td&gt;'''m&amp;agrave;r''' ''star''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ifer''' ''to love''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;igrave;fer''' ''to like''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;ocirc;k''' ''ache''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tom''' ''residence''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;ograve;m''' ''home''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dom''' ''city''&lt;td&gt;'''d&amp;ograve;m''' ''town''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''din''' ''story''&lt;td&gt;'''d&amp;igrave;n''' ''tale''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pener''' ''to seize''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;egrave;ner''' ''to catch''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pon''' ''rest''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;ograve;n''' ''pause''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: Pre-yodification is sometimes used to intensify the semantic value of the base word:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;intensified
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''om''' ''cold''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;m''' ''ice''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''am''' ''heat''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;m''' ''fire''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga''' ''more''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute;''' ''most''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pener''' ''to seize''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;eacute;ner''' ''to strike''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pot''' ''animal''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;oacute;t''' ''wild animal''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vaa''' ''affirmative''&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;aacute;a''' ''true''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ab''' ''on''&lt;td&gt;'''yab''' ''above''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ze''' ''in the middle of''&lt;td&gt;'''z&amp;eacute;''' ''through''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ib''' ''away''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;b''' ''far''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bok''' ''illness''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''paner''' ''to move''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;aacute;ner''' ''to jump''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: The consonant extenders &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are sometimes used to intensify the semantic value of the base word.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;strong&lt;th&gt;stronger
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''&lt;td&gt;'''bl&amp;oacute;k''' ''agony''&lt;td&gt;'''br&amp;oacute;k''' ''torture''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vag''' ''desire''&lt;td&gt;'''vlag''' ''yearning''&lt;td&gt;'''vrag''' ''craving''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;ga''' ''necessary''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;gla''' ''urgent''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;gra''' ''critical''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;eacute;ner''' ''to hit''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;eacute;nler''' ''to beat''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;eacute;nrer''' ''to smash''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''f&amp;uacute;der''' ''to offend''&lt;td&gt;'''fl&amp;uacute;der''' ''to insult''&lt;td&gt;'''fr&amp;uacute;der''' ''to outrage''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dier''' ''to request''&lt;td&gt;'''diler''' ''to beg''&lt;td&gt;'''direr''' ''to demand''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: The ordinal vowel can be extended with a homorganic subordinal vowel in order to add an element of &quot;lengthening&quot; or some other nuance to the meaning of the base word:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;lengthened
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bok''' ''illness''&lt;td&gt;'''book''' ''fatigue''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vager''' ''to want''&lt;td&gt;'''vaager''' ''to desire''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dob''' ''state''&lt;td&gt;'''doob''' ''nation''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dab''' ''government''&lt;td&gt;'''daab''' ''administration''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''body''&lt;td&gt;'''toob''' ''gender''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''din''' ''story''&lt;td&gt;'''diin''' ''recitation''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;eacute;ler''' ''to retain''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;eacute;eler''' ''to conserve''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mil''' ''water''&lt;td&gt;'''miil''' ''dew''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: Here are some examples where all these techniques are employed:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;derived word&lt;th&gt;method of derivation
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bok''' ''illness''&lt;td&gt;normal
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;ograve;k''' ''ailment''&lt;td&gt;post-yodification (mitigation)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''book''' ''fatigue''&lt;td&gt;lengthening
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bo&amp;ograve;k''' ''lassitude''&lt;td&gt;post-yodification (mitigation)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''&lt;td&gt;pre-yodification (intensification)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;ocirc;k''' ''ache''&lt;td&gt;post-yodification (mitigation)
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;ok''' ''suffering''&lt;td&gt;lengthening

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;derived word&lt;th&gt;method of derivation
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vager''' ''to want''&lt;td&gt;normal
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vlager''' ''to yearn for''&lt;td&gt;L-intensification (1st order)

=== Mnemonic and analogic association ===


: Mnemonics is used to the fullest to associate root words and concepts. For example, the words &quot;neigh&quot;, &quot;hehaw&quot;, &quot;bark&quot;, and &quot;meow&quot; in Unilingua all contain a hint of the animal name with which these are associated.  For example:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;animal&lt;th&gt;sound verb
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;pet''' ''dog''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;peder''' ''to bark''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''apet''' ''horse''&lt;td&gt;'''apeder''' ''to neigh''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;pet''' ''pig''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;peder''' ''to squeal''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;pet''' ''cat''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;peder''' ''to meow''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''apat''' ''cock''&lt;td&gt;'''apader''' ''to crow''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pat''' ''bird''&lt;td&gt;'''pader''' ''to tweet''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ep&amp;egrave;t''' ''cow''&lt;td&gt;'''ep&amp;egrave;der''' ''to moo''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

: Two or more words are often joined into a single compound, producing a new concept, where the separate elements are suggestive of the meaning of the resulting compound.  In some cases, words overlap much like ''portmanteau'' words in English (''breakfast'' + ''lunch'' = ''brunch'').  (Note, for euphony, if the final consonant of the first root word is the same as the initial consonant of the second root word, one of the consonants is dropped.)

== Root words ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: Root words are divided into two groups:
&lt;br /&gt;
::* 1st group: nouns.
::* 2nd group: prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, and verbs, that is, all other words.

== Root words of the 1st group (nouns) ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: All noun root words are composed of three letters:
&lt;br /&gt;
::* The first, a consonant, called '''the classifier'''
::* The second, a vowel, called '''the ordinal'''
::* The third, a consonant, called '''the generic'''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Ordinal vowel codification of hierarchical nouns ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: Nouns that are related to one another in a hierarchy or organization can be codified using the ordinal feature of vowels. The '''o''' vowel (zero value) is used for the topmost element.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''job'''&lt;td&gt;time
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''jab'''&lt;td&gt;year
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''jeb'''&lt;td&gt;season
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''jib'''&lt;td&gt;month
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''jub'''&lt;td&gt;day
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''j&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;hour
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''j&amp;aacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;minute
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''j&amp;eacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;second
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob'''&lt;td&gt;human
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tab'''&lt;td&gt;body
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''teb'''&lt;td&gt;head
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tib'''&lt;td&gt;trunk
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tub'''&lt;td&gt;arm
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;leg
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mor'''&lt;td&gt;universe
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mar'''&lt;td&gt;sun
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mer'''&lt;td&gt;planet
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mir'''&lt;td&gt;earth
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mur'''&lt;td&gt;moon
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: Individual elements can be further subdivided into a ''secondary'' classification by the addition of an ordinal vowel to the right of the first vowel:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tub'''&lt;td&gt;arm
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tuab'''&lt;td&gt;shoulder
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tueb'''&lt;td&gt;upper arm
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tuib'''&lt;td&gt;elbow
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tuub'''&lt;td&gt;forearm
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;wrist
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;aacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;hand
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;eacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;fist
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;iacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;palm
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;finger
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;finger nail
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;leg
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;ab'''&lt;td&gt;hip
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;eb'''&lt;td&gt;thigh
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;ib'''&lt;td&gt;knee
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;ub'''&lt;td&gt;tibia
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;ankle
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;foot
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;eacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;talon
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;iacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;heel
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;toe
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;oacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;toe nail
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: A further, ''tertiary'' subdivision can be achieved by prefixing an ordinal vowel to the base:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;finger
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''atu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;thumb
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''etu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;index
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''itu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;middle finger
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''utu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;ring finger
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;tu&amp;uacute;b'''&lt;td&gt;little finger
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: A convenient classification is possible by prefixing an ordinal vowel to the base without any primary or secondary enumeration:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dob'''&lt;td&gt;state
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''adob'''&lt;td&gt;empire
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''edob'''&lt;td&gt;kingdom
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''idob'''&lt;td&gt;principality
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''udob'''&lt;td&gt;marquisate
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;dob'''&lt;td&gt;earldom
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;dob'''&lt;td&gt;barony
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;eacute;dob'''&lt;td&gt;duchy
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;dob'''&lt;td&gt;dominion
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;dob'''&lt;td&gt;tribe
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Forming concepts by compounding (&quot;portmanteau&quot;) ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: New concepts can be formed by compounding simple words.  If the generic (final) consonant of the first word matches the classifier (initial) consonant of the following word or his consonantally homorganic with it, the latter is suppressed for convenience and ease of pronunciation:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;concept 1&lt;th&gt;concept 2&lt;th&gt;compound
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dom''' ''city''&lt;td&gt;'''mep''' ''road''&lt;td&gt;'''domep''' ''boulevard''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pat''' ''bird''&lt;td&gt;'''tub''' ''arm''&lt;td&gt;'''patub''' ''wing''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''teb''' ''head''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''&lt;td&gt;'''teb&amp;oacute;k''' ''headache''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tep''' ''mind''&lt;td&gt;'''book''' ''fatigue''&lt;td&gt;'''tebook''' ''boredom''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: In cases where two ordinated nouns with the same classifier and generic consonants are combined, the vowels are combined:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;concept 1&lt;th&gt;concept 2&lt;th&gt;compound
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mil''' ''water''&lt;td&gt;'''mal''' ''gas''&lt;td&gt;'''mial''' ''vapor''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''mel''' ''soil''&lt;td&gt;'''mil''' ''water''&lt;td&gt;'''meil''' ''mud''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: When you wish to form a word composed of words of the same consonantal classification, and the ordinal vowel is '''o''', the '''o''' is replaced with the ordinal vowel of the determinant:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;concept 1&lt;th&gt;concept 2&lt;th&gt;compound
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''edob''' ''kingdom''&lt;td&gt;'''deb''' ''leader''&lt;td&gt;'''edeb''' ''king''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''udob''' ''principality''&lt;td&gt;'''deb''' ''leader''&lt;td&gt;'''udeb''' ''prince''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
: Two singleton words often join by replacing the generic (final) consonant of the first word with the generic consonant of the second word, producing a melded concept somewhat like portmanteau words in English (&quot;breakfast&quot; + &quot;lunch&quot;  &quot;brunch&quot;).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;concept 1&lt;th&gt;concept 2&lt;th&gt;compound
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''man''&lt;td&gt;'''nof''' ''cloth''&lt;td&gt;'''tof''' ''clothes''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;b''' ''foot''&lt;td&gt;'''nov''' ''tissue''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;v''' ''sock''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''teb''' ''head''&lt;td&gt;'''nof''' ''cloth''&lt;td&gt;'''tef''' ''hat''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tib''' ''trunk''&lt;td&gt;'''nof''' cloth)&lt;td&gt;'''tif''' ''vest''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;b''' ''leg''&lt;td&gt;'''nof''' ''cloth''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;f''' ''pants''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;oacute;b''' ''hand''&lt;td&gt;'''nof''' ''cloth''&lt;td&gt;'''tu&amp;oacute;f''' ''glove''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''teib''' ''nose''&lt;td&gt;'''nov''' ''tissue''&lt;td&gt;'''teiv''' ''handkerchief''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Making nouns and pronouns &quot;feminine&quot; ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: The &quot;feminine&quot; counterpart of a noun or pronoun is obtained by post-yodifying the ordinal vowel (i.e. adding a '''y''' glide):
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''masculine'''&lt;td&gt;'''feminine'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''taf''' ''suit''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;agrave;f''' ''dress/outfit''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;aacute;v''' ''sock''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;oacute;&amp;acirc;v''' ''stocking''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tef''' ''pants''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;egrave;f''' ''skirt''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''n&amp;eacute;f''' ''carrying case''&lt;td&gt;'''n&amp;ecirc;f''' ''purse''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''it''' ''he''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;igrave;t''' ''she''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tob''' ''man''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;ograve;b''' ''woman''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''apet''' ''horse''&lt;td&gt;'''ap&amp;egrave;t''' ''mare''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tad''' ''husband''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;egrave;d''' ''wife''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Codifying nuances of words ==
&lt;br /&gt;
: There are several ways of deriving related words with slightly different nuances from the original word:
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The '''l''' extender is used for a comparatively stronger sense, while the '''r''' extender is used for an even stronger (strongest) sense:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;absolute&lt;th&gt;comparative&lt;th&gt;excessive
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga''' ''more''&lt;td&gt;'''gla''' ''very much''&lt;td&gt;'''gra''' ''too much''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;zbaer''' ''squeeze''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;zbaler''' ''pinch''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;uacute;zbarer''' ''crush''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''buer''' ''give''&lt;td&gt;'''buler''' ''grant''&lt;td&gt;'''burer''' ''bestow''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ika''' ''full''&lt;td&gt;'''ikla''' ''packed''&lt;td&gt;'''ikra''' ''overflowing''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''aker''' ''win''&lt;td&gt;'''akler''' ''vanquish''&lt;td&gt;'''akrer''' ''triumph''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''dier''' ''ask''&lt;td&gt;'''diler''' ''beseech''&lt;td&gt;'''direr''' ''demand''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The post-yodifying '''y''' extender is used for what usually amounts to a ''diminutive'' connotation:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;mitigated
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vager''' ''want''&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;agrave;ger''' ''wish''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''fuf''' ''pipe''&lt;td&gt;'''f&amp;ugrave;f''' ''tube''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''nas''' ''price''&lt;td&gt;'''n&amp;agrave;s''' ''cost''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tep''' ''mind''&lt;td&gt;'''t&amp;egrave;p''' ''spirit''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''din''' ''story''&lt;td&gt;'''d&amp;igrave;n''' ''tale''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''cin''' ''image''&lt;td&gt;'''c&amp;igrave;n''' ''mark''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ciun''' ''sign''&lt;td&gt;'''ci&amp;ugrave;n''' ''signal''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''sen''' ''action''&lt;td&gt;'''s&amp;egrave;n''' ''act''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:: Pre-yodification of a root vowel often imparts an intensified sense to the word.  In any even, the normal and pre-yodified forms are usually related semantically.  Compare:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;th&gt;normal&lt;th&gt;intensified
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''bok''' ''malady''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;oacute;k''' ''pain''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pan''' ''motion''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;aacute;n''' ''jump''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''beer''' ''to remain''&lt;td&gt;'''b&amp;eacute;er''' ''to detain''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''aper''' ''to get on''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;aacute;per''' ''to get up''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''pet''' ''animal''&lt;td&gt;'''p&amp;eacute;t''' ''reptile''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''otata''' ''unholy''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;oacute;tata''' ''diabolical''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''vua''' ''ugly''&lt;td&gt;'''v&amp;uacute;a''' ''dirty''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''go''' ''less''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;oacute;''' ''least''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ga''' ''more''&lt;td&gt;'''g&amp;aacute;''' ''most''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ze''' ''in the middle''&lt;td&gt;'''z&amp;eacute;''' ''though''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''ijer''' ''to begin''&lt;td&gt;'''&amp;iacute;jer''' ''to open''
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Noun-forming derivational suffixes ==

=== Summary ===
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
=== Details ===
&lt;br /&gt;
==== The -er suffix ====
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The suffix '''er''' is used on noun bases to form a verb infinitive.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=yellow&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''noun'''&lt;td&gt;'''verb'''
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''tej''' ''life''&lt;td&gt;'''tejer''' ''to live''

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== The -cer and -ser suffixes ====
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The ending '''-cer''' ''be/become'' is used to create ''intransitive'' verbs from nouns and adjectives where the intransitive form contrasts significantly with the transitive form. If the adjective is a base, the '''-a''' ending is dropped unless 1) the resulting consonant combination would be difficult; or 2) the meaning is literal as opposed to metaphorical, in which case the dropped '''-a''' version is taken as metaphorical.  For example, '''aga''' ''big'' becomes either '''agacer''', meaning literally ''to become big'', or '''agcer''', meaning metaphorically ''to grow'', as in '''Vab agce ga ig&amp;agrave; adjobu mamile.''' ''The grass grows faster when it rains.''
&lt;br /&gt;
:: The ending '''-ser''' ''do/make/act/cause'' is employed to form ''transitive'' verbs.  In a few cases like '''teacer/teaser''', the opposition of '''-cer''' vs. '''-ser''' is semantic in nature.  In these cases, '''-ser''' imparts a more dynamic meaning.  In a few other cases, '''-ser''' is used to form the ''causative'' form of a verb, meaning ''to make/have/cause/let someone do something''.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border cellspacing=0&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''aga''' ''big''&lt;td&gt;'''agcer''' ''to grow''&lt;td&gt;'''agser''' ''to grow''

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
==== The -per and -per suffixes ====

&lt;br /&gt;

== Forming numbers ==
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Cardinal numeric adjectives ===
&lt;br /&gt;
:  The ''cardinal numeric adjectives'' 0-9 are formed from the ordinal vowels.  The tens are formed with the extension consonant '''l''', the hundreds with the consonant '''c''', the thousands with '''r''', the millions with '''ml''', and the billions with '''mr'''.
&lt;br /&gt;
: Numbers composed with '''aro''' (1,000), '''amlo''' (1,000,0000), and '''amro''' (1,000,000,000) retain the '''o''' and are spelled separately from the rest of the number with a space.

== Word Classifiers ==

: The following are common combinatory morphemes used to distinguish or classify entities.  Many of them are abbreviated forms.  If you were to produce a list of word rhyming with any of these morphemes, you would have a list of words that all fit within a similar taxonomic category.  For example, all Unilingua words ending in '''pyot''' refer to wild animals.  All those ending in '''il''' are liquids.

In biology, the osmosis effect can be demonstrated in a number of ways. In schools, there is a standard apparatus for demonstrating osmosis with visking tubing. However, osmosis can also be demonstrated using household ingredients, as described below.

== Demonstrating with eggs ==

An egg contains a semipermeable membrane underneath the shell, which can be used to demonstrate osmosis. The eggshell is mostly made of [calcium carbonate that will dissolve in acid. Vinegar or hydrochloric acid are suitable. Stronger acids will dissolve the shell faster, but are more corrosive. Vinegar takes several days.

===Method===
*Place three eggs in a beaker, cover them with acid and weigh them down so they don't float above the surface.
*Allow them to remain in the acid until the shells completely dissolve.
*Then place each of the eggs in a different liquid:
** Place one in water
** Place one in an isotonic sucrose solution, [about 0.3M]
** Place one in a 1M sucrose solution
*Leave overnight. 
*The next day remove the eggs and compare their size.

You will find that the egg in water will have swollen considerably. If you carefully pierce the membrane with a needle a jet of water will shoot into the air. The egg in an isotonic solution will be approximately the same size, while the egg in 1M solution will have shrunk.

== Demonstrating Osmosis with Potato Slices ==

There are a number of variations on this demonstration.
Potato slices can be used, as also can raw potato 'chips' (English) or 'French fries' (North American) Consistency of sample can be ensured by using a commercial potato chipper, or by using a cork borer of selected diameter.
Other vegetables or fruit may, of course, be used.
The changing dependent variable may be weight or length.

===Materials===
*Potatoes
*Knife, cork borer, commercial chipper
*Cutting board
*Dilutions of sugar (sucrose), suggested range 0 - 0.6M
*Suitable containers (beakers or test tubes or potato cylinders) to match selected dilution range
*Weighing balance / millimetre ruler
*Paper towel
*Marking pen/pencil
*Forceps

Solutions of sodium chloride can be used instead of sugar. Sucrose solutions ranging from 0 to 3.0M give a more convincing range of results.

===Method===
* Cut suitably sized slices or cylinders of potato. As far as is practical, all pieces should be the ''same length, width, and thickness'', the actual size depending on the chosen container (beaker or test tube).
* Mark each container, pour in the appropriate dilution of sucrose.
* Pat each piece of potato dry, and a) weigh it or b) measure its longest length. Note the measurement.
* When the piece has been measured, immerse it in one of your solutions.
* Leave the potato in the sugar solutions for at least half an hour.
* Use the forceps take out each chip in turn, carefully blot it dry without squeezing, and remeasure the piece.
* Plot a graph of either absolute change or percentage change in weight/length v molarity of the sugar dilution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most origami folds can be broken down into simpler steps.

== Basic skills ==
=== Valley fold ===
[[Image:Valley-fold.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Valley fold]]
A '''valley fold''' is the first basic fold, in which the paper is folded in front of itself. The valley fold — which most people do as &quot;just fold the paper in half&quot; — is really made of substeps.  These steps help fold the paper very precisely, which is important in complicated models.  Here is one way to make the valley fold very precisely:
# '''Pull the bottom edge up and forward.'''
# '''Loosely fold, ''without'' making a crease.'''
# '''Line up edges.'''
# '''Line up a corner''' (by lining up the edges on one side, and lining up the edges on the other side).
# Hold (a loosely folded, uncreased) paper down to '''prevent slipping'''.
# While holding the paper down so it does not slip, '''spread out a flat area''' on the paper.  This is often done by holding the paper down at two edges with your index fingers.  Also hold down the paper with one (or both) thumbs.  Gradually move your thumb(s) away from your finger(s), pushing your thumb into the paper, but pulling the paper taut between your thumb(s) and your fingers.
# '''Pinch a crease.'''  While holding the paper down so it does not slip, spread your thumb(s) far enough from the edge that they reach the intended crease line.
# '''Resolve the crease.''' Without letting up on the paper, continue the spreading motion until the crease is sharp. The crease should be exactly where you intended it to be, without any waviness in the edge, without any &quot;bubbles&quot; in the layers of paper, and without any slipping of the paper at the edge(s) or corner(s).

=== Mountain fold ===
[[Image:Mountain-fold.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Mountain fold]]
A '''mountain fold''' is much the same as a valley fold, except in one respect: it is in the opposite direction. This can present problems with the folding order, as valley folds are occasionally performed when there are other layers of paper underneath and the paper cannot merely be turned over. Therefore, to complete a mountain fold, these instructions must be followed:

Summary: fold the paper behind itself
# '''Lightly pinch''' the paper along where the crease will be.
# Pull the bottom of flap to be folded '''behind''' itself, but ''without trapping other layers of paper between them'' (this is only a problem if there are flaps behind the section to be folded, and can be avoided if the flaps are pulled apart a bit to open them and give you more space to fold)
# '''Line up the pinch marks''' with the edges of the paper. 
# While holding the paper down so it does not slip, '''spread out a flat area''' on the paper.  This is often done by holding the paper down at two edges with your index fingers.  Also hold down the paper with one (or both) thumbs.  Gradually move your thumb(s) away from your finger(s), pushing your thumb into the paper, but pulling the paper taut between your thumb(s) and your fingers.
# '''Pinch a crease.'''  While holding the paper down so it does not slip, spread your thumb(s) far enough from the edge that they reach the intended crease line.
# '''Resolve the crease.''' Without letting up on the paper, continue the spreading motion until the crease is sharp. The crease should be exactly where you intended it to be, without any waviness in the edge, without any &quot;bubbles&quot; in the layers of paper, and without any slipping of the paper at the edge(s) or corner(s).

== Simple compound folds ==
Simple compound folds require simultaneous valley and mountain folds but the creases can be made before the actual folding.
=== Inside reverse fold ===
[[Image:Inside-reverse-fold.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Inside reverse fold]]
An inside reverse fold consists of two radial mountain folds extending from a single point on a central fold, and a reversal of the central fold on the affected end, all done simultaneously. Here is one way to do the inside reverse fold:

#  Start with a flap.  Decide where you want to make the inside reverse fold.
# Valley fold the paper along the chosen line.  
# Unfold to step 2.
# Separate the two hidden layers of paper, so that you are half-way between step 1 and step 2. You will see the vee-shaped pair of creases formed in step 2.
# Push the tip of the paper into the gap you just made.
# One of the creases (of the vee) will already be in the correct direction (a valley fold as seen from inside; a mountain fold as seen from outside).  The other crease will be in the opposite direction.  Reverse the second crease, so that both creases are valley folds as seen from the inside, and [mountain fold]s as seen from the outside.
# Reverse the lower left edge, so that it is a mountain fold as seen from the inside, and a valley fold as seen from the outside.
# &quot;Pop&quot; all three creases into place.
# Close up the model again.
# The inside reverse fold is done.  (Notice how you reversed the folds to put the tip inside the model--thus the name.)

=== Outside reverse fold ===
[[Image:Outside-reverse-fold.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Outside reverse fold]]
An outside reverse fold consists of two radial valley folds extending from a single point on a central fold and a reversal of the center fold on the affected end, all done simultaneously.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

== Low-intermediate skills ==
Low-intermediate skills require simultaneous valley and mountain folds but not all the creases can be made before the actual folding.
=== Squash fold ===
[[Image:Origami squash fold.svg|right|thumb|400px|Squash fold applied to one flap of a waterbomb base]]
The '''squash fold''' starts with a flap with at least two layers.
# Make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap.
# Open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

=== Rabbit ear fold ===
A '''rabbit ear fold''' starts with a reference crease down a diagonal. Fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned.
[[Image:Rabbit-ear-fold.svg|center|thumb|200px|Rabbit ear fold]]
&lt;br/&gt;

=== Petal fold ===
A '''petal fold''' starts with two connected flaps, each of which has at least two layers. The two flaps are attached to each other along a reference crease. Make two radial folds from the open point, so that the open edges lie along the reference crease. Unfold these two radial folds. Make another fold across the top connecting the ends of the creases to create a triangle of creases. Unfold this fold as well. Fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases. A petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears, which are connected along the reference crease.

&lt;br/&gt;

== Mid-intermediate skills ==

=== Swivel fold ===
[[File:Origami swivel fold.svg|right|thumb|300px|The swivel fold made on a fold sheet.]]
The '''swivel fold''' is difficult to describe as the term is loosely defined and there are so many different versions that could be called &quot;swivel folds&quot;.  However, generally swivel folds consists of swivelling a flap of paper at a certain point or vertex in order that the raised edge of the flap will lie on the edge of the flap that doesn't move:
# You should start with a sheet that is already fold,
# Take the corner of an overflowed paper and make a fold that cut the corner in the middle; doing so, one edge of the corner will lie on the other edge of the corner,
# Make a radial fold which starts from the same point of the previous fold; you can choose the angle of this fold; it depends on the origami you want to make,
# Open the flap,
# Refold downward,
# Make the edge of the flap lying on the other edge.

=== Pentagon ===
Although most origami models start with a square or rectangular sheet of paper, a few start with a triangle, pentagon, hexagon, circle, or other convex sheet of paper.  A pentagon can be traced (from a template) onto a square sheet of paper, or it can be folded from a square sheet of paper.  One technique for folding a pentagon uses folds to calculate the golden ratio: (1+sqrt(5))/2.  [http://www.folds.net/tutorial/shapes/pentagon3/pentagon3_diagrams.html Another technique for folding a pentagon] uses folds to divide a 180 degree angle into five (almost exactly) equal angles.  The excess paper is often trimmed, before starting to fold the desired model.  Pentagons are used in five-sided flowers, such as the [http://www.folds.net/tutorial/models/cherry/cherry_p1a.html ''cherry blossom''] and [http://www.folds.net/tutorial/models/marie_rose/marie_rose_diagrams.html ''Marie's Rose''].

== High-intermediate skills ==

=== Spread squash ===
The '''spread squash''' can similarly be considered the sinked analog of the squash fold.  It is used to flatten a closed flap or twist fold (see below).  Instead of creating a long point to one side of the flap's base, the spread squash creates a wide splat around the flap's base.  The spread squash is used in the eyes of Engel's ''Octopus'', in [http://www.folds.net/tutorial/models/marie_rose/marie_rose_diagrams.html ''Marie's Rose''], and in some other intermediate and complex models.

=== Open sink ===
[[File:Origami open sink.svg|right|thumb|200px|An open sink on a waterbomb.]]
The '''open sink''' usually involves opening out the paper, and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model.
{{Clr}}

=== Open double sink ===
The '''open double sink''' is equivalent to making an open sink, and then open-sinking the point in the opposite direction. It is a sinked analog of the crimp fold. When made in a single step (after pre-creasing), it can be easier to make than a single open sink, because it does not require neatly reversing the point.  The open double sink is used in many box-pleated models.

=== Closed sink ===
The '''closed sink''' simultaneously makes a locking flap inside of a sink.  It is difficult because the paper cannot be opened out further than a triangle.  This technique is illustrated in [http://www.thekhans.me.uk/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=462 the Origami Forum's thread #462].  The closed sink appears in some high-intermediate and complex models.

=== Twist fold ===
[[Image:Origami twist fold.svg|right|thumb|300px|The twist fold with a pentagon.]]
The '''twist fold''' involves, as the name implies, twisting a section of the paper with respect to its original position. The section twisted will be a polygon; the numerous required support creases include pleat folds radiating from its corners. ''Marie's Rose'' demonstrates this on a pentagon.

It is also possible to twist a single conical point indefinitely, collapsing the sides in a waterbomb-base-like fashion as one goes. (If this is tried with a non-conical point, such as the waterbomb base itself, eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash.) This variant is used in many of Tomoko Fuse's modular boxes.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

== Complex skills ==

=== Unsink ===
The '''unsink''', or sometimes '''open unsink''', makes a concave pocket convex without fully unfolding the paper, or the opposite of an open sink. It is more difficult than the closed unsink below because there is no internal flap to grab onto to help unsink the paper, so the paper must be opened out and the area to be unsunk is pushed out (to be convex) from inside the model and from behind. It is a common fold in Lang's insects.

=== Closed unsink ===
The '''closed unsink''' inverts a closed sink without completely opening out the affected paper.  In theory, it is &quot;just&quot; the opposite of a closed sink.  In practice, it is very difficult, because the paper being &quot;popped&quot; into place usually must be pulled (not pushed), and because it involves simultaneously folding over a locking flap that is hidden inside the sink. However, it is easier to manipulate than an open unsink as there is an internal flap to pull to pop the unsink in place; in an open unsink there is nothing to hold. The closed unsink appears in some complex models, such as a few of Lang's insects.

This article contains information concerning the installation and calibration of [[satellite dish]]es.

== Overview ==

Signal comes from the satellite &amp; reflects on the reflector of the satellite. Then it goes to the sub-reflector &amp; the concentrated signal from the sub-reflector goes through the feed horn. The signal from there goes to the [[ODU]] through [[RF]] Cable (RF signal goes through RF cable). Usually [[Wave Guide]] or [[Coaxial]] cable (of 50 [[ohm]]s) is used here. The length of this cable is also very short (usually not more than 1 meter). The ODU manufacturer usually sets the type &amp; length of the cable.

After the antenna, ODU comes in place. What type ODU will be used is depending on the Modem manufacturer. According to the Modem’s Tx &amp; Rx signal we need to select ODU that fits it’s requirement. Tx &amp; Rx from ODU connects with Modem.

The signal from ODU goes to the Modem through [[IF]] Cable (IF signal goes through IF cable). Usually Coaxial cable (of 75 ohms) is used here. IF cable can carry signal up to 100 meters, after that we need to increase the strength by using a [[repeater]]. We can use longer IF cable than RF cable because Radio Frequency &gt;&gt; Intermediate Frequency. This is why; we setup ODU outside &amp; use shorter cable.


== Alignment of the Antenna with the Satellite for modem use==
 
To do this first we need to know the [[co-ordinate]] of the place where we are going to setup the VSAT antenna. We can know the [[Altitude]] &amp; [[Latitude]] with [[GPS]]. Now we need to decide which satellite we are going to use. After knowing the co-ordinates we need to go to the [[website]] of the satellite &amp; put the co-ordinates over there. Then it will show the [[angle]] &amp; the [[elevation]] of the antenna that we need to find the satellite. 


Now we need to go to the site and observe very carefully that the place where we are going to set the satellite has any obstacle or not. If it has an obstacle then we need to slightly adjust the place of the antenna. After checking every thing, we need to setup every thing in above-mentioned way. Then we need to align the Antenna with the satellite with the angle &amp; the elevation we get form the website of the satellite. 

After aligning the antenna with the satellite now we will tune it farther. To do this we will connect the [[Tx]] of ODU with a [[spectral analyzer]]. Then we will see all the frequencies that are working in the satellite. The satellite service provider will give us a frequency. We need to set the frequency at the center of spectral analyzer. Then they will send a pure carrier signal from the satellite. This plain carrier is known as Beacon Signal (the signal which is not modulated). The pick of this signal will be slightly shifted form the center, either right or left. Then we need to rotate the feed horn of the antenna very slowly to bring the pick of the signal at center of the spectral analyzer. This means that the antenna have been aligned properly.

Now we reconnect the modem &amp; configure it wit the same [[Tx]] &amp; [[Rx]] frequency. Then we send a signal &amp; if we receive it then it means our receiver &amp; transmitter is working properly. Then we change our receive frequency at the given frequency by the satellite service provider. Then we send a signal &amp; the satellite service provider will re-check it with a spectral analyzer. This process is known as Cross Pole. If they find the signal in the right place of the spectral analyzer it confirms that the link has been established properly.

==Personal Satellite dish ==

The theory for your satellite dish is similar. But a [[spectrum analyser]] or a [[microwave power meter| power meter]] are not a necessity. Such equipments can be expensive. 

1)First you need to know the position of the orbiting satellite what you want to target. eg. [[Hot Bird]] 13 [[degree (angle)|º]] [[west]].

2)Then you need to know your coordinates on the globe [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. For example in Cyprus, Nicosia 34 degree of latitude and 34 degree of longitude (approximative) .

3)Using these data , You can calculate (see link below) the angle of [[elevation]] of the dish, and its [[azimuth]] angle or degree of movement, left or right.  Results for the example:  an azimuth angle of 214 degree and an elevation of 44 degree .

4) Then as these measurement are all more or less accurate you need to tune around the position in order to get maximum power, or in case of a TV program , a good picture. Note that a lot of [[Set top box]] (STB) have a power meter function, it is just a display of the power on the TV set, which will help to obtain a good tuning .

Note: your [[Low-noise block converter]] (LNB) place on the antenna, needs to received 12 to 15 [[V]] of [[DC]] supply through the coax cable, otherwise no power can be transmitted.

This archive sounds like an excerpt from an installers manual which I guess is appropriate for the topoc but i'm not sure how relevant it will be as the technology changes or if it applies to all models of dishes.  Also the Overview section pretty much needs to be completely rewritten but I don't have enough knowledge to expand it properly.  
If someone with the technical background can proof and fill in any missing data, I'll be happy to come back an massage it for clarity.  Drop me a note on my user page if it is ready. --[[w:User:Stockwell|Stockwell]] 06:20, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

'''Agree'''--This article needs to be completely reworded to eliminate second-person directions. As it stands it could be a transcript of an installation help phone-in hotline.

'''Baharat''' is a spice mixture typically used in the countries surrounding the Arabian Gulf to flavour [[cookbook:mutton|mutton]] dishes and is said to be the most-used spice in the Arabic cuisine.

==Ingredients==
* 6 tbsp [[cookbook:sweet pepper|sweet pepper]] -- i.e., [[cookbook:allspice|allspice]] 
* 6 tbsp [[cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
* 3 tbsp [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 3 tbsp [[cookbook:coriander|coriander]]
* 2 tbsp [[cookbook:cumin|cumin]]
* 1 tbsp [[cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* 1 tbsp [[cookbook:clove|cloves]]
* ½ tbsp [[cookbook:cardamom|cardamom]]

Note: Here, &quot;sweet pepper&quot; is the literal translation of Arabic فلفل حلو ''filfil ḥulw'', referring to [[cookbook:allspice|allspice]].

==Procedure==
Finely grind the ingredients using a mill. Mix well. To intensify the taste fry the powder in butter before use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Seven card stud''' is one of the most popular forms of poker besides [[../Hold'em|Texas Hold'em]].  Until just a few years ago, it was the most popular form of poker on the U.S. East Coast; even today it is still second behind [[../Hold'em|hold'em]].  Like in all other forms of poker, players try to make the best five-card poker hand.

Up to eight players can play seven card stud at a time.  Seven card stud is almost always limit poker; that is, only fixed amounts can be bet.  There are five rounds of betting, and the amount that can be bet is usually one amount in the first two rounds and double that in the next three ($2-$4, $10-$20, etc.)

==How to Play==
At the beginning of a hand, everyone posts an '''ante''' to build a pot.  Antes can vary, but are often a quarter or a fifth of a small bet ($.50 in our hypothetical $2-$4 game).  All players are given three cards--two face down, and one face up.  The player with the lowest face-up card posts a '''bring-in bet''', usually about twice the size of the ante ($1 in this example).  Play then proceeds clockwise.  Players can elect to not put more money in the pot and fold their hands, call the $1 bring-in, or raise it to a full small bet.  If someone does raise it to $2, then all subsequent raises in the first round of betting are by the amount of the small bet--it can be raised to $4, then $6, and so on.

After all betting and raising is finished in the first round of betting, another face-up card is dealt to each remaining player.  Bets and raises are again done $2 at a time, unless someone has formed a pair with their two face-up cards.  Then, that player is allowed to bet a small bet or a big bet.  After this round of betting, there are two more rounds just like it, with another face-up card dealt to each remaining player, except bets and raises must be by the amount of the big bet.

On the last round of betting, each player is given one card face-down.  Betting is again done in increments of the big bet.  When all betting is done on this last round, each player's card is turned up, and whoever can form the best five-card poker hand with their cards wins the pot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computers are made by humans to make it easier to deal with information. Think of spreadsheets in accounting and word processors in writing lovely letters. While computers can easily store gigantic amounts of information and search and analyse it extremely fast it is difficult to represent such information in a human usable method.

Here the desktop metaphor enters. One should think of your monitor as your office desk. It has a telephone to call other people, paper stack with your correspondence, desk drawers with your files and a garbage can for your junk.

You interact with each of these objects on your desk with physical means. You pick up a piece of paper, call the number of the top, crumple it up and drop it in the garbage or file it in the file cabinet.

To interact with your computer you usually have a monitor a mouse and a keyboard.  This is very different from the real desk where you just use your hands to pick up a document, on a computer you can’t work in this way. Here you have to move the mouse so that the corresponding mouse cursor on your monitor is hovering above a little picture that represents your document. Now you need to push the buttons on the mouse without moving it’s screen cursor to interact with your document.

Desktop environments are the interfaces that make such interaction of your hands through a mouse/keyboard as logical and easy as possible and display the results of your actions on the screen in a manner so that you quickly and easily understand the consequences of your actions. 

KDE is a desktop environment that aims to be the best graphical interface between humans and the information they have stored in computer systems.  It aims to not only provide the framework but also the applications. The framework draws on the screen, accepts user input, the applications apply such input to modify the information, and passes the results back to the framework where they are displayed. However, it takes time for a computer to do this work. The time between user input and computer output is called &quot;latency&quot;. The longer this time, the less pleasing the experience is for the user.

A second oft-cited concern of users is that buttons with the same functions are located in various locations in the interface.  KDE attempts to limit this by providing standards for the makers of the applications so that consistent interfaces are presented to the user.

Consistency is nice, but consistent mysteries don’t help you! KDE tries to be clear in what the results will be of user actions. It does so by providing pictures on buttons (icons) that represent the results of activating such buttons. However, some people don’t quickly understand icons, so straightforward text is sometimes better. KDE allows both and gives users the option of customizing their interface to their information so that they can work as effectively as possible.

And that is the goal of KDE: giving humans an effective interface to work with their information on computers.
=Plasma Workspaces=
[[File:Plasma.png|left|thumb|The Plasma logo.]]
With the development of KDE 4, some major changes were made to the desktop. The first of these is Plasma Workspaces. Unlike KDE 3, the desktop is no longer synonymous with a folder. Instead, it has become an area for displaying small programs, &quot;plasmoids&quot;. (Plasmoids are sometimes referred to by the more generic term &quot;[[w:Desktop_widget|widgets]]&quot;.) Everything on the desktop is a plasmoid — trash can, launchers, task bar, etc. You can easily add pre-installed plasmoids to the desktop or task bar, or download and install new ones.
[[File:Kdebeta2 plasma.png|right|thumb|KDE 4 desktop, with plasmoids.]]

You can switch this setting back to the old desktop behavior.
#Right-click on the desktop, and select '''Desktop Settings'''.
#In the '''View''' section, under '''Layout''', select '''Folder View'''. Now, the desktop will display the contents of the ~/Desktop folder.

=Activities=
The second big change is Activities. KDE 3, like other desktop environments, allowed you to have multiple desktops. Some users found it convenient to have one set of programs open on one desktop, and a different set open on another desktop. KDE 4's Activities extends upon that compartmentalization even further. Instead of just having separate groups of programs, now you can have entirely different desktops...with different plasmoids, wallpaper, and icons. Additionally, each activity can have multiple desktops, used for grouping together open applications.

To enable different widgets for each activity:
#From the K Menu, click on '''Settings &gt; System Settings'''. 
#Under '''Workspace Appearance and Behavior''', click on '''Workspace Behavior'''.
#Go to the '''Desktops''' tab, in the '''Virtual Desktops''' section. Under '''Layout''', check the checkbox for '''Different widgets for each desktop'''. 
#Click '''Apply'''.

[[File:Activity manager.png|550px|center|The Activity Manager plasmoid.]]

The Activity Manager is a plasmoid that lets you create, start, and stop activities, as well as switch between open activities. You can click on the red X in the upper right to delete an activity, or click on the wrench in the lower right to configure the activity. To change an activity's icon, click on the wrench, and then click on the icon panel.

To switch between open activities using the keyboard, use '''[[w:Super_key_(keyboard_button)|Super]]-Tab''' to go to the next activity, or '''Super-Shift-Tab''' to go to the previous activity. The Activity Bar plasmoid is a panel that has a button for each open activity. You can switch to an activity by clicking on its button.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''poker tournament''' consists of a group of people playing poker until one player wins everyone's money.

To start, players buy into the tournament by paying the buy-in and any possible additional fees and then proceed to the tournament zone at the designated time.  Each player begins with a fixed amount of tournament chips, which represent the &quot;money&quot; to be gambled.  In a '''freezeout''' tournament, these chips represent all the money the player may gamble; once they run out, they are eliminated.  As players are eliminated, players are moved around and tables are broken to ensure that everyone is playing with roughly the same number of players.  For example, in a 100 player hold'em tournament, play would likely begin with ten tables; once ten players are eliminated, a table is taken out and its players are spread amongst the remaining tables.

To make sure players continue to be knocked out, the blinds and antes increase regularly thoughout the tournament.  For example, in a no-limit hold 'em tournament where everyone starts with $1,000 in chips, the blinds may start at $5-$10, then increase to $10-$20, $15-$30, $20-$40, $30-$60, and so on.  In major tournaments, the price of poker may increase only every 90 or 120 minutes, though in low buy-in tournaments 30 minutes is more common.  Play continues, with breaks if necessary, until only one player remains.

Most tournaments pay out about ten percent of its field.  The winner may recieve 30%, the runner-up 16%, third place 10%, and so on down the line, until the last player paid gets only a little more than the buy-in.

While freezeout tournaments are the most common, other formats exist.  '''Rebuy''' tournaments allow players to buy more chips early on in a tournament, if they meet certain criteria.  For example, a tournament may allow players to rebuy in the first two hours of a tournament as long as they have fewer chips than they started with.  Rebuys tournaments often also allow '''add-ons'''&amp;mdash;purchasing additional chips at the end of the rebuy period, no matter a player's chip count.

'''Shootout''' tournaments do not redistribute players or break up tables.  For example, if a hold 'em shootout begins with 100 players at ten tables, each table would play down to a winner, and each of these winners meet at a final table to play down to the ultimate winner.

Tournament buy-ins vary greatly.  Buy-ins may be as low as $0 (these are known as freerolls) or $1 on the Internet and as high as $25,000 in high-stakes casinos.  At the World Series of Poker, buy-ins range from $1,000 for the ladies only event to $10,000 for the world championship events and even $50,000 for the world championship [[H.O.R.S.E.]] event.  Any tournament with a buy-in of at least $1,000 is considered notable, and any with a buy-in of $5,000 is considered a major tournament.

{{HistoriographyMain}}

== Archaic Historians ==

=== Introduction ===

In this chapter we will concern ourselves with historical documents
where the personality of the writer is not a contributing factor to
the document, and is often not mentioned. This situation is typical
for the early great civilizations such as [[wikipedia:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and 
[[wikipedia::Ancient_Egypt|Ancient Egypt]], where
professional scribes acted as executors of the intentions of their
patrons, and not as contributors, partners or even as the leads in
the determination of the historical interest of the documents they
produced.  

=== Role of the Historian ===

Much of the historical writing we will consider in this section
is either biographical or serves the purpose of propaganda in some
form of another. The patrons of these texts intended for their actions,
their life, their deeds to be glorified and remembered by future
generations. 

A very large number of the texts that we know about from this area 
are monumental inscriptions. Here, the historian only had the 
task of drafting the text, which was then transferred to the representational 
material by the stone workers or painters. (Often, the inscriptions 
did not survive, we only have the copies of the inscriptions into more portable 
formats.) It is unfortunately unclear what an impact this writing process had 
on the textual content.

While it may seem weird for people to strive to produce massive
inscriptions that 99% of the population could not read, the
form of the message was still understood by all: The sponsor of 
the writing was wealthy and powerful enough to afford the 
expenditure of the monument. Of course, not all stone inscriptions 
were massive; see for example the [[wikipedia:Palermo_stone|Palermo Stone]] 
or the [[wikipedia:Narmer_Palette|Narmer Palette]].

The other main category of text types are those that employ writing
formats optimized for day to day usage such as the 
[[wikipedia:Cuneiform_script|cuneiform tablets]] of the Mesopotamian
civilizations. In [[wikipedia:Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egypt]], 
[[wikipedia:Papyrus|Papyrus]] was also in use to record historical 
texts and communication.

=== Social Status of the Historian ===

The (anonymous) writers of the texts we will consider in this section
belonged to the middle levels of the social strata. Their work
required extensive and expensive training and tied them closely into
the bureaucratic machinery of either the palace or the temple, the 
only social entities who could afford to pay for their upkeep. 

Since vassal states often did not have the economic infrastructure
to maintain the necessary scribal schools, the imperial courts would
loan scribes to their allies. These not only facilitated the bureaucratic
correspondence, but also were convenient ambassadors, spies and 
&quot;supervisors&quot; of the vassals, acting as constant reminders of the
superiority of the imperial culture. 

=== Categories of Texts ===

The main alternative textual form is the ''chronicle'' or the ''list'',
simply enumerating office holders, events or similar items of interest
for the stately or priestly bureaucracies. Such enumerations are 
usually composed without much of an attempt to form an overarching 
narrative.

Both of these categories of genre share the characteristic that they
recount very recent history. As a result, the professional scribes
who lent their skill to these productions did not have to perform any
historical research, that is, employ any historical techniques for 
discovering the ways in which the past was different from their present.

In this sense we can consider their historiographical work as being 
in its infancy. Of course, the availability of such historical records 
like chronicles and lists is an important prerequisite for developing 
such a skill.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Goods==

In economics, objects people want are called ''goods'' (tangible) or ''services'' (intangible). Goods exist or are created through value addition, and can be bought and sold at a price; this includes such things as foods, animals, computers, and jewelry. Even services, which are things people can either do or have done, are a type of good. A service might be vacuuming a room or driving someone to the airport.

Goods are usually classified into two groups. Some goods, such as food, and clothing, are things everyone needs. They are called ''necessities''. Other goods, such as jewelry and stereo systems, are ''luxuries'', meaning that while a person may want them very badly, he can live and function without them.

==Scarcity==

People have numerous wants and desires, but the resources to fulfill these wants and desires are limited. This gap between desires and resources creates scarcity. It is important to understand that goods and services are limited; there is only a finite amount of resources in the world. Of course, since there is a limited amount of goods, there may be a problem if people want more of a good than there is available. If there is less of a good than people want, it is scarce. Some goods are not scarce; if no more of a good would be consumed if it were free, it is an abundant or free good. This means that there is enough, or more than enough, of the good in question.

Scarcity is sometimes referred to as the fundamental fact of economics. There are not enough goods to fulfill all of the wants that people have. This has been true in the past, and it seems that it will remain true for the foreseeable future. Because of this dilemma, there has to be some way to partition goods among the people who want them. In some cultures, this problem is solved by a market pricing system, where the most serious customers are matched with the best suppliers, while in other countries it is determined by some other system, such as everyone getting an equal share regardless of needs, desires, or utility.

==Review Questions==

# Name 3 luxuries you own.
# Name 3 necessities you own.
# Is air a good, or not? Explain.
# Can something be a necessity for one person, but a luxury for another? Explain why or why not.
# What is more scarce, diamonds or wheat? How do you know?
# In what way are goods distributed in modern society?

==Suggest Answers==
# Diamonds, cars, departments, apple computers...etc.
# Food cans, pens for studies, online service for e-working...etc.
# Air is not a good. In the theory of economy, a &quot;Good&quot; is a product that contain expending &quot;Opportunity Cost&quot; in it's production, such as rent on the factory or/and salaries for the workers, which the producer could use these expenses on other production strategies. The production of air need not any opportunity cost, thus air could not be classified as a good.
# Yes, it is possible that something be a necessity for one person, but a luxury for another. For example, a blue-collar family may think that a sports car is luxury for them as they may live normally without purchasing this good; but for a sports-car player, it's necessary for him/her to practice his/her skill with a sports car.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

The current organisation is this:

== [[LearnElectronics:Forward]] ==

1. Aim of book

2. Prerequisites:

3. Materials

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter1]] The Basics ==

1.Basic Thoery

2.Open/Closed/Short Circuit

3.Circuit Diagrams

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter2]] Hands On experience ==

1.Understanding the Parts

2.Assembly and Math

---

Maybe it would be better organised like this (my comments follow the -):

== [[LearnElectronics:Forward]] ==

# Aim of book - hands on tutorial, could rename book to Hands on electronics? No AC electronics, all DC?
# Prerequisites - introductory high school mathematics.
# Materials - Chapter 1, battery and holder, wire, light bulb and holder; Chapter 2 onward, multimeter (cheap), resistors; and Chapter 3? onward, breadboard, etc.

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter1]] Circuits ==

# Materials - battery and holder, wire, 3 identical light bulb and holders (describe briefly what each of the items do (i.e., the battery stores energy, etc.).
# Building my first circuit - connecting the battery to the light bulb, show the circuit diagram.
# How does it work - use the fluid flow analogy to begin with (i.e., electricity behaves as if it's a fluid flowing through a pipe and the battery is a tank, etc.; a closed circuit).
# Open circuits - what happens to the flow when the pipe is disconnected (electrons don't easily flow through air).
# Short circuit - with little resistance to flow a large amount of fluid flows (i.e., a large current flows).
# Series and parallel connection - two bulbs in parallel in series with one more, describe why splitting the current through the two bulbs reduces their brightness (reintroduce the idea of resistance, narrowing of the tube)

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter2]] Resistors ==

# Materials - as Chapter 1, but add the multimeter (describe how to measure battery voltage) and high wattage resistors (or use some some nichrome wire?; show circuit symbol).
# Voltage drop - connect in series with light bulb and observe drop in brightness, measure with multimeter.
# Ohms law - describe how to measure resistance, then calculate current from voltage drop, do an experiment to check.
# A couple more experiments here...

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter3]] Capacitors == - no AC measurements?

# Materials
# Charging and Discharging
# More...

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter4]] Inductors == - no AC measurements?

# Materials... - make a spark too?

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter5]] Diodes ==

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter6]] Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) == - no AC measurements?

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter7]] Field effect transistors (FETs) == - no AC measurements?

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter8]] Operational Amplifiers == - really need to do AC measurements to do properly

== [[LearnElectronics:Chapter9]] Digital electronics == - that's a big one</text>

== I added some ==

I added some to yours. I'm very interested in this subject!

== section on injury added ==
I added a section on injuries and will expanded it to containing into warming/cooling down and stretching. I would also like to add something somewhere about motivation and also make changes in the nutrition section, please say if think this is ok -deven

: That would be a very welcome addition, I look forward to reading it. There's also a [[Nutrition]] book in development if you would like to go into more detail. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 22:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Economics deals with the fundamental questions of why people produce, what they produce, and how much they produce. While one economy may depend on rice, another may need wheat to sustain its economy. Since goods do not stay in the possession of one person but are constantly created and consumed, the system by which goods move is very important to all consumers. There are two extremes of economic systems: ''Planned Economies'' and ''Market Economies''. Although a topic in macroeconomics, a quick overview of these two terms is helpful in understanding the bigger picture behind microeconomics.

==Planned Economies==
A pure planned economy has one person or group who controls what is produced; all businesses work together to produce goods and services that are planned and distributed by the government. These economies are also called ''Command Economies'' because everyone must follow specific guidelines set up by the government. The reason behind such an economy is to make sure that everything needed is produced and that everyone's needs are fulfilled. The main drawback of planned economies is that those who plan the economy must know exactly what should be produced and in what quantities; otherwise, people will not be able to buy as much as they need and shortages will occur.

Planned economies have several advantages. Ideally, there is no unemployment, and needs never go unfulfilled; because the government knows how much food, medicine, and other goods is needed, it can produce enough for all. Realistically, however, these systems tend to suffer from large inefficiencies and are overall not as successful as other types of economic systems.

==Market Economies==
A pure market economy is one perfectly free of external control. Individuals are left up to themselves to decide what to produce, who to work for, and how to get the things they need. This type of economy, though it may be chaotic at times, allows people to change along with the shifting market conditions to maximize their profits.

Although avoiding many of the inadequacies of planned economies, market economies are not free of their own problems and downfalls. Perhaps the greatest problem is that business firms may refuse to produce goods that are unprofitable for them. For instance, in 2000 there was a shortage of tetanus vaccine in the United States; one of the two companies that had previously made it went bankrupt. Because it was expensive to make, other companies were unwilling to start production themselves, leaving only one firm struggling to keep up with demand. In a planned economy, this shortage would not happen because the government would boost production of the vaccine if it were needed.

Because there is no regulation ensuring equality and fairness, market economies are burdened with unemployment, and even those with jobs can never be certain that they will make enough to provide for all of their needs. Despite these and other problems, market economies come with many advantages, chief among which is speed. Because they do not need to wait for word from the government before changing their output, companies under market economies can quickly keep up with fluctuations in the economy, tending to be more efficient than regulated markets. Also, individuals have more freedom and opportunities to do the jobs they want and to profit by them.

==Mixed Economies==
Most modern economies do not strictly follow either system but, wanting the benefits from both systems, will instead have some combination of the two. Usually they have a mostly free market, with the government owning some businesses and providing some goods and services to the citizens. Some governments may ''subsidize'' industries, rather than actually own them. When a government subsidizes an industry, it provides benefits, such as tax breaks, so that the industry will remain profitable. Similarly, mixed governments may have government-owned hospitals and medical services for public use but allow other parts of the economy to run on their own to avoid inefficiency.

==Markets==
In any economy that is not completely planned, there are markets for some, or all, goods and services. These markets are where everything we study in microeconomics occurs. In a pure free-market economy, all goods and services may be bought and sold, whereas in some mixed economies, certain goods are regulated by the government. In either case, the way a good is bought and sold depends on how scarce it is, who supplies it, and what the consumer wants to do with it. In the next chapter, we will start to examine the way markets work. 

==Review==
# Identify one or more countries which demonstrate each of the three main economic types: planned, market, and mixed. 
# Why are most modern economies mixed?
# What type of goods would a country not want to have a market for? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century, it is often said by those selling singing techniques, books and methods that most people can learn how to sing. In fact, scientists have stated that the human larynx is typically very similar across all humans with only a difference in sizes. It is however a commonly held belief that singing is reserved for only a few which are born with the ability. Because of the difference in vocal fold sizes, some people are less capable of hitting higher and lower notes in chest voice (tenor can't hit much below low c, most untrained baritones can't go much above middle C). Knowing one's [[w:tessitura|tessitura]] is important, the song must be in a key suitable for you, otherwise you are likely to look quite the fool as you break and go into falsetto or head voice in inappropriate places. The human larynx is an instrument, in which all that is necessary in order to sing is to learn how to use it, and practice often. With a little bit of motivation and patience, it can be achieved.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: english → English, i.e  → i.e. using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Hebrew]]

==General==
* Avoid using transliteration.
* Don't bother trying to type Hebrew in the wiki edit box. You'll just end up with a big mess. Instead, type the Hebrew into a word processor with right-to-left support, such as MS word or OpenOffice, and then copy it.
* Avoid putting Hebrew and English on the same line. If you want to (like I did for vocabulary), write the English part first, then copy the Hebrew inside. It's a good idea not to let the far right or left character be a Hebrew character.
* To type Hebrew diacritic marks, turn caps lock on and press Shift + ~,0-9,-,+
* Diacritic marks are not easily seen unless you bump up the font size and/or change the Hebrew font.

==Hebrew Templates==
Use the Hebrew Templates to keep the diacritic marks in the right place, to make the text larger and easier to read and to make it easier to switch between left to right and right to left text.

Examples:&lt;br&gt;
Enter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hebrew| אֳ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to create {{Hebrew| אֳ }} or &lt;br&gt;
Enter &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Hebrew-Large| אֳ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to create {{Hebrew-Large| אֳ }} 

==Instructions for Typing in Hebrew with Diacritic Marks Using Windows==
# Make sure the Hebrew language is installed. Use the Windows installation disc to do so.
# Once Hebrew is installed, go to '''Start''' -&gt; '''Control Panel''' -&gt; '''Regional and Language Options'''.
# Go to the '''Languages''' tab, and in the ''Text services and input languages box'', click the '''Details''' button.
# In the new window, under the '''Settings''' tab, find the button in the ''Installed services'' area that says '''Add'''.
# Under '''Input Language''', find '''Hebrew'''. The box below it will also change to Hebrew. Click '''OK'''.
# In the '''Preferences''' area, click '''Language Bar''' and make sure the first and third checkboxes are selected.
# Congratulations, you are now able to type in Hebrew!
# To type vowels, make sure '''Caps Lock''' is on, move the cursor past the letter you want to apply the vowel to, then hold down '''Shift''' and type using the numbers row above the letters section of the keyboard (i.e. type '''%''','''&amp;''', etc. with 'Caps Lock' on).

==Overview:==
'''''Magic: The Gathering''''' (colloquially &quot;'''''Magic'''''&quot; or &quot;'''''MTG'''''&quot;), is a collectible card game created by Richard Garfield, Ph.D. and introduced by Wizards of the Coast in 1993. Magic inspired an entirely new game genre, and continues to endure with an estimated six million players in over seventy countries worldwide and on the Internet. This book attempts to be both an introduction to the game and a manual of reference, and should serve as easy to approach from whatever experience level the reader has with the game.

      <comment>/* Ignition process */ removed the &quot;degrees&quot; before Kelvin symbol for better accuracy</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A spark plug initiates combustion in an internal combustion engine.  A plug sits right inside the combustion chamber and can be removed for inspection.  An examination, or &quot;reading&quot; of the characteristic markings on the firing end of the spark plug can indicate conditions within the running engine. A spark plug's firing end will be affected by the internal environment and will bear the marks as evidence of what is happening inside the engine while running.  Usually there is no other way to know what is going on inside an engine running at peak power. The information obtained is especially important in high performance engines to refine the adjustment of all the systems.

The reading of spark plugs for a racing engine is a precision technique distinct from the more generic reading of spark plugs from general purpose engines, as the published information is intended for commercial mechanics to diagnose engine damage.  

A racing engine is tuned whilst in prime condition. These engines require fine adjustment to much tighter tolerances. The most relevant spark plug parts for reading are at the tip, the center and side electrodes as well as part of the insulator. 

When a spark plug fires, it ignites the fuel-air mixture, creating a fireball inside the combustion chamber.  The size of this fireball or 'kernel' depends on the exact composition of the mixture between the electrodes and the level of combustion chamber turbulence at the time of the spark. A small kernel will make the engine run as though the ignition timing was retarded. A large kernel appears like the timing was advanced for that individual cycle. The combustion process produces characteristic marks on the spark plug. It is these marks that you can analyze.

==Spark plug construction==
[[File:Spark Plug Construction.jpg]]

*Ribs: The ribs prevent electrical energy from leaking from the terminal to the metal case along the side of the insulator. The longer the current has to travel because of the ripples the higher the resistance thereby assisting with isolation. 
 
*Insulator: Made from Aluminum Oxide ceramic. Designed to withstand 1,200 deg. F. and 60,000 volts. The exact composition and length of the insulator, extending from the metal case into the combustion chamber partly determines the heat range of the plug. 

*Metal Case: Bears the torque of tightening the plug. Removes heat from the insulator and passes it on to the engine head. It acts as the ground for the sparks passing through the center electrode to the side electrode. 

*Center Electrode: Can be made of copper, nickel-iron or precious metals. The center electrode is designed to eject electrons because it is the hottest (normally) part of the plug. The electrons 'boil off' from the hot electrode. A further improvement would be to use a pointed electrode but a pointed electrode would melt after only a few seconds. The development of precious metal high temperature electrodes allows the use of a much smaller center electrodes that are smaller in diameter-closer to a point, but they do not melt or corrode away. A smaller electrode also absorbs less heat from the spark and initial flame energy. 

*Side Electrode: The side electrode is made from high nickel steel and is welded to the side of the metal case. The side electrode also runs very hot, especially on projected nose plugs.

==Ignition process==
As the electrons are pushed in from the coil, a voltage difference appears between the center electrode and side electrode. No current can flow because the fuel and air in the gap is an insulator, but as the voltage rises further, it begins to change the structure of the gases between the electrodes.

Once there is a small channel of gas which is affected this way, it is said to be &quot;ionized&quot;. An ionized gas becomes a conductor and can pass electrons.

As the current of electrons surges across the gap, it raises the temperature of the spark channel to 60,000 K. The intense heat in the spark channel causes the ionized gas to expand very quickly, like a small explosion. This is the &quot;click&quot; you hear when watching a spark.

The heat and pressure force the gases to react with each other and at the end of the spark event there should be a small ball of fire in the plug gap as the gasses burn on their own. The size of this fireball or kernel depends on the exact composition of the fuel-air mixture between the electrodes at the time of the spark. A small kernel will make the engine run as though the ignition timing was retarded and a large one like the timing was advanced for that individual cycle.

==Reading spark plug conditions for racing engines==
Spark plug reading flashlight/magnifiers aid in reading spark plugs. 

[[Image:2spark plug viewers.jpg|thumb|right|Two spark plug viewers]]

===Accurate Reading Conditions===
The most accurate plug readings are obtained after an engine is well tuned with new plugs and after shutting the engine at the end of a strong full throttle run. Having the engine shut down quickly and cleanly avoids creating misleading information and provides evidence from  full power conditions.  Idle conditions may be relevant for non-racing readings and general engine diagnosis.

===Gap Type===
Racers are concerned with only two gap styles illustrated in ''figure 2''.
#Projected Nose 
#Conventional gap
Most racing engines use projected nose, fine wire plugs, but some engines need the conventional gap fine wire plugs because of clearance problems or difficulty in cooling the plug.
Surface gap, retracted gap, etc., plugs are not suitable for high performance use.

==Engine conditions and impact on spark plugs==

===Heat range===
With respect to heat range, manufactured racing engines already have most of the selection done. The stock plug is usually within two heat ranges of ideal. The only change that might be needed to use the fine wire version of the same plug (usually 1 or 2 steps hotter). For heavily modified standard engines the choice is less clear. A plug 2 to 3 ranges colder than stock and of the fine wire type would be a good starting point. Complete the ignition timing and fuel system adjustments first and then select the final heat range for the spark plug.

''Figure 1'' illustrates hot versus cold spark plugs.  Spark plugs are capable of running anywhere from cold to hot in a given engine, depending on plug design. Use the hottest plug that won't over heat itself under the worst conditions.

A hot plug does not make an engine run hot, nor a cold plug make an engine run cold. A hot plug merely means that the insulator nose will run hotter and keep itself clean by burning off deposits.
Needs clarification, per NGK..... http://www.ngksparkplugs.com/techinfo/spark_plugs/installation.asp?nav=31300&amp;country=US#heat

A plug which is too cold collects carbon and fuel deposits on its insulator, which leaks energy from the ignition, causing loss of power, if allowed to continue it will foul (not spark at all).

The length of the insulator determines the heat range of a plug. Use the hottest plug that doesn't burn the tip of the center electrode.

If your plug is too cold, you will see deposits on the nose of your plug. ''Figure 6'' illustrates this.  If your plug is too hot, the porcelain will be porous looking, almost like sugar. The material which seals the center electrode to the insulator will boil out.

Note: A lower number usually means  a colder spark plug but not all the time. Ex: NGK uses high numbers for cold spark plugs as Bosch uses a lower number for colder spark plugs.

===Voltage loss===
As the voltage builds up in the plug, it may leak to ground through any deposits, which are on the insulator nose, robbing the spark gap of its energy.  This is what happens when you foul a plug.  Any conductive deposits on the insulator nose will, (even if the engine doesn't misfire) cause a reduction of energy in the spark leading to small,erratic kernels, slightly reducing power.

===Ignition timing===
Ignition timing can be seen on the center electrode tip.  If the timing is too advanced by 2 to 4 degrees, the tip of the electrode will be scorched clean for about one millimeter from the tip.  The center electrode will have its edges rounded from heat. The material which seals the center electrode to the insulator may boil out.  This is illustrated in ''figure 3''.

When the timing is correct or retarded, the fuel deposits on the electrode tip will extend right to the tip. So you can only see ignition advance on the plug, not retard.

===Fuel mixture===
This is the most important part of plug reading and the most misunderstood.  Mechanics are often talk about &quot;color&quot; on their plugs. However there is only one color to look for on a plug and that is black. It is soot, the remains of combustion.

The brown color you see on a plug is only the result of gasoline additives and nothing more. In an engine which is running well, the plug will run hot enough to burn off all the brown color, leaving only white and black. Under test conditions as there will be little time to accumulate fuel deposits.

The black will be found at the base of the electrode insulator nose where the porcelain meets the metal case. This is the only place on the plug where you can see if the engine is rich or lean. This carbon forms a ring around the base of the electrode very quickly. It can be seen after only a few seconds of full throttle running, but a couple of full throttle runs should be made so that the ring will be very clear.  (See ''figure 4'').

While learning to read plugs it will be much easier to see the mixture ring if you cut apart the spark plug and remove the porcelain from the metal case. (See ''figure 5''.) You will see the mixture ring starting where the seal was and extending up the insulator some distance. 

The optimum width of this ring is about 0 to 2mm millimeters with .5mm being ideal for many engines, more than this is too rich for most engines and many engines respond to a mixture where almost no ring is visible but you must conduct power tests to find the ideal for your situation. Make sure your heat range is correct because it may affect the mixture ring.

===Engine power===
Power produces heat and one can see the heat of combustion on the metal case of the plug. The only plugs that show this feature are the cadmium-electroplated types. Don't use the black oxide plugs because they can't show engine heat. Racing engines will produce enough heat to burn the plating off the end of the threads on the case as illustrated in ''figure 7''. You should have 1 to 4 threads scorched by heat on your plugs. If you can't get that heat, you have a problem. Even if every other indication on the plug is perfect, the engine is not making its potential power.

===Ignition performance===
You can see the performance of your ignition system on the electrodes where the spark jumps from one to the other.  The spark should burn clean a spot on both electrodes where the spark touches as illustrated in ''figure 8''.

If the spot is small and irregularly shaped, your ignition is going bad.  You should watch this spot when you are experimenting with spark plug gaps.

===Detonation===
&quot;Detonation&quot; is one of the worst things that can happen in a powerful engine because they are running near the edge of the envelope. It can occur for many reasons; high compression, overly advanced timing, fuel too low in octane rating, too high of a heat range spark plug or poorly shaped combustion chamber.  It can often be seen on the spark plug before serious damage occurs.

You will see small balls of fuel and metal deposits on the porcelain tip and smaller balls of debris on the electrode tip. The metal case will look as if it were sandblasted (inside the engine the piston will also look sand blasted).  See ''figure 9''.

(Detonation is not entirely bad however, maximum power is always found with just a trace of detonation, not enough to be seen on the plug or to be heard by the driver, but enough to leave a slight sandblasted look  (just enough to remove the carbon deposits) on the edge of the piston, after a race.  (Drag racers may not have visible marks even though it is happening due to the short running time). It is theorized that the trace detonation is partially burning the otherwise unburnable mixture in crevices of the piston and chamber.)

Definatelly merge it. [[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 19:27, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

No merge. This article has nothing whatsoever to do with automobile repair. The information is for tuning RACING engines only.[[User:Motorhead|Motorhead]] 03:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

A new book about racing engines should be started and this would merge well into that.--[[User:Motorhead|Motorhead]] 13:29, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>a kilobyte is 8 kilobits</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When/if this tutorial is finished, it will show how to use the Super FX chip, which is included in 8 released games, most notably Star Fox, Doom, and Yoshi's Island.

=Internals=

As the Super FX chip is a processor itself, programming for it is done with Super FX assembly language.
The Super FX chip has 4 RAM banks of 64 Kb each, or a total of 256 kb (32 kilobytes) of RAM.

==Registers==
The Super FX chip has 16 general-purpose registers labeled R0 to R15. They are each 16 bits.

{| width=&quot;35%&quot; || border=&quot;2&quot;
|''Register''||''Address''||''Description''
|-
|R0||3000|| default source/destination register
|-
|R1||3002|| pixel plot X position register
|-
|R2||3004|| pixel plot Y position register
|-
|R3||3006||
|-
|R4||3008|| lower 16 bit result of lmult
|-
|R5||300a||
|-
|R6||300c|| multiplier for fmult and lmult
|-
|R7||300e|| fixed point texel X position for merge
|-
|R8||3010|| fixed point texel Y position for merge
|-
|R9||3012||
|-
|R10||3014||
|-
|R11||3016|| return address set by link
|-
|R12||3018|| loop counter
|-
|R13||301a|| loop point address
|-
|R14||301c|| rom address for getb, getbh, getbl, getbs
|-
|R15||301e|| program counter
|}

There are also plenty of other internal registers:
{| width=&quot;35%&quot; || border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|''Name''||''Address''||''Description''||''Size''
|-
|SFR || 3030 || status flag register || 16 bits
|-
|| || 3032|| unused
|-
||PRAMR || 3033 || Backup RAM register ||  8 bits
|-
||PBR || 3034 || program bank register ||  8 bits
|-
|| || 3035 || unused
|-
||ROMBR || 3036 || rom bank register ||  8 bits
|-
||CFGR || 3037 || control flags register || 8 bits
|-
||SCBR || 3038 || screen base register ||  8 bits
|-
||CLSR || 3039 || clock speed register ||  8 bits
|-
||SCMR || 303a || screen mode register ||  8 bits
|-
||VCR || 303b || version code register (read only) ||  8 bits
|-
||RAMBR || 303c || ram bank register ||  8 bits
|-
|| || 303d || unused
|-
|| CBR || 303e || cache base register || 16 bits
|}


SFR status flag register bits:

{| width=&quot;35%&quot; || border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|| 0 ||   -
|-
|| 1 || Z   Zero flag
|-
|| 2 || CY  Carry flag
|-
|| 3 || S   Sign flag
|-
|| 4 || OV  Overflow flag
|-
|| 5 || G   Go flag (set to 1 when the GSU is running)
|-
|| 6 || R   Set to 1 when reading ROM using R14 address
|-
|| 7 || -
|-
|| 8 || ALT1   Mode set-up flag for the next instruction
|-
|| 9 || ALT2   Mode set-up flag for the next instruction
|-
||10 || IL  Immediate lower 8-bit flag
|-
||11 || IH  Immediate higher 8-bit flag
|-
||12 || B   Set to 1 when the WITH instruction is executed
|-
||13 || -
|-
||14 || -
|-
||15 || IRQ Set to 1 when GSU caused an interrupt. Set to 0 when read by 658c16

Affixes are our &quot;workhorse&quot; morphemes--the tools we use again and again to assemble new words. There are several kinds of affixes:

1. '''Suffixes.''' Suffixes are morphemes that attach to the end of a word. Examples are:
   ''-ion'' in ''motion''
   ''-ate'' in ''investigate''
Suffixes are written with an initial hyphen, as above.

2. '''Prefixes.''' Prefixes attach to the beginning of a word. Examples are:
   ''re-'' in ''redo''
   ''un-'' in ''unthinkable''
Prefixes are written with a terminal hyphen, as above.

3. '''Infixes'''. Although English generally does not have infixes, or morphemes that go
&quot;in the middle&quot; of a word, other languages do. An exception in English
might be ''-frickin-'' in

       Q: Are you going to the concert tonight?
       A: Absofrickinlutely.

Infixes are written with initial and terminal hyphens, as above.

3. '''Circumfixes'''. Circumfixes are affixes that &quot;surround&quot; the word, attaching to the beginning and end of the word. Although English has few examples of this type of affix, other languages use it. The circumfix is probably most widely known from the [[German language|German]] [[past participle]] (''ge- -t'' for regular verbs). Probably the only circumfixes in English are: 
   ''en- -en'' in ''enlighten''
   ''em- -en'' in ''embolden''
In older usage, however, the [[present participle]] could be formed using the circumfix ''a- -ing'':
   ''a- -ing'' in ''a-flying''
   ''a- -ing'' in ''a-caroling''

Circumfixes are written with initial and terminal hyphens, as above.

== Archive ==
This Talk page Module was too long and so I split it into 2 pages.  The first half remains here. The second half was moved to '''Talk Electronics 2'''.  I you don't like what I did, you can re-unite them, but then you get a page which is excessively long again.  I don't suggest re-uniting them until it is decided what to delete.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 23:25, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Let's combine them back together and create an archive for the old discussions, as is normally done on big talk pages on wikipedia. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:09, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Should this be on two separate pages?  That seems strange to me.  Maybe just archive the old discussions or combine them all on this page. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:17, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Delete &quot;talk&quot; sections that no one has commented on in over 6 months old -- move signed comments them to the user's talk page, delete anonymous comments outright. OK ? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:00, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Just archive them normally. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:07, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Foreword ==
Couldn't the three foreword sections be combined into one &quot;article&quot;? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:56, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I agree.  These three sections are very short - might as well combine them into one &quot;Forward&quot; module.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 19:37, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Contributing==
Hi, since you're a DSP engineer, perhaps you would be interested in helping out with the Electronics wiki-textbook. http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics 

:Yes, I would love to.  How do I start?  I am not too familiar with Wikibooks - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:48, Mar 19, 2004 (UTC)

A starter would be grabbing some articles from wikipedia and modifying them to be an educational text. I already started a basic lesson on RC circuits so far. The aim of this text is to educate someone with no previous experience in electronics to a one or two year level.

As for editing, wikibooks are almost exactly the same as editing wikipedia articles. The only difference is the structure of the books and their modules, but most of the required chapters and topics are set up. If you have any more things that you think should be covered, by all means add them to the main page of the textbook, then we can begin fleshing out the details. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
oh, and by the way, do you have a template you use for your electronics diagrams? It would be good if we could have a template, which we could use to standardize all our circuit diagrams.  - Anonymous Contributer, 22:58, Mar 19, 2004 (GMT)

:I don't have a template for them.  Here is a short description and some examples: [[Wikipedia:user:Omegatron#Electronics_diagrams]]

:I have been using Arial size 10 (and then size 9 dropped down 3 pixels for the subscripts), but that could be made prettier.  There is no template for how the labels are arranged, etc. but there could be.  I often edit the diagrams from Klunky so that they are more compact and easy to read.  Do you have any suggestions for them?  I would love some feedback.

:Just try to remember what it was like when you first learned electronics and what you had trouble with.  I tried to teach myself electronics several times when I was in elementary/high school, and never had much luck until college.  I will try to write this like the book I wish I had at the time.  Some misconceptions I had:

(see below.)

:just a few.  :-)  what are the differences to wikipedia?  obviously you don't make links to other encyclopedia articles.  do you include external links or is it meant to be like a printable standalone book? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:56, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:You can include links to other book pages. For the most part, the wikibooks project is the exact same format as the wikipedia with only minor changes. For instance, all the electronics articles are written with names of Electronics/Pie for instance. Make sure you do that, because if we just used standard words, there could be crossing over of a topic. Besides that, add articles and edit mine without mercy! - [[User:Alex S|Alex S]] 18:00, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Table of Contents ==
Do you want to add a table of contents to each page, as in:

http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style#Tables_of_Contents

It should at least have a back button at the bottom of each page or something. 

&gt;&gt;I think that the current TOC for each page works good enough. I don't think there's a need for another TOC on the title page, that can be seen in one screen-viewing...

Who is working on this book?  It looks like it is just Alex.  - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:02, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I'm sure some people from wikipedia would be interested. We just need to messag e them to get their attention.

:Umm .. well, I went ahead and made a TOC for the book. To link into it just include this code at the top of each page: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:Electronics}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; I did so on a couple of pages but did not go though each page to add the code. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== TOC ==
Hmm...  I started adding TOC to each page, and realized that the pages already have titles at the top.

#Do we want redundant titles? As in [[Electronics/Diodes]]
#Is there a way to make TOC default on each page like the titles?

:I don't get the point of the TOC. At the bottom and top of the pages. Why do we need those if any browser you use has a back button? If someone is reading about diodes, will they want to click up on the TOC and go read up on the section about static electricity?  - [[User:Alex S|Alex S]]

::Having to use the back button is sometimes annoying.  Some browsers don't go to the same place in the page when you press back, requiring you to scroll down to wherever you were to go to the next section.  Back--&gt;Scroll/Find--&gt;Click, just to go to the next section.  But yeah, I thought the TOC would have a link to each section, and maybe back and forward buttons (is that possible?), so you can just click on the next section in one click, which is conveniently located at the bottom of the page, which is where you are after reading that section.  This example is more what I was thinking:

*Basic Concepts ? [[Electronics/Electrons|1]] - [[Electronics/Static Electricity|2]] - [[Electronics/Voltage and Current|3]]
*DC Electronics ? [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page1|1]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page2|2]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page3|3]]
*Chapter 3 ? [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page1|1]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page2|2]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page3|3]]

or

*Basic Concepts ? [[Electronics/Electrons|Electrons]] - [[Electronics/Static Electricity|Static Electricity]] - [[Electronics/Voltage and Current|Voltage and Current]]
*DC Electronics ? [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page1|Chap2Page1]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page2|Chap2Page2]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap2Page3|Chap2Page3]]
*Chapter 3 ? [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page1|Chap3Page1]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page2|Chap3Page2]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page3|Chap3Page3]]

though this could get messy

- [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

:I say keep it simple for now. Those current TOCs dont really serve a purpose, and the most useful thing to have would be a 'next chapter' or 'previous chapter' button. But that isn't very feasable at the moment as we're just starting up the book. Should we remove the redundant TOCs?

- [[User:Alex S|Alex S]]

::The way they are now is basically useless, but a little better than just using the back button.  I vote for a table like I included above.  Maybe we can make it even smaller, but it would serve kind of like next and previous section buttons.  who is the developer of wikibooks?  Maybe we can make forward and back buttons?  we can definitely just add them in by hand.  but automated would be better. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

Also when you arrive at a page through another page through another page that you edited, etc etc and you want to go back to the electronics TOC, there is no easy way to get to it. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:44, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I far prefer page names that describe what the page is about. If I want to read about electrons,
*Basic Concepts ? [[Electronics/Electrons|Electrons]] - [[Electronics/Static Electricity|Static Electricity]] - [[Electronics/Voltage and Current|Voltage and Current]]
:tells me right where to click.
:Links like
*Chapter 3 ? [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page1|Chap3Page1]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page2|Chap3Page2]] - [[ExampleBook:Chap3Page3|Chap3Page3]]
:are, in my opinion, useless.
:--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 18:14, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I agree.  Did someone add links like that? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:17, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Unfortunately, yes.
* [[Electronics/History/Chapter 1]]
* [[Electronics/History/Chapter 5]]
Several other books have this unfortunate style.
For example,
* [[Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 1]]
* [[Geometry: Chapter 6]]
* [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Chapter 6]]
* [[SA NC Doing Investigations:Chapter 10]]
* [[European History:Chapter 2]]
* [[Home Remedies/Chapter 2]]
* [[Japanese History/Chapter 9]]

Is there a better place than &quot;[[Talk:Electronics]]&quot;
for discussing how to name chapters in a wikibook ?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:00, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:You mean [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:07, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

''Do we want redundant titles? As in [[Electronics/Diodes]]?''

I don't know. I think it might be nifty if we eliminated some redundancy and had everyone focus on polishing one really, really good explanation of capacitors and inductors at
[[capacitors and inductors]].
That one explanation would somehow be &quot;included&quot; in both the electronics textbook and the physics textbook.
On the other hand, having independent pages in the electronics textbook and the physics textbook
might let us focus on just the properties relevant to the particular subject we are studying.
(In particular, when designing electronic circuits,
we just care about the electrical properties at the terminals,
the &quot;imaginary impedance&quot; stuff.
If we want to learn details about how they work,
how to make and modify them,
then we need to learn the physics
underlying them --
the electric field, the magnetic field, etc.)
But I certainly don't think we need 5 different pages on capacitors:
* [[Electronics/Capacitors]],
* [[Electronics/Capacitor Construction]],
* [[FHSST Physics Electronics:capacitive and inductive circuits]],
* [[Modern_Physics:Electromagnetism:Contents#Capacitors.2C_Inductors_and_Resistors]],
* [[Wikipedia:capacitor]]

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:00, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

==Scope of Book==
This is the second part of the Electronics book.  It deals with topics that are related to Electronics but don't quite fit into an Electronics book.  As this is the second part editors can stop showing restraint towards math.  Long live Greek. 
----

[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]]: I would help on this wikibook except all of you have made it too physics intense. There isn't a basic setting. Right away people are thrown into physics.. jeeze people. This isn't a physics book, it should be an introduction into electronics, and then once you establish the basis of introduction, you can start laying on formulas and equations. I understand that physics is the hardcore study of electronics, but I think it should be more of a basic introduction, not intense.

A lot of the physics is covered in the physics textbooks.. Eh, I don't really know. 

''It is true that these subjects are covered elsewhere, but this part of the book talks about them in terms of Electricity and Magnetism.  A good example is Optics.  Normally when people talk about Optics they talk about visible light.  My question is how optics works throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. For instance at higher frequencies light will destroy mirrors rather than being reflected by it.''

&lt;Electronics normally just refers to circuitry containing non-linear elements; transistors, diodes, semiconductors, etc. This book appears to covering a much wider range: all of circuit theory, and most of classical electomagnetism.

Perhaps it would be better called 'Simple electrity and magentism', maybe covering circuit theory, electrostatics, electrochemistry, electronics, the EM spectrum etc up to undergrad level, stopping short of Maxwell's equations. Either that, or narrow the focus.&gt;

See, I was hoping to make more of a practical book about electronics and about the subject. Now it seems this book has become practically everything but? Hoped to cover things like design and understanding of electrical circuits and systems, etc. Your thoughts?

&lt;Narrow the focus. There's a proposed physics with calculus that can cover the wider shores of EM. For this book, just stick to circuits; without much maths in the first half, with maths in the expanded section: resistance, capacitance, inductance, batteries and electrolysis, generators and motors, and semiconductors. Don't explain how semiconductors work, or details about magnetism; stick to what's need for studying circuits. Possibly a final chapter saying, without maths, 'This is how circuits fit into EM and beyond. Now go and read these other books'&gt;

I agree with person. If we concentrate more on the field of ELECTRONICS and less on the field of ELECTRICITY, we should fare well with a good textbook. If a reader can design a radio transmitter or digital circuit by the end of the book, we can give our selves a pat on the back. However, learning how electron spin and the function of n-doped semiconductor materials only gets you so far.

This book seems to be getting a lot of information added to it that is really not too relevant to electronics.  Table of chemicals, extensive frequency spectrum, history.  If you want to change the name of the book to an Electromagnetics book or Physics of Electricity book, that is fine, but it seems there is too much information here for anyone to complete it in a reasonable amount of time and learn anything useful about practical electronic circuits in the process.  I think they should know a little about the physics of charge, voltage, current first, so they have a foundation to understand what they are actually manipulating, and then learn how to apply them with the various components available and build circuits, then you can go into radio a bit, and in the process explain some electromagnetics, but leave the heavy electromagnetics and physics and chemistry for another book.   The good thing about Wikipedia is that you can link to something without going in depth about it, and people who are interested can read, and people who are not interested don't have to.  Let's not overburden the book with irrelevant information.  Let's just link to it, and stick to the topic.  Interested readers can find it themselves.  Frankly, it is overwhelming, and I find it hard to help editing. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 13:40, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

===This is getting ridiculous===
Sound, Brief History of the Universe, The Solar System, Evolution of the Earth's Atmosphere, Earthquakes and natural disasters, and Global Warming?

As sections in the chapter Analog Circuits?

Stick to the topic, please!

Saying &quot;the earth behaves like a conductor&quot;, &quot;the ionosphere behaves like a conductor and can reflect radio waves&quot; is plenty.  There is no need at ''allllll'' to go into the details like this.  That should be in a radio book anyway, not a basic electronics book.  This is supposed to be a book about electronic circuits for beginners, not about life, the universe, and everything.

- [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 21:09, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Ok, I will admit that my writing does suffer a bit from feature creep.  I like to be through, and there are certain subjects that are not taught in school.  I have moved the offending sections to the Expanded Edition.  If you see anything else that seems excessive I will move it to the Expanded Edition.

[[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

Good compromise.  I just don't see a point of including all kinds of unrelated information when you can just link to Wikipedia articles on each topic. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:12, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:I disagree. Expanded edition is bad idea. We should put all thing in FULL edition. That's what books are.

Not true. Books 'don't' try to cover everything in one go, because people can't. 
Everything includes stuff for people 12 or younger, and the full rigors of QED. No twelve year old can possibly open a book, knowing nothing, and learn QED in a few weeks. Nor will anyone studying QED want to begin by reading about static electricity. They already know that.

Textbooks are aimed at specific targets, 12-16,16-18, undergraduate, etc, which lets them make good assumptions about what the reader already know, and they only cover a limited range of topics, enough to help the reader onto the next stage.

We should do likewise.

This book can, as Wanderer said, cover Electronics with light maths, say 16-18, and the expanded edition cover topics just beyond that scope, including the full maths.

Similarly the expanded edition will also be of limited scope, stopping short of QED. A full account of that topic belongs in a quite different book, for people who've already read Quantum Mechanics and Undergraduate Calculus, among other prerequisites. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

===Road map===
Anyway, does anyone else agree that this should have a charge and basic electron section?  I don't want to go into crazy physics or anything, but we should teach about charge, electrons, holes, potentials, charge flow, etc. so that people understand what it is we are manipulating, what is being stored in a capacitor, etc.  This was my original road map from the [[Talk:Electronics/Aim]] page:

* Electricity
** [[Electronics/Charge|Charge]]
** Voltage
** Current
** Resistance
* Ideal circuits &amp; real circuits (and a description of the difference between schematics that just show wiring between real components, and schematics which show the ideal functioning of components)
** Ideal voltage and current sources
** Ideal nodes and meshes
** Capacitors
** Inductors
*** Introduce magnetism here or in the electricity section?
*** Transformers
** Controlled voltage and current sources
* Other types of components

...

How does this compare with what other people are thinking?  I see the charge section got removed to the expanded edition... - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:26, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I definitely agree on this.  Perhaps a section called 'Basic Electricity Concepts' or something similar could cover charge, current, and voltage.  This section could be VERY basic however.  One thing that should be stressed is that current is not just a magnitude, but also a direction (similar idea for voltage too!).  I think that list should also contain 'Fundamental Laws' - Ohm, KVL, KCL.  - [[User:Maxpower|maxpower]] 17:07, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Alright, so how are we going to do this? Having to cover the laws and all. I suggest we have two sections. One explaining the physics nature of charge and electron flow, then another explaining ohm's law, KVL, KCL. Then for more complex things, such as multiple current sources and capacitors and inductors, another chapter? or we will explain the behavior of the components in their own chapters?

:For more complex things, there are a lot of different techniques/things to know.  Nodal/Mesh analysis work well for circuits with multiple voltage/current sources.  The Inductors/Capacitors sections should also include DC transient analysis.  (Well, this is math heavy, and I don't know if it's really essential for the hobbyist.  Perhaps in the 'expanded' edition.  Simple RC and RL circuits may be enough...probably don't need to consider multiple sequential transients in a single circuit.)  If transients don't get covered, then inductors/capacitors are only useful in the 'AC circuits' chapter.  If this is the case, they should be moved here.

:Regardless, we could introduce Ls and Cs in one chapter, talk about their transient behaviour elsewhere, resonance in the RLC circuits section, and impedance in the AC chapter.  This may make more sense, because no one really wants to know 'everything about capacitors'; they want to know how to use them in a specific context. - [[User:Maxpower|maxpower]] 21:41, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::Good ideas.  We talked about this in the depth of mathematics section, too. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:01, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:::Rereading the depth of mathematics section gave me a chance to look at the electron device modelling book.  I suspected that simple models for diodes would be covered there, and they are, but in a very superficial way.  If the coverage there was more comprehensive, we could just link there...but it isn't.  The ideal diode concept and ID model, Constant Voltage Drop model, and Piecewise Linear model should be covered in our diode section.

:::In general, the Electronics sections on diodes and MOSFETs are lacking.  The kind of qualitative information given in these sections, while useful in understanding, gives no basis for circuit analysis.  While diode and FET models do, of course, contain MORE MATH, there's really no point in covering these topics without attaching some useful info.  None the less, understanding how these devices work on an electron scale is totally unnecessary.  Models useful for circuit analysis should suffice.  Another useful area to delve into would be CMOS logic.  Virtually no math (except boolean algebra), makes MOSFETs useful.  - [[User:Maxpower|maxpower]] 16:51, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::::Yes, we should cover all of those models.  There are a few people who are paranoid of math, it seems, and we can certainly explain how things work without it.  But really, that isn't useful for anything.  You can't do anything with your knowledge without knowing the math.  We should try to present the math as accessibly as possible, though.  Presenting transistors as simple switches first and then as &quot;amplifiers&quot; might be a good idea...  As I have mentioned before, I don't like the term amplifier, because a transistor is not an amplifier by itself.  The circuit it is built into is the amplifier.  The transistor is just an electronically controlled valve. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

:::Ok. Now here is another question: do people prefer lots of chapters, or few? I personally would rather have full, worthwhile chapters than many small ones. How about this:

- Basic Electricity Concepts (charge, attraction)
- Basic DC Electronics (KVL, KCL, Ohm's law) 
- Resistors 
- Capacitors
- Inductors

rest falls into AC and analog electronics. Perhaps we merge these sections??

::I agree with concepts, and fundamental laws, but the rest of the merging goes too far.  Full worthwhile chapters are great, but this arrangement is not helpful in learning the material.  As I said earlier, no one wants to know everything about capacitors.  They are useful in many contexts, and should be covered in each context, rather than grouping all capacitor information together.

::Ohm's law needed to go into the fundamental laws section, but circuit components is not a logical part of the fundamental laws section. Also, covering components before laws makes more sense to me.  This is a case where I feel that starting small and building up (rather than top-down) really works.

::BTW, &quot;the rest&quot; does not fall into AC and analog electronics.  There are several worthwhile topics that aren't covered in the scheme above: transients, nodal/mesh, Thevenin/Norton. If less chapters does in fact equals better (intentional), nodal/mesh can become one chapter. - [[User:Maxpower|maxpower]] 00:23, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Depth of mathematics==
&quot;Dear people editing this book, while math is useful and does have its place in an electronics textbook, it makes it very hard for people to understand electronics.&quot;

:Understood.  On the other hand, I had huge amounts of trouble understanding electronics until I got the math background.  When I used to read books on the subject I would skip any equations as being too hard, and hence didn't get a very good understanding of it.  It is almost a form of applied mathematics in several ways.  We should try to make it very intuitive how things work, without needing the math background, but we should also provide the math (in the simplest forms possible), because it really is necessary. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:30, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I don't have problems with math, I enjoy it. However, when people write pages upon pages of equations that have little to no explanation, it turns the electronics textbook from a learning book into a formula table. The rule of thumb for most math related textbooks: 1 equation -&gt; 100 words explaining it. - [[User:Alex S|Alex S]] 14:30, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Certainly.  I was intimidated by lots of math, especially when it involved calculus, which I hadn't learned yet (how are we going to handle this?) and skipped over parts in books that had heavy math, my loss.  I mostly learned from a book I still have, by Forrest Mims or something like that.  I will read over it and highlight the parts that led me in the wrong direction. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 21:38, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::I wrote the part on RCL circuits.  This contains a lot of math.  I agree that more explanation is required.  And this is still a work in progress.  Can you explain this topic without the math?  You can do it in the frequency domain with Laplace transforms, but its still not that simple.  You can ignore the zero in the pole/zero diagram and deduce a similar, however wrong equation. It often annoys me when textbooks skip lots of steps in the derivation of their equation or make assumptions without explicitly saying so.  So I have tried to include all the steps, which makes the math appear more complex. Would a compromise be to include both simplified and full explanation?  [[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]] 00:05, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:And what are laplace transform pairs? - [[User:Alex S|Alex S]] 14:30, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Laplace transforms are used to calculate a transient response from the frequency response. [[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]] 00:05, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::Yeah that definitely needs to be included.  However, I can't remember Laplace transforms at all.  I think I do everything with Fourier transforms now.  Am I thinking about this correctly?  That Fourier can replace Laplace? If so, which should we cover?  I guess the aim of the book should be clarified.  Do we want to teach something that a 10 year old could understand, without really giving them the tools to build or do anything themselves?  Or do we want to teach them as if they were taking a college class?  Should we try to be all things to all people?  (Basic ideas and water pipe analogies at the beginning of a section with calculus and transforms at the end?)  It says in the intro that it should teach the first two years of electronics, but starting with what knowledge? Should we even assume that the reader can understand algebra?

::: On an unrelated note, I think I will start stubifying sections, so that people feel compelled to add more, without being daunted by starting a new section. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:32, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::::Laplace transforms are a transform to the S-domain which you may be familiar with from pole-zero diagrams in filter analysis.  Fourier transforms are a transform to the frequency domain.  They are similar, but i wouldnt say one replaces the other.  For filter design laplace transforms are best.

:::::I have updated the format of the RCL circuit [[Electronics/RCL_time_domain_simple]].  what do people think?  Is this simple enough? [[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]] 03:22, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)  

:::To be honest, I have only a basic understanding of calculus (basic derivative calculus) and have little to no idea about those equations. Peter, you might want to kick it down a notch mathematics wise, and add some more explanations to the articles to help people understand. And Omegatron, I think if we made this book start from 0 knowledge and work your way up it would be good. Assuming people have basic algebra knowledge. Maybe we should even have a prerequisite page directing them to other math wikibooks? -Alex S

::::::Hmm... I do remember that I used to do Laplace transforms, of course, and I remember pole-zero plots and root-locus diagrams, but I always found them confusing and nonintuitive.  bode plots and frequency responses make more sense to me, and were just as easy to use.  Can you give an example of a filter design that is easier in laplace domain?

::::::I looked at the simple RCL circuit.  I understand now why alex is concerned.  We should start each section with a few sentences that explain the situation in a way that even a child with 4th grade math could understand, and then work our way up from there.  even if &quot;working our way up&quot; means we need to jump right into calculus, that's ok, as long as we have given the reader a basic idea of how charge and charge pressures are flowing. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

:::::: I'm sorry I've to make a comment about the RCL analysis.  How is it possible to analyse a RCL circuits without differential equations or in the Laplace or Fourier Domain?  The other choice would be only focussing on steady state but it also comes with the problem of complex maths or at least some maths that might seem a bit strange to someone with any mathematical knowledge.[[User:IknowNothing|IknowNothing]]

&quot;In reading &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; by Steven Hawking he said (and I paraphrase) that his editor told him that for each formula that he included in his book the readership would drop by one half.  As a result the only formula he included was the one Einstein is famous for.  I would suggest you keep that in mind as you add math equations.  Decide if the equation you are adding really adds enough value to the work to justify the loss of half the readers being able to comprehend the passage.  Not saying to leave them out, but don't add them for their own sake.&quot;

:I'm sorry, but electronics is a very math-heavy subject.  We will try our best to explain the way things work without math, but most of these equations are completely necessary, unless we want to rename the book &quot;electronics for kids&quot; and not really explain any of it. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]


==Circuit template==
#[[Electronics/Template|Circuit-Creation Template]]

moving this here, since it seems to be more for editors than readers.  i recommend klunky for drawing schematics anyway, as i have said before. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 01:36, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Quantum physics, Quantum Mechanics==
I've noticed a lot of references to QM and QP in many articles. For some people it is a more clear system of understanding things. That being said, it also can be irrelevant at times. Sometimes it is a good way to show off how smart you are (I don't mean this in a negative way, however I see this more and more often). What are your thoughts about this?

In order to really understand electronics you need to understand E&amp;M and some parts of Quantum (Spin, electrons, photons, and some random other stuff).  Spin is responsible for magnetism, electrons are orbitals, and photons are carrier particles for E&amp;M.  This is not to say that we need to teach all the math involved.  The main reason things seem irrelevant at times is that they are not well enough explained to show their relevance.  Overall electronics is a much bigger field than most people realize, with lots of far ranging implications.  Afterall E&amp;M is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.  So what do radio waves have to do with ether?

==A Crossroads==
Ok. We seem to have run into a crossroads here. We have people pushing for a book more oriented on information about almost everything and how it works, and other people pushing for a book on electronics design with heavy calculus. What are your thoughts? Personally I would want a book that gives useful information about how to design electronics, explaining LAWS and THEOREMS. I mean, learning how the atmosphere works is good -

If I wanted to be a meteorologist.

:Exactly. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

So you really want something that looks like [[Electron_Device_Modelling|this]]?

:Yes.  Something that focuses entirely on electronics; not on all related disciplines, with a certain amount of detail.  Electron Device Modelling could list the Electronics book as a prerequisite, for instance, for people who want to know in-depth semiconductor info.  The electronics book won't have that much detail about semiconductors.  A book on electroacoustics or bioacoustics or electrical properties of the atmosphere would be great, but they shouldn't all be lumped into one book about everything. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

To the crossroads person, I have no problem with LAWs and THEOREMS and useful information, but I do have problems with needing a graduate level math degree to understand Electronics. Heavy Calculus is just the tip of the math iceberg. As you said yourself &quot;Someone should lay off on the big worded talk&quot;. Well make up your mind. Do you or do you not want this book to use graduate level math? As for the atmosphere, if a meteorologist is all you can think of then you have no imagination. Also what is the point of learning Electronics if you do not know how to apply that knowledge? That is the point of this book. Finally, you seem to have something against me given your negative comments. If you persist I will ask the moderators to ban you or erase all of your comments. Play kind and I will play kind. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

I did not see any comments that were out of line.

&quot;Also what is the point of learning Electronics if you do not know how to apply that knowledge?&quot; 

Knowing about infrasound and it's &quot;emotion-intensifying&quot; properties or about the atmosphere is not exactly application. It's learning information from other fields that have no direct application. An application of electronics would be, for instance, designing a circuit to emit 'infrasound'.

:Exactly, again. :-) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

You said the &quot;Book For Geeks&quot; has no purpose and should be deleted. You also said that many of the topics I include have nothing to do with Electronics. You just want a book that will teach you how to design circuits. Well I have grander aspirations, so feel free to ignore anything you feel does not belong. As I am the main person editing this book series, I feel I have the right to shape its destiny. If you do not like the scope of the book series, you are welcome to start your own Electronics book and include any content you desire from this book series. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

:Imagine you are working with a group of people who are making a map.  It is meant to be a road map, showing roads, cities, and maybe a little bit more useful information to someone driving in a car.  You have to leave for a day, and when you come back, someone else has joined the group, and added county lines, train routes, subway routes, canals, rivers, fast food locations, latitude and longitude, historical locations, topographic lines, magnetic field strength lines, zoning regulations, etc etc.  Not only is it no longer useful as a road map (you can't &quot;just ignore&quot; the parts that are cluttering up the map), it is hard to make sense of it and continue contributing.  I have a feeling this is why you are the major contributor.  I know that it's the reason I don't contribute as much as I used to.  Sorry; I don't want to sound mad or drive you away from helping.  But frankly, a lot of the information you contribute is not helping anyone learn electronics, and some of it is even wrong (resistor value color codes, for instance, and how are capacitors a type of cell?).  I think moderators would agree that your last comment should be turned around.  You are welcome to start your own Electricity, Physics, and How It Relates To Everything book and include any content you desire from this one, but I think this book should focus on practical electronic circuit building, with enough theory to understand it well, and maybe just a few simple radio, computer, etc applications at the end.  maybe more advanced applications; i don't know.  Regardless, let's finish the basics before outlining all these advanced chapters.  Let's work in order so that everything is consistent.

:The expanded edition may be a good compromise that we all can live with.  Maybe we should split them into two distinct books, though.  Maybe there is a way to make drop down menus with additional information so we can hide it from the typical reader unless they want to see it?

:Whether we want this to be for college level students who know calculus, or high school students who only know algebra, I don't know that either.  I would have loved a book that didnt need knowledge of calculus a few years ago...  Maybe we could explain things in terms of frequency spectra instead?  If you go through all the derivations it requires calculus, but I think we could create a simplifed non-calc explanation of fourier transforms, frequency components, sinusoids, phase, etc. and explain everything (inductors, filters) through that.  We should title the book appropriately, so that someone else can write a different type of electronics book if they want.  Electronics: An Introduction for Pre-calculus Students or something.  Maybe we need some voting.  Or maybe this will be like a religion and just split up into 50 different denominations that believe basically the same but don't associate with each other. :-) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 16:46, 4 May 2004 (UTC)

Notice how lately I have been refering to this project not as a book but as a series of 5 books each the size of the Electronics book. I guess it was a mistake to organize them all on a single page. As for the resistor colors, I got them from some table. As for a capacitor being a variant of a cell, well both have to do with the separation of charge and you can power lasers by discharging capacitors. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

:Yeah, I guess they are kind of similar.  I think I read somewhere that those &quot;supercaps&quot; in the kilofarad range behave in-between real capacitors and batteries. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

5 books is quite a bit. Anyways, I don't know. You seem to claim that you started this book. However, that should not mean that you 'own' the book. When this book was 'started' by you, it was one page with a bunch of random formulas (go check). It's not like we're even fighting for credit here. This is all open source, free text. None of us will gain anything or benefit. We shouldn't be fighting at all. But the main problem is the relevancy of information. I personally want a book on electronics design. Please don't be angry at my comments, but I felt that this needed to be said. You've mentioned many many times that you've started this book. Are you saying that because you've started the book, that you have more input or command over it than others? Lastly, Omegatron's map analogy pretty much well sums up everything. What are your views on moving parts of this textbook into other textbooks? 你有不脑。

:Splitting it into 5 books might be a good idea.  I still think we should start at the beginning and not start putting content into the next sections until the first sections have at least the 75% symbol.

:Likewise, being the major contributor does not mean you &quot;own&quot; the book, either.  It's a collaborative effort, which should theoretically tend to make the information more useful and relevant and error-free than real books written by one person. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

I'm not disputing the need for a book on Electronics design based on Omegatron's road map. That's why I split up the old book up into five books. The only thing linking them together is that they share the same namespace. Is there a reason I can't put a series of books in the same namespace? After all the only difference between Wikibooks is that they have different namespaces. The expanded edition is just a temporary holding place for these books. 

As for ownership, all books start as nothing. The reason I say I have more input than anyone else, is I have spent quite a bit more time than anyone else organizing and working on the book. I could care less about credit and have no problems with collaboration, but I do want the power to shape the overall content of the book series. Given that topics like the atmosphere will not appear in the first book, I do not see the problem. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

:Wanderer I don't see how you can have the power to shape the overall content of the books. Everything here is done by collaboration. I'm concerned about overlap. If a topic is not strictly electronics, then it probably better to go into a general physics textbook. Otherwise all our books will overlap considerably and we will be constantly reinventing the wheel, which is in nobody's interest. I can personally see two books a &quot;non calculus book&quot; and a calculus one. (Also can we please keep the discussion calm? Talking of banning etc. is not very nice, Oh yeah one more thing, would the anon editor please sign comments I'm finding it hart to follow the conversation) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:24, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

Given that this is an issue that refuses to die, I have created another book called [[Physics in English]]. Since chapter 1 and various other topics are background reading, I have moved them to the new book. This way the Electronics book can focus on circuit design from the start to the end. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

:I think we should leave charge and voltage and current, as they are inherently electronics topics.  We won't go into too much detail about electromagnetism and maxwell's equations, but explain enough for the reader to understand relays, inductors, transformers, parasitic components, crosstalk, (anything else?)  It's kind of like... a capacitor stores charge and can supply a voltage, a diode blocks current in one direction, a transformer converts voltages and currents, so those are electronics topics, but just because a piezo buzzer produces sound, and a cell produces chemical reactions, doesn't mean all of acoustics and chemistry should be subtopics.  Likewise, we aren't explaining all of the implications of charged particles and currents and voltages either.  Just enough for them to understand what they are manipulating.  I think of the reader as knowing basically what atoms and electrons are, but not much more about what goes on in a piece of metal or circuit.

:I need to stop coming to this page and just work on the articles. :-) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 23:19, 5 May 2004 (UTC)


==Unusual visualizations==
I just saw this. I haven't read it all, but it looks interesting.  Maybe we want to include it?  This is kind of a note to myself to read it later, and showing it to others so you can judge how useful it is:

- [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:16, 7 May 2004 (UTC)

:Looks like a graphical representation of voltage and current. Might be good for explaining voltage drops and current, but it is more ambiguous and inflexible than a circuit diagram. Having a good physical understanding of voltage would probably be more useful. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

* zdrav  - health? (like Na Zdrowie in Polish?) Na zdrowie better known as in most languages na zdravje. In health. On health.
* cxutijsx - You read. In Southern Slavic region (Balkans) this would be read as ćutijš. Which in this region is read as ćutiš - meaning to be quiet. One lack of connection. In Slovio its reading. In Balkans it is ćitaš. Šta ćitaš? What are you reading?
* cxutijm - I read. In Balkans. ćutijm is read as ćutim. Which means I am quiet, or i am being quiet. If it whas cxitam in Balkans that would be read as ćitam. I'm reading.
* to - this/it.  In Balkans to is that.
* brosxur - brochure. Understandable enough.
* idijm  - I go. One connection between all. In Balkans it is idem. I'm going....
* Praguf - Prague. Old Prussia wording from what it appears, and also Northern Slavic. Sorbs perhaps.
* idijt - he/she/it goes. Russian in terms. In Balkans. Idem. 
* nikto - Nothing/No-one? Balkans  niko - no one.
* idijsx - You go. Balkans ideš - you're going.... 
* Cxehju Republikuf - Czech Republic. Problem with kuf is that in most Slavic languages its ku or ka, Republiku, Republika, Republike, Republiko.
* idijm - I go. Balkans, idem. IM going


Praguf in most slavic languages - Pragu, Prage, Pragi, Praga, Prago.

==Wrong==

&quot;cxutim&quot; is not &quot;i read&quot;, it's &quot;feel&quot;. &quot;Cxutit&quot; means &quot;to feel&quot; and in south slavic languages ćuteti/šutjeti means to be quiet, but &quot;ćutiti&quot; means to feel. Ćitati doesn't exists, it's &quot;čitati&quot;, which means &quot;to read&quot;. What logical reason is to start a conversation with &quot;How do you read?&quot; thats apsurd. I'm going to change it from &quot;read&quot; to &quot;feel&quot;.

== Place Names ==

*'''Prague''' - Praga not ''Praguf''
*'''Czech Republic''' - Cxehju Republik not ''Republikuf''

The 'uf' endings used to be used to show direction and the accusative case. This is now demonstrated with 'm' or 'um' but this is rarely used as it is an unnecessary complication when pronouns are just as effective.</text>

* '''Suggestion:''' How about a chapter near the end talking about &quot;Commercial Software versus Open Source.&quot;  
** Given your comments about the tone of the book, an obvious theme is &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  
** I would distinguish the theme of this chapter from the &quot;Cancer&quot; chapter, which would be more a compilation of all the name-calling.  SCO CEO Darl Mc Bride's press quotes would be another fertile source for juicy epithets. 
** This would be about specific strategies and tactics commercial vendors are taking to thwart open source.  
*** The obvious jumping off point would be the SCO lawsuit, but I think there's a lot more to the story than just lawsuits, actual or imagined.  
*** One approach is to co-opt open source &quot;virtues&quot; for proprietary products.  
*** Another is to open source parts of their product like, like CA did with Ingres or like BEA Systems did with the framework for Web Logic Workshop.  
** You could do two chapters: one on business stuff, and the other on &quot;dirty tricks&quot; like the SCO lawsuit, potential patent suits, license proliferation, ... 

Thanks for your work in starting this project. --brent

==Branch on extensions==
When writing a bash script which should do different things based on the extension of a file, the following pattern is helpful.

&lt;pre&gt; 
 #filepath should be set to the name(with optional path) of the file in question
 ext=${filepath##*.}
 if [[ &quot;$ext&quot; == txt ]] ; then 
   #do something with text files
 fi
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Source: [http://www.splike.com/howtos/bash_faq.html#Get+a+file%27s+basename%2C+dirname%2C+extension%2C+etc%3F slike.com Bash FAQ]).

==Rename several files==
This recipe shows how to rename several files following a pattern.

In this example, the user has huge collection of screenshots. This user wants to rename the files using a Bourne-compatible shell. Here is an &quot;ls&quot; at the shell prompt to show you the filenames. The goal is to rename images like &quot;snapshot1.png&quot; to [[Commons:Image:nethack-kernigh-22oct2005-01.png| &quot;nethack-kernigh-22oct2005-01.png&quot;]].

 $ ls
 snapshot1.png   snapshot25.png  snapshot40.png  snapshot56.png  snapshot71.png
 snapshot10.png  snapshot26.png  snapshot41.png  snapshot57.png  snapshot72.png 
 snapshot11.png  snapshot27.png  snapshot42.png  snapshot58.png  snapshot73.png
 snapshot12.png  snapshot28.png  snapshot43.png  snapshot59.png  snapshot74.png
 snapshot13.png  snapshot29.png  snapshot44.png  snapshot6.png   snapshot75.png
 snapshot14.png  snapshot3.png   snapshot45.png  snapshot60.png  snapshot76.png
 snapshot15.png  snapshot30.png  snapshot46.png  snapshot61.png  snapshot77.png
 snapshot16.png  snapshot31.png  snapshot47.png  snapshot62.png  snapshot78.png
 snapshot17.png  snapshot32.png  snapshot48.png  snapshot63.png  snapshot79.png
 snapshot18.png  snapshot33.png  snapshot49.png  snapshot64.png  snapshot8.png
 snapshot19.png  snapshot34.png  snapshot5.png   snapshot65.png  snapshot80.png
 snapshot2.png   snapshot35.png  snapshot50.png  snapshot66.png  snapshot81.png
 snapshot20.png  snapshot36.png  snapshot51.png  snapshot67.png  snapshot82.png
 snapshot21.png  snapshot37.png  snapshot52.png  snapshot68.png  snapshot83.png
 snapshot22.png  snapshot38.png  snapshot53.png  snapshot69.png  snapshot9.png
 snapshot23.png  snapshot39.png  snapshot54.png  snapshot7.png
 snapshot24.png  snapshot4.png   snapshot55.png  snapshot70.png

First, to add a &quot;0&quot; (zero) before snapshots 1 through 9, write a for loop (in effect, a short shell script).
* Use &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; which is a filename pattern for a single character. Using it, I can match snapshots 1 through 9 but miss 10 through 83 by saying &lt;tt&gt;snapshot?.png&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Use &lt;tt&gt;${&lt;/tt&gt;''parameter''&lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;''pattern''&lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; to substitute the value of ''parameter'' with the ''pattern'' removed from the beginning. This is to get rid of &quot;snapshot&quot; so I can put in &quot;snapshot0&quot;.
* Before actually running the loop, insert an &quot;echo&quot; to test that the commands will be correct.

 $ for i in snapshot?.png; do echo mv &quot;$i&quot; &quot;snapshot0${i#snapshot}&quot;; done
 mv snapshot1.png snapshot01.png
 mv snapshot2.png snapshot02.png
 mv snapshot3.png snapshot03.png
 mv snapshot4.png snapshot04.png
 mv snapshot5.png snapshot05.png
 mv snapshot6.png snapshot06.png
 mv snapshot7.png snapshot07.png
 mv snapshot8.png snapshot08.png
 mv snapshot9.png snapshot09.png

That seems good, so run it by removing the &quot;echo&quot;.
 $ for i in snapshot?.png; do mv &quot;$i&quot; &quot;snapshot0${i#snapshot}&quot;; done

An ls confirms that this was effective.

Now change prefix &quot;snapshot&quot; to &quot;nethack-kernigh-22oct2005-&quot;. Run a loop similar to the previous one:
 $ for i in snapshot*.png; do
 &gt; mv &quot;$i&quot; &quot;nethack-kernigh-22oct2005-${i#snapshot}&quot;
 &gt; done

This saves the user from typing 83 &quot;mv&quot; commands.

==Long command line options==

The builtin &lt;tt&gt;getopts&lt;/tt&gt; does not support long options so the external &lt;tt&gt;getopt&lt;/tt&gt; is required. (On some systems, &lt;tt&gt;getopt&lt;/tt&gt; ''also'' does not support long options, so the next example will not work.)

&lt;pre&gt;
eval set -- $(getopt -l install-opts: &quot;&quot; &quot;$@&quot;)
while true; do
    case &quot;$1&quot; in
        --install-opts)
            INSTALL_OPTS=$2
            shift 2
            ;;
        --)
            shift
            break
            ;;
    esac
done

echo $INSTALL_OPTS
&lt;/pre&gt;

The call to &lt;tt&gt;getopt&lt;/tt&gt; quotes and reorders the command line arguments found in &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt;.  &lt;tt&gt;set&lt;/tt&gt; then makes replaces &lt;tt&gt;$@&lt;/tt&gt; with the output from &lt;tt&gt;getopt&lt;/tt&gt;

Another example of getopt use can also be found in the [http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/extmisc.html#EX33A Advanced Bash Script Guide]

== Process certain files through xargs ==

In this recipe, we want to process a large list of files, but we must run one command for each file. In this example, we want to convert the sampling rates of some sound files to 44100 hertz. The command is &lt;tt&gt;'''sox file.ogg -r 44100 conv/file.ogg'''&lt;/tt&gt;, which converts &lt;tt&gt;file.ogg&lt;/tt&gt; to a new file &lt;tt&gt;conv/file.ogg&lt;/tt&gt;. We also want to skip files that are already 44100 hertz.

First, we need the sampling rates of our files. One way is to use the &lt;tt&gt;'''file'''&lt;/tt&gt; command:

 $ '''file *.ogg'''
 audio_on.ogg:            Ogg data, Vorbis audio, mono, 44100 Hz, ~80000 bps
 beep_1.ogg:              Ogg data, Vorbis audio, stereo, 44100 Hz, ~193603 bps
 cannon_1.ogg:            Ogg data, Vorbis audio, mono, 48000 Hz, ~96000 bps
 ...

(The files in this example are from [http://www.secretmaryo.org/ Secret Maryo Chronicles].) We can use &lt;tt&gt;'''grep -v'''&lt;/tt&gt; to filter out all lines that contain '44100 Hz':
 $ '''file *.ogg | grep -v '44100 Hz''''
 cannon_1.ogg:            Ogg data, Vorbis audio, mono, 48000 Hz, ~96000 bps
 ...
 jump_small.ogg:          Ogg data, Vorbis audio, mono, 8000 Hz, ~22400 bps
 live_up.ogg:             Ogg data, Vorbis audio, mono, 22050 Hz, ~40222 bps
 ...

We finished with &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;file&quot;, so now we want to remove the other info and leave only the filenames to pass to &quot;sox&quot;. We use the text utility &lt;tt&gt;'''cut'''&lt;/tt&gt;. The option &lt;tt&gt;'''-d:'''&lt;/tt&gt; divides each line into fields at the colon; &lt;tt&gt;'''-f1'''&lt;/tt&gt; selects the first field.

 $ '''file *.ogg | grep -v '44100 Hz' | cut -d: -f1'''
 cannon_1.ogg
 ...
 jump_small.ogg
 live_up.ogg
 ...

We can use another pipe to supply the filenames on the standard input, but &quot;sox&quot; expects them as arguments. We use &lt;tt&gt;'''xargs'''&lt;/tt&gt;, which will run a command repeatedly using arguments from the standard input. The &lt;tt&gt;'''-n1'''&lt;/tt&gt; option specifies one argument per command. For example, we can run &lt;tt&gt;'''echo sox'''&lt;/tt&gt; repeatedly:

 $ '''file *.ogg | grep -v '44100 Hz' | cut -d: -f1 | xargs -n1 echo sox'''
 sox cannon_1.ogg
 ...
 sox itembox_set.ogg
 sox jump_small.ogg
 ...

However, these commands are wrong. The full command for cannon_1.ogg, for example, is &lt;tt&gt;'''sox cannon_1.ogg -r 44100 conv/cannon_1.ogg'''&lt;/tt&gt;. &quot;xargs&quot; will insert incoming data into placeholders indicated by &quot;{}&quot;. We use this strategy in our pipeline. If we have doubt, then first we can build a test pipeline with &quot;echo&quot;:

 $ '''file *.ogg | grep -v '44100 Hz' | cut -d: -f1 | \'''
 &gt; '''xargs -i 'echo sox {} -r 44100 conv/{}''''
 sox cannon_1.ogg -r 44100 conv/cannon_1.ogg
 ...
 sox itembox_set.ogg -r 44100 conv/itembox_set.ogg
 sox jump_small.ogg -r 44100 conv/jump_small.ogg
 ...

It worked, so let us remove the &quot;echo&quot; and run the &quot;sox&quot; commands:
 $ '''mkdir conv'''
 $ '''file *.ogg | grep -v '44100 Hz' | cut -d: -f1 | \'''
 &gt; '''xargs -i 'sox {} -r 44100 conv/{}''''

After a wait, the converted files appear in the &lt;tt&gt;conv&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory. The above three lines alone did the entire conversion.

== Simple playlist frontend for GStreamer ==

If you have GStreamer, the command &lt;tt&gt;gst-launch filesrc location=''filename'' ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! esdsink&lt;/tt&gt; will play a sound or music file of any format for which you have a GStreamer plugin. This script will play through a list of files, optionally looping through them. (Replace &quot;esdsink&quot; with your favorite sink.)

 #!/bin/sh
 loop=false
 if test x&quot;$1&quot; == x-l; then
   loop=true
   shift
 fi
 
 while true; do
   for i in &quot;$@&quot;; do
     if test -f &quot;$i&quot;; then
       echo &quot;${0##*/}: playing $i&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr
       gst-launch filesrc location=&quot;$i&quot; ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! esdsink
     else
       echo &quot;${0##*/}: not a file: $i&quot; &gt; /dev/stderr
     fi
   done
   if $loop; then true; else break; fi
 done

This script demonstrates some common Bourne shell tactics:
* &quot;loop&quot; is a boolean variable. It works because its values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; are both Unix commands (and sometimes shell builtins), thus you can use them as conditions in &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; statements.
* The shell builtin &quot;shift&quot; removes $1 from the argument list, thus shifting $2 to $1, $3 to $2, and so forward. This script uses it to process an &quot;-l&quot; option.
* The substitution &lt;tt&gt;${0##*/}&lt;/tt&gt; gives everything in $0 after the last slash, thus &quot;playlist&quot;, not &quot;/home/musicfan/bin/playlist&quot;.

:&quot;As soon as one learns Slovio one can communicate with over 400 million people in such countries as: Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldavia, Serbia, Montenegro and so on.&quot;

Eh? 'one can begin to attempt to communicate' perhaps. Heck, if you want to be '''sure''' of being able to communicate with people in those countries, learn Russian. -- [[User:Jimregan|Jimregan]] 01:09, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I think it's easier to communicate in English than in Russian nowadays in some of them, e.g. in Poland. [[User:Ausir|Ausir]]

Yeah Slovio would need a field study on its understandability to properly gauge its usefulness as a communication
tool. [[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 06:49, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I removed the last sentence stating that you'd usually don't want to leave out the break statements in the switch loop.
I don't agree with that, leaving out the break statements can make life a lot easier. So i think the programmer should be the judge of that, not the writer.
: I put a more specific version back under the code block, I hope that will allay your concerns.  I feel that it's necessary to have because beginning programmers may (and probably will) be reading this, and missing break; statements are often a gotcha that can lead to unexpected results. --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 04:51, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Autodesk 3ds Max! This is a powerful [[w:en:3D computer graphics software|3-Dimensional computer modeling/animation package]] developed by [[w:Autodesk|Autodesk]]. It is the industry standard for games design, used in well-known titles such as [[w:Assassin's_Creed|Assassin's Creed]], [[w:en:Rome_total_war|Rome: Total War]] and perhaps more famously, it's built in [[w:Quake|Quake]] export feature. It has also been used for creating 3d scenes for films and television, though more often packages such as the more expensive [[w:Autodesk Maya|Autodesk Maya]] are used in its place for such purpose.

==The Layout==
Before beginning to create anything, you must know what does what. This is an introduction to the most important areas of the UI (user interface) in the software, those being the menus and the Viewports.

===The Main Toolbar===
[[File:Maintoolbar.jpg|center|800px|thumb|The Main Toolbar of 3ds max 7]]

This is bar at the top of your screen. As you can see, this bar contains several buttons, and it would be difficult to memorize all of them at once. Therefore, we will only go over 4 important buttons in Main Toolbar right now, but feel free to experiment with the others to find out what they do, or hover over them for a tooltip.

Select Object - This is the button with the single mouse icon in the center. This command allows you to select an object in your scene by clicking on it, without accidently performing any transformation (move, rotate, or enlarge). The keyboard shortcut for this command is &quot;q&quot;.

Select and Move - This is the button with 4 arrows pointing in different directions; it should be 4 buttons to the right of Select Object. This allows you to select an object and move it to a different location along its axis by clicking on the three arrows in the viewports. The keyboard shortcut for this command is &quot;w&quot;.

Select and Rotate - This is the arrow going in a circle right next to Select and Move. This allows you to select an object and make it spin on its pivot point. The keyboard shortcut for this command is &quot;e&quot;.

Select and Scale - This button shows a small square in the lower left corner of a larger square; it is right next to Select and Rotate. This command allows you to select an object and make it bigger or smaller along an axis. The keyboard shortcut for this command is &quot;r&quot;.


&lt;u&gt;Remember the shortcuts !!&lt;/u&gt;

===The Viewports===
[[File:Viewports.jpg|right|thumb||thumb|change this layout just by right-clicking]]
The Viewports are where you will be doing most of your work; they display (by default) three orphagraphic wireframe views and a 3d solid perspective view. 
They are the 4 large squares that occupy most of the screen when you first open 3DS MAX. 
These represent (in default positions): 
&lt;li&gt; top (upper left) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front (upper right) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;left/side (lower left)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perspective (lower right).&lt;/li&gt;
You can always change this layout by right-clicking in the space between the viewports.

===The Command Panel===
[[File:Commandpanel.jpg|right|100px|thumb|The command panel of 3DS Max 7]]
The Command Panel is the panel to the far right of the screen when you first open 3DS MAX. This important panel takes a large part in creating objects.

This area has several important tabs:

==Navigating 3D space==
[[File:Navigating.jpg|right|60px|thumb| y x z axis]]
In 3DS Max, there’s x, y, z, axis. Imagine looking down at a table top; these define: width ‘x’, length ‘y’, and height ‘z’ pointing up. This is being clarified due to the fact there are other applications that use these axis where ‘z’ and ‘y’ are switched, as if looking at a wall. This can lead to some confusion if you’re coming over from Maya or any other software that uses ‘y’ as up.
[[File:Zoomin.jpg|right|thumb|thumb|Zoom buttons]]
It is important to know how to navigate around a scene to simplify editing an object. In the very bottom right corner of the screen, there is a toolbar full of buttons ment for moving around in a viewport.

Zoom - This is the button with the magnifying glass image. This allows you to click and drag the mouse up and down in a viewport to zoom in and out of the scene. The shortcut for this is using your mouse's scroll wheel.

Zoom All - This is the button right next to zoom with a magnifying glass and 4 boxes. This essentially does the same thing as Zoom, the difference being that it will zoom in and out in all viewports at once. This is an advantage when you want to get a better view of your scene in all viewports.

Zoom Extents - This is the button next to Zoom All with a blank box. Clicking this button will instantly zoom the active viewport so that all objects in your scene fit into it.

Zoom Extents Selected - You change Zoom Extents to this button by holding it down until you get a selection list. Click on the button with the white shaded box. This button zooms the active viewport so that your current selection fills it up. This has the same effect as Zoom Extents if you have either every thing or nothing in your scene selected.

Zoom Extents All - Has the same effect as Zoom Extents except it zooms in all viewports.

Zoom Extents All Selected - Has the same effect as Zoom Extents Selected except it zooms in all viewports. The keyboard shortcut for this command is &lt;u&gt;&quot;z&quot;&lt;/u&gt;.

Field-of-View - Directly below Zoom. This allows you to zoom in and out of a viewport right on the center.

Region Zoom - Button accessed by changing from Field-of-View. Allows you to zoom in on a dragged selection area of a viewport.

Pan - Button with an image of a hand. Allows you to move your view of a viewport along the viewport's X and Y axis. The shortcut for this is dragging your mouse with the scroll wheel held down.

Arc Rotate - Allows you to rotate your view in a viewport so you can look at your scene from any angle. It is recommended that you only use this command in the Perspective viewport. The shortcut for this command is to hold &quot;shift&quot; while dragging the mouse with the scroll wheel held down. (Alt and scroller wheel down in version 8)

Min/Max Toggle - Clicking this button enlarges the active viewport to take up the entire area of all 4 viewports. This is useful for working on something small or crowded you want a very large view for. Click again to change it back to a 4-way view. The keyboard shortcut for this button is &lt;u&gt;&quot;alt+w&quot;&lt;/u&gt;.

For the purposes of this discussion, the following system of transliteration is used to represent the Sanskrit alphabet:

* a A i I u U R RR L LL &lt;br /&gt;

* e ai o au &lt;/br&gt;

* M [anusvAra] &lt;/br&gt;

* : [visarga]&lt;/br&gt;

* k kh g gh n; &lt;/br&gt;

* ch chh j jh n' &lt;/br&gt;

* T Th D Dh N &lt;/br&gt;

* t th d dh n &lt;/br&gt;

* p ph b bh m &lt;/br&gt;

* y r l v &lt;/br&gt;

* sh Sh s &lt;/br&gt;

* h &lt;/br&gt;


[Note that proper nouns are not capitalized in this system. The accent in words like ''jn'Ana'' can be readily omitted [= ''jnAna''], as likewise with ''an;ga'' [=''anga'']. The ungainly ''chchh'' can conveniently be written ''cch''.]

Sanskrit spelling is perfectly phonetic. At the same time, the pronunciation of many letters is affected when they come in contact with particular letters. For this reason, the perfectly phonetic spelling creates inconsistencies. 'Undoing' these inconsistencies is the first task of a translator.

=== ALPHABET ===
The Sanskrit alphabet contains 42 letters [''varNa''s]: 9 vowels [''svere''s] and 33 consonants [''vyanjana''s].

=== VOWELS ===
There are 5 simple svaras [''a i u R L''], and four diphthongs [''e ai o au''].

A vowel may be short [''hrasva''], long [''dIrgha''], or protracted [''pluta''], according to its length. The lengths are respectively 1, 2, and 3 beats [''mAtra''s]. Thus:
* SHORT: 
: a i u R L
* LONG: 
: A I U R e ai o au &lt;small&gt;[Note that the letter ''LL'' is merely hypothetical].[A short vowel is considered to be long in poetry when followed by more than one consonant, or by a final consonant.]&lt;/small&gt;
* PROTRACTED: 
: a3 A3 i3 I3 u3 U3 R3 RR3 L3 e3 ai3 o3 au3 
&lt;small&gt;[The plutas are encountered only in chant, or in a voice calling from a distance, or in echo].&lt;/small&gt;

NASALIZATION
Vowels may be sounded with or without nasalization [anunAsika or ananunAsika], as in French. Nasalization is indicated by the letter ''M'', a form called ''anusvAra''. 

ACCENT/TONE
Vedic Sanskrit also distinguishes tones of vowel, but these are disregarded in Classical Sanskrit. These tones or accents are: acute [''udAtta''], grave [''anudAtta''], and circumflex [''svarita''].

=== CONSONANTS [''vyanjanas''] ===
The 33 consonants are grouped, according to their articulation, as mutes [sparshas], intermediate semivowels [antasthas], and sibilants [Ushmans]. The sparshas are further grouped into five vargas, according to the site of articulation. Thus the vyan'janas are:
* [a] Mutes: [1] k kh g gh n; [guttural]; [2] ch chh j jh n' [palatal]; [3] T Th D Dh N [retroflex lingual or 'cerebral']; [4] t th d dh n [dental]; [5] p ph b bh m [labials]
* [b] Semivowels: y r l v
* [c] Sibilants: sh Sh s 
* [d] Sonant Aspirate: h.
   The first two letters in each of the 5 vargas [k kh ch chh &amp;c.] are called Surds or Hard Consonants. The other three in each varga are Sonants or Soft Consonants. 

=== VISARGA ===
''visarga'' is a sort of hard breathing that is badly pronounced by modern speakers. It is in fact a vestigial sound, like the letter ''s'' or ''r'' when the tongue does not quite contact the roof of the mouth--a whispered ''sh''. It never has the sound of ''ha'', a pronunciation which violates the meter of the verse in which it is read.

=== ASPIRATION ===
Consonants are with or without breath [mahAprANa or alpaprANa]. The 1st and 3d letters of each varga, together with the 5th [nasals], and the semivowels, are alpaprANa, the rest are mahAprANa. 

=== LOCUS [''sthAna''] ===
The vargas are based on the locus of articulation. The gutturals [kaNTha] are formed in the throat; the palatals [tAlu] on the palate; the linguals with the tongue on the roof of the mouth [mUrdhan]; the dentals on the teeth [danta]; and the labials on the lips [oShThau].

=== ELISION ===
The ''avagraha'' sign is used to mark the elision of ''a'', and is here indicated by a single apostrophe. The initial ''a-'' is elided after final ''-e'' or ''-o'', thus: ''te'' + ''api'' = ''te 'pi'', them too; ''kAla:'' + ''asti'' = ''kAlo'' + ''asti'' = ''kAlo 'sti'', it's time. When ''A'' follows ''A'' it is elided, and such elision may optionally be shown by the double ''avagraha'', thus: ''tathA'' + ''Aste'' = ''tathA &quot;ste'', or ''tathAste'', so be it. 

=== VOWEL WEIGHT ===
Vowels have three degrees of weight: &lt;tt&gt;Simple&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''guNa''&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;''vRddhi''&lt;/tt&gt;. For each of the vowels, these degrees are shown below:
: Simple: a / i, I / u, U / R, RR / L
: guNa: a / e / o / ar / al
: vRddhi: A / e / au / Ar / Al

Having these definitions in mind, we can proceed to the rules of '''''sandhi'''''.


[The following summary of the rules of sandhi is based on M.R. Kale’s grammar of 1894.]
The term &lt;tt&gt;sandhi&lt;/tt&gt; derives from ''sam'' ‘together’ and ''dhA'' ‘to join’. It indicates the coalescence of two letters on account of phonetic principles.
== &lt;tt&gt;sandhi&lt;/tt&gt; of vowels [svara-sandhi].
=== Simple Vowels ===
When a simple vowel, whether short or long, is followed by a similar simple vowel, short or long, the two vowels are replaced by the corresponding long vowel: for example:
* &lt;tt&gt;a + a = A&lt;/tt&gt;, ''daitya + ari: = daityAri:'', for of the children of Diti
* &lt;tt&gt;a + A = A&lt;/tt&gt;, ''atra + AsIt = atrAsIt'', here was
* &lt;tt&gt;A + a = A&lt;/tt&gt;, ''yadA + abhavat = yadAbhavat'', when he was
* &lt;tt&gt;A + A = A&lt;/tt&gt;, ''vidyA + Atura:'', eager for wisdom
* &lt;tt&gt;i + i = I&lt;/tt&gt;, ''iti + iva = itIva'', just so
* &lt;tt&gt;i + I = I&lt;/tt&gt;, ''api + IkShate =apIkShate'', indeed he wishes
* &lt;tt&gt;I + I = I&lt;/tt&gt;, ''shrI + Isha: = shrIsha:'', Shri's lord [Vishnu]
* &lt;tt&gt;u + u = U&lt;/tt&gt;, ''bhAnu + udaya: = bhAnUdaya:'', sunrise
* &lt;tt&gt;u + U = U&lt;/tt&gt;, ''sAdhu + Uchu: = sAdhUchu:'', they said well
* &lt;tt&gt;U + U = U&lt;/tt&gt;, ''chamU + Urja: = chamUrja:'', the strength of an army
* &lt;tt&gt;R + R = RR&lt;/tt&gt;, ''kartR + Rju: = kartRRju:'', doer of right
* &lt;tt&gt;R + RR = RR&lt;/tt&gt;, ''kR + RRkAra = kRRkAra:'', the letter ''RR'' with the root ''kR''
* &lt;tt&gt;R + L = RR&lt;/tt&gt;, ''hotR + LkAra: = hotRRkAra:'', the letter ''L'' as pronounced by the priest

When different simple vowels are combined, the corresponding &lt;tt&gt;''guNa''&lt;/tt&gt; letter replaces them, e.g.:
* &lt;tt&gt;a + i = e&lt;/tt&gt;, ''upa + indra: = upendra:'', Indra's younger brother [Vishnu]
* &lt;tt&gt;a + I = e&lt;/tt&gt;, ''parama + Ishvara: = parameshvara:'', the supreme Lord
* &lt;tt&gt;A + i = e&lt;/tt&gt;, ''ramA + ichchhA = ramechchhA'', the wish of the lady Rama
* &lt;tt&gt;A + I = e&lt;/tt&gt;, ''yathA + Ipsitam = yathepsitam'', as desired
* &lt;tt&gt;a + u = o&lt;/tt&gt;, ''hita + upadesha: = hitopadesha:'', friendly instruction
* &lt;tt&gt;a + U = o&lt;/tt&gt;, ''kRShNa + Uru: = kRShNoru:'', Krshna's thigh
* &lt;tt&gt;A + u = o&lt;/tt&gt;, ''gan;gA + udakam = gan;godakam'', Ganges water
* &lt;tt&gt;A + U = o&lt;/tt&gt;, ''mahA + Uru: = mahoru:'', great thigh [?]
* &lt;tt&gt;a + R = ar&lt;/tt&gt;, ''kRShNa + Rddhi: = kRShNarddhi:'', the prosperity of Krshna
* &lt;tt&gt;A + R = ar&lt;/tt&gt;, ''mahA + RShi: = maharShi:'', great sage
* &lt;tt&gt;a + L = al&lt;/tt&gt;, ''tava + LkAra: = tavalkAra:'', the 'L' you say

&lt;small&gt;Sometimes when similar consonants meet, one is optionally dropped in the process of &lt;tt&gt;''sandhi''&lt;/tt&gt;, e.g.: 
''kRShNa + Rddhi: = kRShNarddhi:'', or ''kRShNar + d + dh + i: = kRShNardhi:'', where the similar ''d'' is dropped. There is also a third form ''kRShnarddhi:'' [see below].

When any consonant of the five ''varga''s [except the palatal nasal ''n'''] follows a semivowel [''y r l v''], it is optionally doubled; so the above example ''tavalkAra:'' may also be ''tavalkkAra:'', ''tavallkAra:'', or even ''tavallkkAra:''&lt;/small&gt;

==== Exceptions: ====
* When a word ending in ''-a'' is followed by ''Uha''; or when ''pra'' is followed by ''Uha'', ''UDha'', or ''UDhi'', e.g.: ''praShTha'' + ''Uha:'' = ''praShThauha:'', chief guess; ''pra'' + ''Uha:'' = ''prauha:'', principal reasoning.
* ''akSha'' + ''UhinI'' = ''akShauhiNi'' [for the change from '''n''' to '''N''' see below].
* When ''sva'' is followed by ''Ir'' or ''Irin'' [from the root ''&gt;Ir'' to go], e.g.: ''sva'' + ''Ira:'' = ''svaira:'', a wilful person.
* When ''-a'' is followed by ''Rta'' with an Instrumental sense, e.g.: ''sukha'' + ''Rta:'' = ''sukhArta:'', blessed with happiness.
* Some compounds with ''-RNa'', e.g.: ''pra'' + ''RNam'' = ''prArNam'', principal debt; ''RNa'' + ''RNam'' = ''RNArNam'', a second mortgage.
* When a preposition ending in ''-a'' precedes a &gt; root beginning with ''R-'', as ''upa-'' + ''Rchchhati'' = ''upArchchhati''.

When ''a'' or ''A'' is followed by ''e'' or ''ai'' and ''o'' or ''au'', then ''ai'' and ''au'' are the substitutes, e.g.: ''kRShNa'' + ''ekatvam'' = ''kRShNaikatvam'', oneness with Krshna; ''deva'' + ''aishvaryam'' = ''devaishvaryam'', divine majesty; ''sA'' + ''eva'' = ''saiva'', she alone; ''bhava'' + ''auShadham'', medicine against reincarnation; ''vidyA'' + ''autsukyam'' = ''vidyautsukyam'', longing for wisdom.

==== Exceptions ====

* When a preposition ending in ''-a'' precedes a &gt;root beginning either ''e-'' or ''o-'', then ''e'' or ''o'' is the substitute, e.g.: ''pra'' + ''ejate'' = ''prejate'', quakes severely.

'''Colcannon''' is a rich mashed potato dish, with cabbage, butter and other ingredients.

This has always been a favorite in my house. It's very easy to make and is a nice change from ordinary mashed potatoes.  

== Irish Original ==
Colcannon is originally an Irish dish, a very rich and occasional treat. Its sloppiness is balanced by the crunch of the cabbage, and it should taste a little peppery.

===Ingredients===
* 450 g potatoes - floury Maris Piper or Golden Wonders are best; leave skin on if you want
* 150 ml single cream
* [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|Mace]]/ Paprika
* 450 g shredded cabbage - white or savoy
* 2 small leeks, or a bunch of spring onion tops, chopped
* 125 g unsalted butter
* 200 g mature Gouda cheese grated
* Salt and pepper

===Procedure===

# Boil or steam the potatoes, until soft, then shake the drained spuds in a deep pot with the lid on, until they crumble. Mash the crumbled potatoes up with a fork and season with the salt, pepper and mace/paprika, before stirring in the cream. Add 100g of the butter in pieces and put the lid back on, leaving the butter to melt, then stir. Transfer the mix to a clean bowl.
# Blanch the cabbage in boiling water for 2 minutes and drain. Fry the leeks/onion tops in the remaining butter for a few minutes, then add the cabbage and toss around for a few more minutes. Spoon the cabbage into the  bowl and mix with the mashed potatoes.
# Stir the gouda into the mix, leaving a little to coat the top, and put the bowl in an oven on 2/3 heat for 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted.

The Gouda is an innovation - leave it out, if you don't want the dish too rich. The oven heating is ideally done along with the final stage of your roast meat. Seasoning is very important: bear in mind that the cheese has plenty of salt. The perfect colcannon has a butter sogginess at the bottom of the bowl when removed from the oven.

==Variation==

'''Scottish Colcannon'''

This is from an old Scottish recipe still used frequently to this day.

* Equal amounts of cooked Potato and Cabbage.
* Butter.
* Salt and Pepper.

# Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a saucepan, allowing approximately one ounce to one pound vegetables. 
# Mix all the ingredients together, heat throughly and serve.

==Notes==

* The mixture may be turned into a greased pie-dish, sprinkled with grated cheese, dotted with butter or margarine, and browned in a hot oven.
* Is especially good with dark greens such as savoy cabbage or kale.

{{Formal Logic:TOCPageNav|up=Sentential Logic|prev=The Sentential Language|next=Informal Conventions}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Formal Syntax =

In [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/The Sentential Language | The Sentential Language]], we informally described our sentential language.  Here we give its formal syntax or grammar.  We will call our language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

== Vocabulary ==

* ''Sentence letters'':  Capital letters 'A' &amp;ndash; 'Z', each with (1) a superscript '0' and (2) a natural number subscript.  (The ''natural numbers'' are the set of positive integers and zero.)  Thus the sentence letters are:
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A^0_0},\ \mathrm{A^0_1},\ ...,\ \mathrm{B^0_0},\ \mathrm{B^0_1},\ ...,\ ...,\ \mathrm{Z^0_0},\ \mathrm{Z^0_1},\ ...\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* ''Sentential connectives'':
:: &lt;math&gt;\land,\ \lor,\ \lnot,\ \rightarrow,\ \leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* Grouping symbols:
:: &lt;math&gt;(,\ )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The superscripts on sentence letters are not important until we get to the predicate logic, so we won't really worry about those here.  The subscripts on sentence letters are to ensure an infinite supply of sentence letters.  On the next page, we will abbreviate away most superscripts and subscripts.

== Expressions ==

Any string of characters from the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; vocabulary is an ''expression'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Some expressions are grammatically correct.  Some are as incorrect in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as 'Over talks David Mary the' is in English.  Still other expressions are as hopelessly ill-formed in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as 'jmr.ovn asgj as;lnre' is in English.

We call a grammatically correct expression of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a well-formed formula.  When we get to Predicate Logic, we will find that only some well formed formulae are sentences.  For now though, we consider every well formed formula to be a sentence.

== Formation rules ==

An expression of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a ''well-formed formula'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is constructed according to the following rules.

: i. A sentence letter is a well-formed formula.

: ii. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are well-formed formulae, then so are each of:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii-a.}\ \ \lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii-b.}\ \ (\varphi \land \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii-c.}\ \ (\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii-d.}\ \ (\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{ii-e.}\ \ (\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In general, we will use 'formula' as shorthand for 'well-formed formula'.  Since all formulae in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are sentences, we will use 'formula' and 'sentence' interchangeably.

== Quoting convention ==

We will take expressions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to be self-quoting and so regard

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

to include implicit quotation marks.  However, something like

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad (\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

requires special consideration.  It is not itself an expression of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are not in the vocabulary of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Rather they are used as variables in English which range over expressions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Such a variable is called a ''metavariable'', and an expression using a mix of vocabulary from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and metavariables is called a ''metalogical expression''.  Suppose we let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Q^0_0} \lor \mathrm{R^0_0})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  Then (1) becomes

: &lt;math&gt;(\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow (\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is not what we want.  Instead we take (1) to mean (using explicit quotes):

: the expression consisting of &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;(\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; followed by &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; followed by &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; followed by &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; followed by &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;'&lt;/font&gt; .

Explicit quotes following this convention are called ''Quine quotes'' or ''corner quotes''.  Our corner quotes will be implicit.

== Additional terminology ==

We introduce (or, in some cases, repeat) some useful syntactic terminology.

* We distinguish between an expression (or a formula) and an ''occurrence'' of an expression (or formula).  The formula

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{P^0_0}) \land \lnot \mathrm{P^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is the same formula no matter how many times it is written.  However, it contains three occurrences of the sentence letter &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and two occurrences of the sentential connective &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a ''subformula'' of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both formulae and &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; contains an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a ''proper subformula'' of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; if and only if  (i) &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a subformula of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and (ii) &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not the same formula as &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* An ''atomic formula'' or ''atomic sentence'' is one consisting solely of a sentence letter.  Or put the other way around, it is a formula with no sentential connectives.  A ''molecular formula'' or ''molecular sentence'' is one which contains at least one occurrence sentential connective.

* The ''main connective'' of a molecular formula is the last occurrence of a connective added when the formula was constructed according to the rules above.

* A ''negation'' is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a formula.

* A ''conjunction'' is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \land \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both formulae.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both ''conjuncts''.

* A ''disjunction'' is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both formulae.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both ''disjuncts''.

* A ''conditional'' is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both formulae.  In this case, &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''antecedent'', and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''consequent''.  The ''converse'' of &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\psi \rightarrow \varphi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The ''contrapositive'' of &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(\lnot\psi \rightarrow \lnot\varphi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* A ''biconditional'' is a formula of the form &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both formulae.

== Examples ==

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad (\lnot(\mathrm{P^0_0} \lor \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{R^0_0} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q^0_0}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By rule (i), all sentence letters, including 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0},\ \mathrm{Q^0_0},\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{R^0_0}\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are formulae.  By rule (ii-a), then, the negation 

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{Q^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is also a formula.  Then by rules (ii-c) and (ii-b), we get the disjunction and conjunction 

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \lor \mathrm{Q^0_0}),\ \mbox{and}\ (\mathrm{R^0_0} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as formulae.  Applying rule (ii-a) again, we get the negation 

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\mathrm{P^0_0} \lor \mathrm{Q^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

as a formula.  Finally, rule (ii-c) generates the conditional of (1), so it too is a formula.


: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad ((\mathrm{P^0_0} \lnot \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \lor \mathrm{S^0_0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This appears to be generated by rule (ii-c) from

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \lnot \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}),\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{S^0_0}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The second of these is a formula by rule (i).  But what about the first?  It would have to be generated by rule (ii-b) from 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\lnot\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{Q^0_0}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\lnot\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

cannot be generated by rule (ii-a).  So (2) is not a formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creating an Island may sound like the work of science fiction but it can be possible, in a large enough scale you can achieve the requirement to form a micronation.

== Making an Island ==
Creating an island can be as simple as putting a chair in a 0.50m deep sea and calling it an island. Land reclamation projects tend to create bigger surfaces to stand on, which vary from square meters to even square kilometers. Before we start building an island, we need to consider what use it will have first. Here is a list of reasons why we might want to build an island: ''To have fun'', enjoying the sensation of standing on a surface which was previously only water. ''To grow crops'', which can save space and make use of the water. ''To recycle'', by collecting glass bottles, wooden crates and tin/aluminum/steel cans and make use of it. Building islands can indeed encourage recycling. (This should ''not'' include plastic. Do not use plastic in this process, as it will pollute!)

==Examples==
Famous land reclamation projects include the artificial islands in Dubai, which were built with dredgers loaded with sand and lots of complicated engineering, which is not necessarily what it takes to build an island. As seen on the TV show ''[[w:Ripley's Believe it or Not|Ripley's Believe it or Not]]'', in [[w:Mexico|Mexico]] a person happened to find a sum of broken discarded fishnets and combined them with empty bottled water containers and dirt, to create [[w:Spiral Island|Spiral Island]]. One major problem with this is that Mexico is or was trying to annex the island as a tourist site. Also, in [[w:Dubai|Dubai]], [[w:United Arab Emirates|UAE]], there is the construction  of [[w:Palm Islands|The Palm Islands]], which are three groups of man-made islands shaped like palm trees. A separate company is also constructing [[w:The World (archipelago)|The World]], named for its shape, which, when complete, will form a map of the world. Also, [[w:Kansai International Airport|Kansai International Airport]] in Osaka Bay is on a man-made island, as are [[w:Chubu Centrair International Airport|Chubu Centrair International Airport]] and [[w:Kobe Airport|Kobe Airport]]. In Tokyo Bay, [[w:Odaiba|Odaiba island]], which is an 19th century [[w:Artificial island|artificial island]], remains a popular tourist destination.  The [[w:Uros|Uros]] in Peru are a group of pre-[[w:Inca|Inca]] people living on man-made islands in [[w:Lake Titicaca|Lake Titicaca]].  The islands are fashioned out of totora reeds and anchored to the bottom of the lake with stakes attached to ropes.

One of the earlier modern artificial island built for the purpose to create a [[w:Micronation|micronation]], is the [[w:Republic of Minerva|Republic of Minerva]], built on the [[w:Minerva Reefs|Minerva Reefs]], though within months of declaring independence, [[w:Tonga|Tonga]] invaded. An earlier example is [[w:Republic of Rose Island|Republic of Rose Island]], which was, in a hostile manner, taken over and destroyed by Italy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One technique that maybe helpful as you inspire yourself around this adventure of organizing is to write your own book on organizing.  By writing your own personalized version of organizing you have a book specifically written for yourself.  Make it a work in progress.  You may want to start the book on your computer so you don't have to organize all of the hard copy.

      <comment>/* Rishi Sowa's Floating method */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page describes some of the possible methods for creating an island.

== Dumping Method ==
The easiest (and simplest) method is to import large quantities of rocks and soil into a shallow pool of water until the hill it forms breaks the surface.

===Advantages===

*Solid foundation
*Simple

===Disadvantages===

*Expensive
*Not movable
*Must be placed in shallow water (unless you have a REALLY huge amount of material)
*Expansion requires enough material to fill a volume from your extended surface to the sea floor i.e. 10 m^2 of extra land in 10 m of water will require at least 100 meters cubed of material.
*Erosion will be a problem without some way to hold the island together.

== Rishi Sowa's Floating method ==
Get broken fishnets from trash and fill with empty plastic bottles, tie to discarded wooden pallets, or bamboo lattice work. To make it larger you tie additional segments together. Cover the pallets or latticework on soil, plant mangroves and other salt tolerant plants. The roots will help stabilize the structure and provide nourishment. Further information available at http://www.spiralislanders.com/ .

===Advantages===

*Free
*Environmentally friendly

===Disadvantages===

*Vulnerable to violent storms (could sink)

== General Floating Island ==

===Advantages===

*Movable
*Can be placed anywhere
*If built as a set of modules then expansion is almost unlimited

===Disadvantages===

*No foundation for building
*Poor anchors will result in island drifting
*Storm damage may be more severe as center of gravity is much higher compared to a normal sea floor constructed island

== [[Wikipedia:Seacrete|Seacrete]] Method ==
This method utilizes electricity to cause minerals to be deposited onto a mesh of conductive wire. Over time it will form a substance similar in strength to concrete.

===Advantages===

*Construction is inexpensive. Cost is the price of the mesh foundation and the electricity required to deposit the seacrete.
*Massive structures can be built.
*Seacrete structures may become the basis of new reefs

===Disadvantages===

*Still poorly understood
*Will probably require shallow water
*Could take a long time

== Large Ship Method ==
Most expensive method compared to any listed above.  This method was depicted in the movie [[w:Waterworld|Waterworld]] and in the book [[w:Snowcrash|Snowcrash]] by Neal Stephenson as a place where people made a permanent residence on an abandoned large ship.  Snowcrash in particular makes mention of a large inter-connected city of lashed boats connected to a decommissioned aircraft carrier (the U.S.S. Nimitz in this case). With little propulsion it was forced to go with the flow of the sea currents using its engines to only keep away from the territorial waters of countries.

Also the Mindstar series of books by Peter F Hamilton (Mindstar Rising, A Quantum Murder and The Nano Flower) also describe the use of ships and large floating concrete structures in the middle of the Atlantic as a manufacturing facility and spaceport, using large OTEC generators to provide cheap electricity from the thermal difference between deep sea water and surface water.

===Advantages===

*May be used in deep sea oceans without anchorage being strictly necessary.
*Mobility of structure is possible, with even large power facilities available.
*Basic utilities and resources such as water purification, power generation, communications, and other basic requirements for survival are usually available and built-in to basic design of ship.
*Survival of major storms is possible, although deep sea natural phenomena are still not totally understood.
*May serve as &quot;anchor&quot; to a larger island complex using one or more of the above listed methods.
*Gives an &quot;instant start&quot; to any island structure, including basic life support and shelter.

===Disadvantages===

*Expensive
*Dragging around a &quot;flotilla&quot; of other island structures (like many of those listed above besides this method) may prove difficult at best.
*Sovereignty claims may be made on the original vessel.  Most major ships are usually &quot;flagged&quot; to a specific nation-state, although there are &quot;flags of convince&quot; to many vessels, and it may be possible to find a &quot;stateless&quot; vessel.
*Any abandoned or decommissioned ship may have significant structural damage, including saltwater corrosion, damaged components, or genuine antique facilities with no spare parts.  This may require knowledge of a machine shop to maintain to build custom tools.

== Pikecrete/Pykrete Method ==
Please refer to materials section for explanation.  [[w:Pykrete|Pykrete]] is a very potent material, but as of yet it has not been used, by any nation. Only small scale use by individuals, no nation has built anything with it.

[[w:Pykrete|Pikecrete]] can serve as an extremely strong island material, it has the same strength as concrete but it floats.  It can be used to hold a foundation until a permanent location is found.  Alternately, if you would like to roam, just make a mold of a vessel and then pour it onto the mold with a flat top as a foundation.  It could also potentially serve as a boxing fence to pour in dirt or sand to form an island.

===Advantages===

*Inexpensive
*Weather-resistant
*Good for short-term use
*Can be applied to the entire construction from sea-bed to above-sea level

===Disadvantages===

*Will eventually melt unless continuously cooled
*Using it to construct an entire island can be expensive as a barge with dirt or other, ''terra-firma'' materials are needed and can be costly
*Production of a mold is necessary
*Subsequent freezing or refreezing can be costly as well

Note: It may be possible to use these disadvantages as advantages. It should be possible to build a vessel from pykrete and use it to transport raw materials ''en-masse'' to the site and then use them.  No costly ship to return and this would also be biodegradable.

== Volcano Method ==
Many islands have been formed as the result of undersea volcanic activity - the Hawaiian Islands are an example. A volcano is simply a point where the molten rock has squeezed through a fissure leading to the surface of the earth. If an appropriate point can be found where a volcano can be stimulated by drilling or placement of explosive on the ocean floor, a subsequent eruption may form a cone of lava that reaches above the surface of the water.

===Advantages===

*Creates a sturdy and solid landform; weathering will eventually turn the igneous rock surface into fertile soil.

===Disadvantages===

*Immensely expensive and disruptive to the local ecology
*No technology exists to stabilize a volcano once one has been formed
*Location would be dictated by existing geological structures
*Would take an extremely long time

==Sand Build-up Method==
All you need is water (estuaries/pool of water) and  sand/loam (If built in estuaries a lot). First,Dump sand/loam into the water. Then,When it reaches the sea level carve it with your hands. Do it again and again until it stands on its own.

===Advantages===
*Sturdy if put with plants
*Can be placed with plants
*If with loam then its can be placed with plants
*Expansion might be unlimited
*Can be sturdy
*Habitable (if in estuaries)
*Kid-Friendly (Can be used in school , Can widen children's imagination)
*Closely related with Dumping Method

===Disadvantages===
*Expensive (If in estuaries)
*Might sink(If in estuaries)
*Too small (if in pool of water)
*Might be impossible (if in estuaries)

*[[Radiation_Oncology/Nephroblastoma/Randomized|Link to Level I Evidence]]


==Epidemiology==
*450-650 new cases per year in North America
*75% cases &lt; 5y, Median age is 3-4 for unilateral and 2.5y for bilateral
*~90% are unifocal/solitary, ~12% multifocal (unilateral), ~7% are bilateral
*Black children more than white
*Females more than males
* 4th most common pediatric cancer 
* Most common renal malignancy
* 90% are favorable histology
* General prognosis has improved from high mortality in early 1900s to current cure rate of &gt;90%

==Genetics==

*1p &amp; 16q Loss of heterozygosity. increased risk for relapse and death in NWTS-5. Grundy, JCO 2005 (PMID: 16129848)

==Presentation==
*Healthy appearing child with abdominal swelling (remember, Wilms = Well, Neuroblastoma = Not well).
*Smooth nontender mass
*Gross hematuria ~25% cases
*Sometimes hypertension
*Calcifications in ~5-10% (compare with ~60-70% of neuroblastoma)
*Most common site of metastases: lymph nodes, liver, lungs
*Unifocal (one kidney) in ~82%
*Multifocal (one kidney) in ~12%
**Requires observation of contralateral kidney (nephrogenic rests)
*Bilateral in ~6%

==Staging==
'''New COG Staging System (AREN0532):'''
* Stage I - Tumor limited to kidney, completely resected. The renal capsule is intact. The tumor was not ruptured or biopsied prior to removal. The vessels of the renal sinus are not involved. There is no evidence of tumor at or beyond the margins of resection. NOTE: For a tumor to qualify for certain therapeutic protocols as Stage I, regional lymph nodes must be examined microscopically.
* Stage II - The tumor is completely resected and there is no evidence of tumor at or beyond the margins of resection. The tumor extends beyond kidney, as is evidenced by any one of the following criteria: 
** There is regional extension of the tumor (i.e. penetration of the renal capsule, or extensive invasion of the soft tissue of the renal sinus, as discussed below)
** Blood vessels within the nephrectomy specimen outside the renal parenchyma, including those of the renal sinus, contain tumor.
** '''Note: Rupture of spillage confined to the flank, including biopsy of the tumor, is no longer included in Stage II and is now included in Stage III.'''
* Stage III - Residual non-hematogenous tumor present following surgery, and confined to abdomen. Any one of the following may occur:
** Lymph nodes within the abdomen or pelvis are involved by tumor. (Lymph node involvement in the thorax, or other extra-abdominal sites is a criterion for Stage IV)
** The tumor has penetrated through the peritoneal surface
** Tumor implants are found on the peritoneal surface
** Gross or microscopic tumor remains post-operatively (e.g., tumor cells are found at the margin of surgical resection on microscopic examination)
** The tumor is not completely resectable because of local infiltration into vital structures
** Tumor spillage occurring either before or during surgery
** The tumor is treated with preoperative chemotherapy (with or without a biopsy regardless of type- tru-cut, open or fine needle aspiration) before removal
** Tumor is removed in greater than one piece (e.g. tumor cells are found in a separately excised adrenal gland; a tumor thrombus within the renal vein is removed separately from the nephrectomy specimen). Extension of the primary tumor within vena cava into thoracic vena cava and heart is considered Stage III, rather than Stage IV even though outside the abdomen.
* Stage IV - Hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, brain, etc.), or lymph node metastases outside the abdomino-pelvic region are present. (The presence of tumor within the adrenal gland is not interpreted as metastasis and staging depends on all other staging parameters present).
* Stage V - Bilateral renal involvement by tumor is present at diagnosis. An attempt should be made to stage each side according to the above criteria on the basis of the extent of disease.




'''National Wilms Tumor Study 5 Staging System:'''
*Stage I - Tumor limited to kidney and completely excised. No penetration of the renal capsule or involvement of renal sinus vessels. 
*Stage II - Tumor extends beyond the kidney but is completely excised with negative margins and lymph nodes. At least one of the following has occurred: 
**(a) penetration of the renal capsule 
**(b) invasion of the renal sinus vessels 
**(c) spillage of tumor &lt;u&gt;locally&lt;/u&gt; during removal 
*Stage III - Gross or microscopic residual tumor remains postoperatively, including inoperable tumor, positive surgical margins, &lt;u&gt;diffuse&lt;/u&gt; tumor spillage involving peritoneal surfaces, regional lymph node metastasis, or transected tumor thrombus. Biopsy before resection.
*Stage IV - Hematogenous metastasis (lung, liver, bone, brain) or lymph node metastasis outside the abdominal or pelvic cavities. 
*Stage V - Bilateral renal tumors at diagnosis.

==Pathology==
*Reflects development of normal kidney, containing 3 components: blastemal, epithelial, and stromal elements
*Prognostically divided into favorable histology (FH) and unfavorable histology (UH)
*Favorable histology is present in ~90%
*Unfavorable histology includes anaplasia, and two further varieties no longer considered WT: Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK)
*Anaplasia (~5%) may be focal (FA) or diffuse (DA), and reflects distribution of anaplastic cells within the tumor
*CCSK (~4%) tends to metastasize to bone and brain (need to do bone scan and brain MRI)
*RTK (~1%) is the most aggressive; it may have [[Radiation_Oncology/Peds/CNS_PNET|CNS PNET]] associated with it


==Treatment Overview==
*National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) consortium was established in 1969 to more rigorously evaluate treatment strategies, given the rarity of the condition. The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) began running trials in parallel in Europe in 1991
*The treatment strategies diverged, after the first SIOP trial, SIOP-1 showed benefit for neoadjuvant RT over adjuvant RT. SIOP has since then been using neoadjuvant therapy, followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy. In the US, NWTS continues to perform surgery first, and optimize adjuvant therapy.
*NWTS 1 showed that adjuvant RT is not necessary for young patients (&lt;2 years) in Group I (tumor limited to kidney and completely resected) if they are treated with Actinomycin D x15 months. RT dose for the rest was age-adjusted, topping out at 40 Gy
*NWTS 2 showed that adjuvant RT is not necessary even in older patients (&gt;2 years) in Group I, as long as they get Actinomycin D and vincristine. For the rest, same age-adjusted doses were used as NWTS 1
*By this time, NWTS determined that different histologies have different prognosis. Favorable Histology (FH) included tumors with no anaplasia; Unfavorable Histology (UF) included tumors with anaplasia, as well as clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK). CCKS and RTK were excluded from NWTS 3 onward.
*NWTS 3 showed that RT can also be eliminated from Stage II, and that dose can be reduced from as much as 40 Gy to 10 Gy in Stage III. Dose-adjusted RT was no longer necessary
**Stage III 10Gy with 3-drug chemo (added adriamycin), or 20Gy with two drugs
*Post-hoc analysis from NWTS 1-3 showed that delay in RT &gt;10 days after surgery was associated with worse outcomes
*NWTS 4 didn't ask any RT questions; it attempted to optimize chemo delivery
**Also failed to verufy need to begin RT within 10 days
*NWTS 5 showed that loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 1p and 16q was associated with significantly worse DFS and OS
*Meanwhile, in Europe SIOP-5 showed that neoadjuvant chemo doublet is comparable to neoadjuvant RT with Actinomycin D; neoadjuvant chemo become the standard
*SIOP-6 began a risk-adapted strategy. No RT was used for Stage I patients
*SIOP-9 revealed that a short course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is comparable to a long course; adjuvant RT was 15 Gy
*Finally, SIOP 93-01 demonstrated that in intermediate risk patients, short adjuvant chemo is comparable to long adjuvant chemo. 
*The British were historically following the NWTS protocols, but in 1991 decided to compare the NWTS and the SIOP approach directly. A randomized trial showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy downstaged significant number of patients, and allowed 20% children to avoid potentially toxic RT or doxorubicin, with same EFS and OS
*Editorial in JCO 2008 (PMID 18757319) provides a nice perspective on the two differing approaches (pre-op vs post-op therapy)
*In the US, Childrens Oncology Group (COG) is now managing clinical trials for Wilms
**Surgery is the primary approach
**Chemotherapy plays a critical role 
*US RT Guidelines
**RT not necessary for Stage I
**RT not necessary for Stage II, if adequate chemotherapy (vincristine/dactinomycin) given
**Risk adapted dose as below; please see COG protocol for risk definitions
**RT start by day 9, FH at latest by day 14
**Care must be given to irradiate vertebral column uniformly to limit scoliosis
**Historically, pulmonary mets seen on CXR were treated with whole-lung RT 12 Gy; whether presumed mets seen on CT should be treated is controversial, since only 69% of multiple pulmonary lesions were tumor on bipsy

==Specific Situations==
===NWTS Flank recurrence===
*'''NWTS Flank recurrence; 2006''' PMID 16542795 -- &quot;Radiation therapy for favorable histology Wilms tumor: prevention of flank recurrence did not improve survival on National Wilms Tumor Studies 3 and 4.&quot; (Breslow NE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):203-9.)
**NWTS Subset analysis. Stage I-IV FH, enrolled on NWTS-3 and NWTS-4. 
**Recurrence: In flank 20 Gy 0%, 10 Gy 1.5%, no RT 1.8 % (SS); intra-abdominal 1.0%, 3.7%, 2.4% (SS). Composite flank NWTS-3 risk 1.0% increased to NWTS-4 (no 20 Gy RT) 2.1%, but EFS was unchanged 86% vs. 88% (NS), and OS was better 91% vs. 94% (SS)
**Conclusion: Due to lower post-recurrence mortality with more intense chemo, prevention of flank recurrence by RT did not improve survival
*'''Tumor spillage; 2010''' (1979-1994) PMID 19395185 -- &quot;Intraoperative spillage of favorable histology wilms tumor cells: influence of irradiation and chemotherapy regimens on abdominal recurrence. A report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.&quot; (Kalapurakal JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Jan 1;76(1):201-6.)
**NWTS subset analysis. 450 patients, surgical tumor spillage (20% of total). Stage II-IV FH, enrolled on NWTS-3 and NWTS-4. Influence of tumor dose evaluated: NWTS-3 Stage II no RT vs RT 20 Gy to flank (1cm margin on involved kidney, cross midline), Stage III RT 10 Gy vs RT 20 Gy, Stage IV RT 20 Gy to tumor bed. NWTS-4 Stage II no RT, Stage III-IV RT 10 Gy or whole abdomen 10 Gy. If diffuse tumor spillage, WART 10 Gy or 20 Gy on NWTS-3 and 10 Gy on NWTS-4. Considered two types of failure, at flank and beyond-flank
**Outcome: Recurrent disease in abdomen in 7% overall; flank in 61%. Flank relapse no RT 12% vs RT 10 Gy 3% vs RT 20 Gy 0% (SS). Beyond-flank relapse 6% vs 3% vs 3%. Stage II unirradiated patients treated with 2-drug regimen 8-year RFS spillage- 87% vs spillage+ 79% (NS), 8-year OS 95% vs 90% (SS).
**Conclusion: RT reduced abdominal tumor recurrence after tumor spillage


===Anaplastic Histology===
*'''NWTS Subset; 2006''' PMID 16710034 -- &quot;Treatment of anaplastic histology Wilms' tumor: results from the fifth National Wilms' Tumor Study.&quot; (Dome JS, J Clin Oncol. 2006 May 20;24(15):2352-8.)
**Subset analysis, 281 patients with anaplastic histology (11%). Stage I treatement AMD + VCR x4.5 months. Stage II-IV RT + VCR + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide + etoposide x6 months
**4-year Outcome: OS Stage I 83%, Stage II 83%, Stage III 65%, Stage IV 33%, bilateral 44%; compared with Stage I favorable histology 98%
**Conclusion: Novel strategies needed to improve outcomes for patients with AH


===Bilateral Wilms' Tumor===
*'''NWTS experience''' (1974-86) - PMID 1650403, 1991 &amp;mdash; &quot;Extended followup of bilateral Wilms tumor: results of the National Wilms Tumor Study.&quot; Montgomery BT et al. J Urol. 1991 Aug;146(2 ( Pt 2)):514-8.
**185 pts from NWTS 2 and NWTS 3 who were registered but not eligible for randomization. 
**Overall outcome is good, with 90% survival at 5 and 10 yrs. Worse outcome with surgical substage III or IV disease and unfavorable histology. No difference in survival for initial tumor resection vs initial biopsy.


===Adults===
*'''SIOP 93-01 Subset''' PMID 15542800 -- &quot;Wilms' tumor in adults: results of the Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 93-01/Society for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) Study.&quot; (Reinhard H, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Nov 15;22(22):4500-6.)
**Subset analysis. 30 patients &gt;16 years treated according to pediatric protocol. Predominance of higher stages, 33% Stage IV. 2/30 showed nephroblastoma and renal cell carcinoma in the same kidney. Mean F/U 4 years
**Outcome: 4-year EFS 57%, OS 83%
**Conclusion: Adults can be cured in high percentage by pediatric protocols. Toxicity higher but acceptable

==NWTS Trials==
*'''NWTS 5''' (1995-2002) - Prospective risk-adapated therapy 
**Prospective non-randomized study. 2387 patients. Risk-adapted treatment attempting to reduce toxicity for low risk patients, and intensify treatment for high risk patients. Evaluation of loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1p and 16q. RT depending on risk: none, 10.8 Gy to flank, and possibly 10.8 Gy boost to residual disease, 12 Gy to whole lung
**'''2005''' PMID 16129848 -- &quot;Loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 1p and 16q is an adverse prognostic factor in favorable-histology Wilms tumor: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.&quot; (Grundy PE, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 10;23(29):7312-21.)
***2021 children assayed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 16q
***Outcome: Risk for relapse 1p 1.56 (SS), 16q 1.49 (SS); risk of death 1p 1.84 (SS), 16q 1.44 (NS). For Stage I-II, worse outcome for either 1p or 16q; for Stage III-IV, worse outcome only if LOH of both regions
***Conclusion: LOH for 1p and/or 16q identifies subset of favorable histology who have significantly increased risk of relapse and death

*'''NWTS 4''' (1986-94) -- no RT randomizations; chemo randomizations
**Randomized. 1638 patients. Compared standard schedule (STD) of AMD + ADR vs pulse-intensive (PI), and short (5-6 months) vs long courses (15-16 months)
***Stage I, FH or anaplastic: AMD + VCR, STD vs PI
***Stage II, FH: 2x2 design: AMD + VCR, STD vs. PI, and short vs long 
***High risk (FH Stage III-IV or CCSK): 2x2 design: AMD + VCR + ADR STD vs PI, and short vs long  
**'''2-years 1998''' PMID 9440748 &amp;mdash; &quot;Comparison between single-dose and divided-dose administration of dactinomycin and doxorubicin for patients with Wilms' tumor: a report from the National Wilms' Tumor Study Group.&quot; (Green DM et al. J Clin Oncol. 1998 Jan;16(1):237-45.)
***Fractionation outcome: RFS for STD 91% vs. PI 91% (NS)
***Conclusion: Pulse-intense chemothereapy equivalent to standard fractionated chemotherapy, less toxic, and logistically much easier

*'''NWTS 3''' (1979-1985) -- High dose RT vs. low dose RT; low dose RT vs. no RT
**Randomized. 1439 patients. Treatment adapted by Stage and histology; FH in 90%, anaplastic 4%, CCSK 4%, RTK 2%. 2x2 design for Stage II and III. RT given in 1.8 Gy/fx, large fields 1.5 Gy/fx. Evaluated RT dose and chemo intensity
***Stage I, FH: No RT. AMD + VCR x 10 weeks vs 6 months.
***Stage II, FH: No RT vs 20 Gy. AMD+VCR+ADR vs intensive AMD+VCR, both for 15 months. 
***Stage III, FH: RT 10 Gy vs 20 Gy. AMD+VCR+ADR vs intensive AMD+VCR, both for 15 months.
***Stage IV and All UH: RT per NWTS 2 followed by AMD+VCR+ADR vs AMD+VCR+ADR+ cyclophosphamide, both for 15 months.
**'''4-years: 1989''' PMID 2544249 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of Wilms' tumor. Results of the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study.&quot; (D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1989 Jul 15;64(2):349-60.)
***Stage I FH Outcome: RFS 10 weeks 89% vs. 6 months 91% (NS)
***Stage II FH Outcome: No difference between no RT and RT 20 Gy. Also no difference between chemo regimens
***Stage III, FH Outcome: No difference between RT 10 Gy and RT 20 Gy. Also no difference between chemo regimens
***Stage IV and UH Outcome: Cyclophosphamide didn't improve outcomes
***RT Conclusion: Stage II FH doesn't require RT; Stage III FH RT 10 Gy sufficient with doublet chemotherapy

*'''NWTS 2''' (1974-78)
**Randomized. 513 patients. Surgery first. RT within 10 days of surgery, same dose schedule as NWTS 1. If pulmonary mets, 12 Gy whole thorax (had toxicity at 14 Gy); if liver/brain mets 30 Gy
***Group I (35%): Actinomycin D + vincristine x6 months, then Arm 1) observation vs. Arm 2) additional 9 months of chemo. No RT for anyone, assume addition of VCR in age &gt;2 will obviate need for adjuvant RT, and compare to historical outcomes
***Group II-IV: RT everyone, then Arm 1) Actinomycin D + vincristine vs. Arm 2) Actinomycin + vincristine + doxorubicin. Total 15 months both arms
**'''2-years; 1981''' PMID 6164480 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of Wilms' tumor: results of the Second National Wilms' Tumor Study.&quot; D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1981 May 1;47(9):2302-11.
***Group I Outcome: No difference in RFS or OS between arms. Age &gt;2 2-year OS comparison: NWTS2 (AMD+VCR, no RT) 89% vs. NWTS1 (AMD+RT) 77% vs. NWTS1 (AMD, no RT) 51%. Abdominal relapse &lt;5%
***Group II-IV Outcome: DFS AMD + VCR 62% vs. AMD + VCR + doxorubicin 77% (SS)
***RT Conclusion: RT not necessary in Group I with chemo doublet

*'''NWTS 1''' (1969-74) -- Group I Adjuvant RT vs. adjuvant chemo
**Randomized. 259 patients. Surgery first. RT given within 2 days of surgery. Dose 0-18 months 18-24 Gy, 18-30 months 24-30 Gy, 30-40 months 30-35 Gy, &gt;40 months 35-40 Gy. Fields: Group I/II flank, Group III whole abdomen
***Group I (n=163): Arm 1) RT + Actinomycin D vs. Arm 2) Actinomycin D only
***Group II/III (n=100): Surgery + RT and Arm 1) Actinomycin D vs. Arm 2) Vincristine vs. Arm 3) Actinomycin D + Vincristine
***Group IV (n=26): Arm 1) Surgery + RT + adjuvant chemo vs. Arm 2) Neoadjuvant vincristine + surgery + RT + adjuvant chemo
**'''2-years; 1976''' PMID 184912, 1976 &amp;mdash; &quot;The treatment of Wilms' tumor: Results of the national Wilms' tumor study.&quot; D'Angio GJ et al. Cancer. 1976 Aug;38(2):633-46.
***Group I Outcome: Age &lt;2 years: RT 90% vs. no RT 88% (NS); age &gt;2 years RT 77% vs. 58% (SS). More infradiaphragmatic failures without RT, leading to worse survival
***Group II/III Outcome: Actinomycin D 57% vs. Vincristine 55% vs. Combination 81% (SS)
***RT Conclusion: Adjuvant RT not necessary for Group I patients &lt;2 years treating with Actinomycin D, but important for patients &gt;2 years.

***Conclusion: 4-week neoadjuvant chemo should be standard

*'''SIOP-6''' (1980-1987) -- Risk adapted randomization
**Randomized. 509 patients. Risk adaptive therapy. Neoadjuvant chemo (AMD+VCR), surgery, then assigned based on stage, LN involvement.
***Stage I: 4 months (short) vs. 9 months (long) adjuvant chemo
***Stage II LN0: adjuvant RT 20 Gy vs. no RT (''Stopped prematurely due to high failures in no RT arm''
***Stage II LN+/Stage III: intensified VCR + AMD vs. VCR + AMD + doxorubicin. RT 30 Gy + 5 Gy boost dose to residual disease
**'''5-years; 1993''' PMID 8388918 -- &quot;Results of the Sixth International Society of Pediatric Oncology Wilms' Tumor Trial and Study: a risk-adapted therapeutic approach in Wilms' tumor.&quot; (Tournade MF, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jun;11(6):1014-23.)
***Outcome: 2-year DFS and 5-year OS
****Stage I: DFS short 92% vs. long 88% (NS); OS 95% vs. 92% (NS)
****Stage II LN0: DFS RT+ 72% vs. RT- 78%; OS 88% vs. 855 (NS) - (trial stopped early in favor of RT+, due to first year 6 consecutive failures in RT- arm vs none in RT+ arm)
****Stage II LN+/III: DFS VCR+AMD 49% vs. VCR+AMD+doxorubicin 74% (SS); OS 77% vs. 80% (NS)
***Conclusion: Risk-adapted therapy possible. Continued RT or more chemo necessary for LN+

*'''SIOP-5''' (1977-1979) -- neoadjuvant chemo vs. chemo-RT
**Randomized. 164 patients. Arm 1) Preop RT 20 Gy + concurrent Actinomycin D then surgery then post-op RT 15 Gy vs. Arm 2) Pre-op Actinomycin D + vincristine then surgery then post-op RT 30 Gy. Both arms maintenance Actinomycin D + vincristine. Primary criterion was effectiveness of pre-op therapy on surgical outcome
**'''4-years; 1983''' PMID 6321673 -- &quot;Effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy in Wilms' tumor: results of an International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) clinical trial.&quot; (Lemerle J, J Clin Oncol. 1983 Oct;1(10):604-9.)
***Outcome: No difference in tumor size or intra-op tumor rupture; chemo resulted in less necrosis and tumor histology distortion. 4-year RFS chemo 76% vs. chemo-RT 69% (NS), OS chemo 89 vs. chemo-RT 83% (NS). No difference in failure patterns
***Downstaging: 43% of patients were Stage yI at surgery, and thus may not need post-op RT
***Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemo alone comparable to neoadjuvant chemo-RT

*'''SIOP-2''' (1974-1976)
**Prospective nonrandomized. 52 patients with small tumors had primary surgery, 86 patients had pre-op RT. Results described in PMID 6321673
**Outcome: tumor rupture pre-op RT 5% vs. surgery first 20% (SS)
**Conclusion: confirmed results of SIOP 1

*'''SIOP-1''' (1971-1974) -- Pre-op vs. Post-op RT
**Randomized. 195 patients. 2x2 design. Arm 1) Pre-op RT 20 Gy + surgery + post-op RT (Stage I none, Stage II-III 15 Gy) vs. Arm 2) post-op RT (Stage I 20 Gy, Stage II-III 30 Gy). ''Post-op RT arm ended prematurely due to worse outcome.'' Actinomycin D single course vs. 15 months
**'''1976''' PMID 184913 -- &quot;Preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy, single versus multiple courses of actinomycin D, in the treatment of Wilms' tumor. Preliminary results of a controlled clinical trial conducted by the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (S.I.O.P.).&quot; (Lemerle J, Cancer. 1976 Aug;38(2):647-54.)
***RT outcome: Tumor rupture during surgery pre-op RT 4% vs. post-op RT 31% (SS). No difference in RFS or OS. Post-op arm stopped, because massive tumor rupture in 11 patients during surgery necessitated upstaging and whole-abdomen RT
***Chemo outcome: No difference between single course and multiple courses
***Conclusion: Pre-op RT superior, as it leads to less tumor rupture during surgery


==UK CCSG==
*'''UKW3''' (1991-2001)
**Randomized. 205 patients with renal tumors. Arm 1) immediate surgery vs. Arm 2) biopsy, then 6 weeks preoperative chemotherapy (AMD+VCR) followed by surgery. Both groups received risk-adjusted post-op therapy. Post-op RT FH 20 Gy, UH 30 Gy. Wilms confirmed in 91%, CCSK 4%.
**'''2006''' PMID 16904312 -- &quot;Immediate nephrectomy versus preoperative chemotherapy in the management of non-metastatic Wilms' tumour: results of a randomised trial (UKW3) by the UK Children's Cancer Study Group.&quot; (Mitchell C, Eur J Cancer. 2006 Oct;42(15):2554-62.)
***Stage distribution: surgery vs. chemo Stage I 65% vs. 54%, Stage II 24% vs. 15%, Stage III 10% vs. 30%, (SS). This resulted in 20% fewer children receiving RT or doxorubicin
***Outcome: 5-year EFS both groups 80% (NS), OS both groups 89% (NS)
***Conclusion: Neoajduvant chemotherapy shifts patients to better stage, and hence reduction in adjuvant therapy</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Plants are the most important part of a floating island as it will be extremely prone to erosion. You will have to make sure the plants you put on the island can grow in whatever environment you chose to put the island in. If you build your island in saltwater, you might need to use plants that can survive in environments that are rich in salt, such as mangrove trees. If you are growing plants that are not resistant to salt water, you need to make sure that the soil in which the plants are growing has no contact with the subterranean sea water. You might want to cover the bottom of the surface which is supporting the soil with either concrete or wooden boards.

Additionally, the roots of plants will add support and strength to the soil. Grass might be a good plant to start with, which will also improve the aesthetic condition of the island.

== Overview ==

The first book in the Harry Potter series, '''''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''''' (or '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''''' in the US) is written from the point-of-view of the 11-year-old Harry Potter. While its prime audience is children aged 8 to about 11, the story has enough depth to make it a satisfying, if short, read for even teen-aged and adult readers, and the characters show realistic development over the course of the book, and the entire series.

This book was published with different titles in the UK and in the US. In the UK, and in most other English-language editions, it was titled, ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. Apparently the U.S. publisher felt that its younger American audience would lack sufficient background in classical mythology to know what the Philosopher's Stone was, and so re-titled the book, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''. While many fan sites, mostly in the US, have chosen the latter title, and the film and video games have done likewise, this book uses the UK title as being closer to the author's intent. This is the only book in the series with any difference in the title.

== Overview ==

The second book in the Harry Potter series, '''''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''''' is written from the point-of-view of the now-12-year-old Harry Potter. The book's title refers to a chamber which was, according to legend, created somewhere in Hogwarts castle by one of the founders, Salazar Slytherin, when he departed Hogwarts; much of the book's action revolves around that chamber, and what may be inside it, if, in fact, it actually exists.

In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', we begin to see the darker side of the wizarding world that we were introduced to in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. In this story, Harry is not seen only as The Boy Who Lived by his fellow students, but instead as a suspect, as many believe him to be the heir of Slytherin, and thus the force behind attacks on students in the school. Further darkening the atmosphere is the history of Hogwarts itself, including some highlights of arguments between the Founders. We find that while Hogwarts has become, in a way, Harry's new home, his safety is not assured there, as this new threat comes from within the castle itself.

== Overview ==

The fourth book in the Harry Potter series, '''''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''''' is told from the viewpoint of the now 14-year-old [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]. Apart from the usual magic, events at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], and frustration of the Dursleys, it includes a visit to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], and an ancient tournament that, after a hiatus of over a century, is being restarted at Hogwarts School. Darker and more mature than the preceding entries in the series, this book again shows us Harry maturing and gaining strength in preparation to fight the gathering darkness.

While this book is rather daunting in appearance at 636 pages (Bloomsbury / Raincoast edition), it is set in larger type than the previous three volumes. If set in the same type as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], it would be 487 pages (approximately) to 223 for ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.

== Book Highlights ==

== Overview ==

The fifth book in the Harry Potter series, '''''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''''' is told from the viewpoint of the now fifteen-year-old Harry. 

This is possibly the darkest book in the Harry Potter series. Surprisingly, perhaps, it is not the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and his Death Eaters that give this book its power, for in fact they do very little during this year. Its grimness is the multiplicity of enemies facing Harry, as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], headed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], has also set itself against Harry and Dumbledore. Additionally, Harry must deal with a new nemesis and possibly the series' most hated character, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], a petty Ministry bureaucrat.

Apart from the usual magic, events at Hogwarts School, and the frustrating Dursleys, this book includes the resurrection of the Order of the Phoenix, a group dedicated to Lord Voldemort's downfall, and Voldemort openly returning. Darker and more mature than the preceding entries in the series, this book shows Harry coping with loss and dealing with adversity, while growing in maturity and ability.

While the book appears daunting at 766 pages (Bloomsbury / Raincoast edition), it is set in somewhat larger type than the first three volumes. If set in the same type as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], it would be 655 pages (approximately) to 223 for ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. At this, though, it is still the largest of the seven volumes.

== Overview ==

We join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] as he enters his sixth year at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. This volume is written from the point-of-view of the now 16-year-old Harry, as he takes advanced courses to prepare for the NEWT-level exams required for his chosen career. A darker book than the preceding volumes, it reveals more about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort's]] history and his impact on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] world. Voldemort has emerged into the open, and his presence is beginning to have an effect on the day-to-day life of the Wizarding world.

While the series progressively covers seven years in Harry Potter's life, each of the first five volumes is largely self-contained. This book is written more as the first half of a two-part novel, and, as such, the ending feels rather incomplete.

Note: While this book is one of the longer ones in the series, at 607 pages (Bloomsbury / Raincoast edition), it is also set in significantly larger type. If it were the same size type as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], it would be 414 pages (approximately) to 223 for ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mimas.jpg|right|220px|Mimas from Cassin-Huygens]]
Mimas is one of the moons of Saturn. 

==How big is Mimas?==
Mimas is 397.2 km wide (246 miles).  It is egg shaped because Saturn and the other moons stretch it with their gravity.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Mimas is covered with craters, the largest being Herschel, which was named after William Herschel, the person who discovered Mimas.  This crater is about one-third of Mimas' width.  It is 5 km (3 miles) high, 10 km (6 miles) deep, and its peak is 6km (4 miles) above the crater floor.  Mimas and Rhea, another of Saturn's moons, have been called the most heavily cratered bodies in the Solar System.

Mimas also has many '''chasmata'''(chasms), which are long, narrow, steep-sided depressions on the moon's surface.

==How long is a day on Mimas?==
One day on Mimas is equal to 23 hours.

==How long is its orbit around Saturn?==
Mimas takes 23 hours to make one orbit around Saturn. It has '''synchronous rotation''', which means that it takes the same amount of time for Mimas to complete one '''orbit''' as it does for one '''rotation'''. The same side of Mimas is always facing toward Saturn.

==What is it made of?==
Mimas is made mostly of ice, with some rock.  Mimas appears to be frozen solid despite its location to Saturn.  This location should have made Mimas more susceptible to tidal heating from Saturn, thus causing partial thaw of the frozen ice.

==How much would Mimas' gravity pull on me?==
If you were on Mimas, the gravity would be 0.008 times as much as Earth's gravity.

==Who is it named after?==
Mimas is named after Mimas, the son of the Greek goddess Gaia. The named was suggested by John Herschel, William Herschel's son. Mimas is also called Saturn I.

==How was it discovered?==
Mimas was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel using a telescope. It was the second moon of Saturn to be discovered by Herschel

== Trinidad and Tobago ==

I've created [[:Category:Trinidadian_and_Tobagonian_recipes]]. Please add that category to the appropriate recipes. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:03, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Solar System]] Proofreading ==

Shanel,

Thanks for your offer to help.  Please, just read the instructions and dig in!
The &quot;assignments&quot; are at [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System/Pluto/Proofreading]], and you can follow the [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System/Proofreading|proofreading process]] link to get more.

If you think the proofreading process is a dumb idea, please let me know.

I'm just scratching my head, trying to figure out how to make this work.

Thanks!

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 00:14, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

===Fact Checking===
Shanel,

You did get busy -- Thanks! 

When you do fact-checking, can you mark the facts you checked with 
the references?  Right after the fact, you put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{an|RefName}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
and then in the references list, you put &lt;nowiki&gt;{{anb|RefName}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  In the Pluto module, you can see it in action in the [[Wikijunior_Solar_System/Pluto#10th_planet_beyond_Pluto.3F|10th planet beyond Pluto?]] section.  You can see more examples in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Solar System]] module.
As for &quot;Images Needed&quot; -- whatever works well for each book, I guess.  I think if we focus on one book at the moment, finish it, and then move on to the next, we can get 3 out the door.

===Cutting Words -- Yay===
Fewer words! Good work!  It's easier to read without them.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 11:55, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

===Pictures Needed===
I think you idea of creating a &quot;pictures needed&quot; page is a good one.
I don't know the best way to get visibility for it, though.  You might try contacting [[User:Theresa Knott]], who has done a bunch of diagrams already.
I have found that doing a google image search using site:nasa.gov turns up a lot of good stuff.

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 12:58, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

===Grade Level===
Shanel,

I used WORD to check what grade level the material is on.  I copy one section at a time into WORD and work on it sentence by sentence.  It needs to be readable for 4th to 6th graders.  This is tough.  There is really too much stuff in this book.  And some of it is very complicated.  The printed form is going to have to have whole sections cut out.  The online version will keep them in.  WORD only checks how long words and sentences are, not how &quot;hard&quot; or unfamiliar they are.  So I took a look at the information at http://simple.wikipedia.org and the suggested &quot;simple&quot; word lists.  I ignored the stuff about weird grammer for non-native speakers.  This is a tough task.
Thanks for your help
--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:27, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

Take a look at the help on the &quot;Grammer&quot; stuff.  do a Help search on &quot;flesch&quot;.  Under &quot;Readability Scores&quot; you'll see the formulas for the Flesch Reading Ease score and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score.  You can improve both scores by using shorter words and shorter sentences.  It is hard.  Often you get dramatic improvement by just chopping sentences to bits.  So many people have contributed, there are a LOT of extra words in many of the articles, anyway.  Some concepts are very complicated for the target age group.
--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 12:58, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

===Missing Information for Neptune===
I would think that should be added before or during proofreading.  Maybe I was a little quick to put up the proofreading notice on that one... --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 20:24, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

You can see [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System#Important]] where the grant-writer, Danny Wool, says we should be done with the proofreading process already, so we can publish it on October 3.  Just a tad optimistic on this one.  If he could mobilise all of the Wikipedia fact checkers and copyeditors, and bring in the simple english team, maybe.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 22:53, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

===References from Wikipedia===
I don't think wikipedia is a citeable source, because anyone can change anything at any time.  In any case, that article does not show any evidence that it has been fact-checked.  I consider the NASA websites to be citeable sources, because NASA employs experts to write them.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 13:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

===Uranus and Grade Level -- tough work ===
I was just looking at the work you did on Uranus and its moons.  Was that uranus or was it neptune.  Lots of references to silicate rocks and methane ice.  OUCH!   That's a tough piece of text to start with.  Imagine a bunch of restless 8-11 year old hurricane refugees trying to read this! 
I think it is OK to cut out some facts.  We may have to cut out a bunch of moons entirely. 48 pages.  We only have 48 pages.
Ariel is made of ice and rocks and frozen gas.  That's complicated enough!  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 00:15, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mars]] references ==

: ''I've Started adding references to this module, but I've done it the old way (Force of habit :)). Could you fix them for me when I'm done? Thanks! --[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 05:07, 6 January 2006 (UTC)
Will do. Incidentally, any thoughts on the thread [[User talk:David Kernow#Wikijunior Solar System/Our Solar System|here]] and [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Readability; 'Freezing' modules to form a version 1 of the book|here]]? &amp;nbsp;Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 16:52, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

== Wikijunior &quot;running out of steam&quot; ==

While in general I support &quot;meeting&quot; together to try and come up with a strategy for Wikijunior, I would like to point out that Wikibooks does tend to go in cycles where a burst of activity happens on a Wikibook and then a temporary lull happens... sometimes for a couple of months.  There has been a general increase in the overall number of active users over the past 6 months or so, particularly with Wikijunior itself.

I have most of the Wikijunior modules on my watch list, and it seems like most of the activity right now is concentrated on the [[Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations]] Wikibook, mainly out of interest in the subject and the fact that it has expanded considerably in terms of content so there is a general pull of both existing content and new stuff going into it.  [[Wikijunior Solar System]] is hitting a brick wall of sorts, because the task at hand to raise the editorial standards rather than simply add new content is a much harder task.

Now here is a thought to crunch on for a little bit.  [[:Template:WJAOTW]] is incredibly stale as the last time I updated it was back in August.  I'm wondering if we ought to instead turn it into an article of the week and concentrate on just one book module at a time, but really work hard on trying to bring it up to some sort of high quality standard.  The real question here is how to go about deciding what to put in there.  The articles I selected were purely arbitrary and based mainly on my own view of what needed work at the time for each Wikijunior book.  Instead perhaps we could have a vote more like Wikipedia and the COTM page, or perhaps form an &quot;editorial&quot; committee to select the current direction for Wikijunior in terms of what book is very close to completion and to concentrate on what weak areas in the Wikibook need attention.  Any thoughts on your part?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:17, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Dinosaurs ==

I can't really picture what you were talking about for the cover, so could you draw something in MS paint then? ;)--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 17:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

:Behold my lack of artistic prowess! First of all I thought the divisions between could be kind of ivy or plants or trees or something, rather than merely a coloured line. Also the divisions wouldn't have to be perfect, if a particular bit got a little curvy that would make the division even more natural.

===Example 1===
[[Image:WJ Dinosaurs cover example 1.png]]
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;
The three eras are evenly divided, with a T-Rex (everyone loves T-Rex!) sticking out of his frame and seeming to come out of the page. And he's repeated in  a sort of ivy ring thing (again &quot;bursting&quot; out of it) to keep the back cover interesting.
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;

===Example 2===
[[Image:WJ Dinosaurs cover example 2.png]]
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;
This time the third era is on the back cover, with the stegosaurus' head (yes, that's what it's meant to be) sticking around to encourage you to look at the back and see the rest of him. I may have the stegosaurus' era wrong, it's been a while. Once again the dinosaurs would be drawn to appear to be looking out of the page right at you.
&lt;br clear=all /&gt;
As a dinosaur-mad child I thought books with this &quot;bursting&quot; style of cover were great, so I'm sure it would appeal to modern children too. Anyway, what do you think now? [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:28, 2 February 2006 (UTC)



Regarding the images.  Under what kind of license does Demitrios Vidal give us to use the existant images from his page?  I may start some work on the Velociraptor article and it would be great if I could upload one of his Velociraptor images.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 22:55, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">It doesn't matter if the song is gospel, hymns, spirituals, soul, and etc., they are all &quot;Praise and Worship&quot; songs dedicated to God. In order to write a song ascribing the worth that is due God, we must first find out what He is worth.  In order to even attempt to describe God, we must know Him more and more.

Just because one is a non-Christian does not mean they should stay away from understanding it, since many American Musics - be they Blues or Jazz - was deeply rooted in the call-and-response of Spirituals. Additionally, it is quite imperative to study this unique music genre, to see what makes the music powerful to sway a large crowd.

Here are a few important aspect to writing a Praise and Worship song:

==Heart of submission==
*You need a heart that is full of the Glory of God 
**From the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.  Word of God in . . . Word of God out. Strive to expand your worship vocabulary.  Yes, &quot;Praise the Lord!&quot; is a wonderful expression, but God is so much bigger than that. If you're going to write about things spiritual, the most important thing is to keep your spiritual life going.  Your writing becomes dry when your spiritual life is dry.
*Was it a prompting from the Holy Spirit? - Pray for further direction.  Seek Him to help you finish it. Sing Scripture to it - if you have a favorite, try it (e.g., &quot;Psalm 119&quot;).
*Sing your testimony to it.
*Sing a prayer to God to it. (e.g., In the Quiet).

==Choice of words==
*Scripture  - more of &quot;The Word&quot; in the words
**When scripture is married to music (&quot;the one expression that God created that bypasses the intellect&quot;), it drives straight	into the heart of the listener and deposits that word or seed there, which WILL NOT - according to His own promise –	return void. Have you ever noticed it's easier to memorize scripture that has been set to music? Praise songs that contain The Word feed the heart in preparation for the worship time.
*Lyrics that declare His attributes (i.e. our Healer, our Provider, our Peace etc.), for He brings those attributes to bear on our present circumstance as we sing them.
*Lyrics that declare an awareness of and response to the glory and sovereignty of God.
*Call-and-response is a very effective way to get in touch with the Holy spirit, for both the audience and the musician him/herself
*The most powerful imagery in a Praise and Worship Song is imagery that points people to God.

==Style==
*Just plain, does it minister?
*Is it prophetic or evangelistic?
*Does it create an atmosphere for praise or worship?

==Performance and outcome==
*Has the Holy Spirit been produced right out of the song?
*Has it gone right over the common person's head?
*Can it be played with any instruments, be it keyboard, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, flute, djembe— be it a combination, individual, or even acapella?

==Themes==
*The Names of The Lord - Proclaiming one of the many names of the Lord and their meanings
*Gods Love - The depth and breadth
*Healing - Calling upon the Lord for physical or spiritual or emotional healing
*Holiness - Seeking sanctification and purity
*Surrender - Laying down our wills to be replaced by His
*Declaration - Affirming who God is in our lives
*Exaltation - High praise, praise with abandon to self consciousness
*Exhortation - Encouraging the assembly
*Spiritual Warfare - Is it a rally or battle cry?
*Focused mainly on God
*Focused mainly on Jesus
*Focused mainly on the Holy Spirit
*Repentance - Confession and asking for forgiveness
*Thankfulness - Gratitude for Who He is, and all He's done
*Adoration - Lavishing our deepest love upon Him

==Ways to increase the spirtual creativity==
*Bible study
*Sermons - Something as simple as a single phrase (e.g., &quot;High King of Heaven&quot;)
*Sermon topics
*Fasting - Marty Nystrom wrote &quot;As The Deer Panteth For The Water&quot; on the 19th day of an extended fast. As we put the flesh under and deny it, the spirit man rises up and becomes more receptive (e.g., &quot;Lord of Lords&quot;).

And finally . . . and most importantly . . .if you want to be truly used of God in a powerful way through your songwriting, then give your heart TOTALLY to Christ and give that gift to God.

The '''century egg''' (a.k.a. preserved egg, thousand-year egg, thousand-year-old egg; Chinese: 皮蛋; pinyin: pídàn or Chinese: 松花蛋; pinyin: sōnghūadàn) is a Chinese delicacy made by preserving duck (or less commonly chicken) eggs in a mixture of charcoal and lime for (despite the name) around 100 days. It is greenish in color, and has a creamy cheese-like flavor and strong aroma.

==Ingredients==
*4 Century [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*80g Jinhua ham
*80g [[cookbook:Ginger|pickled stem ginger]] 
*320g [[cookbook:butter|butter]]

===Seasoning===
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 small bowl of dark [[cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]] (use for dipping)  

== Procedure ==
#Wash preserved egg clean. Steam for 10 minutes.
#Shell the eggs. Cut into 4 parts. Cut the pickled stem ginger into thin slices.
#Cut the Jinhua ham into thin slices. Soak in water for a while.
#Sandwich a sliced ginger with a sliced ham and a sliced preserved egg.
#Leave the preserved egg sandwiches in a dish for later use. 
#Mix the water, oil, salt, batter well to make pasta. Pour the pasta over the preserved egg sandwiches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Common adverbs in Portuguese==
Adverbs are words which modify the meaning of a verb (a word which expresses an action, or something which happens).
Most adverbs in Portuguese end in '''mente''' - the notable exception being '''bem''', which means &quot;well&quot;. Be careful not to confuse this with &quot;bom&quot;, which means &quot;good&quot;.



Well - '''Bem'''

Badly - '''Mal''' 

Slowly - '''Lentamente'''

Quickly - '''Rapidamente'''

Awkwardly - '''Desajeitadamente'''

Unfortunately - '''Infelizmente'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, the second person pronoun only has one person - whether talking to one person or several, whether talking to an intimate friend of someone we don't know at all, we say &quot;you&quot;.
However, as many other languages, Portuguese has several forms for these words. In fact, there are EIGHT forms of the word &quot;you&quot; in Portuguese. They are listed below.

'''Tu''' &lt;br&gt;
'''Vós'''


'''Você'''&lt;br&gt;
'''Vocês'''


'''O senhor'''&lt;br&gt;
'''A senhora'''&lt;br&gt;
'''Os senhores'''&lt;br&gt;
'''As senhoras'''&lt;br&gt;

==Tu and Vós==
'Vós' is relatively uncommon nowadays, but 'tu' is still widely used in Portugal and in south of Brazil.

'''TU'''
This form of &quot;you&quot; is very informal, and can be used only when talking to one person. That is to say, it is only used between friends, when addressing children, or in situations where a certain level of comfort has been established. It is mostly used in Portugal. In Brazil it is never used with the exception of the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Tu is conjugated with the SECOND PERSON SINGULAR conjugation (This means that when we use a verb, such as '''falar''' [to speak], there is a unique way to conjugate '''falar''' - in the present indicative, it is '''tu falas''').

'''VÓS'''
This is the plural form of &quot;you&quot;, or SECOND PERSON PLURAL. It is formal in Portugal. It is hardly ever used in the spoken language even in Portugal; it is still occasionally used in (formal) written communication in Portugal. It may also be encountered in literature, for example The Bible, in a similar way to some words such &quot;Thee&quot; and &quot;Thou&quot; in English. For example, '''Vós falais''' [you speak].

==Você and Vocês==
These are the most common forms of 'you' in usage. If in doubt, they can be used in almost any situation.

'''VOCÊ'''
This is the more commonly used form of &quot;you&quot; and is used between employees, friends, people of the same age and social standing. Again, it can be used only when you are talking to one person. It can be both mildly formal (in Portugal is never informal) and informal (in Brazil). It is widely used in Brazil instead of '''tu'''. It uses the THIRD PERSON SINGULAR conjugation, which means we use the same form of the verb as with &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; - for instance, '''ele fala''' [he speaks] and '''você fala''' [you speak].

'''VOCÊS'''
This has the same level of formality as the singular '''você''', however, it used when talking to a group of people. It uses the THIRD PERSON PLURAL conjugation. That means that we use the same part of the verb as with 'they'. For instance, '''eles gostam''' [they like] and '''vocês gostam''' [you like]

==O senhor and A senhora==
These are the polite forms of 'you'. They are widely used.

'''O SENHOR''' and '''A SENHORA'''
This is the formal version of &quot;you&quot; (one person), and is used when you don't know someone, or towards someone you should show respect to, for example, a boss or a teacher. '''O senhor''' is used when talking to a male, and '''a senhora''' when talking to a female. Like '''você''', it uses the THIRD PERSON SINGULAR conjugation. So we can have '''Você fala''' or '''O senhor fala'''.

'''OS SENHORES''' and '''AS SENHORAS'''
These two forms are, as you have probably guessed, the plural forms of '''o senhor''' and '''a senhora''', respectively. We use them in the same situations as with '''o senhor''' and '''a senhora''' - but when we are talking to more than one person. 

And what if we are talking to a group which is mixed? Unfortunately for equality of the sexes, we use '''os senhores''' if the group is mixed. These forms, like '''vocês''', use the THIRD PERSON PLURAL conjugation. So we can have '''eles comeram''' [they ate], '''vocês comeram''' [you ate], '''os senhores comeram''' [you ate] and '''as senhoras comeram''' [you ate]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Understanding ==

The 'Romantic' Period of music's history begins roughly in 1820 and ends no later than 1910. 

All art (painting, music, drama etc.) during this period is considered to be of a 'Romantic' style. There is no supremely clear definition of this term, but one may consider it thus: A period in cultural history where art (and most notably music) began to grasp emotion and imaginative idea as its roots, rather than the heavily standardized rules and formulas of Classicism which had existed directly before - in the 18th century.

Note: Donald Grout in &lt;u&gt;The History of Western Music&lt;/u&gt; also mentions the alternation between Romantic and Classical eras throughout western music history. 

The significance in this turning point in music's history cannot be underestimated. Calling it a revolution would be rather accurate. It was pioneered by a few individuals, not content with Classicism's standards, and caused nothing less than a paradigm shift in music's critical theory. Romanticism caused changes in how music was first conceived in a composer's mind, how it was performed and, of course, how it was received by an audience. Indeed, the full cycle of conception (by the composer) and reception (by the audience) became a much more organic axis around which music would develop from there on in. 

Of course, music had never been composed without considering how it would be received (by definition, this is fundamentally impossible), but what Romanticism brought to this process was the new, now principal understanding of emotion. Thus, in the aforementioned cycle, this involves insertion of a composer's emotive/imaginative idea into a piece and the later reception of this emotion by an audience (these ideas would be developed vastly to the height of the impressionists in the early 20th Century). Therefore, Romanticism saw the arrival of music that was truly evocative. Music which was not simply technically fine-tuned and although extremely beautiful, lacking in that new experimental, revolutionary core that would fuel the ideas of Romanticists.

== Ludwig Van Beethoven ==

It is my understanding that one individual in particular deserves - demands - special mention. He is Ludwig Van Beethoven. Often credited with giving birth to Romanticism in its true sense in music, Beethoven is remembered as one who was often not content with conforming to Classicism's standardized understanding of music. 
Works by Beethoven that caused controversy when first performed became famous shortly after for being composed with brilliance and a revolutionary energy. 

A perfect example is Beethoven's 3rd ('Eroica') Symphony. Although written initially in admiration of Napoleon Bonaparte, in whom Beethoven perceived great strength and heroism, upon Napoleon's crowning himself Emperor of France in 1804, one may see some of the fire in Beethoven upon learning that when he heard this news, Beethoven tore the title page of the Symphony (which held the dedication of the work to Napoleon on it) from the manuscript in fury - aghast at what Napoleon was doing. 

The Symphony was later given the subtitle 'Eroica' in reference to a more general heroism and &quot;composed to celebrate the memory of a great man&quot;. This seems to show Beethoven's wit - the Symphony remembers an earlier Napoleon, before he became - in Beethoven's mind - a tyrant. 

The work was initially received with surprise and, now and again, shock from audiences who had not experienced a work of such length or power before. The music itself almost literally sparkles with brilliance. Beethoven has crafted a Symphony which began to give real definition to the word 'symphonic'. It is full of variety that had in reality never been seen before. It travels from lull to climax with such technical dexterity that it caused a handful of individuals in early audiences to swoon at its sheer power! Indeed, this is the core of the work. It rests on its ability to evoke emotion; it was designed to be a revolutionary work, a work that revelled in itself and most dazzlingly, in what Beethoven could create from an orchestra. 

Beethoven had commented three years before embarking on the piece that he was unhappy with his work, that he would &quot;henceforth (...) take a new path&quot;. It is no surprise therefore that many see the composition of Eroica as the first symphonic step for Beethoven that would bring Romanticism into music and change music history forever. One should also consider the Pathetique sonata which some believe is the single first piece that can be classed as part of Romanticism.

== The Development of Romanticism ==

Beethoven, however, was just the beginning. Perhaps he is the most interesting as one can take his nine symphonies and listen to them in succession, hearing the unmistakable changes and developments he was bringing to music and symphonic form from the first to ninth work.

But romanticism continued strongly after Beethoven's death. Some of the most notable composers include Brahms, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Chopin, and Mahler. A few have been covered in further detail below.

'''Brahms''' - A great admirer of Beethoven, Brahms was directly inspired by him and his first symphony was labelled 'Beethoven's Tenth' by admirers. Notable works include the 3rd Violin Sonata, the Violin concerto and his exceptional works for piano including the Intermezzos and Piano Concertos in particular. However, Brahms is often most famously remembered for his Hungarian Dances. This is an important facet in Romanticism - the use of folk melodies and traditional pieces in a symphonic setting was more or less new and became quite popular. Mahler (Symphonies) and Tchaikovsky (1st Piano concerto etc.) are great advocates of this along with Dvorak who wrote his 'Slavonic Dances' in 1878.

'''Dvorak''' - Another composer who drew direct inspiration from Beethoven, Dvorak wrote a number of extremely significant romantic works including his Cello and Violin Concertos. The former often being hailed as the greatest ever written. Although Czech, Dvorak spent time in America and pieces he wrote there (which included said Cello Concerto) offer insights into two feelings. Firstly his curiosity upon entering a different country (Symphony No.9, 'The New World' etc.) and secondly his feelings of homesickness (Folk melodies in the Cello Concerto and smaller violin works etc.).

'''Chopin''' - Polish-born composer Frederic Chopin is most remembered for his works for Piano (Which include Preludes, Etudes, Waltzes, Mazurkas, Nocturnes, and Two Piano Concertos etc. etc.). Note in particular the (unofficially-) titled 'Revolutionary Etude', which is a startling piece of music which some believe was written in response to the 1831 Russian invasion of Warsaw.

'''Mahler''' - A late romantic, Mahler's latest works contain hints of impressionism. He was committed to evoking new emotions in audiences and presenting the world with new sounds and techniques from the orchestra. His compositional output is almost entirely Lieder (songs for voice and piano) and Symphonies. Where Brahms and Dvorak had taken Beethoven as the root for inspiration, Mahler (who was born in 1860) had a much wider variety of Romantics to draw on. 

In particular, he is connected with Wagner and akin to the works of Bruckner. Mahler indeed pushed Romanticism to its limits, introducing some atonality to music, abundant use of scherzos and sonata forms and later, as stated, very early impressionism. It seems fitting that, although dying unfortunately young, Mahler died in 1911 - he had lived to the very edge of Romanticism; and briefly had the chance to peek beyond it.

== Characteristics ==

*Emphasis on emotion

*Increased chromaticism and expansion of harmony

*New musical forms and expansion of old ones

*Expansion of the orchestra with new instruments

Above, I have selected the main factors from these composers that were major parts of Romanticism - they are the ideas and expressions that did not exist before and which gave true meaning to the word 'Romanticism'. 

(The above is a brief beginning to this 'module' - I entreat its expansion and continued revision)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TopNav|prev=Operators|next=Scalar Variables}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Perl has four fundamental [[w:data type|data type]]s: scalars, lists, hashes, and typeglobs.

;scalar : is a funny way of saying a single value; it may be a number, a string, or a [[w:Reference (computer science)|reference]].

;list : is an ordered collection of scalars. A variable that holds a list is called an ''array''.   Items in a list or array can be accessed by their position in the list; programs can retrieve the first, second, third, etc. item in a list.

;hash : is like an array, in that a hash holds many values, but the values are identified by a unique &quot;key&quot;, rather than an ordinal index position.

;typeglob : is a variable representing an entry within the internal symbol table.  It is used to manipulate file handles, and to create references or aliases. 

All variables are marked by a leading [[w:Sigil (computer programming)|sigil]], which identifies the data type.
The same name may be used for variables of different types, without conflict.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
  $foo   # a scalar
  @foo   # a list
  %foo   # a hash
  *foo   # a typeglob
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Enceladus from Voyager.jpg|right|220px|Enceladus from Voyager 2]]
Enceladus is a moon of Saturn.

==How big is Enceladus?==
Enceladus measures 498.82 km across.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Enceladus has a great deal of variety. Pictures taken by ''Voyager 2'' revealed at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth, young terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain that often border the smooth terrain. The picture also revealed cracks that crossed the cratered and smooth terrain.

The smooth plains have very few craters, indicating that they are very young. This means that there are '''cryovolcanoes''' on the surface, or something else that renews the surface.

When the ''Cassini'' spacecraft flew by on February 17 and March 9, 2005, it revealed even more detail about the surface of Enceladus. The smooth regions that Voyager 2 saw now had many small '''ridges''' and '''scarps''', while the old cratered regions had many fractures.

==How long is a day on Enceladus?==
One day on Enceladus is equal to 1.37 Earth days, or one day, 8 hours, and 53 minutes. This is the same amount of time it takes to complete an orbit around Saturn. As a result the same side of Enceladus is always facing toward Saturn. When the orbit and the rotation times match like this, it is called '''synchronous rotation''':  Earth's Moon is another example.

==How would Enceladus' gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on the surface, you would only weigh about 1/10 of what you do on Earth.

==Who is it named after?==
Enceladus is named after a Gigantes in Greek mythology. He was defeated by one of Zeus' thunderbolts, and placed under Mt. Etna. The fire from the mountains is said to be his breath, and the rumbling of the mountain is said to be from him rolling around inside.

The name, as well as the names of the other moons of Saturn, was suggested by John Herschel, son of William Herschel, in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope''.

==How was it discovered?==
Enceladus was discovered in 1789 by the English astronomer William Herschel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook will be written collectively by students enrolled in the course ME 513: Engineering Acoustics during the fall semester 2005.  For information about the class, you can check the course home page at:[http://widget.ecn.purdue.edu/~me513/Index.html].  This is going to count for the students grades.  Feel free to edit or comment any article per wikibook policy.  Please be careful when editing or making suggestions that you don't annihilate possibly interesting contributions from the original authors.  Acoustic students at accredited Universities are especially encouraged to contribute.--[[User:Me513|Engineering Acoustics Student]] 19:09, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

=== Wikibooks Policy ===

This page is in violation of wikibooks policy, which can be viewed [[WB:WIW|HERE]]. Specifically, the part about how wikibooks is not a personal webhost. If the contributers here continue to violate policy, this page could be locked from further editing, or (worst-case scenario) it could be deleted from the server entirely. While the wikibooks community appreciates it's contributers, we cannot allow these projects to be used in a manner that is against policy. If you have any questions about this statement, you may leave me a message on [[User talk:Whiteknight|my talk page]]. I would advice the contributers on this page to take this warning very seriously. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:22, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:Hello, ME 513 students, '''welcome to Wikibooks!'''

:This book looks useful, and I hope that it stays at Wikibooks. However, notices like this are '''not''' acceptable: ''Feel free to add comments to the discussion page, but please do not edit the page since it is part of the course grade.'' (quote from [[Engineering Acoustics/Filter Design &amp; Implementation]])

:Here at Wikibooks, any user can improve modules by clicking &quot;edit this page&quot;. I have sometimes created a module, and it exists for weeks without any edits except from me. But the opportunity was there for other users to edit modules. ([[Guide to UNIX]], which I worked on, is begging for edits.)

:One can use a notice like {{tl|inuse}} to temporarily halt other edits to pages (especially pages that no other user edited recently). I usually type {{tl|inuse}} at the top of a module, save the page, then immediately click &quot;edit this page&quot; and start working on my edits. Once I am finished (I might save several times), I remove {{tl|inuse}} and save. This is only for avoiding edit conflicts, where I try to save but I find that someone else has changed something since I started. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:12, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

I received a message from this user on my [[User talk:Whiteknight|talk page]], and it seems more reasonable now. It is interesting to me that professors are trying to increase wikibooks contributions as part of a classroom excercise. I think this this (in general) is a good thing for our community, and so long as they don't wantonly abuse policy, I'm inclined to leave well-enough alone. I personally know a good deal about acoustic engineering, but mostly with a focus on digital sound processing. I would therefore like to read this book, and maybe help out a little (when I have fewer other projects on my plate). --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

== Orphaned modules ==

In general, '''do not unlink''' a module from a book, unless the module is a redirect or being deleted (or belongs to a different book). In some cases, it appears that users unlinked modules from [[Engineering Acoustics]] main page to reupload the content under a different title; the correct thing to do would have been to use the &quot;move page&quot; feature of this wiki. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:47, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

See [[Help:Pages#Moving]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 16:49, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

I created a template {{tl|previous edit history}} (see [[Project:Template messages/Maintenance]]) to handle situation like this. I redirect an old page to its newer version, then I mark the newer version's talk page with the template.

I started striking out orphan pages from the above list which I fixed. If you fix a page in the above list, then you can strike it like I did. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:21, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

Acoustics is the science of sound, particularly its production, transmission, and effects.  Sound is defined as a small mechanical disturbance that may propagate at a speed characteristic of the medium, provided the medium is of great extent compared to a typical size of the disturbance.  Sound may exist in gases, liquids or solids.

The applications of acoustics can be broken down into four main categories: Earth Sciences, Engineering, Life Sciences, and the Arts.  Within Earth Sciences, acoustics is used in such applications as the development and refinement of underwater detection devices, the measurement of seismic waves and sound levels in the atmosphere.  Engineering applications of acoustics include Noise Control, Electro-Acoustics, Sonic and Ultrasonic Engineering systems, non-destructive material testing, shock and vibrations of mechanical systems, and sound quality design of products.  Life Sciences use Acoustics in hearing, speech production, bioacoustics, and psychoacoustics.  In the Arts, Acoustics is involved in musical instruments, room acoustics, and communications.  The following article describes some of the fundamental principles of Acoustics.

:''write introduction last''

=== The Palermo Stone ===
The [[wikipedia:Palermo_stone|Palermo Stone]], the main fragment of seven surviving
pieces of a larger stele, is generally considered Egypt's oldest historical document, 
dating from the end of the [[wikipedia:Fifth dynasty of Egypt|5th dynasty]] 
([[wikipedia:25th century BC|twenty-fifth century BC]]). It gives a list of the
kings of Egypt, starting with the Gods and other mythical rulers, all the way down
to the time of its making. 

==== Context of Authorship ====
Its presumed purpose, both propagandistic and/or religious, is to document the 
ordered descent of power (in Egyptian, &lt;I&gt;Ma'at&lt;/I&gt;, after the name of the 
Egyptian goddess [[wikipedia:Ma%C3%A0t|Ma'at]], who symbolized justice and order) 
from time immemorial to the then-living ruler who commissioned the work. 

In terms of the actual writing process (of the papyrus from which the stone 
was carved), the nameless Egyptian historians assigned to the task must have worked 
backwards, probably using the archives of palaces and temples, or possibly even 
documentation from early tombs. Anachronistically, [[wikipedia:Cartouche|cartouches]] 
are provided for all of the kings, even including the mythical ones. 
This is one of the clues that the annal in its present form is a 
retrospective construction of the [[wikipedia:Fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] 
rather than a record that was kept from the beginning of the 
[[wikipedia:First_dynasty_of_Egypt|First Dynasty]].

Notice that this is in clear contrast to the way annals are normally authored, 
namely updated at regular intervals, as events warrant. Whether the authors intended
to give the impression of an annal is not clear to us. The entries for the kings get 
sparser as they proceed into the past, and by the time they reach the time before 
the first dynasty, the time of Gods and Heroes, the contents is down to a bare 
recording of the name.

For our analysis, let us look at the types of information that the authors
provide for the individual dynasties.

==== The Fifth Dynasty ====
For the [[wikipedia:Fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], the annal provides information 
about the stipends that the  kings granted to the various temples, 
identified by the name of the Godhood and  the location (e.g. ''Buto in Pernu'', 
''Nekhbet in the Sanctuary of the South''). 
The donations fall into three categories: 

# food (mainly bread and beer, occasionally animals such as oxen and geese), expressed as so-and-so many offerings per day; 
# land, expressed as [[wikipedia:Ancient_weights_and_measures#Egyptian_area|stat]] of land in a specific city or district ([[wikipedia:Nome_%28Egypt%29|nome]]), which could then be used to grow the food;
# religious infrastructure, such as temples, altars or statues made of electrum.

The annal also specifies trade activities, such as imported amounts of myrrh and electrum. 
Furthermore, the annal mentions the jubilee of the inthronement of the king as the ruler
of both Upper and Lower Egypt. Finally, the annal gives the ordinal number for the census
of the large cattle and the inundation level of the Nile in 
[[wikipedia:Ancient_weights_and_measures#Egyptian_length|cubits, palms and fingers]].

==== The Fourth Dynasty ====
For the [[wikipedia:Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]], the annal is only badly preserved;
the portions we have included the jubilee of the inthronement of the king, the celebration of
various religious festivals (e.g. the ''Sheshed'' Feast), and possibly some temple
stipends (the text is very corrupted). The annal mentions the census of the large 
cattle as well as the inundation level of the Nile. 

Interestingly, the annal of the Fourth also record the selection of the construction
place for the pyramid of the pharao [[wikipedia:Shepseskaf|Shepseskaf]] called ''Shelter of Shepseskaf'' 
(although he eventually was buried in a [[wikipedia:Mastaba|mastaba]]).

With the founder of the [[wikipedia:Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]], 
[[wikipedia:Sneferu|Sneferu]], the style of the annal changes. The annal is no longer
reporting any stipends to the temples, but instead mentions military activities with
numbers of prisoners and spoils, various state sponsored construction activities such
as buildings and ''dewatowe'' ships, possibly for trade, and the birth of royal children. 
Famously, the annal also cites 40 ships worth of cedar wood traded with the Lebanon, 
which are then turned into the doors of the king's palace.

==== The Third and Second Dynasty ====
The annal for the [[wikipedia:Third_dynasty_of_Egypt|Third Dynasty]] and
[[wikipedia:Third_dynasty_of_Second|Second Dynasty]] is also in bad shape, especially
with respect of the names of the kings. As a result, the division between the
two dynasties is difficult to draw. 

Suffice it to say that for the reign of [[wikipedia:Nynetier|Nynetier]], 
the jubilee of the throne ascension is celebrated separately for Upper and Lower 
Egypt (only once in the same year), with a clear preponderance for the Lower Egypt 
jubilee. The census was for counting gold and land and bi-annually at that time. 
Occasionally a note mentions that a temple was layed out (&quot;stretching of the cord 
for the house called XXX&quot;), that shipbuilding took place or that cities we cannot
identify were destroyed. 

Only the reporting of the innundation levels of the Nile remain constant. 

==== The First Dynasty ====
The annal for the [[wikipedia:First_dynasty_of_Egypt|First Dynasty]] 
becomes increasingly spartan. Some feasts are recorded as being celebrated for
the first time. The smiting of enemies, some of which are unidentified and may indeed 
be legendary, and the hunting of hippos is recorded. Only the first census ever 
is mentioned, this time of the people in all nomes of the land. 
As the march back in time reaches the border to the mythical kings and
gods, even the innundation levels of the Nile subside.

==== The First Kings and the Gods ====
The annal begins to meander from human history into the mythological in the
very first entries. Even though the terrible state of perservation of the
top part of the stele makes reconstruction difficult, many of the names
clearly identify male divinities. In addition, they are listed in the order
of the cosmogeny of the [[wikipedia:Ennead|Ennead]], that is, 
[[wikipedia:Shu_%28Egyptian_deity%29|Shu]], [[wikipedia:Geb|Seb]], 
[[wikipedia:Set_%28mythology%29|Set]], [[wikipedia:Horus|Horus]] and
[[wikipedia:Osiris|Osiris]], followed by sons of the aforementioned
deities such as [[wikipedia:Thoth|Thoth]]. 

The name [[wikipedia:Osiris|Osiris]] is another hint for a 
[[wikipedia:Fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] authorship, as
Osiris only became established during that time.

==== Assessment ====
The annalistic text recorded on the Palermo Stone is the first
historical text from Egypt. However, its purpose is not to reconstruct
a foreign and distant past, but to display the continuity between the 
divine origins of kingship and the [[wikipedia:Fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] 
rulership that commissioned the work. In this sense, it treats the historical
information it deals with [[wikipedia:Antiquarian|antiquarian]], not critical.

While the authors must have done research to assemble the details the 
text refers to, there is no independent way to verify the correctness of
their claims the farther one goes back in time; to give a (potentially
hyper-critical) example, it is at least conceivable that the authors made 
up numbers for the Nile innudations for some of the years they did not 
possess levels for. 

The information most likely to be correct are the donations to 
the various temples recorded for the time of the 
[[wikipedia:Fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]]; cf. the pain-staking
detail of donations to various monestaries and churches in the 
[[wikipedia:Anglo_Saxon_Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicles]]. 
These events are most proximate to the authors; changing the amounts 
would have been a political act against (or for) the priesthoods; and 
future rulers would have been measured against these donation levels.

=== The Turin Papyrus, a list of Kings ===

The [[wikipedia:Turin_King_List|Turin King List]] is a [[wikipedia:Papyrus|Papyrus]] 
that contains a very complete list of the kings of Egypt, starting in mythical time
with the king Gods and descending all the way into at least the 
[[wikipedia:Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|17th dynasty]], where its current form
breaks off (the papyrus had suffered since its discovery and fallen apart).

The purpose of the Turin king list is not quite clear; it forms the backside of an old
document apparently used for taxation purposes. If it is but a copying exercise,
then this would mean that there was a monument or other scroll playing the role of
the original, and our historiographical interest shifts to the original authors that
the Turin king list copies.  

By itself, the notion of a king list is not that exceptional in [[w:Ancient_Egypt|Ancient Egypt]];
pharaos such as [[w:en:Seti_I|Seti I]] and [[w:en:Rameses_II|Rameses II]] in their tombs
in [[w:en:Abydos%2C_Egypt|Abydos]] give lists of their predecessor kings. However, these
lists are ''selective''. They do not express all the ancestors or all the previous office holders,
but only those that the pharao felt an especially strong connection with. To give 
a present-day analogy, this would be akin to American presidents seeing themselves 
in the tradition of [[w:George_Washington|Washington]], [[w:Thomas_Jefferson|Jefferson]] and [[w:Abraham_Lincoln|Lincoln]], but not, say [[w:James_Garfield|Garfield]] or 
[[w:Millard_Fillmore|Fillmore]]. As in the American example, such ''cultic king lists'' 
pick and choose the famous and impressive pharaos from te known ones.

In contrast, the [[wikipedia:Turin_King_List|Turin King List]] provides a very 
complete list of the pharaos for the dynasties, including the invading [[w:Hyksos|Hyksos]],
not one of the fondest memory of the Egyptians. But it is this fact that allows us to
consider it as an example of historical writing, rather than a mere source for the
reconstruction of a chronology of the pharaos of Egypt; the completeness of the chronology
overrules the cultic intentions.

=== The Biography of Methen ===
Dating from the [[w:en:Third_dynasty_of_Egypt|Third Dynasty]], the biography of Methen is
a narrative of the important events in the life of an important dignitary and 
court official. The narrative is complicated to piece together, as it covers the
walls of the [[w:en:Mastaba|mastaba]] of Methen at [[w:en:Saqqara|Saqqara]], providing
no apparent order to the individual subsections. It is clearly the oldest biography of
[[w:en:Ancient_Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and probably one of the oldest biographies we have.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Carbon vs. carbon==

So I'm on a healthy edit war over Carbon vs. carbon.  I really don't care, but if we are going to get into a stupid, petty edit war on a single word (and only if the first letter is a captial letter), I don't know what else can happen here.

For now, I'm just going to leave it as it is, because I'm no grammar Nazi anyway.  Perhaps I'll change it back in 6 months or so.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:45, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

== [[Engineering Acoustics]] ==

I wanted to drop you a little warning about the book [[Engineering Acoustics]]. Wikibooks is a community editing project with a series of guidelines that have been established by the community itself, to help shape the way wikibooks works. This book, by virtue of the fact that you've attempted to restrict the input of contributers from outside your classroom, is in violation of wikibooks policy, and '''could be deleted''' if the community at large decides it is a big enough violation of policy. Here are some of the points that are of some concern:

#Wikibooks is not to be used as a personal webhost, nor is it to be used to disseminate information not directly related to the prime directive of the site.
#Wikibooks is a community effort, and the input of contributers cannot be restricted (except for vandals).

For more information on wikibooks policies, check out [[WB:WIW]].

Of course, the last thing that we here at wikibooks want to do is stifle the learning process, but we have to ensure that the community continues to grow and evolve acording to our preexisting guidelines. If the atmosphere at [[Engineering Acoustics]] does not attempt to merge with existing wikibooks policy, it could face deletion. If you have any questions on the matter, you may leave me a message --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:15, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|German Cuisine]] | [[Image:Kirschtorte.jpg|right|thumb|]]

'''Black Forest Cake''', sometimes called by the French ''gateau'', ''gateaux'' or ''gâteau'' (meaning &quot;cake&quot;), is a chocolate cake with a strong cherry element, popular throughout North America.  The recipe originates from Germany, where it is called '''[[Cookbook:Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte|Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte]]'''.

== Ingredients ==

=== Cake ===

* 4oz/100g Irish [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 8oz /225g [[cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 4oz /100g plain [[cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]
* 7oz /200g [[cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]]
* 1/4 teaspoon ground [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1/4 pint [[cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* 3 tablespoons strong cold black [[cookbook:coffee|coffee]]
* 2 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* pinch of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]

=== Pastry base ===

* 4oz/100g [[cookbook:Flour|cream flour]]
* pinch of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 2oz /50g [[cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
* 2 oz/50g Irish [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 [[cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]]
* a few drops of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla essence]]

=== Misc. ===

* 1 pint [[cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 1-lb tin black [[cookbook:cherry|cherries]]
* 4 tablespoons black cherry jam
* [[cookbook:brandy|brandy]] or cherry juice
* 4oz/100g grated [[cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]

== Procedure ==

=== Cake ===

# [[Cookbook:Creaming|Cream]] the butter and sugar together well.
# Melt the chocolate and beat into the creamed mixture, then mix in the eggs.
# Sift flour, salt and cinnamon together.
# Fold the dry mix lightly into the liquids, then fold in the sour cream and cold coffee.
# Pour the mixture into a lined and greased 9-inch round, deep tin,and bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes.
# Set to cool on a wire rack.

=== Pastry base ===

# Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and bind until the mixture stiffens.
# Roll the pastry onto a floured board worktable until pastry is about the same size as the base of the tin.
# Lay out on baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes.

=== Assembly ===

# Whip cream until it holds its shape.
# Put some whipped cream into pastry piping bag with a star pipe attached, and reserve this for the decoration.
# Slice the cake into 3 equal-sized layers.
# Drain the cherries, reserve 8 for decoration and remove the stones from the remainder.
# Put pastry on serving plate and spread the pastry with black cherry jam.
# Soak the cakes with spirit. 
# Put one layer of cake on top of coated pastry.
# Spread a layer of cream with half the stoned cherries.
# Put the second layer of cake and add another layer of cream and cherries.
# Add the final layer of the cake.
# Cover the entire cake with the remaining cream and press on the grated chocolate. Decorate the top with piped rosettes of cream and the reserved whole black cherries.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* Using 3 identical cake pans instead of 1 large one is acceptable.

* Margarine, vegetable oil or regular butter will substitute for Irish butter.

* In some countries (e.g. Austria and Australia) the brandy is often replaced by rum, in Germany itself it is almost always replaced by Kirschwasser.

* '''This did not come with a temperature to bake at for either the pastry or cake.'''  Cakes usually work at between 325°F and 400°F (160°C and 205°C).  Pastries usually work at between 350°F and 425°F (175°C and 220°C).

*Recommended garnishes include fish-shaped crackers.

== Ingredients ==
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Ground Beef|ground beef]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*about 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]

== Procedure ==
# Mix spices into beef, using hands, until well-mixed. 
# Form eight small balls of meat, then press into very flat [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] shapes. 
# Top four with about 2 tbsp. crumbled feta cheese, then cover with the other four. 
# Press together firmly to flatten, then crimp edges tightly to make four burgers. 
# Chill.
# Cook as regular burgers in a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or on the [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]]. Handle gently to avoid crumbling. 

Serve on toasted white or [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] with spicy [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]].

Makes four burgers.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Any other [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] that doesn’t melt easily can be substituted for feta in this recipe. Some possibilities are [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]], [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss]], and Jarlsberg. If you use a cheese that melts and becomes runny, however, it will all drip out.
* If you plan to grill the burgers, you can opt to mix the feta in with the beef and simply treat as regular burgers. Don’t try this on a skillet, however, as the cheese will stick and burn.

== Ingredients ==
*12 thick asparagus spears
*2 cups water
*1 medium shallot, chopped
*3 tablespoons unsalted butter
*1/4 cup to 1 cup whipping cream or light cream
*to taste: salt, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne pepper

== Procedure ==
#Snap the tough ends off the asparagus spears. 
#Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan, salt the water lightly, and add the asparagus spears. Cook at a lively simmer for 10 minutes.  Lift out with tongs and set aside. Reserve the cooking water.
#In a separate saucepan large enough to hold the finished soup, heat the butter, add the chopped shallot, and cook gently until soft but not browned. Add the cooked asparagus spears and one cup of the cooking water and bring to a boil. Cook at a lively simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain the soup through a medium sieve into a bowl, reserving the liquid. 
#Purée the solids in a food processor with enough of the reserved liquid to allow the mixture to purée smoothly.
#Strain the purée through the sieve back into the non-reactive saucepan, rubbing the mixture through with a flexible scraper or wooden spoon and leaving the fibrous parts in the sieve. Discard the contents of the sieve.
#Add the cream and enough of the remaining asparagus cooking water to give the soup the consistency you want. Season to taste with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reheat gently over low heat, making sure not to let the soup boil.
#Serve hot or chilled. (If you want to serve it chilled, let it cool, then refrigerate it uncovered until thoroughly cold, then cover with plastic wrap. You can keep it refrigerated for up to 2 days.)

== Notes and Tips ==
#Don't be tempted to omit the final straining of the soup! If you leave the bits of fibrous asparagus skin in the soup, they give it a very unpleasant texture. Use a sieve with a medium mesh, not too coarse and not too fine: too coarse will let too much of the fiber through, too fine will make the job of straining too difficult.
#The richest version of this recipe, using a full cup of whipping cream, produces an especially luscious and velvety soup. For a lighter soup with fewer calories, use the smaller amount of whipping cream or substitute light cream. If you're planning to use only 1/4 cup of cream, cook the asparagus in 3 cups of water so that you'll have enough cooking water to add to the finished soup to achieve the right consistency.
#To make this soup vegan, cook the asparagus in 3 cups of water, omit the cream, and use oil instead of butter to cook the shallot.

'''Boiled pasta''' is the basis of an enormous variety of [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] dishes.  In most of them, the pasta is usually cooked in the same manner, regardless of the [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]] and other ingredients that will be added to it.  Notable exceptions are [[Cookbook:Soups|soups]], ''gnocchi,'' and baked dishes like ''[[Cookbook:Lasagna|lasagna]]'' and ''manicotti,'' which are not covered here. 

The four key &quot;secrets&quot; for cooking a good pasta are: ''cook in salted water'', ''add the pasta only after the water is boiling'', ''do not undercook or overcook'', and ''drain and cool promptly''. One must also be aware that some sauces or other accessories may take longer to prepare than the pasta itself.

==Salted water==

On the average, for every 200 [[Cookbook:Grams|grams]] of pasta, one should use 4 [[Cookbook:liter|liters]] (about 17 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]]) of cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]] and 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]. The salt should be added to the water to flavor the pasta. (Although some people believe salt is added because it raises the boiling point of water, thereby cooking the pasta faster, this is not true. The amount of salt being added raises the boiling point of the pasta only a fraction of a degree. The salt is purely for flavor). In addition, some people also add a few drops of [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]] to the water, in order to reduce foaming and the risk of spillovers. It is worth noting, however, that adding oil to pasta water inhibits the ability of the drained pasta to absorb the flavors of any sauce and is generally considered undesirable.

The [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot]] should be large enough for the water level to be one or two inches below the rim.  It must also be wide enough to hold the uncooked pasta entirely submerged in the water; long pasta like ''[[Cookbook:Spaghetti|spaghetti]]'' may have to be broken in half to fit a smaller pot.

==When to add the pasta==

The water should be brought to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]], stirring. Once the water is vigorously boiling, the pasta should be thrown in, all at once. If the pasta is added to non-boiling water it will turn brown on the edges. The cooking time should be measured from this moment. 

When the cold pasta is added to the water, the latter usually stops boiling for a few moments. The stove's heat should be adjusted so that the water resumes boiling promptly, and stays boiling moderately while the pasta is cooking. The pasta should be kept entirely submerged at all times. (Failure to follow these rules will result in pasta that is partly overcooked and/or partly undercooked.)

==Cooking time==

Cooking time varies depending on the kind of pasta; usually it is listed on the pasta packaging. Typical times for dry pasta range from 5 minutes for thin ''spaghettini'' to 12 minutes or more for some thick varieties.  Fresh, [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]-based pasta (''pasta all'uovo'') takes very little time to cook - hardly a minute after the water has returned to a boil; filled pasta like ''tortellini'' needs only a few minutes.

The recommended time needs to be increased when cooking pasta at great altitudes, since water will boil at a lower temperature. Also, the cooking time may depend on the brand as well as on the kind of pasta. 

The cooking time can be adjusted to vary the firmness of the pasta. The suggested time will usually produce a chewy ''pasta al dente'', favored by connoisseurs but somewhat heavy to digest; a slightly longer time produces softer pasta, which may be more adequate for children. However, care must be taken to not overcook to the point where the pasta turns into a paste.

==Testing the pasta==

Beginners should probably play it safe and stick to the time given in the box.  Experienced cooks test whether the pasta is ready by &quot;fishing&quot; a sample piece out of the boiling water with a slotted spoon and chewing on it. The pasta is ready when it has lost the &quot;flour&quot; taste of uncooked pasta and has become moist and flexible throughout its thickness, but is still firm enough to need chewing.

==Drain and serve==

When the pasta is cooked, it should be drained promptly with a [[Cookbook:Strainer|strainer]] or [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]]. To avoid over-drying the pasta, immediately place the pasta on a large plate when it is still dripping a slight amount of water. Quickly mix together with the sauce and other accompaniments. The pasta should be eaten hot within a few minutes, unless the recipe says differently.

Note that the pasta will continue to cook in the colander, so its important you not overcook it in the first place. If you feel you have overcooked the pasta, you can rinse it with cold water to impede the cooking process. However, obviously, you will have cold pasta as a result. Rinsing is a non-optimal solution because it also washes away the starches. Typically, you want starches to help the sauce adhere to the pasta. On the other hand, if you are making a non-sauced pasta such as [[Cookbook:Pierogi|pierogi]], you might want to wash the pasta to prevent them from sticking to one another.

==Storing cooked pasta==

When preparing a large portion that cannot be served immediately, for example, for a buffet-style meal &amp;mdash; it is advisable to cool off the pasta a bit, immediately after draining it. Otherwise the heat still remaining in the pasta may cause it to overcook and stick to itself.  This can be done by rinsing the pasta quickly in cold water, or spreading it out on a wide bowl or tray, or tossing it up into the air a few times with the colander.

For the same reason, it is better to allow the pasta get cold, and re-heat it before serving, than trying to keep it hot for a long time. In this case, it should be drained a bit earlier than the optimum point; each portion can be reheated by placing it in a strainer and plunging it for a few seconds into ''salted'' boiling water.

==Where did I go wrong?==
* ''The pasta came out too mushy'': It is mushy because you overcooked the pasta. Alternatively, you drained the pasta when it was perfectly done, but it continued to cook in the strainer.

* ''The pasta still comes out mushy!'' Low-quality pasta can be next to impossible to cook properly: as soon as it is no longer undercooked, it becomes mushy.  There are many types of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]. Good pasta is usually made with ''semolina'', ''hard wheat'', or ''durum hard wheat''. These qualities of wheat contain little free starch, and more of the endosperm protein that forms the gluten that gives pasta its consistency. Low-quality pasta is often made with flour that has a higher content of free starch grains, so that once it cooks it becomes mushy. 

* ''My recipe called for X-amount of sauce, yet the pasta soaked the sauce up with little leftover'': People tend to over-drain their pasta. Drain the pasta when there it is still slightly dripping. Alternatively, add some olive oil to the drained pasta prior to saucing it.

* ''My pasta is undercooked, yet I followed the directions on the box.'' The box is a guideline and its advice should be used with caution. The pasta wasn't cooked for long enough. After adding the pasta, wait for the water to boil again and continue to cook for as long as the box says.

* ''My ravioli came out a soggy mess and they fell apart.'' A rolling boil can do damage to filled pasta. Return the pot to a boil after placing in pasta, and turn the heat to medium once a rolling boil is achieved. 

* ''I was told pasta is done when throwing it sticks it against a cabinet. Is this true?'' This is not true; it simply means your pasta is sufficiently sticky. The center of the pasta could still be raw.

* ''Does adding oil to the pasta water make it not stick'': Water and oil don't mix when they're cold, and they don't mix when they're hot. Most of the oil will float to the the surface of the boiling water, far away from the pasta you want to protect, but potentially reducing foaming. When you drain the pasta, you dump the oil out first, so little if any oil will touch the pasta.

'''Rhubarb crumble''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]. Served traditionally with [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] (though you can of course serve with [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]]) it is a hearty, filling, and warm feast, best served after a light meal. We have included two recipes in this page: some people like to make the crumble topping with oats, and some just with flour.

==Recipe version 1==
This version is a flour-based crumble topping, and simply uses rhubarb and sugar as the filling (unlike the cornstarch etc in version 2). The rhubarb juice acts as a sufficient sauce.

===Ingredients===
*400g [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]], cut into pieces roughly about 1.5 cm long (no need to be consistent)
*15g (2 tbsp) light [[Cookbook:Sugar|brown sugar]]
*75g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|marge]]
*100g [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
*50g [[Cookbook:Flour|wholemeal flour]]
*50g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*Pinch of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] (optional)

===Method===
#Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan).
#Rinse and drain the rhubarb pieces, and place them in a deep ovenproof dish. Add the light brown sugar and mix briefly.
#Put the flours in a mixing bowl. Add the butter/marge to this bowl - not in one large lump, in pieces. With your fingers (not the palms of your hands), rub the marge into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs.
#Sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon over this mixture, and mix them in briefly.
#Sprinkle the crumble mixture over the fruit, making a complete layer. Do not press the topping down - you want it light and crumbly.
#Put the dish in the oven (no lid) for 35-45 minutes until crisp and a bit brown.

Serve with custard.

==Recipe version 2==
This version uses '''oats''' in the crumble mixture, and also is rather unusual in putting some crumble mixture as a layer on the bottom (not just on top).

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Oats|oat]]s
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*4 cup uncooked cut up [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]/cornflour
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

===Method===
#Mix brown sugar, oats, flour, butter and cinnamon until crumbly.
#Press 1/2 of mixture into a 9 inch square pan.
# Cover crumb mixture with cut up rhubarb.
# Mix white sugar, cornstarch and water. Cook until clear and thick, stirring constantly. Add vanilla and stir.
# Pour over rhubarb. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture over the top. 
# [[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for 1 hour at 180&amp;deg;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]].

A cake is a type of leavened dessert, usually made from wheat flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk and some chemical [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening]]. Cakes should be delicate and moist; the batter should not be mixed for too long so as to avoid building up [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]], and the cake should not be cooked too long so as to avoid drying it out or burning.

The term &quot;cake&quot; is also used for small, flattened balls of dough, as in [[Cookbook:Indian Pone|pone]], or for cooked batters, as in [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]].

The following recipe is quite common in most of Mexico as a breakfast item, due to the addition of eggs, but is also eaten throughout the day including during dinner time.  I've included an additional recipe for a ''salsa de chile de arbol'' that will be used as the primary sauce.  The following recipe is intended as a single serving, adjust the ingredients exponentially to make larger quantities.

= Ingredients = 
* Vegetable Oil (enough to cover the tortillas to deep fry them)
* 2 Corn Tortillas cut into strips and then into squares (preferably day old)
* 1 large Egg
* 1/4 of an Onion diced (white onion is mainly used in Mexican cooking)

* '''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'''
* 1 cup of Tomatillos, husks taken off and roasted (these are found extensively in most Mexican groceries and are somewhat common in larger urban supermarkets)
* 4 to 6 dried Chiles de Arbol roasted (these are quite hot and you should adjust to your liking)
* 1 roasted Garlic
* 1/2 cup of Water
* Salt and Pepper to taste

* crumbled or shredded Cheese (you can use anything that melts well, i like to use monterey jack or manchego, however you can utilize your favorite cheese for this recipe)

== Procedure == 

# Begin by making the ''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'': roast the tomatillos by wrapping them in heavy duty aluminum foil and placing them on a comal over your stovetop (this does not need to be done in the oven, it never is in Mexico).  After roasting the tomatillos for approximately 15 to 20 minutes you can pull them off the fire and roast the dried chilies and garlic directly on the comal (caution, the dried chilies will roast in less than a minute while the garlic will take longer).  Combine the roasted tomatillos, chilies and garlic along with the water, salt and pepper in a blender.  Liquify the mixture thoroughly for a few minutes to ensure that the sauce is smooth and consistent with no large pieces left floating around.  You will probably end up with more salsa than you need for this recipe.  Use it as a condiment for any other of your favorite Mexican dishes!
# Next, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan until it is hot enough so that when you drop the pieces of tortillas into it they immediately begin to fry at a rapid pace.
# Allow the tortillas to fry until they become a chestnut brown, just not too dark or burnt.  At this point, drain most of the oil out of the pan leaving only enough to fry the rest of the ingredients.
# Crack the egg into the fried tortillas and scramble it, folding the fried tortilla strips into the egg.  At this point season this mixture with salt and pepper if desired.  Take this mixture out of the pan and let it rest on a plate while you continue with the rest of the dish.
# Add some of the oil that was taken out of the pan earlier back into it and heat it up again.  To this add the diced onion and allow it to soften for a few minutes.  Add the ''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'' to the oil and onions and sauté it for a minute or two.  Add a little bit of water to dilute it if it becomes too thick.
# Finally, return the fried tortilla and egg mixture to the onion and chili sauce in the pan and allow it cook only for about a minute, enough time to allow the tortillas to soak up some of the sauce.  Before plating it, add the cheese and enjoy!



==Variations==

In Mexico, very rarely is this dish made with tortilla chips but rather day-old tortillas that have stiffened.  If you don't have day-old tortillas you can leave out fresh tortillas until they are stiff to get the right texture.  The recipe for the chili sauce used in this recipe is of course a red sauce.  If you prefer a green sauce, simply substitute the chiles de arbol for fresh jalapeño chilies that you can also roast in the same way.  After you have roasted the chilies on the comal and thoroughly burnt the skins, place the chilies in a plastic bag with a small amount of water so as to allow them to steam.  After about 5 minutes, remove the jalapeños from the bag and simply rub the skin off of them.  Continue to make the sauce as indicated above.

Also this dish can be made with strips of chicken in addition to or as a replacement for the egg.  In Mexico chilaquiles are often served throughout the day and as such the addition of chicken strips will complement it as a dinner item.  Using all the same ingredients just add some warmed and shredded chicken meat during the last step before you add the cheese.  Oftentimes, my mother would add a little bit of Mexican cream (somewhat like sour cream but more akin to creme fraiche) over the top of the chilaquiles right before we enjoyed them on our serving plate as a way to tone down the spicy heat of the dish.

An '''oatcake''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] made from [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]],  cooked on a [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]].

=North Staffordshire Oatcakes=
North Staffordshire oatcakes are a local delicacy in the North Staffordshire (Stoke-on-Trent) area of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]], and so may be known to non-locals as a ''North Staffordshire oatcake'' or ''Potteries oatcake''. These use [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], whereas other oatcakes do not. When pre-cooked, they are a form of fast food, and catering outlets in the area usually offer oatcakes with fillings such as [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] and [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]. They can be re-heated by [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] in butter, or by [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilling]]. In addition, [[Cookbook:Pikelet|pikelets]] are often served alongside oatcakes in a similar fashion.

== Ingredients ==
* 8oz fine oatmeal
* 8oz wholemeal or plain flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2oz fresh yeast
* 1 1/2 pints warm milk and water, mixed half and half
* 1 teaspoon sugar

== Procedure ==
# Add the salt to the flour and oatmeal.
# Dissolve the yeast with a little warm liquid and add the sugar. Allow the mixture to become frothy.
# Mix the dry ingredients with the yeast liquid to make a batter.
# Cover the batter with a clean cloth and leave it in a warm place for an hour.
# Bake the oatcake on a well-greased griddle. Put enough batter onto the griddle to produce an oatcake about 8-9 inches in diameter. The surface will be covered in holes as it cooks. 
# Turn the oatcake after 2 - 3 minutes when the upper side appears dry and the underneath is golden brown, and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes.

* 250 g (1 cup) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 100 g (0.4 cups) of medium soft [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] (leave it out for a half-hour before making the crust)
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* some lukewarm water
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

=== Filling ===
*1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|aubergine]]s (eggplants)
*1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s
*4 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]es
*150 g (0.6 cups) of [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s
*some grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
*some [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*an [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] yolk
*near the end, some fresh [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]

== Procedure ==
=== Crust ===
# Pour the flour into a large bowl. 
# Add the portions of butter. 
# Knead everything until the pastry is nearly consistent. 
# Add the egg, then some water bit by bit while working the pastry with your hands until it becomes soft and smooth. 
# It should not be sticky, and it should look shiny and medium yellow.

=== Filling ===
# Cut the vegetables into thin slices. 
# Brown the vegetables in oil or butter, or you may steam them. 
# Begin with the onions and aubergines (eggplant), then the mushrooms. 
# Keep the tomatoes raw. 

=== Putting it together ===
# Butter the pie pan and shape the pastry into the pan.
# Pre-heat the crust for about 10 minutes at medium heat after making small holes in the base of the pan. 
# So the pastry does not swell up, place some aluminum foil in a curved shape over the pastry. 
# Once the pastry is precooked take it out of the oven and arrange the cooked vegetables over the crust in whatever arrangement pleases you.
# In a bowl, mix the egg yolk with some milk and a bit of fresh cream, then pour the mixture on top of the vegetables. 
# Cover with grated cheese.

'''Salted mustard greens and shredded meat noodle soup''' (&amp;#38634;&amp;#33756;&amp;#32905;&amp;#32114;&amp;#40629;) is a Chinese dish composed of salted mustard greens (&amp;#38634;&amp;#35041;&amp;#32005;), shredded pork (&amp;#32905;&amp;#32114;), soup stock, and noodles.  Many Chinese restaurants in the US serve this dish.  All quantities are approximate.

* [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]

==Procedure==

# Wash and dry the mustard greens.

# Seal in a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator for several days.
# Cut the pork tenderloin meat into tiny strips.  Marinate the meat with corn starch, soy sauce, and sugar.
# Retrieve the semi-pickled mustard greens and dice them.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]], stir-fry the meat until it is slightly brown.  Remove the meat from the wok.

A refreshing topping for carbohydrate and meat-style foods. The [[:Category:South American recipes|South American]] equivalent of [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]. Sarza Criolla goes well on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]], slabs of boiled potatoes, [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Tamales|tamales]], and [[Cookbook:Quesadilla|quesadillas]].

== Ingredients ==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (optional)
* chopped boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (optional)
* chopped boiled or pickled [[Cookbook:Beet|beets]] (optional)
* chopped (not mashed) [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]] (optional)

==Procedure==
# Cleave the onion from top to bottom, along the grain, then slice it fine across the grain, forming half-rings. 
# Rinse in cold water, soak in cold water for around 5 minutes, and rinse again.  This procedure washes away the contents of the plant cells destroyed by the knife, taking the sting out of the onion's flavor.
# Squeeze over it the juice of the lime.
# Optionally toss in the cilantro, potatoes, beets, or avocado.

=== Vowels ===
Rohingya has 6 soft-sound(normal) vowels and 6 hard-sound(accented) vowels.
 a  e  i  o  u  ou
 á  é  í  ó  ú  óu
Each vowel gives only one sound as the '''bold''' vowels in the English phrase:- 
 &quot;'''A'''m'''é'''r'''i'''ca '''o'''n f'''ú'''ll t'''ou'''r&quot; or in the Rohingya phrase:- 
 &quot;'''A'''l'''e'''m'''i''' m'''o'''d'''ú'''r h'''ou'''li&quot; meaning ''International Honey Center''.
   
=== Circular vowels ===
Rohingya uses at least 4 circular vowels (in each set) as:-
 ai  ei  oi  ui   (for soft sounds)
 ái  éi  ói  úi   (for hard sounds)
which are pronounced as in words D'''ái'''l, F'''éi'''l, '''Owi''', B'''úi'''ck respectively.
   
=== Long vowels and its variants ===
Rohingya uses double vowels to extend the sound. For example
 aa  for simple extending of '''a''' sound, like G'''aa''' means body. 
 aá  for slow to raised up of '''a''' sound, like '''Gaá''' means sing and
 áa  for raised to slowing down of '''a''' sound, like G'''áa''' means infections.

==More on the origins of physics==

The view of physics taught at school is quite different from modern physics.  Elementary School Physics concentrates on lumps of matter undergoing accelerations, collisions, extensions and motions in set directions. In real physics the world is understood as a collection of events occurring in a 'manifold' that dictates the freedom for motion. Each event or phenomenon is either directed and has the properties of a '''vector''' or not directed and has the properties of a '''scalar'''.  Directed events have a magnitude that is a property of the event or phenomenon itself. The interaction of events with the world depends upon the angle between the direction of the event and the thing with which it interacts. So, in physics phenomena have an intrinsic magnitude and this can cause effects on other things according to the way they interact in space and time. In real physics all interactions depend on both magnitude and the spatio-temporal relations between things.

The next big departure between physics and School Physics is the '''conservation laws'''.  In physics it is understood that space and time are symmetrical and that the freedom for things to move evenly in all spatial directions results in the conservation of linear momentum, the evenness of time results in the conservation of energy etc. The discovery of the role of symmetry in the conservation laws arose out of the Lagrangian form of analysis and will be discussed below.  The application of the Lagrangian method in quantum mechanics demonstrates why large objects take particular paths in the real world and can be used to derive and explain Newtonian mechanics.

It is the deep attachment of biologists and AI researchers to School Physics that is probably the chief obstacle to making progress in areas such as consciousness studies.  The fact that the world can, to some extent, be described by processes should not blind us to the fact that the classical world of our observation is actually arrangements of things governed by metrical geometry and quantum physics.

==Action==

Most of those people who have been taught physics at school learnt Newton's original approach.  This seventeenth century approach to physics has been superseded.  It will come as a shock to many students to know that it was first superseded in the eighteenth century. What you were taught in school physics is an approach that is two hundred years out of date.

Fortunately the approach discovered over two centuries ago is still widely applicable, even in modern physics, so it is easy to catch up. The eighteenth century approach is known as '''Lagrangian mechanics''' (devised by Joseph Lagrange between 1772 and 1788).  Lagrangian mechanics concentrates on the ''energy'' exchanges during motion rather than on the forces involved. Lagrangian mechanics gave rise to Hamiltonian mechanics (devised by William Hamilton 1833).

Consider a toy train running along friction free tracks. We want to work out the path it takes to get from the start to the finish of the track using our intuitions about energy and motion. If the train is run freely along the track it is found to take a particular time to get to the finish. If, on a second run, the train is reversed then set back in motion in the original direction to finish at the same time any amount of energy could be used to get the train from the start to the finish.  It is evident that if the train is to get from the start to the finish in a given time then the least amount of energy used over the period occurs when there are no interventions. 

We could measure all the forms of energy used to slow down or speed up the train to see if an intervention has occurred but it turns out that only the kinetic energy of the train needs to be measured. If the train is slowed down, subtracting kinetic energy, then for the train to get to the end of the track at the proper time even more kinetic energy must be added when pushing it forward again for it to arrive at the finish on time.  This means that we can account for the energy expenditure that affects the motion of the train by simply measuring the kinetic energy at intervals.  The minimum amount of kinetic energy over the whole period of the trip corresponds to no interventions.

No interventions occur when the sum of all the kinetic energy measurements are zero.  The sum of the kinetic energy measurements in the toy train system is known as the '''action''' and has the symbol '''S'''. 

The action can be more complicated than a simple sum of kinetic energies, for instance when a ball is thrown into the air the kinetic energy can be converted into potential energy and vice versa. If a ball is thrown into the air and hits the ground after a definite time then the minimum interventions occur when the sum of the measurements of the difference between the kinetic and potential energy over the interval is a minimum. In this case the 'action' is the sum of the measurements of the difference between the kinetic and potential energies.

Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis discovered the idea of least action in 1746.  He defined the action as the product of the time over which a movement occurs and twice the kinetic energy of the moving object. He found that this product tends to a minimum and this idea became called the '''Principle of Least Action'''.

The work of Euler, Lagrange and Hamilton has led to the concepts in the principle of least action being applied to the whole of physics.  This wider and modified principle of least action is now called the '''Principle of Stationary Action'''.

In mathematical terms the action, S,  is given by:

&lt;math&gt; S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\ (T - U) \,dt.  &lt;/math&gt;

where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy.

The quantity (T - U) is known as the '''Langrangian function''' so if:

&lt;math&gt;L = T - U&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian depends upon the position and the derivative of the position with respect to time &lt;math&gt;(x,\dot{x})&lt;/math&gt;. The action is:

: &lt;math&gt; S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; L(x,\dot{x})\,dt.  &lt;/math&gt;

The problem is to determine how the Lagrangian, &lt;math&gt; (T-U) &lt;/math&gt;, can vary with distance, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so that the action, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is minimised.  In other words, given relationships between &lt;math&gt;T, U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x &lt;/math&gt;, what curve of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; against &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; will contain the minimum area. (This process is known as finding the minimising ''extremal curve'' for the integral). 

The starting point for calculating the least ''action'' in this way is Euler's calculation of variations method  (see Hanc 2005). This results in the Euler-Lagrange equation:

: &lt;math&gt; {\partial L\over\partial x_{a}} - {d\over dt }{\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}_{a}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which is a complicated formula for finding the extremal curve.

==The Lagrangian==

The Langrangian &lt;math&gt;(T - U)&lt;/math&gt; finds immediate applications in simple mechanics.  In simple mechanics the kinetic energy of a moving object is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; T =  \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

which, as &lt;math&gt; v = \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; (the time derivative of distance), equals:

: &lt;math&gt; T =  \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the potential energy is usually directly proportional to distance:

: &lt;math&gt; U = kx &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; U = mgh &lt;/math&gt; etc..

The Lagrangian is then:

: &lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2 - U(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;  {\partial L\over\partial x} = -{dU\over dx}&lt;/math&gt;

but Newtonian force is the change in potential energy with distance so:

: &lt;math&gt;  {\partial L\over\partial x} = force&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating Lagrangian with respect to &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; {\partial L\over\partial \dot{x}}  = m \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;m \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is Newtonian momentum. 

So:

: &lt;math&gt;  {d\over dt }{\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}} 
  = m \dot\dot{x} &lt;/math&gt;

which is Newtonian force.  Hence:


: &lt;math&gt;   {\partial L\over\partial x} = {d\over dt }{\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the Lagrangian equivalent of &lt;math&gt; f = ma&lt;/math&gt;

==Hamiltonian mechanics==

Hamiltonian mechanics starts from the idea of expressing the total energy of a system:

:&lt;math&gt;H = T + U &lt;/math&gt;

where T is the kinetic energy and U is the potential energy. The Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the momentum, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the Lagrangian:

: &lt;math&gt;H_{(p, \dot{x})} = p\dot{x} - L_{(x, \dot{x})}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the Hamiltonian with respect to momentum velocity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial H\over\partial p} = \dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the Hamiltonian with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we can derive the Hamiltonian expression for force:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial H\over\partial x} = -{\partial L\over\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; -{\partial H\over\partial x} = \dot{p} = force&lt;/math&gt;.

==Lagrangian analysis and conservation laws==

The Euler-Lagrange equation can be re-organised as:

: &lt;math&gt; {\partial L\over\partial x} = {d\over dt }{\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

If one side of this equation is zero then the other side is also zero. This means that, for instance, if there is no change in kinetic-potential energy with distance then &lt;math&gt;\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is constant or ''conserved''.

In the discussion of action above it was shown that changes in the kinetic and potential energy are due to perturbations in the course or progress of an object. In other words changes in the Lagrangian will occur in Euclidean space if an object is perturbed in its motion and &lt;math&gt;\partial L\over\partial x&lt;/math&gt; will be zero if the path is unperturbed.

In the case of a freely moving particle:

: &lt;math&gt; L =  \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial L\over\partial\dot{x}} = m\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

If 

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial L\over\partial x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Then 

:&lt;math&gt;m\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;

the momentum, is conserved.

Emmy Noether systematically investigated the relationship between conservation laws, symmetries and invariant quantities. The following symmetries are shown with their corresponding conservation laws:

Translation in space: '''conservation of momentum'''.

Translation in time: '''conservation of energy'''

Spatial rotation: '''conservation of angular momentum'''

Hyperbolic rotation (Lorentz boost): '''conservation of energy-momentum 4 vector'''

Aspartame is an artificial sweetener containing phenylanine and aspartic acid. It is about 160 times sweeter than sugar. Some common uses for aspartame are sugarless gum, breath mints, and drinks. However, some other sweeteners such as [[Cookbook: Acesulfame Potassium|acesulfame potassium]] are often used instead because phenylalanine, one of the ingredients in aspartame, can severely affect people with phenylketonuria. Thus products containing aspartame must include a warning usually stating &quot;contains a source of phenylalanine.&quot;
The American trade names for the sweetener are Equal and Nutrasweet.

      <comment>moved [[Portuguese grammar/Orthography]] to [[Portuguese Grammar/Orthography]]: Title caseing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Portuguese orthography is close to the [[w:Latin|Latin]] one, although not so close as French is. Written, it is very similar to Spanish.
A text in Portuguese is easy to read, and the reader will have trouble only with the letters ''x'', ''e'' and ''o''. Although, writing is more complicated and involves etimological rules, i. e., the spelling of some words are defined by Latin. The phoneme [[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]], for instance, can be written in seven ways: ''s'', ''c'', ''ss'', ''x'', ''ç'', ''sc'' or ''sç'',

== About the letters ==

=== ''c'' ===
*''c'' represents the phoneme /[[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]/ before the vowels e (é, ê) and i (í).
*''c'' represents the phoneme /[[w:Voiceless velar plosive|k]]/ in all other situations.

=== ''g'' ===
*''g'' represents the phoneme /[[w:Voiced postalveolar fricative|ʒ]]/ before the vowels e (é, ê) and i (í).
*''g'' represents the phoneme /[[w:Voiced velar plosive|k]]/ in all other situations.

=== ''h'' ===

As h is never pronouced, it is written by etymological reasons or in digraphs.

In the beginning of the word&lt;sup id=&quot;fn_1_back&quot;&gt;[[#fn_1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;, ''h'' are sometimes written in words that also begin in ''h'' in Latin: 
*''haver'' (to have)
*''honra'' (honor)
*''homem'' (man)
*''honesto'' (honest)
*''hora'' (hour)
*''horta'' (kitchen garden)
*''harmonia'' (harmony)

Contrarely to Italian and French, but similar to Spanish, Portuguese does write the letter ''h'' in all the forms of the verb ''haver'' (to have / there be): ''hão'', ''havia'', ''houvera'', ''há''.

In the middle of the word, there is never a mute ''h'' and it is supressed in compound words, except if hyphen is used:
* ''habilitar → reabilitar''
* ''harmonia → desarmonia''
* ''higiênico → anti-higiênico''

In the end of the word, it is used just in a few number of interjections &lt;sup id=&quot;fn_2_back&quot;&gt;[[#fn_2|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;:
* ''ah!''
* ''oh!''
* ''puh!''

=== ''m, n'' ===
These letters, normally represents the phonemes /[[w:Bilabial nasal|m]]/ and /[[w:Alveolar nasal|n]]/, but, after a vowel, it indicates the nasalisation of the preecedent vowel.

* ''assunto'' → /as&amp;u#771to/
* ''conta'' → /kõta/
* ''impar'' → /i&amp;#771;paɾ/
* ''mentiroso'' → /me&amp;#771;tiɾozu/
* ''sambar'' → /sãbaɾ/

As sign of nasalisation, we use ''m'' before ''p'' and ''b'' and ''n'' in the other cases.

=== ''r'' ===
''r'' represents two phonemes.

*The ''r'' is pronouced '''strong''' - /[[w:Voiced uvular fricative|ʁ]]/ - in the beginning of the word, after a consonant or when it is doubled, in the digraph ''rr''. 

*In all other situations, ''r'' is pronounced '''weak''', /[[w:Alveolar tap|ɾ]]/.

=== ''s'' ===
''s'' is pronouced /[[w:Voiced alveolar fricative|z]]/ between two vowels. In all other situations, it is pronouced /[[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]/.

=== ''x'' ===
''x'' can be pronouced in five different ways.
In the beginning of the word, ''x'' is generally pronouced /[[w:Voiceless postalveolar fricative|ʃ]]/.

*''mexer'' → /meʃer/ (to stir)
*''xarope'' → /ʃaɾopi/ (syrup)
*''xeque-mate'' → /ʃekimati/ (checkmate)

''x'' is pronouced /[[w:Voiceless aveolar fricative|s]]/ before a consonant. Before /[[w:Voiceless aveolar fricative|s]]/ spelled as ''c'', the letter is soundless.

*''exceto'' → /esɛto/ (except)
*''exportar'' → /espoɾtaɾ/ (to export)
*''explodir'' → /esplodiɾ/ (to explode)
*''ex-prefeito'' → /esprefeɪtu/(ex-mayor)

It is pronouced /[[w:Voiceless velar plosive|k]][[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]/ in loan words and between two vowels.

*''óxido'' → /ɔksidu/
*''tóxico'' → /tɔksiku/

Finally, it can be pronounced /[[w:Voiced alveolar fricative|z]]/, between two vowels.
*exato → /ezatu/
*exigência → /eziʒe&amp;#771;sia/

=== ''k, w, y'' ===
These letters are used only in loan words and international abbreviations:

* byronista
* delivery
* km (quilómetro)
* rock
* skate
* show
* wagneriano
* whiskey

== The diacritics ==

=== Cedilha ===

Portuguese, as [[w:French language|French]] and [[w:Catalan language|Catalan]], uses [[w:cedilla|cedilla]] (in Portuguese, ''cedilha'') to spell the sound /[[w:Voiceless alveolar fricative|s]]/ before the letters ''a'', ''o'', ''u''.

* ''caçar'' - /{{IPA|kasaɾ}}/
* ''criança'' - /{{IPA|kriɐ&amp;#771;sɐ}}/ (children)
* ''paço'' - /{{IPA|pasu}}

=== Tilde ===

=== Tonic accent ===

----

&lt;cite id=&quot;fn_1&quot;&gt;[[#fn_1_back|Note 1:]]&lt;/cite&gt; In vocative, the interjection used is '''ó''': ''Ergue-te, ó Radamés, ó meu vassalo'' (Luís Delfino).

&lt;cite id=&quot;fn_2&quot;&gt;[[#fn_2_back|Note 2:]]&lt;/cite&gt; There is only one exception: the interjection ha! or hahaha!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Harmonic mean is most commonly preferred when the data is given in terms of speed (e.g. km/hour), rate (e.g. kg/rupee) etc. The harmonic mean is defined as the reciprocal of arithmetic mean of reciprocals of the items in a given series.

This is an  appropriate wikibook. There is at least one book that is/was in print that covered the idea of island construction in fair detail. The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps by Marshall T. Savage 


There's alredy a lot of text here, i understand how someone may think that but people have actually done this before, and I'm about to put up a list of reasons for doing it. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 19:28, 26 July 2005 (UTC) Also this doesn't seem to be covered by speedy deletion as no meaningful content in wikibooks deletion policy is typing giberish like this: &quot;kjasjdfh&quot;

What would really stop this is if someone would start making their own island using this book right now. Any takers?

delete it no useful content. just one persons stupid ideas 02:27, 27 July 2005 (UTC)~~

I'm sure they aren't ideas if they're actually being used and work. Also since i was the only one who put something on the votes for deletion page as &quot;keep&quot; i removed all those notices since it was already removed from the speedy deletion list. Just because you don't like a book or disagree with it doesn't mean you can destroy every copy of it. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 02:34, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

You could write also something about legal aspects of making your own Island. How to declare independence, estabilish embassies, and not be annexed :)

A.

planning on doing &quot;declaring independence,&quot; and the only way i can think of to not be annexed is to literally move the island.
----
It doesn't seem like anyone would actually use this (anyone ever heard of a private island declaring independence from a well known source?). --[[User:Member|Member]] 18:37, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

There is now an external link about a someone who tried in the 70's to, until it was taken over by another country's military.

Ripley's believe it or not is a credible source and that island is technicaly an independent nation. Declaring independence is optional.
----
On a different note, would it be wise to add a disclaimer for the wikibook? -anon

---- 
There is the little fort in the english channel (sealand iirc) that calls itself an independant state. I think the guy who runs it is called king roy or something similar... (no time to double check as I'm at work)
Only reason its not been challenged is because the uk govenment can't be bothered since they know it belongs to the uk.

I added my notes on my site (see external links) feel free to add them to the site, I removed all copyrighted material except one table which has been edited by me and the data in which should he public domain.

I personally don't think that reclaiming land for an island is a particularly viable especially if you are going to potentially want to become independant one day. Since you will be unable to move if a local nation decides to claim you... (see the republic of minerva for an example)

Also a modular floating island (built more along the lines of a ship) is more easily expanded, repaired and adapted to changing conditions. Especially if many islands are built with compatible modules. You could join and split the islands as the needs arise.
BTW, feel free to contact me off site if you wish to... mike at technomonk dot com

== An interesting orphan Wikibook module ==

I have an interesting Wikibook module that this Wikibook could &quot;adopt&quot; and add to the content of this Wikibook:

*[[International law:Public International Law:Law of the Sea]]

I would recommend that you rename the page to conform to the naming standards of this Wikibook.  Mind you, no other Wikibook claims this page, so you are free to use it, or if you don't want to, simply throw a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template tag on it, or try to throw it to some other Wikibook.  It was added awhile ago by an anonymous user, and no way to know what else they intended.  I since found a duplicate page ([[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]), but it would still be something interesting to add to this Wikibook.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:03, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:Erm, this is not an orphan, but a page of the book [[International law]], as is clear from checking [[Special:Whatlinkshere/International law:Public International Law:Public International Law of the Sea]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:30, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::Actually, it is.  There is another module that has almost identcal content, so I guess it really should be a speedy delete.  I was just trying to &quot;find a home&quot; instead of killing it.  My &quot;What links here&quot; gives only this talk page, so I don't know what the difference would be between my account and yours.  OK, I think I got it:  Try [[Special:Whatlinkshere/International law:Public International Law:Law of the Sea]].  That gives only this talk page as the link.  If you feel it should be a speedy delete, let's kill it.  I just thought that this would be an interesting page to heavily modify to fit this Wikibook, and what better than to take a trash page that already needs to be reworked or deleted and fix it up to talk about International law, oceanic boundaries, and artificial islands.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:41, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Erk. You're correct. I got confused between:
:::* [[International law:Public International Law:Law of the Sea]]
:::* [[International law:Public International Law:Public International Law of the Sea]]
::: Doesn't really matter. Point is, it still follows [[WB:NP]], and thus both should be considered subpages of the pages [[International law:Public International Law]]. Just seems the author neglected to link the former of those page from the parent page. The book's a bit of a mess, but I don't think it's appropriate to rename it, since the original author may come back and fix it (or someone else might). The page [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] is also linked from [[International law:Public International Law]], and is probably also considered a part of this book. I it would be better to fix the page [[International law:Public International Law]], and the pages it links to, then link to it from [[Making an Island]]. Seems a bit rude to rip a page out of one book and stick it in another. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:48, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::::I guess I'll just have to do it to show you what I meant.  The two pages, [[International law:Public International Law:Law of the Sea]] and [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] are word-for-word identical in content, and the UN page is linked to the international law, so I would say the original page under discussion simply needs to be speedily deleted, with a link from this Wikibook to the UN page.  A fork of the UN page can be '''heavily modified''', but that is for another day.  I'm sorry that I had to make such a mess here.  This has nothing to do with [[WB:NP]] but rather [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]].--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:25, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

:: My goal in life is in fact to create a floating town, I would appreciate it if this wasn't the only source....this information appears outdated and does not take advantage of modern technology. Seems like I need to write a book myself.

== Coconuts to be dropped? ==

Anyone else think that the coconut section on http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Making_an_Island:Communication should be dropped? Since this is a community effort I don't want to go deleting something without at least someone else agreeing...

[[User:Darkflib|Darkflib]] 20:18, 10 August 2005 (UTC)



I agree; this method dosn't sound plausible in any way.
--[[User:Shdwninja8|Shdwninja8]] 05:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

== Pictures ==

If anyone has a pond or creek in their backyard they could test out some of the construction methods on small scale and send pictures in. some ideas: examples of all the methods, seeing how the island holds up agianst plants of different sizes (grass-trees) what makes the strongest base, etc...



== Population ==

There should be an article on encouraging population on the island, unless there's a good reason not to. I honestly have no idea how I would do that (populate the island), so if anyone sees a way please add it!

== Deletion of [[Making an Island:The Island as a Secret Fortress]] ==

I'm not completely sure how many people actually look at this page, but I think this comparatively new module is totally over the top.  This is not the Uncyclopedia (perhaps a transwiki to that project?), but rather a serious attempt to try and discuss what issues may be related to island construction and motivations for creating such structures.

If there is somebody who is even a semi-active participant who wants to defend having this page as a part of this Wikibook, I'm willing to listen.  In short, this is a &quot;VfD&quot; for this page that I am taking within the participants of this Wikibook.  If there is no objection, in a few weeks I'll go ahead and delete this page.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:38, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

I would like to defend [[Making an Island:The Island as a Secret Fortress]]. This is the logical final step in making an island. --[[User:DavesTA|DavesTA]] 03:40, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

== Rewrite introduction for [[Making_an_Island/Declaring_Independence]]? ==

On [[Making_an_Island/Declaring_Independence]] it reads:
 &quot;You are only an independent nation when enough current nations agree that you are.&quot;

However this is somewhat untrue but can also be regarded as true as well. Simply put, it's misleading. You are only '''recognized''' when there's an agreement to recognize you, but you're still an independent nation, and can function as one with or without recognition.

Take the Principality of Sealand for example. Prince Roy occupied an old anti-aircraft see fort, previously owned by the UK. (A little note, the UK no longer owns the fort and is certainly the property of Sealand) Once the Navy learned of Sealand and their use of the old fort, the went to take back the fort. On arrival, Prince Roy fired &quot;warning shots&quot; at the UK Navy. As Prince Roy was also a British citezen, he was summoned before a court with the charges of firing at the navy, however, the court recognized that they had no jurisdictional power over Sealand or the fort, and threw it out of the window.

An even stronger example of the Principality of Sealand is the time a German and two Dutchman went to do business with the Government of Sealand. However, the 3 men took hostage Prince Michael, (Prince Roy's son) and of Sealand. Prince Roy, overcome the 3, rescued his son, retook Sealand, and imprisoned the 3 men as Prisoners Of War (POW). 
The Germans and the Dutch petitioned to the UK for release of these people, but the UK referred to the previous Court ruling and said it wasn't under their jurisdiction. So the Germans and Dutch sent a diplomat to Sealand to request the POW's release.

The history itself testifies to being an independent nation. Declaring independence is unnecessary.

== Seasteading ==

Do you know [http://seasteading.org/seastead.org/book_beta/full_book_beta.html this book]? It's not exactly the same, but covers many of the same topics as this book. -- [[Special:Contributions/80.136.103.206|80.136.103.206]] ([[User talk:80.136.103.206|talk]]) 15:10, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

== Requested move ==
I think the page should be moved to [[Micronations/Starting your own micronation/Making an island]], as it would fall more under the jurisdiction of micronations than under anything else. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] ([[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|contribs]]) 16:54, 17 January 2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;</text>

==Elementary Information and Information Systems Theory==

When one physical thing interacts with another a change in &quot;state&quot; occurs. For instance, when a beam of white light, composed of a full spectrum of colours is reflected from a blue surface all colours except blue are absorbed and the light changes from white to blue. When this blue light interacts with an eye it causes blue sensitive cones to undergo a chemical change of state which causes the membrane of the cone to undergo an electrical change of state etc.  The number of distinguishable states that a system can possess is the amount of information that can be encoded by the system.

[[Image:constudinfo1.gif]]

Each distinguishable state is a &quot;bit&quot; of information. The binary symbols &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; have two states and can be used to encode two bits of information.

The binary system is useful because it is probably the simplest encoding of information and any object can represent a binary &quot;1&quot;. In electrical digital systems an electrical pulse represents a &quot;1&quot; and the absence of a pulse represents a &quot;0&quot;. Information can be transferred from place to place with these pulses. Things that transfer information from one place to another are known as &quot;signals&quot;.

[[Image:constudinfo2.gif]]

Information is encoded by changes of state, these changes can occur over time or as variations in density, temperature, colour etc. in the three directions in space. The writing on this page is spatially encoded.

It is interesting that our spoken communication uses a narrow band of sound waves.  This favours the temporal encoding of information, in other words speech is largely a one dimensional stream of symbols. In vision, somesthesis, sound location and some of the other senses the brain uses spatial encoding of information as well as encoding over time.

[[Image:constudinfo3.gif]]

The rearrangement or replacement of a set of information so that some or all of the original information becomes encoded as another set of states is known as &quot;processing&quot;.  Devices that perform these actions are known as &quot;information processors&quot;. The brain is predominantly an information processor.

[[Image:constudinfo4.gif]]

Information systems in general have transducers that convert the state of signals in the world into signals impressed on another carrier, they then subject these signals to various processes and store them.

[[Image:constudcla1.gif]]

The spatial encoding in the brain generally preserves the relation of what is adjacent to what in the sensory field. This allows the form (geometry) of stimuli to be encoded.

Information transfers in the brain occur along numerous parallel &quot;channels&quot; and processes occur within each channel and between channels. Phenomenal consciousness at any moment contains a continuum of simultaneous (parallel) events. Classical processes take time so phenomenal experience is likely to be, at any instant, a simultaneous output of processes, not a classical process itself.

==Classification, signs, sense, relations, supervenience etc.==

A '''sign''' is a symbol, combination of symbols such as a '''word''' or a combination of words.  A '''referent''' is &quot;...that to which the sign refers, which may be called the reference of the sign&quot; (Frege 1892). Statements and concepts usually express relations between referents. 

The '''sense''' of statements depends on more than the simple referents within them, for instance &quot;the morning star is the evening star&quot; is true in terms of the referents but dubious in terms of the sense of the morning and evening stars because the morning star is Venus as seen in the morning and the evening star is Venus as seen in the evening.  So the sense of the expression &quot;the morning star&quot; depends on both the referent &quot;Venus&quot; and the referent &quot;Morning&quot; and probably other associations such as &quot;sunrise&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc..

Each sign is related to many other signs and it is these groups of relationships that provide the sense of a sign or a set of signs. A '''relation''' is an association between things. It can be understood in the abstract as &quot;what is next to what&quot;. Relations occur in both time and space. When a ball bounces the impact with the floor changes the direction of the ball so &quot;direction&quot; is related to &quot;impact&quot;, the ball is round so &quot;ball&quot; is related to &quot;round&quot;. For instance, the morning is next to the presence of the morning star so &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;morning star&quot; are related.  Relations are the connections that allow classification.  

According to the physical concept of information all abstract signs are physical states of a signal and are only abstract according to whether they are related to a physical thing or exclusively to another sign. The process of treating an abstract idea as if it were a concrete thing that contains other concrete things is known as '''reification'''.

It is possible to have statements that have a sense but apparently no reference. As Frege put it, the words 'the celestial body most distant from the Earth' have a sense but may not have a reference. There can be classes of things that have not yet acquired any members or have no members. In a physical sense a particular '''class''' is a sign that refers to a particular state or set of states. Classes can be arbitrary such as &quot;big things&quot; being all things that have a state of being over one metre long. Classes and '''sets''' are very similar, sometimes sets are defined as being a class that is an element of another class. The term &quot;set&quot; has largely superseded the term &quot;class&quot; in academic publications since the mid twentieth century.

The '''intension''' of a set is its description or defining properties. The '''extension''' of a set is its members or contents. In mathematics a set is simply its members, or extension. In philosophy there is considerable discussion of the way that a given description can describe more than one thing. In other words, one intension can have several extensions. The set of things that are &quot;tables&quot; has the properties &quot;legs&quot;, &quot;flat surface&quot; etc. The extension of &quot;tables&quot; is all the physical tables. The intension of &quot;tables&quot; may also include &quot;stools&quot; unless there is further clarification of the properties of &quot;tables&quot;. Intensions are functions that identify the extensions (original members of a set) from the properties.

Classification is performed by information systems and by the information processing parts of the nervous system.  A simple classification is to sort symbols according to a set of rules, for instance a simple '''sort''' classifies words by letter sequence. There are numerous classification systems in the visual system such as arrangements of neurons that produce a single output when a particular orientation of a line is viewed or a particular face is seen etc. The processes that identify attributes and properties of a thing are usually called '''filters'''. 

[[Image:constudcla2.gif]]

The output of filters becomes the properties of a set and specifies the relations between sets. These relations are stored as address pointers in computers or connections in the nervous system.

[[Image:constudcla3.gif]]

An intension uses these properties and relations to identify the things that are members of the set in the world.  Clearly the more specific the filters the more accurate the intension. 

A '''database''' is a collection of signs.  A '''fully relational''' database is a database arranged in related sets with all relationships represented by pointers or connections. In conventional usage a '''relational database''' is similar but more sophisticated, redundant relationships and wasteful storage being avoided.  Conventional relational databases obey &quot;Codd's laws&quot;. An '''hierarchical database''' only contains pointers that point from the top of a classification hierarchy downwards. Events and persistent objects are also known as '''entities''', the output of filters related to entities are known as the '''attributes''' of the entity. In practice a system requires an event filter to record an entity (in a computer system the event filter is usually a single data entry form and the attributes are filtered using boxes on the screen to receive typed input).

[[Image:constudcla5.gif]]

In information systems design there are many ways of representing '''classification hierarchies''', the most common is the '''entity diagram''' which assumes that the attributes of an entity define it and are stored together physically with the symbols that represent the entity. This adjacent storage is purely for convenient management of storage space and reduction of the time required for retrieval in modern computers.  

Filters contain processing agents of varying degrees of sophistication from simple sorting processes to &quot;intelligent&quot; processes such as programs and neural networks. It is also possible to arrange filters in the world beyond an information processor. For instance, an automatic text reading machine might turn over the pages of a book to acquire a particular page. A human being might stroke an object to confirm that the texture is as it appears to be and so on. 

Scientists routinely use external transducers and filters for the purpose of classification. For instance, a mass spectrometer could be used to supply details of the atomic composition of an item. External filters allow us to distinguish between things that are otherwise identical (such as two watery compounds XYZ and H2O) or to acquire properties that are unobservable with biological transducers such as the eyes and ears. The scientist plus his instruments is a single information system. In practice the referent of a set is determined by applying transducers and filters to the world and looking up the results in a relational database. If the result is the original set then a referent has been found. A sophisticated system may apply &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; or other methods to assign a probability that an object is truly a member of a particular set.

It is also possible to classify information according to relationships in time (i.e.: starting a car's engine is related to car moving away). Within an information system the output from the filter for &quot;starting engine&quot; might precede that from the filter for &quot;starts moving&quot;. In information systems design procedures that involve successions of events can be arranged in classification structures in the same way as data; this technique is known as '''structured programming''' (esp. Jackson structured programming).

[[Image:constudstruct.gif]]

Hierarchies related to a single entity are frequently stored together as '''objects''' and the information processing that results is known as '''object oriented programming'''. A fully relational database would, in principle, contain all the objects used in a structured information system. In Part III the storage and sequential retrieval of related functions in the brain is described.

It has been pointed out by (McCarthy and Hayes (1969)) that an information processor that interacts with the environment will be producing continuous changes in all of its classifications (such as position etc.) and also changes in theories (structured programs that are predictive processes) about the world. In a serial processor, such as a Turing Machine with a one dimensional tape, the presence of changes in the world would create a huge burden on the machine. In a parallel processor, such as a biological neural network, the reclassifications should be straightforward. The problem of adapting an information system to changes in the world, most of which have little effect on the processes performed by the system, is known as the '''frame problem'''.  The frame problem is usually stated in a form such as &quot;how is it possible to write formulae that describe the effects of actions without having to write a large number of accompanying formulae that describe the mundane, obvious non-effects of those actions?&quot; (Shanahan 2004).

Chalmers(1996) introduced the terms '''primary intension''' and '''secondary intension'''. Primary intension is a high level description where the properties of a set may be insufficient to specify the contents of the set in the physical world. For instance, the term &quot;watery&quot; might specify several liquids with various compositions. Secondary intension is specific so that it applies to one substance in the world (H2O). In the context of information systems primary intensions differ from secondary intensions as a result of inadequate filtering and classification. (See note below for details of Putnam's twin earth thought experiement).

The problem of matching the properties and relations of an item in a relational database with an item in the world involves the problem of '''supervenience'''.  Supervenience occurs when the properties and relations in the database for an item are the same as the output from filters applied to the item.  In other words, '''in an information system information does not supervene directly on a thing, it supervenes on information derived from the thing'''. Chalmers described supervenience in terms that are accessible to an information systems approach:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The properties of A supervene on the properties of B if no two possible situations are identical with respect to the properties of A while differing with respect to the properties of B (after Chalmers 1996).&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In terms of information processing the ''properties'' are changes in state derived from a transducer that are subject to classification with a filter. The properties of a predictive program would supervene on the input from transducers applied to an object if it correctly identified the sets and sequence of sets that are discovered at all times.

Information theory is consistent with '''physicalism'''. Philosophers coined the term physicalism to describe the argument that there are only physical things. In '''token physicalism''' every event is held to be a physical event and in '''type physicalism''' every property of a mental event is held to have a corresponding property of a physical event. Token physicalism is consistent with information theory because every bit of information is a part of an arrangement of a physical substrate and hence a physical event. Type physicalism would be consistent with information theory if it is held that mental events are also arrangements of substrates. It is sometimes held that the existence of abstract mental entities means that token physicalism does not correspond to type physicalism. In terms of information theory abstract entities would be derived sets of information that are arrangements of substrates. Hence information theory does not distinguish between type and token physicalism.

The reader should be cautioned that there is an extensive literature associated with supervenience that does not stress the way that information is embodied and representational. (The removal of these constraints will lead to non-physical theories of information).  

It is sometimes asked how conscious experience containing a quale that is a colour, such as blueness, can supervene on the physical world. In terms of information systems the question is back to front: blueness is very probably a phenomenon in the physical brain - it is certainly unlike an arrangement of stored bits in an information system. The question should read &quot;what physical theory supervenes on information in the signals related to the phenomenon called blue?&quot;

The simple answer is that there is no widely accepted description available of the physical nature of the experience called blue (there are several theories however). A common mistake is to say that the secondary intension of the quale blue is known - this is not the case, the physical basis of em radiation or absorption of light is known to some extent but these are almost certainly not the physical basis of the &quot;blue&quot; of experience. The quale &quot;blue&quot; is probably a particular substrate that has a state, not an encoded state on a generalised substrate. 

Information is the patterns and states of an underlying substrate or carrier, this leaves us with exciting questions such as: what is it like to be the substrate itself rather than simply the information impressed upon it? Can only particular substrates constitute conscious experience? How can we relate the properties of this experience to information about the physical world?

The substrate of information is not part of the problem of access consciousness which deals with the problem of the flow of information from place to place.

''This is a '''stub''' and needs expanding''

==Qualia and Information==

The problem of the generalised nature of information is addressed by several &quot;thought experiments&quot; which are described below. 

The problem of &quot;intensions&quot; is tackled in Putnam's twin earth thought experiment which was discussed above but is given in more detail below.

===Absent and fading qualia===

====Absent qualia====

Block (1978) argued that the same functions can be performed by a wide range of systems. For instance, if the population of China were equipped with communication devices and a set of rules they could perform almost any function but would they have qualia? The argument considers the fact that systems which process information can be constructed of a wide range of materials and asks whether such systems will also have qualia (see illustration below).

[[Image:Constudfun.gif]] 

This argument also occurs when the physical structure of computing devices is considered, for instance a computing machine could be constructed from rolling steel balls. Would the steel balls at one instant possess the quale 'blue' and then, as a result of the movement of one ball to another position, possess the quale 'red'? Can an arrangement of balls really have qualia or are they absent? It is encumbent upon proponents of functional organisation to describe why identical balls arranged as O O OOO can be the quale red and yet those arranged as OOO O O can be the quale blue. They must also take into account Kant's &quot;handedness problem&quot;:  the balls OOO O O look like O O OOO when viewed from behind. Red and blue, as arrangements of things, would be identical depending on the viewing point. How can a processor have a viewing point when it is itself the steel balls?

====Fading qualia====

Pylyshyn (1980) introduced a thought experiment in which a human brain is progressively replaced by synthetic components and it is asked what would happen to consciousness during this replacement of the brain.  

Chalmers (1996) considers the problem in depth from the point of view of functional organisation. (i.e.: considering replacement of biological components with components that perform the same functions). The argument is straightforward: if phenomenal consciousness is due to functional organisation then replacement of biological parts with artificial parts that duplicate the function should allow phenomenal consciousness to continue.

But suppose phenomenal consciousness is not due to functional organisation. What would we expect then? 

Chalmers argues that consciousness could not suddenly disappear during replacement of the brain because functions could be replaced in tiny stages so unless qualia could reside in a single tiny place in the brain '''Disappearing qualia''' would be ruled out. 

Chalmers considers the alternative idea of '''fading qualia''', where slow replacement of parts reduces experience progressively. This &quot;fading&quot; is described in terms of qualia fading from red to pink and experience in general becoming more and more out of step with the world. Chalmers dismisses the idea of fading qualia on the grounds that people do not have abnormal experiences, like fading colours, except in the case of pathology.  More specifically, he argues that since it seems intuitively obvious that silicon implants could be devised to stand in, in any relevant functional role, for the original brain matter, we might reasonably assume that during the carbon - silicon transformation the organism's functional state, including all its dispositions to notice and report what experiences it is having, can be preserved. The absurd consequence is then supposed to consist in a being whose qualia have significantly faded continuing to report them as they originally were; without noticing the change. 

Crabb(2005) has argued that there are hidden premises in this argument, and once these are exposed the desired conclusion is seen to be unwarranted. Thus, consider the assumption that during the silicon implantation process the person's functional state can be preserved in any relevant respect. This is very likely the case. Certainly, we have no ''a priori'' reason for ruling out the possibility; for surely technology might be employed to achieve any functional state we desire. In principle, then, it just has to be possible to preserve such functional traits as the noticing and reporting of the original qualia. But then, as Crabb observes, the alleged absurdity of issuing such reports in the presence of ''severly faded'' qualia depends on a further assumption; that during the implantation process the noticing and reporting functions have been preserved in such a way that we should still expect that noticing and reporting to remain fairly accurate. Chalmers completely overlooks this requirement. In effect, then, he is arguing in a circle. He is arguing that faded qualia in the presence of the original functional states are very unlikely, because a conscious being will tend to track its own conscious states fairly accurately. Why? Because the preservation of the original functional states during the implantation process is of the sort required to preserve the faithfulness of the subject's tracking. How do we know this? Well, because it is just generally true to say that a conscious being would be able, in respect of noticing and reporting, to track its conscious states. In short, then, he is saying that qualia could not fade with functional states intact, because in general that just could not happen. 

Consider the following example. The original human subject Joe starts out seeing red things and experiencing vivid red qualia. He reports them as such. Then an evil scientist implants a device between Joe's visual cortex and his speech centre which effectively overrides the output from the ''red zone'' of the visual cortex, and ensures that come what may experientially, Joe will report that his qualia are vivid. We could assume a similar intervention has also been effected at the ''noticing centre'', whatever that might be. Plausibly, then, Joe will continue to notice and report vivid qualia even though his own are severely faded. Now Crabb's question is this: why would Chalmers assume that the item-for-item silicon substitutions he envisaged would not themselves allow this sort of noticing and reporting infidelity?  And unless he can provide a good reason, his thought experiment with Joe and his fading qualia simply does not work. Of course the functional states can be preserved during the silicon substitutions, but we have no reason to suppose that noticing and reporting fidelity can too. Consequently, there is no inference to an absurd situation, and therefore no reason to reject the possibility of fading qualia. 

It is possible that at some stage during the replacement process the synthetic parts alone would have sufficient data to identify objects and properties of objects so that the experience would be like blindsight. The subject might be amazed that subjective vision was disappearing.  However, Chalmers denies that new beliefs, such as amazement at a new state, would be possible.  He says that:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing in the physical system can correspond to that amazement. There is no room for new beliefs such as &quot;I can't see anything,&quot; new desires such as the desire to cry out, and other new cognitive states such as amazement. Nothing in the physical system can correspond to that amazement.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

On the basis of the impossibility of new beliefs Chalmers concludes that fading qualia are impossible. Again, though, he has failed to explain why he thinks the original belief set can be preserved come what may, and in such a way as to preserve belief and reporting fidelity. 

Notwithstanding these objections, then, according to Chalmers, if fading qualia do not occur then qualia must also exist in &quot;Robot&quot;, a totally synthetic entity, so '''absent qualia''' do not occur either. Therefore Robot should be conscious. He concludes the fading qualia argument by stating that it supports his theory that consciousness results from ''organizational invariance'', a specific set of functions organised in a particular way:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The invariance principle taken alone is compatible with the solipsistic thesis that my organization gives rise to experience. But one can imagine a gradual change to my organization, just as we imagined a gradual change to my physical makeup, under which my beliefs about my experience would be mostly preserved throughout, I would remain a rational system, and so on.  For similar reasons to the above, it seems very likely that conscious experience would be preserved in such a transition&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

The response to this should now be obvious. What exactly does remaining 'a rational system' entail? If it entails the preservation of noticing and reporting fidelity, then it follows that Joe's qualia would not fade. But there is no independent support for this entailment. It remains perfectly reasonable to assume that Joe's qualia would fade, and therefore that the only way he could end up misreporting his fading qualia as bright would be through a breakdown in fidelity, of the sort Crabb describes. 

Chalmers notes that if qualia were epiphenomenal and not due to functional organisation then the argument would be false. This is rather unfortunate because it makes the argument tautological: if it is assumed that conscious experience is due to functional organisation then the argument shows that conscious experience is due to functional organisation. The role of epiphenomenal, or apparently epiphenomenal, consciousness brings the philosopher back to the problem of change, where consciousness does not appear to be necessary for change (functions) but change does not seem to be possible without consciousness. 

There are other interesting questions related to the fading qualia argument, for instance: Can all of organic chemistry be replaced by inorganic chemistry - if not why not? If information always has a physical substrate and conscious experience is the arrangement of that substrate then how could conscious experience be the same if the substrate is replaced? At the level of molecular and atomic interactions almost all functions involve electromagnetic fields, if identical function is achieved at scales below the size of an organelle in a cell in the brain would the functional elements, such as electromagnetic fields, have been changed? (i.e.: is the replacement feasible or would it be necessary to use organic parts to replace organic parts at small scales?).

The reader may have spotted that Chalmers' fading qualia argument is very similar to Dennett's argument about the non-existence of qualia.  In Dennett's argument qualia are dubiously identified with judgements and then said to be non-existent. In Chalmer's argument an attempt is made to identify qualia with beliefs about qualia so they can be encompassed by a functionalist theory.

The reader may also have noticed that the argument, by using microscopic progressive replacement, preserves the form of the brain. The replacement is ''isomorphic''' but it is not explained anywhere why form should need to be preserved as well as function. To examine functionalism the argument should allow each replacement module to be of any size and placed anywhere in the world.  Furthermore it should be possible for the functions to be asynchronous. But the argument is not a simple examination of functionalism.  If form is important why is it important?  Would a silicon replacement necessarily be able to achieve the same four dimensional form as the organic original?

===Putnam's twin earth thought experiment===

The original Twin Earth thought experiment was presented by philosopher Hilary Putnam in his important 1975 paper &quot;The Meaning of 'Meaning'&quot;, as an early argument for what has subsequently come to known as semantic externalism. Since that time, philosophers have proposed a number of variations on this particular thought experiment, which can be collectively referred to as Twin Earth thought experiments.

Putnam's original formulation of the experiment was this:

:We begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like earth in virtually all respects, which we refer to as ‘Twin Earth’. (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings of Twin Earth are identical to those of earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on.) On Twin Earth there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of H2O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as ‘XYZ’. The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as ‘English’ call XYZ ‘water’. Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called ‘water’ were H2O and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water, and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical. 

Now the question arises: when an earthling, say Oscar, and his twin on Twin Earth (also called 'Oscar' on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the inhabitants of that planet necessarily call their own planet 'earth'. For convenience, we refer to this putative planet as 'Twin Earth', and extend this naming convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring to Oscar's twin as Twin-Oscar, or Toscar.) say 'water' do they mean the same thing? Ex hypothesi, their brains are molecule-for-molecule identical. Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says water, the term refers to H2O, whereas when Toscar says 'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the contents of a persons brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms he uses, as one must also examine the causal history that led to his acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, learned the word 'water' in a world filled with H2O, whereas Toscar learned 'water' in a world filled with XYZ.) This is the essential thesis of semantic externalism. Putnam famously summarized this conclusion with the statement that &quot;meaning just ain't in the head.&quot;

In terms of physical information systems such as occur in the brain this philosophical argument means that if there are inadequate external filters available the information system will confuse XYZ with H2O; it will conclude that they are they same thing and have no difference in meaning. For the information system meaning is in the classification structures assigned by the system. If the system is provided with better transducers and filters then new meanings will arise within the system. However, for an information system 'meaning' is no more than a chain of relations because this is the nature of information (i.e.: arrangements of an arbitrary carrier). Other types of meaning would require phenomena other than simple information processing.

In Putnam's thought experiment the world can be different but the meaning for the individual is the same if the brain is the same. If there is a type of meaning other than a chain of relations would Putnam's experiment suggest that this type of 'meaning' occurs as a phenomenon in the brain or in the world beyond the body?

===The Inverted Qualia Argument===

The possibility that we may each experience different colours when confronted by a visual stimulus is well known and was discussed by John Locke.  In particular the idea of '''spectrum inversion''' in which the spectrum is exchanged, blue for red and so on is often considered. It is then asked whether the subject of such an exchange would notice any difference. Unfortunately it turns out that colour is not solely due to the spectrum and depends on hue, saturation and lightness. If the colours are inverted all the axes of colour would need to be exchanged and the relations between the colours would indeed still be discernably different.

Some philosophers have tried to avoid this difficulty by asking questions about qualia when the subject has no colour vision. For instance, it is asked whether a subject who saw things in black and white would see the world differently from one who saw the world in white and black. 

This sort of discussion has been used as an attack on Behaviourism where it is argued that whether a tomato is seen as black or white the subject's behaviour towards the tomato will be the same. So subject's can have mental states independent of behaviours.

Block (1990) has adapted this argument to an ''inverted earth'' scenario in which it is proposed that a subject goes to another planet which is identical to earth except for the inversion of visual qualia. He points out that behaviours would adjust to be the same on the inverted earth as on the actual earth.  All functions would be identical but the mental state would be different so it is concluded that mental states are not processes.

Chalmers(1996) approaches this argument by assuming that the absent and fading qualia arguments have proven his idea of organisational invariance. He then introduces the idea that conscious experience only exists for the durationless instant and notes that, given these assumptions a person would not be aware that the quale red had been switched for the quale blue.

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;My experiences are switching from red to blue, but ''I do not notice any change''. Even as we flip the switch a number of times and my qualia dance back and forth, I will simply go about my business, noticing nothing unusual.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

===The Knowledge Argument===

Much of the philosophical literature about qualia has revolved around the debate between physicalism and non-physicalism. In 1982 Frank Jackson proposed the famous &quot;Knowledge Argument&quot; to highlight how physical knowledge might not be enough to describe phenomenal experience:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ‘red’, ‘blue’, and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal chords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘The sky is blue’. (It can hardly be denied that it is in principle possible to obtain all this physical information from black and white television, otherwise the Open University would of necessity need to use color television.) &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.&lt;/font&gt; Jackson (1982).

The Knowledge argument is a category mistake because a description of the universe, such as information about science, is a set of symbols in a particular medium such as ink on paper. These symbols provide the recipe for experiments and other manipulations of nature, and predict the outcome of these manipulations. The manipulations of nature are not the same as the set of symbols describing how to perform these manipulations. Scientific information is not the world itself and the truth or falsehood of Physicalism is unaffected by the knowledge argument.

If the Knowledge Argument is interpreted as an argument about whether information about the nature of the colour red could ever be sufficient to provide the experience that we call red then it becomes more relevant to the problem of consciousness but it is then a debate about whether information processors could be conscious, this is covered below. Those interested in a full discussion of the Knowledge Argument should consult Alter (1998) and especially the link given with this reference.

==The problem of machine and digital consciousness==

===Information processing and digital computers===

Information processing consists of encoding a state, such as the geometry of an image, on a carrier such as a stream of electrons, and then submitting this encoded state to a series of transformations specified by a set of instructions called a program. In principle the carrier could be anything, even steel balls or onions, and the machine that implements the instructions need not be electronic, it could be mechanical or fluidic.

Digital computers implement information processing. From the earliest days of digital computers people have suggested that these devices may one day be conscious. One of the earliest workers to consider this idea seriously was Alan Turing. Turing proposed the [[/Turing Test/]] as a way of discovering whether a machine can think. In the Turing Test a group of people would ask a machine questions and if they could not tell the difference between the replies of the machine and the replies of a person it would be concluded that the machine could indeed think. Turing's proposal is often confused with the idea of a test for consciousness.  However, phenomenal consciousness is an internal state so the best that such a test could demonstrate is that a digital computer could simulate consciousness.

If technologists were limited to the use of the principles of digital computing when creating a conscious entity they would have the problems associated with the philosophy of 'strong' artificial intelligence. The term ''strong AI'' was defined by Searle:

 ..according to strong AI, the computer is not merely a tool in the 
 study of the mind; rather, the appropriately programmed computer 
 really is a mind (J. Searle in Minds, Brains and Programs. The 
 Behavioral and Brain Sciences, vol. 3, 1980).

If a computer could demonstrate Strong AI it would not necessarily be more powerful at calculating or solving problems than a computer that demonstrated Weak AI. 

The most serious problem with Strong AI is John Searle's &quot;chinese room argument&quot; in which it is demonstrated that the contents of an information processor have no intrinsic meaning -at any moment they are just a set of electrons or steel balls etc. The argument is reproduced in full below:

&lt;font face=&quot;times&quot;&gt;&quot;One way to test any theory of the mind is to ask oneself what it would be like if my mind actually worked on the principles that the theory says all minds work on. Let us apply this test to the Schank program with the following Gedankenexperiment. Suppose that I’m locked in a room and given a large batch of Chinese writing. Suppose furthermore (as is indeed the case) that I know no Chinese, either written or spoken, and that I’m not even confident that I could recognize Chinese writing as Chinese writing distinct from, say, Japanese writing or meaningless squiggles. To me, Chinese writing is just so many meaningless squiggles. Now suppose further that after this first batch of Chinese writing I am given a second batch of Chinese script together with a set of rules for correlating the second batch with the first batch. The rules are in English, and I understand these rules as well as any other native speaker of English. They enable me to correlate one set of formal symbols with another set of formal symbols, and all that &quot;formal&quot; means here is that I can identify the symbols entirely by their shapes. Now suppose also that I am given a third batch of Chinese symbols together with some instructions, again in English, that enable me to correlate elements of this third batch with the first two batches, and these rules instruct me how to give back certain Chinese symbols with certain sorts of shapes in response to certain sorts of shapes given me in the third batch. Unknown to me, the people who are giving me all of these symbols call the first batch a &quot;script,&quot; they call the second batch a &quot;story,&quot; and they call the third batch &quot;questions.&quot; Furthermore, they call the symbols I give them back in response to the third batch &quot;answers to the questions,&quot; and the set of rules in English that they gave me, they call the &quot;program.&quot; Now just to complicate the story a little, imagine that these people also give me stories in English, which I understand, and they then ask me questions in English about these stories, and I give them back answers in English. Suppose also that after a while I get so good at following the instructions for manipulating the Chinese symbols and the programmers get so good at writing the programs that from the external point of view—that is, from tile point of view of somebody outside the room in which I am locked—my answers to the questions are absolutely indistinguishable from those of native Chinese speakers. Nobody just looking at my answers can tell that I don’t speak a word of Chinese. Let us also suppose that my answers to the English questions are, as they no doubt would be, indistinguishable from those of other native English speakers, for the simple reason that I am a native English speaker. From the external point of view—from the point of view of someone reading my &quot;answers&quot;—the answers to the Chinese questions and the English questions are equally good. But in the Chinese case, unlike the English case, I produce the answers by manipulating uninterpreted formal symbols. As far as the Chinese is concerned, I simply behave like a computer; I perform computational operations on formally specified elements. For the purposes of the Chinese, I am simply an instantiation of the computer program.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

In other words, Searle is proposing that if a computer is just an arrangement of steel balls or electric charges then its content is meaningless without some other phenomenon. Block (1978) used the analogy of a system composed of the population of China communicating with each other to suggest the same idea, that an arrangement of identical things has no meaningful content without a conscious observer who understands its form.

Searle's objection does not convince Direct Realists because they would maintain that 'meaning' is only to be found in objects of perception.

===The meaning of meaning and the Symbol Grounding Problem===

In his Chinese Room Argument Searle shows that symbols on their own do not have any meaning.  In other words, a computer that is a set of electrical charges or flowing steel balls is just a set of steel balls or electrical charges. Leibniz spotted this problem in the seventeeth century.

Searle's argument is also, partly, the '''Symbol Grounding Problem'''; Harnad (2001) defines this as:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;the symbol grounding problem concerns how the meanings of the symbols in a system can be grounded (in something other than just more ungrounded symbols) so they can have meaning independently of any external interpreter.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Harnad defines a Total Turing Test in which a robot connected to the world by sensors and actions might be judged to be indistinguishable from a human being. He considers that a robot that passed such a test would overcome the symbol grounding problem. Unfortunately Harnad does not tackle  Leibniz's misgivings about the internal state of the robot being just a set of symbols (cogs and wheels/charges etc.).  The Total Turing Test is also doubtful if analysed in terms of information systems alone, for instance, Powers (2001) argues that an information system could be grounded in Harnad's sense if it were embedded in a virtual reality rather than the world around it.

So what is &quot;meaning&quot; in an information system? In  information systems a '''relation''' is defined in terms of what thing contains another thing. Having established that one thing contains another this thing is called an '''attribute'''. A car  contains seats so seats are an attribute of cars. Cars are sometimes red so cars sometimes have the attribute &quot;red&quot;. This containing of one thing by another leads to classification hierarchies known as a relational database. What Harnad was seeking to achieve was a connection between items in the database and items in the world outside the database. This did not succeed in giving &quot;meaning&quot; to the signals within the machine - they were still a set of separate signals in a materialist model universe. 

Aristotle and Plato had a clear idea of meaning when they proposed that ideas depend upon internal images or forms. Plato, in particular conceived that understanding is due to the forms in phenomenal consciousness.  Bringing this view up to date, this implies that the way one form contains another gives us understanding. The form of a car contains the form we call seats etc. Even things that we consider to be &quot;content&quot; rather than &quot;form&quot;, such as redness,  require an extension in space so that there is a red area rather than red by itself (cf: Hume 1739).  So if the empiricists are correct our minds contain a geometrical classification system (&quot;what contains what&quot;) or geometrical relational database. 

A geometrical database has advantages over a sequential database because items within it are highly classified (their relations to other items being implicit in the geometry) and can also be easily related to the physical position of the organism in the world. It would appear that the way forward for artificial consciousness would be to create a virtual reality within the machine. Perhaps the brain works in this fashion and dreams, imagination and hallucinations are evidence for this. In Part III the storage of geometrically related information in the &quot;Place&quot; area of the brain is described. But although this would be closer to our experience it still leaves us with the Hard Problem of how the state of a model could become conscious experience.

===Artificial consciousness beyond information processing===

The debate about whether a machine could be conscious under any circumstances is usually described as the conflict between physicalism and dualism. Dualists believe that there is something non-physical about consciousness whilst physicalists hold that all things are physical.

Physicalists are not limited to those who hold that consciousness is a property of encoded information on carrier signals. Several indirect realist philosophers and scientists have proposed that, although information processing might deliver the content of consciousness, the state that is consciousness is due to some other physical phenomenon. The eminent neurologist Wilder Penfield was of this opinion and scientists such as Arthur Stanley Eddington, Roger Penrose, Herman Weyl, Karl Pribram and Henry Stapp amongst many others have also proposed that consciousness involves physical phenomena subtler than information processing. Even some of the most ardent supporters of consciousness in information processors such as Dennett suggest that some new, emergent, scientific theory may be required to account for consciousness.

As was mentioned above, neither the ideas that involve direct perception nor those that involve models of the world in the brain seem to be compatible with current physical theory. It seems that new physical theory may be required and the possibility of dualism is not, as yet, ruled out.

===The Computability Problem and Halting of Turing Machines===
====The Church-Turing thesis====
In computability theory the Church–Turing thesis, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture or Turing's thesis, named after Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, is a hypothesis about the nature of mechanical calculation devices, such as electronic computers. The thesis claims that any calculation that is possible can be performed by an algorithm running on a computer, provided that sufficient time and storage space are available.

This thesis, coupled with the proposition that all computers can be modelled by Turing Machines, means that Functionalist theories of consciousness are equivalent to the hypothesis that the brain operates as a Turing Machine.

====Turing machines====
A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine Turing Machine] is a pushdown automaton made more powerful by relaxing the last-in-first-out requirement of its stack.  (Interestingly, this seemingly minor relaxation enables the Turing machine to perform such a wide variety of computations that it can serve as a model for the computational capabilities of all modern computer software.)

A Turing machine can be constructed using a single tape. There is no requirement for data to be arranged congruently with input or output data so a two dimensional square in the world would be handled as a string or set of strings in the machine yet still calculate a known function. This is problematic in consciousness studies because phenomenal consciousness has many things simultaneously present in several directions at an instant and this form is not congruent with a one dimensional tape.

A Turing machine consists of:
# A ''tape'' which is divided into cells, one next to the other. Each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet.  The alphabet contains a special ''blank'' symbol (here written as '0') and one or more other symbols. The tape is assumed to be arbitrarily extendible to the left and to the right, i.e., the Turing machine is always supplied with as much tape as it needs for its computation. Cells that have not been written to before are assumed to be filled with the blank symbol.
# A ''head'' that can read and write symbols on the tape and move left and right.
# A ''state register'' that stores the state of the Turing machine. The number of different states is always finite and there is one special ''start state'' with which the state register is initialized.
# An ''action table'' (or ''transition function'') that tells the machine what symbol to write, how to move the head ('L' for one step left, and 'R' for one step right) and what its new state will be, given the symbol it has just read on the tape and the state it is currently in. If there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state then the machine will halt.
Note that every part of the machine is finite; it is the potentially unlimited amount of tape that gives it an unbounded amount of storage space.

Another problem arises with Turing Machines is that some algorithms can be shown to be undecidable and so the machine will never halt.

====The halting problem====
The proof of the halting problem proceeds by reductio ad absurdum. We will assume that there is an algorithm described by the function &lt;code&gt;halt(a, i)&lt;/code&gt; that decides if the algorithm encoded by the string ''a'' will halt when given as input the string ''i'', and then show that this leads to a contradiction.

We start with assuming that there is a function &lt;code&gt;halt(a, i)&lt;/code&gt; that returns &lt;code&gt;'''true'''&lt;/code&gt; if the algorithm represented by the string ''a'' halts when given as input the string ''i'', and returns &lt;code&gt;'''false'''&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. (The existence of the universal Turing machine proves that every possible algorithm corresponds to at least one such string.)  Given this algorithm we can construct another algorithm &lt;code&gt;trouble(s)&lt;/code&gt; as follows:

  '''function''' trouble(''string'' s)
      '''if''' halt(s, s) = '''false'''
          '''return''' '''true'''
      '''else'''
          loop forever

This algorithm takes a string ''s'' as its argument and runs the algorithm &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt;, giving it ''s'' both as the description of the algorithm to check and as the initial data to feed to that algorithm.  If &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;'''false'''&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt; returns '''true''', otherwise &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt; goes into an infinite loop. Since all algorithms can be represented by strings, there is a string ''t'' that represents the algorithm &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt;. We can now ask the following question:

: Does &lt;code&gt;trouble(t)&lt;/code&gt; halt?

Let us consider both possible cases:

# Assume that &lt;code&gt;trouble(t)&lt;/code&gt; halts. The only way this can happen is that &lt;code&gt;halt(t, t)&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;'''false'''&lt;/code&gt;, but that in turn indicates that &lt;code&gt;trouble(t)&lt;/code&gt; does not halt. Contradiction.
# Assume that &lt;code&gt;trouble(t)&lt;/code&gt; does not halt. Since &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt; always halts, this can only happen when &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt; goes into its infinite loop. This means that &lt;code&gt;halt(t, t)&lt;/code&gt; must have returned &lt;code&gt;'''true'''&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt; would have returned immediately if it returned &lt;code&gt;'''false'''&lt;/code&gt;. But that in turn would mean that &lt;code&gt;trouble(t)&lt;/code&gt; does halt. Contradiction.

Since both cases lead to a contradiction, the initial assumption that the algorithm &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt; exists must be false.

This classic proof is typically referred to as the '''diagonalization proof''', so called because if one imagines a grid containing all the values of &lt;code&gt;halt(a, i)&lt;/code&gt;, with every possible ''a'' value given its own row, and every possible ''i'' value given its own column, then the values of &lt;code&gt;halt(s, s)&lt;/code&gt; are arranged along the main diagonal of this grid.  The proof can be framed in the form of the question: what row of the grid corresponds to the string ''t''?  The answer is that the &lt;code&gt;trouble&lt;/code&gt; function is devised such that &lt;code&gt;halt(t, i)&lt;/code&gt; differs from every row in the grid in at least one position: namely, the main diagonal, where ''t''=''i''.  This contradicts the requirement that the grid contains a row for every possible ''a'' value, and therefore constitutes a proof by contradiction that the halting problem is undecidable.

===The simulation argument===

According to this argument (Bostrom 2003) the universe could be a giant computer simulation that contains people as well as objects. Bostrom seems to believe that at any instant a collection of bits of information like electrons on silicon or specks of dust on a sheet could be conscious, he states that:

&quot;A common assumption in the philosophy of mind is that of substrate-independence. The idea is that mental states can supervene on any of a broad class of physical substrates. Provided a system implements the right sort of computational structures and processes, it can be associated with conscious experiences.&quot;

He then goes on to argue that because of this assumption human beings could be simulations in a computer. Unfortunately, without tackling the problem of how a pattern of dust at an instant could be a person with 'conscious experience' the simulation argument is flawed. In fact even a person made of a moving pattern of dust over several instants is problematical without the assumptions of naive realism or dualism. Bostrom, puts 'mental' states' beyond physical explanation (i.e.: simply assumes that conscious mental states could exist in a pattern of electrons, dust or steel balls etc.). In view of this dualism, Bostrom's argument reduces to the proposal that the world is a digital simulation apart from something else required for endowing the simulations of people in the world with consciousness.

== Defining Continuity ==
We are now ready to define the concept of a function being '''continuous'''. The idea is that we want to say that a function is continuous if you can draw its graph without taking your pencil off the page. But sometimes this will be true for some parts of a graph but not for others. Therefore, we want to start by defining what it means for a function to be continuous at ''one point''. The definition is simple, now that we have the concept of limits: 

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (continuity at a point)
|text=
If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined on an open interval containing &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''continuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;''' if and only if
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Note that for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be continuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the definition in effect requires three conditions:
# that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; exists,
# the limit as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; exists, and
# the limit and &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; are equal.

If any of these do not hold then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea of the definition is that the point of the graph corresponding to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; will be close to the points of the graph corresponding to nearby &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-values. Now we can define what it means for a function to be continuous in general, not just at one point.

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (continuity)
|text=A function is said to be '''continuous on &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;''' if it is continuous at every point of the interval &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

We often use the phrase &quot;the function is continuous&quot; to mean that the function is continuous at every real number.  This would be the same as saying the function was continuous on (&amp;minus;&amp;infin;, &amp;infin;), but it is a bit more convenient to simply say &quot;continuous&quot;.

Note that, by what we already know, the limit of a rational, exponential, trigonometric or logarithmic function at a point is just its value at that point, so long as it's defined there. So, all such functions are continuous wherever they're defined. (Of course, they can't be continuous where they're ''not'' defined!)

==Discontinuities==

A '''discontinuity''' is a point where a function is not continuous. There are lots of possible ways this could happen, of course. Here we'll just discuss two simple ways.

===Removable discontinuities===
The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac {x^2-9} {x-3}&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;. It is discontinuous at that point because the fraction then becomes &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, which is undefined. Therefore the function fails the first of our three conditions for continuity at the point 3; 3 is just not in its domain.

However, we say that this discontinuity is '''removable'''. This is because, if we modify the function at that point, we can eliminate the discontinuity and make the function continuous. To see how to make the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; continuous, we have to simplify &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, getting &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac {x^2-9} {x-3} = \frac {(x+3)(x-3)} {(x-3)} = \frac {x+3} {1} \cdot \frac {x-3} {x-3}&lt;/math&gt;. We can define a new function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x + 3&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not the same as the original function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined at &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not. Thus, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 3} (x+3) = 6 = g(3)&lt;/math&gt;. However, whenever &lt;math&gt;x\ne 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;; all we did to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; was to make it defined at &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, this kind of simplification is often possible with a discontinuity in a rational function. We can divide the numerator and the denominator by a common factor (in our example &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt;) to get a function which is the same except where that common factor was 0 (in our example at &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;). This new function will be identical to the old except for being defined at new points where previously we had division by 0.

However, this is not possible in every case.  For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x-3}{x^2-6x+9}&lt;/math&gt; has a common factor of &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt; in both the numerator and denominator, but when you simplify you are left with &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{1}{x-3}&lt;/math&gt;, which is still not defined at &lt;math&gt;x=3&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case the domain of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are the same, and they are equal everywhere they are defined, so they are in fact the same function.  The reason that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; differed from &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the first example was because we could take it to have a larger domain and not simply that the formulas defining &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; were different.

===Jump discontinuities===
[[Image:Step function, 1 if x less than 0, -1 if x less than or equal to 0.svg|300px|Illustration of a jump discontinuity]]

Not all discontinuities can be removed from a function. Consider this function:
:&lt;math&gt;k(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }x &gt; 0 \\ -1, &amp; \mbox{if }x \le 0 \end{matrix}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} k(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist, there is no way to redefine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at one point so that it will be continuous at 0.
These sorts of discontinuities are called ''nonremovable'' discontinuities.

Note, however, that both one-sided limits exist; &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^-} k(x) = -1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} k(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is that they are not equal, so the graph &quot;jumps&quot; from one side of 0 to the other. In such a case, we say the function has a ''jump'' discontinuity. (Note that a jump discontinuity is a kind of nonremovable discontinuity.)

==One-Sided Continuity==

Just as a function can have a one-sided limit, a function can be continuous from a particular side.
For a function to be continuous at a point from a given side, we need the following three conditions:
# the function is defined at the point,
# the function has a limit from that side at that point and
# the one-sided limit equals the value of the function at the point.

A function will be continuous at a point if and only if it is continuous from both sides at that point. Now we can define what it means for a function to be continuous on a closed interval.

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Definition: (continuity on a closed interval)
|text=
A function is said to be '''continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;''' if and only if
# it is continuous on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;,
# it is continuous from the right at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and
# it is continuous from the left at &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Notice that, if a function is continuous, then it is continuous on every closed interval contained in its domain.

==Intermediate Value Theorem==
A useful theorem regarding continuous functions is the following:

{{Calculus/Def
|title=Intermediate Value Theorem
|text=
If a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on a closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, then for every value &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt; there is a value &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(c)=k&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

===Application: bisection method===
[[Image:Bisection method.png|250px|thumb|A few steps of the bisection method applied over the starting range [a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]. The bigger red dot is the root of the function.]]
The bisection method is the simplest and most reliable algorithm to find zeros of a continuous function.

Suppose we want to solve the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Given two points &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs, the intermediate value theorem tells us that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must have at least one root between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as long as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. If we know &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in general (say, because it's made out of rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions), then this will work so long as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined at all points between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. So, let's divide the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; in two by computing &lt;math&gt;c = (a+b) / 2&lt;/math&gt;. There are now three possibilities: 
# &lt;math&gt;f(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs, or
# &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.
In the first case, we're done. In the second and third cases, we can repeat the process on the sub-interval where the sign change occurs. In this way we hone in to a small sub-interval containing the zero. The midpoint of that small sub-interval is usually taken as a good approximation to the zero.

Note that, unlike the methods you may have learned in algebra, this works for ''any'' continuous function that you (or your calculator) know how to compute.

{{Formal Logic:TOCPageNav|up=Sentential Logic|prev=Formal Syntax|next=Formal Semantics}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Informal Conventions =

In [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/The Sentential Language|The Sentential Language]], we gave an informal description of a sentential language, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We have also given a [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Our official grammar generates a large number of parentheses.  This makes formal definitions and other specifications easier to write, but it makes the language rather cumbersome to use.  In addition, all the subscripts and superscripts quickly get to be unnecessarily tedious.  The end result is an ugly and difficult to read language.

We will continue to use official grammar for specifying formalities.  However, we will informally use a less cumbersome variant for other purposes.  The transformation rules below convert official formulae of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into our informal variant.


== Transformation rules ==

We create informal variants of official &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; formulae as follows.  The examples are cumulative.

* The official grammar required sentence letters to have the superscript '0'.  Superscripts aren't necessary or even useful until we get to the predicate logic, so we will always omit them in our informal variant.  We will write, for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* We will omit the subscript if it is '0'.  Thus we will write &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P^0_0}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  However, we cannot omit all subscripts; we still need to write, for example, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

* We will omit outermost parentheses.  For example, we will write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will let a series of the same binary connective associate on the right.  For example, we can transform the official

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \land (\mathrm{Q^0_0} \land \mathrm{R^0_0}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: into the informal

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, the best we can do with 

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \land \mathrm{R^0})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:is

::&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{R}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* We will use precedence rankings to omit internal parentheses when possible.  For example, we will regard &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as having lower precedence (wider scope) than &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows us to write

:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: instead of

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q^0_0} \lor \mathrm{R^0_0}))\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: However, we cannot remove the internal parentheses from

:: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \lor \mathrm{R^0_0})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Our informal variant of this latter formula is 

:: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \lor \mathrm{R}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Full precedence rankings are given below.

== Precedence and scope ==

Precedence rankings indicate the order that we evaluate the sentential connectives.  &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has a higher precedence than &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in calculating the truth value of

: &lt;math&gt;(1) \quad \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\ ,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we start by evaluating the truth value of 

: &lt;math&gt;(2) \quad \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

first.  Scope is the length of expression that is governed by the connective.  The occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) has a wider scope than the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs the whole sentence while the occurrence of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in (1) governs only the occurrence of (2) in (1).

The full ranking from highest precedence (narrowest scope) to lowest precedence (widest scope) is:

{| cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| width=&quot;15px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\lnot\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || width=&quot;10px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || highest precedence (narrowest scope)
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || lowest precedence (widest scope)
|}

== Examples ==

Let's look at some examples.  First,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \lor ((\lnot \mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P^0_0} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q^0_0})))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Second,

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P^0_0} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \leftrightarrow ((\mathrm{P^0_0} \land \mathrm{Q^0_0}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P^0_0} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q^0_0})))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be written informally as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Some unnecessary parentheses may prove helpful.  In the two examples above, the informal variants may be easier to read as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Note that the informal formula

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, the informal formula

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is restored to its official form as

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P^0_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q^0_0})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">what about marxist international theory? or the clash of civilisations theories?
[[User:Spiller|Spiller]] 21:58, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

== Book Overhaul ==

I suggest we start looking at an overhaul of this textbook, if anyone else is interested. The introductory page seems rather scant and doesn't really dicuss IR as a field, just a cursory examination of realism and liberalism.

While, arguably, the two most important ideas to walk out of an IR class with a grasp on, is that really introducing the discipline? The prologue goes back into this discussion.

I would suggest we re-write the introductory page to introduce the major areas of the discipline, and the primary thinkers and a general history to this day. Although not yet started, retain the &quot;Core Concepts&quot; chapter or some similar variant (I think a discussion of IR as a scientific discipline, postivist and postpositivist methods, etc, would be beneficial early on). Then break into separate chapters for the major paradigms (Realism and Liberalism, obviously, but we might include Constructivism on its own, plus a catchall for more minority theories like postmodernism and marxism). Strategic studies should probably be eliminated as it is a niche i-d field, not a part of IR.

After that, we have chapters on various important concepts, debates, etc., in IR. I think chapters on the UN, MNCs, civil wars, nuclear proliferation, globalization, and IPE, to name a few, would be good for illustrating the debates and interests of IR as well as helping to show how the theories work in evaluating the debates. Anyone interested? Comments? I'd like to hear from others before I move on this project. [[User:Kenny v|Kenny v]] ([[User talk:Kenny v|talk]]) 20:06, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== Overhaul ==
These ideas sound good.. I would suggest progressing as you mentioned, starting with a discussion of IR as a scientific discipline (epistemology, ontology, methods etc), before moving onto major theoretical groups: realism, liberalism, the neo-neo debate, social constructivism, marxism and other approaches (separate or together?) (broadly following the outline of first part of the Baylis Textbook 'Globalization of World Politics', though with more treatment of IR as a discipline).
This introductory page would then serve to give a broad overview of the history of the discipline and the different approaches that are covered more in depth later on..

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people assume that if you build a good looking model, it will simply come to life all by itself. Unfortunately, this couldn't be farther from the truth. A poorly constructed animation will typically suffer from objects moving in an awkward and unrealistic manner. The motion you create in your scene is an ''extremely important'' element of your overall product. You '''must''' design and execute your movement with as much care as you give to designing the objects in your animation.

An analysis of unsuccessful animation usually reveals ''too little motion'' or motion that is ''not life-like''. So how does motion become part of your overall design? Planning must begin immediately -- even before you begin to build your scene.

In this book you'll find a list of principles that the traditional masters of animation have discovered, learned and '''applied''' in their journey to learn their art. Applicable to both traditional 2D animation and computer 3D animation, every quality animated film makes use of at least a few of these basic principles developed at the Walt Disney studios during the 1930s. Believable movement starts with applying these concepts. As you continue to gain experience and knowledge, you'll come to realize just how important these techniques are. Every animator is ''expected'' to not just know these principles, but to apply them to their work. Memorizing them isn't enough. Knowing when, where and how to apply them is what's important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Anticipation''''' is a preliminary action that sets up a primary action. It cues or prepares the audience for what is about to happen. Let's look at an example. Let's say that a steel cable is being stretched extremely tight by two opposing forces. Before the cable snaps in two, you position your camera for a close up on the actual breaking point. The close up shows the cable fraying as more and more tension is applied. Seeing this, the audience automatically ''anticipates'' what's about to happen (the eventual breaking of the cable).

In some cases anticipation is needed physically. For example, before you can throw a ball, you must first swing your arm backwards. As the arm goes back, the audience ''anticipates'' it coming forward and releasing the ball. more important than just audience anticipation... there is a need for a set up to the coming movement. every movement requires anticipation and recovery. there is a need to show a transfer of weight before performing an action. it is here where the action is set up.

Anticipation is also required to simulate real motion. If an object is at rest, some preliminary action that transfers energy to the object must occur so that it can use that energy to execute the primary action. Before a character can jump, they must crouch down and swing their arms for counter-balance. By seeing the crouch, the audience ''anticipates'' that the character is about to jump.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The principle of '''''Squash and Stretch''''' implies that no matter how much an object deforms, it must always maintain the same apparent volume. Proper use of Squash and Stretch illustrates just how dense or rigid an object is. All real world objects, unless extremely hard, exhibit some form of squash and stretch.

The classic example is the bouncing ball. The ball ''squashes'' as it hits the ground, then ''stretches'' on its way up and then back down. When an object squashes along one axis (direction), it automatically expands along the other two. It is up to you, as the animator, to ensure that any deformation along on axis is offset be an opposite deformation along other axes maintaining a constant volume.

Consider the way a pillow changes shape as it's tossed across the room. The shape deforms, but does the volume of the pillow change? No matter how contorted the pillow becomes, it still maintains the same weight and amount of stuffing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Search Engines ==
=== Clusty ===
Clusty (http://clusty.com) groups the results of other search engines into clusters.

* Location: http://clusty.com/search
* Arguments:
** '''query='''''search query'' http://clusty.com/search?query=hypertext+transfer+protocol

describes a way to get a &quot;short URL&quot; into Google Groups.

==FreeBSD Manual Pages==
FreeBSD's &quot;man.cgi&quot; script presents the online manual pages for several versions of FreeBSD and other manual pages.

*Location: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi
**Similar service: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi
*With no arguments: presents an index page with HTML form allowing user to enter query
*Arguments:
** '''query='''''name of a manual page'' http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=printf
*** null string: error message http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=
*** not specified: presents index page deriving default form values from the other arguments http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sektion=8
** '''sektion='''''section of manual page'' http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=printf&amp;sektion=3
*** &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;...&lt;tt&gt;9&lt;/tt&gt;: the usual sections
*** &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; or null string: a section containing a matching manual page
** '''manpath='''''name of operating system'' (&lt;tt&gt;NetBSD+2.0&lt;/tt&gt;, others)
*** &lt;tt&gt;NetBSD+2.0&lt;/tt&gt; manual page from NetBSD 2.0 http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cgd&amp;manpath=NetBSD+2.0
*** nonexistent choice: uses latest FreeBSD release and ports http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nethack&amp;manpath=Government+of+Earth
*** not specified: uses latest FreeBSD release and ports
** '''apropos='''''type of query'' (&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;)
*** &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; or null string: present manual page
*** &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; or any greater integer: download a .tar.gz (what???)
*** &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; or anything else: present apropos search (searches the one-line synopsis strings of the manual pages) http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=printf&amp;apropos=1
** '''format'''=format of result page (&lt;tt&gt;html&lt;/tt&gt;, others)
*** &lt;tt&gt;html&lt;/tt&gt;: HTML web page

To see pages such as [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nethack nethack] from FreeBSD ports, you must not set manpath to an [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nethack&amp;manpath=NetBSD+2.0 OS that does not include ports]. Note that the choice (currently &lt;tt&gt;FreeBSD+5.4-RELEASE+and+Ports&lt;/tt&gt;) that contains ports changes when the site adds a new version of FreeBSD. Note that if you bookmarked an old manpath (like &lt;tt&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nethack&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+5.2-RELEASE+and+Ports FreeBSD+5.2-RELEASE+and+Ports]&lt;/tt&gt;) it acts like a nonexistent choice, which by the above list &quot;uses latest FreeBSD release and ports&quot;.

== Wikis ==
=== UseMod ===
UseMod exists as a Perl script.
* Location: http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl and several other places
* With no arguments: fetches the front page (same as http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?UseModWiki)

=== MediaWiki ===
The MediaWiki PHP script allows users to retrieve and edit wiki pages.

* Location: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php and several other places
* With no arguments: redirects to [[Main Page]]
* Arguments:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Overlapping action''''' implies that not everything happens at the same time.

Take the example of moving a character's arm from a position of rest to that of picking up a set of keys on a table. A common mistake would be to advance a few frames from the at-rest position, then move all of the arm elements (objects) to the final position. This technique would result in a very lifeless motion (because everything starts and stops moving at the same time). The proper sequence requires that the upper arm begins to rise first. Then the forearm pivots out, followed by the wrist bending back. Finally the fingers curl around the keys. Each of these motions begins before the preceding motion is complete, providing the realistic overlap that your viewer expects. In other words, the motion of the arm rotating upward is ''overlapped'' by the wrist bending back.

:I have added it onto [[Talk:America's Army: Special Forces]]. Might be best to leave it a week and then do it as I've only recently added it to the talk page. Thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:12, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Electromagnetics ==

The page [[Electromagnetic Fields]] is supposed to be a sub-page of [[Electromagnetics]]. I believe this bot is used rename/move the page. Thanks for your help.

== Navigation headers/footers ==

I might be missing something, but I've been looking around for some sort of automation to the addition/update of navigation headers and footers (by that I mean little sets of links pointing to the table of contents, previous page, next page, that can be found at the top and bottom of each page of a book). For example, I was learning noun declension for my Polish course from the Polish wikibook and noticed that a lot of the navigation headers/footers were missing or inaccurate. Is there any sort of automation currently existing for that, and if not, is that something that tsca.bot would be able to do? &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#000000; font-family:Papyrus; color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;'''[[w:User:Rezecib|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;~rezecib&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[w:User talk:Rezecib|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 19:34, 8 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Follow-Through''''' is a companion to the overlapping action. An action almost never comes to a complete and sudden stop. Instead, inertia carries the object beyond the termination point, often causing the object to slowly reverse direction and settle back to the intended stop location. A golfer's swing provides an ideal example of a follow-through. Once the ball is struck, the club (and golfer) ''follow through'' the point of contact to complete the swing. What about a pencil that drops to the ground? When it hits, does it stop dead in its tracks? Or, does it bounce around a little, then rolls to a stop? Two cars collide in the middle of an intersection. Do they hit and stick? No, recoil occurs, causing them to reverse direction. Again, an action almost never comes to a complete and sudden stop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The concept behind '''''Staging''''' is that objects (still or animated) should be positioned in a way that they are quickly detected and are easily understood. A common mistake involves placing an object or action where it can't be noticed or in front of a more interesting object that divides the audience's attention. If your audience can't detect the action that you want them to notice, was your staging poor?

Think of this situation. Your scene involves two characters sitting at a table talking to each other. You want your audience to view their conversation by positioning your camera behind one of the characters, looking over their shoulder. Do you think the shot is staged well if part of the character's head partially blocks the face of the other character? Or, would it be better to move the camera a little more to the side so you see both characters clearly. Which of the two would represent better staging? Obviously, the second.

Try to visualize the primary objects in your scene as silhouettes. If an action occurs within the silhouette of an object, it is hard to detect. If you move the action to one side, where it's not masked by another object, it stands out much better. If you view your scene in silhouette and can't easily discern what's happening, consider using either a better viewing angle or possibly moving your scene objects so they can be more easily understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Exaggeration''''' is used to accentuate an action or idea. You often must exaggerate a motion or effect to ensure that the audience catches it. Exaggeration works in conjunction with anticipation and staging to direct the audience's attention to the action that you want them to see. Anticipation sets up the action, staging ensures that the action occurs where it can be seen, and exaggeration makes sure the action is not so subtle that the audience fails to notice it.

Use of exaggeration shouldn't detract from the scene, but rather enhance reality by making sure the audience catches what is happening. Remember the Big Bad Wolf's exaggerated Mannerisms in attempting to blow down the Three Little Pig's house? The exaggerated size of his chest implied that nothing would withstand the hurricane-like force of his breath.

Be careful on just how much exaggeration you use when working on human characters. Most people are very aware of how their body moves. Because of that, they are less forgiving of exaggeration of movement that goes to far beyond what is really possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Secondary Action''''' is any action that results directly from another action. Secondary actions heighten interest and add realistic complexity to an animation. They should always remain subordinate (not as important) to the primary action. They should not conflict, become more interesting or in any way dominate your primary point of interest. If the audience is paying too much attention to the secondary actions, they're missing the most important element (primary action) of your shot.

It is sometimes easy to forget about secondary actions because we take such 'side effects' for granted in real life. Think of the basketball shot that hits the backboard rim. As an animator, you did a great job with the ball's shape as it hits the rim. But what about the effect the ball had on the rim itself? Did the rim wobble back and forth a little after the ball hit it? The rim wobbling is the secondary action; the result from another action (the ball hitting it).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Weight==
Weight transfer is essential for realistic motion. Watch an elephant or rhinoceros walk through its surroundings. You can actually see (and almost feel) its weight shift from one portion of its body to another. Does a young kitten move the same way? Does a bowling ball bounce like a beach ball? Imagine how unbelievable a feather would appear if, when dropped, it shot straight down to the ground. Instead it sways from one side to another as it descends; its motion provides a clue as to its ratio of mass to surface area, and the resistance of the air.

==Balance==
With the exception of falling, the body is almost always in balance. If you extend your right arm, your left arm, shoulder and torso all pivot and move back. Few people stand perfectly straight. Think of what position other body parts should be in when one body part moves or changes location.

Interesting Note: Walking and running are special cases of falling. When you walk, you constantly cycle through a process of falling forward, restoring balance and falling forward again. Running works the same way except that you spend most of your time falling forward.

==Curved Motion==
No straight lines exist in nature. This statement also applies to natural motion. Watch a person as they swing their arm up in a handshake. Does the arm simply swing straight up? Usually the arm not only swings up, but also swings out from the side and back in again. This subtle motion makes all the difference between an unnatural, robotic move and something that appears life-like.

In contrast, a motion by an ''intentionally'' inanimate object should follow Newton's laws, i.e. move in a straight line until it is affected by a force. This provides the necessary contrast that differentiates it from a &quot;sentient&quot; object.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How do we set up a link back to the main guitar wikibook?  theres got to be some automatic way to do this.
- jmcgarey
I added alink back, but can't we make part of the 'Guitar:Buying a Guitar' header be a link back to the main book?


I have moved some content from this page to [[Guitar/Different_Types_of_Guitars]]. I also rearranged a lot of the cast-away sentences into the main articles, reworked a lot of the sentences and deleted some duplicate content. I tried to save as much of the flavour of the text as I could, and I hope the article flows better. Don't forget to modify my changes and make it even better! --[[User:99.245.94.31|99.245.94.31]] 05:57, 19 July 2007 (UTC)


&quot;Your strings should be somewhere around a centimeter above the fretboard.&quot;

What?
--[[User:80.59.3.82|80.59.3.82]] 04:21, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

That does seem awfully high to me. --[[User:Ivelasco|Ivelasco]] ([[User talk:Ivelasco|talk]]) 16:22, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

== Clearly written by a dealer ==

Recommends buying a bunch of accessory crap, never mentions tiers of brands and/or manufacturing countries, and otherwise gives loads of advice on how to blow several hundred bucks and get crap MiC gear. Seems rather destructive more than constructive

== Material removed and placed here for adding later  ==

&lt;u&gt;Removed&lt;/u&gt;

Budget guitars use less expensive woods and parts though major manufacturers adhere to high standards and therefore these are ideal first guitars. (Opening paragraph)

[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sluffs|contribs]]) 16:07, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

== Possible changes needed to this section ==

This section has a lot of material already covered in the two preceding sections. For example the acoustic guitar description mentions the body acting as a resonating chamber, the metallic sound of steel strings, the steel string acoutic is used in popular music, etc, etc. All this has been stated ealier and should be removed.

Maybe a banded price range might be better - after-all Fender set out to build good guitars that could be bought with 2 or 3 paypackets and then entered the budget market with their Squier range (half a paypacket) after realising thats where the market lay for beginners. Also that the early Japanese made Fenders (I think the very early good Japanese guitars don't have the Squier logo) were superb budget guitars before Fender realised that people were just swapping out the cheaper tuners and pickups and were ending up with Strats as good as the USA models and half the price. Fender then removed the license from the Japanese and I do believe had a short run of Chinese made budget Fenders before realising that was a mistake and shifted the production to Mexico.

Another area is the normally unbranded pre-1970s guitars that can be found in second-hand shops - this was the height of rock guitar and there are some terrible beginners guitars from this period - especially since very little computerised production existed at this time.

Just some ideas on how this section should read. I'm going to remove duplicate material though as per usual fell free to revert my edits that you disagree with or to add your own material.

== Removed Acoustic Paragraph  ==

The first two pages of this book has covered most of the material pasted below though there is some that needs to be added back. Will add those later. I'm going to try to make this a buying guide and all the stuff about how guitars work, etc,  will be placed elsewhere if not already covered. 

===Acoustic guitar===
There are basically two kinds of acoustic: classical guitar and steel-string guitar.

Steel string-guitars, also known as folk guitars, typically have a large sound box, which gives them a big resonating sound. Steel strings are used extensively in country, folk-rock and popular music and occasionally are used for their distinctive timbre in blues, jazz and rock music. Steel strings can be hard to press, especially for beginners that have not developed callouses. Picking also demands an extra muscular effort whether you use a plectrum or finger-style.

Classical guitars have nylon strings and a wider fretboard. The peg box resembles the peg box of a violin, which has tuning pegs that are perpendicular to the neck. The body is also smaller. The tone is mellow when compared to a steel string guitar and is the instrument of choice for players wishing to learn classical music. The nylon strings of a classical guitar are the easiest of all strings to fret though nylon strings normally take longer to settle down to stable tuning than steel strings.

== Material removed from beginning to be placed elsewhere ==

I've removed this material from the beginning to allow a concise opening. The material is relevant and useful so I've placed it here and will add it back into the chapter at a different place.

&lt;u&gt;Material Removed&lt;/u&gt;

Whether you are buying an entry level guitar for yourself or a parent buying a beginner's guitar for a child; it is not worth spending any money on a guitar that the player won't enjoy. How the guitar feels in the player's hands is more important than how it looks hanging up in a store, and the key to learning to play is being excited about playing.

Be careful about buying a guitar for a person that already plays, unless you know exactly what they want. The best course of action is to buy the guitar with the person. Players who have played long enough know what they like and what they don't like. If it is not possible to shop with the guitarist, then the best option is to give them a gift certificate.

Always remember every single guitar is different.  Even if the guitar is exactly the same make and model and color, it may play completely differently than the next. This is because wood is an organic material and is subject to variation and also the way a shop or manufacturer sets up a guitar may add to the differences. This means in some cases one guitar will be great and another seemingly identical guitar will be a dud.

== Material removed - already covered in the accessories and amps sections ==

I removed all this material since this is about buying a guitar and the material is already covered in the accessories and amps section. Placed the material here since some of it needs to be added to the appropiate sections.

&lt;u&gt;Material Removed&lt;/u&gt;

=== What else will you need? ===
Once you've chosen the guitar there are accessories the dealer will want to sell you. You will probably need:
* Guitar strap to enable the player to play standing up. Make sure that it can be shortened and lengthened appropriately, as some models cannot be short enough for a short person to play, or long enough for a big guy to play.
*Plastic strap lock. Washer made out of durable plastic that can be fitted over the strap buttons and have the hole shrunken to a smaller diameter, creating enough friction to ensure the strap stays on.
* Picks (also called plectrums). These come in a variety of shapes and sizes and are made of plastic though other materials are available. Picks fall into three categories: soft, medium and hard. Thin (soft) picks offer less resistance when striking the strings and have a degree of flexibility though they do tend to break easily and also produce a lower volume than the other two types. Thick (hard) picks rarely break and their inflexibility ensures firm and stable contact when striking the strings. Because picks are inexpensive you can buy all three types and various sizes; this will allow you to test which pick is suitable for you.
*Thumb and finger picks: while on a nylon string guitar it is not necessary, but on a steel string, finger picking without finger picks will produce a quieter less pronounced sound. Playing steel string with your bare fingers takes practice and presents a more physical challenge. A thumbpick is a good idea in that it frees the rest of the fingers of the hand for other stuff, such as holding the whammy bar or an e-bow.
* A guitar stand to set the guitar on when its not being played, or a guitar hanger to hang the guitar on the wall. The stand should be of the best quality since the guitar falling off the stand is the most common cause of cracks to the body. 
* A tuner of some kind - preferably an electronic one with a built-in microphone and guitar cable plug. Especially important for beginners learning to tune the guitar. Buy a good quality brand at the highest cost you can afford. The market is flooded with cheap guitar tuners that do a terrible job and the beginner is advised to avoid these They come in two display types: LED and floating needle. The floating needle type is recommended since it accurately displays the oscillations of a struck string. 
* A case or a gig bag - These are protection for the guitar. A Gig Bag is typically a thick padded (1-2&quot; of padding) zipper bag in the shape of the guitar which provides good protection and is necessary to avoid large scrapes and dings. A gig bag is not suitable for airline transportation. The case is a hardshell case suitable for greater protection and one that is ATA-approved even allows you to transport it in an airplane's cargo hold (make sure it is ATA approved!) If you are fine with  scrapes and dings or you do not plan on transporting the guitar often, a case might not be necessary. Keep in mind that the case helps protect your guitar from sudden temperature and humidity changes, which can harm the wood. 
* A string winder — very useful for changing strings. It's cheap, so may as well as get one now.
*Fine Polishing cloth - either one made for polishing guitars, or those used to wipe glasses. Fabric from an old flannel shirt works well too. Be sure to use 100% cotton.
*You will immediately need an extra set of strings at the time of purchase. Not only will this allow you to find out from the shop which gauge and make of strings is recommended for your guitar but will also give you a set of strings ready for the removal of the old strings in about 2 months time or 30 to 40 hours playing time later. Old strings start to lose their tone and become brittle and they will also show corrosion and discoloration. All professional guitarist have spare sets of strings close at hand for quick changes and if you don't mind the extra cost this is something you should do . Changing old strings is not an absolute necessity unless they break, so if your budget is tight, don't buy too many packs.  Also, the difference between the cheaper and more expensive strings is subtle at best, so as long as it is the right gauge, you are good to go.  Some people do not like the sound of new strings, which can be &quot;bright and metallic&quot;, but this is a matter of preference.

What you don't need:

* You don't need guitar polish. While you should always polish your guitar from time to time, most of the time the polish is mostly water with traces of lemon oil. As long as you have a small spray of water or just a quick dab on the cloth, it's good enough. Besides, what kind of polish is good is a matter of debate amongst guitarists.


Guitar dealers have a slower turnover of stock than most other businesses. Once a player has purchased a guitar it can be many years before they purchase another guitar. This means that the overheads and cost of running an outlet that sells guitars is reflected in the dealer's sale price of the guitar.  However, prices are negotiable (consider saying &quot;I've been thinking about this item; what's your best price?&quot;). Most of the accessories (including a gig bag) can be thrown in for free. Just tell a salesperson that you want to buy a guitar and they will probably start suggesting things they can throw in for free, and if not, you can suggest some accessories yourself. The hardshell case is usually an exception. Don't forget to calculate the any sales tax on top of that. For example, dealers will rarely, if ever, bring down the price of the cheaper guitars, but are more than willing to throw in extra accessories with the purchase of a guitar.  They will sometimes even offer to set it up for you. Also look for beginner-packs; these include most things a beginner would need to start off with and you will end up saving more money than if you had planned on buying those things separately.

All guitars require some maintenance over time since wood changes with air-pressure and humidity. However, this does not mean you need a humidifier, unless your guitar is very expensive or rare. Guitars at all price ranges are quite resilient to humidity and air pressure changes.

For an electric guitar, the player has many options in their choice of practice equipment. If you want to sound like your favorite electric guitarist, an amplifier of the sort they use will obviously be necessary. Find out if your favorite guitarist uses a valve or solid state amp. Buying an electric guitar with no amplifier can be a way to get a good guitar without spending too much at first. 

Another good substitute for an amplifier can be playing the guitar through a mixer or computer's sound card (especially a sound card or audio interface designed for recording guitar, like those made by M-Audio). There is a large amount of guitar effects software available; these use amplifier modeling and a wide range of effects combinations to create a simulation of the most popular guitar rigs. Amplitude and Guitar Rig are two popular guitar effects modeling software packages. Also, as mentioned in the [[Guitar/Buying an Amplifier|buying an amplifier]] article, you can buy a direct box which has been designed for amplifier modeling and because it is a dedicated piece of hardware offers even more accurate recreations of popular guitar rigs than its software equivalent. These modelers/direct boxes can also be used with a guitar amplifier as an effects unit.

== Removed material on cables ==

This should go in the accessories, amps page or even more suitable should be merged with the main chapter on cables. I've placed the material here and will place it in the appropiate section. I also think the image is not suitable or necessary for this section.

&lt;u&gt;Material Removed&lt;/u&gt;

====Cables====
[[Image:EKO Ranger 12.jpg|thumb|200px|An EKO Ranger twelve string acoustic guitar.]]
You will also need a cable to connect to your amplifier. Sometimes a shop may throw in a free cable when you buy a guitar, which apart from having poor shielding will also typically have a short head-shell that requires you to unplug it in the wrong way (i.e. grabbing the cable to pull it out, instead of grabbing the head-shell). This is especially true for Fender-type body-front-embedded plugs, which is also used on other big-name guitars. This method of removing the cord could result in damage to the guitar (for those without the plug guard, such as Ibanez S series) or the plug getting  stuck in the jack on the guitar.

Therefore, let's start with the headshell. If you are just using one that plugs into the side of the guitar, then  a standard AV-sized head plug is good enough. If you are using the body-front plugs, such as Fender and Ibanez S series, you may want to use the ones with the larger head-shell, which should be about three inches including the plug itself. When plugged in, the head-shell should be long enough for you to grab the plug comfortably and easily. The material used in construction of the head-shell also matters: some players endorse the metal head-shell; while others may prefer the injected plastic type.

The minimum cable length greatly depends on how and where you play the guitar. If you play it with the amplifier just next to it,  six to ten feet (3m) is enough. In a live or even a normal jamming situation, however, you may need 20 feet (6m) or more. If you want to connect the effect units, you may want cables as short as 3 feet. Also take note of any fraying or kinked sections as the cable's durability is the best indicator of quality; some have plastic-based wrapping and others use a knitted outer shell wrapping.

== Electric Guitar material removed ==

All this material has been covered in the Anatomy section and Different Guitars section. I've pasted it here to allow anything relevant to be included in its appropiate section.

&lt;u&gt;Material Removed&lt;/u&gt;

===Electric guitar===
''If you are buying an electric guitar, also read [[Guitar/Buying an Amplifier|Buying an Amplifier]]''

Amplified electric guitars sound very different from an acoustic guitar, even when no effects or distortion are used.  The pick-ups and amplifier define the guitar's sound. Electric guitars come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Pick-ups are an important part of an electric guitar's sound. There are two main kinds of pick-ups: passive single coil and humbuckers. Passive single coil pick-ups have one magnetic coil and are the standard pick-up for Fender Stratocasters. Humbuckers have two magnetic coils, allowing the pick-ups to be over-driven by the use of gain and this generally give a heavier overall sound.  Furthermore, as the name implies, humbuckers cancel noise from electrical interference. Ultimately, however, both kinds of pick-ups are suitable for any kind of music and you will have to decide what kind of pickup is best for you.

Guitars can have more than one pick-up and it is the arrangement of the pick-ups that generate the end tone. Another consideration is the &quot;playing area&quot; between the pick-ups, as too much contact with the pick-ups can change the tone drastically, if not damage it. The lack of a pick-up &quot;sticking out&quot; also allows harder (and slightly less precise) picking. Such a problem is even more prevalent when it is either the Humbucker-Single Coil-Humbucker or Humbucker-Humbucker-Humbucker arrangement, where there is  a smaller clean region, if any, and therefore will require a more careful approach to playing, which can be an important concern when buying a guitar for a beginner

A Tremolo bar, also known as a Whammy bar or Vibrato bar, is a bar that is used to slacken and stretch the strings, causing the sound to change pitch rapidly.  When used lightly, it can create a vibrato effect, but it is more commonly used for dive bombs and various other guitar tricks. Some whammy bars have locking mechanisms that allow you to stay in tune more easily.

===&quot;Special&quot; guitars===
There are a variety of less common guitar types. These include archtop guitars, 12-string guitars, bass guitars, and multi-neck guitars. Each kind of these special guitars has its own characteristics, which may or may not suit the playing style of the guitarist, they are usually used for specific reasons like timbre or for technical reasons. For more information on these kinds of guitars, please see the [[Guitar/Different_Types_of_Guitars|Different Type of Guitars]] article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
== Environmental Power ==

When using environmental power sources like wind and solar power, it is important to remember that they are often unpredictable and intermittent.  For instance, should an island be powered by sunlight and wind, on a a calm, dark evening these sources will not be available.  Unless intermittent power on the island is deemed acceptable, an energy reserve must be maintained for periods when the primary generators are not working, either by storing excess energy produced during active periods, or importing energy to the island in the form of fuel or charged batteries.  Needless to say, unless the island can produce sufficient revenue to cover the cost of importing energy (say, by selling excess fish caught or vegetables grown on site), this method will not allow self sufficiency.  

Electrical energy would be stored in rechargeable batteries, whose DC output would need to be converted to mains AC to run standard equipment on the island (unless the equipment is built to use DC,) or electrical power could be generated as needed by driving a generator from imported (or grown) fuel, or possibly recovered biomass.  An engine burning imported fuel could equally well provide mechanical energy directly (say, for driving propellers should the island be navigable).  It is very important to have a method of starting the generators and engines in the absence of other energy sources, say a starter motor, pull cord or starting handle, if the latter approach is taken.

== OTEC Generators ==

OTEC is an acronym standing for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion. It uses the difference in temperature between the cold water at depth and the much warmer water at the surface.
[http://www.nrel.gov/clean_energy/ocean.html]



== Wind Power ==

Off-shore the wind has few obstacles that cause turbulence; because of this the wind tends to blow slightly stronger. (Mention anchoring to seabed or floating platforms (and anchor problems) and economies of scale)

Advantage: 24 hours, except when no wind

== Wave Power Generators ==

These types of generators that harness the energy created by sea-waves is, so far, too expensive and impractical for the average island-maker. Many of the various designs for the generator are still frustrated by the practical challenges of the sea, chiefly storm damage and saltwater corrosion. The salter's duck is one example of a wave based generation system.  

Another method, which does not require tethering to the sea floor like salter's duck and hence allows the island to be moved without dismantling, is to build an island of several modular, independently floating units linked by pivoted arms, which could also serve as bridges.  In the presence of waves of the correct wavelength, twice the length of each arm for example, the relative vertical movement of the floating units would apply an oscillating turning moment to the arms, from which power could be extracted by attaching pistons to them to pump seawater through a turbine or compress air into a tank.  Of course, this method of power generation would require the island to be located in an area with an abundance of waves, and the occupants to endure the wave motion of the floating units.  One solution might be to make one large floating island to be used as a central habitation area, of sufficiently great buoyant volume that wave effects are cancelled out, and surround it by small auxiliary islands on arms which would not be occupied for significant periods, storage for food, fresh water and machinery, for example.  These smaller islands would then move relative to the stationary central hub to generate power.

== Current turbines ==

There are many currents in the sea, the most obvious one to most people is the gulf stream. This flows year round at around 4 knots. A single turbine placed in this stream could produce significant amounts of power. It is unknown how much power we could remove from a current such as this before it may have an appreciable effect on the world. (Mention Betz theorem as related to wind and adjust to water as just another fluid dynamics problem)

== Photovoltaic Arrays ==

Solar panels may not be a good choice when considering that they will take up space and sunlight on the island which could otherwise be used for growing food, and are also only usable during fairly bright daylight.

Solar panels have been around since the early 70s for commercial purposes. Only now with economies and power crises around the world are they becoming very popular. Photovoltaic panels are made up of many small cells each having a voltage of around 0.4-0.6V these are then connected in series or parallel to produce a panel of a certain size and specification. Current photovoltaic panels use a single layer of very pure silicon to convert solar radiation into electricity.  Next generation panels incorporating up to five layers of slightly less pure, and hence much cheaper, silicon are just around the corner. Photovoltaic panels are fairly inefficient, converting around 10% of the light falling on them into usable electricity, and hence a very large area of panels will be required to provide a sizeable power output.  It might be worth calculating the relative efficiency of plants converting light into chemical energy, and the subsequent efficiency of burning this (for example, as plant oils, ethanol or methanol) in an engine to produce electricity, and comparing this to solar panels.  Photovoltaic cells also have a problem with temperature, becoming less efficient the hotter they get.

== Solar furnace or Steam powered turbines ==

Sun power is free, however most techniques for converting it into usable power are very expensive to implement. One technique that can be fairly cheap to build if designed carefully is the concept of the solar furnace. In the solar furnace many mirrors are used to focus sunlight at a single point. This point will get very hot very quickly and this temperature rise can be used to turn water into steam. This steam can then be used to turn a turbine and produce electricity. Design of a solar furnace is critical, since you are potentially dealing with superheated steam and explosion risk is a distinct possibility. However it is a valid concept and a floating island could use its very nature to assist.  To avoid the problems of dealing with superheated steam, peltier devices or hot air engines could be substituted, at the cost of scale.

Instead of turning all the mirrors to face the sun it may be easier to turn the island. This depends on a number of things and the mirrors will still need to track the sun's elevation in the sky.

== Geothermal (ocean vents) ==

== Biofuels ==
There has been much publicity in the last few years about crops of fast growing wood such as willow being grown strictly as an alternative fuel for burning in power stations. The same idea could possibly be used with kelp or seaweed in the ocean.  However it may not be a particularly efficient process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Desalination of Sea Water ==

Sea water can be processed to remove any dissolved salts to provide almost pure water. The simplest technique for doing this is simply to heat the water until it evaporates and then re-condense the water into a fresh water tank. As a by-product of this you will have a large quantity of salt. If you break the process into separate stages you can sort these separate salts as they will come out of solution at different points. However, since distilled water has no minerals, you should consider adding 2-4 drops of sea water, which contains the minerals that the body needs to survive. Drinking distilled water is unhealthy and could eventually kill you.

Yields for these different salts are roughly as follows.

Yield per ton of water processed

Chloride   (Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)	18.9800

Sodium	(Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)	10.5560

Sulfate	 (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) 2.6490

Magnesium   (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)	1.2720

Calcium	(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.4000

Potassium	(K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.3800

Bicarbonate	(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.1400

Bromide	(Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.0650

Borate	(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.0260

Strontium	(Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.0130

Fluoride	(F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)	0.0010

Many of these products are valuable on the commercial market as many other processes rely on them which on its own may justify the cost of the island.

{{TODO| Verify information. (Note: I'm not sure where this list came from originally, however the information is public domain [[User:Darkflib|Darkflib]] 09:58, 29 July 2005 (UTC))}}

== Desert Cone ==
Basically you make a hole and then put something to collect water in the bottom, then you cover it with a waterproof tarp and put a rock on the place above the container. then condensation will drip down into the container.

== Distilling Water ==
You can distill water without using any fuels by using a solar oven or cooker [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cooker]

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you do not live on the island permanently and have a main base on another body of land, it would be more practical to send routine supplies to the island rather than attempt any of the following.

== Food Producing Plants ==
'''Freshwater Plants'''
If you use edible freshwater plants, such as rice, you're going to have to keep the plants away from the saltwater that your island is probably floating in (unless it's built in fresh water, such as a lake.) One solution is to plant these above the ground, in which case you're also going to have to give them some of the salt free drinking water for them to survive. If the island has no native soil then it will be required to either import it or generate it from raw materials. &lt;b&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics Hydroponics]&lt;/b&gt; is another option.

'''Saltwater Plants'''
Edible marine plants include the seaweed kelp and the red alga carrageenan.  These can live and thrive in salty seawater; in fact, most of them can only live in saltwater.

'''Land Plants'''
Edible land plants, such as potatoes or wheat, are also an option, but this will only work if your island has soil.  For most plants (except those few that grow at the seashore,) you will also have to provide protection from the sea and access to  fresh water, unless of course your island is ''built'' in fresh water.

== Fishing ==
Fish are the most available source of meat for an island, although means of cooking them would be less readily acquired. Sushi is an alternative, combining farmed seaweed and raw fish. Shellfish (such as crabs, lobsters, oysters, and shrimp) can be gathered in large amounts by use of cages and traps.

==Insects==
Edible insects are another possible source of food, as they do not need much space and can live off of most foods, but you should make sure that they ''are'' edible, that there ''is'' food for them, and that you can overcome the &quot;Gross!&quot; factor.

*For now, this page is for discussion of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), defined as surgically unresectable at presentation.
**Historically this includes features such as skin ulceration, tumor fixation to chest wall, satellite nodules, and palpable supraclavicular LNs
**Today, it may also include operable tumors &gt;5cm, which are typically treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Inflammatory|Inflammatory breast cancer]] is discussed separately at its [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Inflammatory|own page]].


*'''MD Anderson''' 
**'''2007''' PMID 17418973 -- &quot;Postmastectomy radiation improves the outcome of patients with locally advanced breast cancer who achieve a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&quot; (McGuire SE, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Apr 5; [Epub ahead of print])
***Retrospective. 106 LABC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo, who achieved pCR on mastectomy. No inflammatory. Chemo 92% anthracycline-based, 38% also taxane. Post-mastectomy RT in 72 (68%). Median F/U 5.2 years
***10-year loco-regional recurrence: Stage I-II 0% for both with and without RT; Stage III RT 7.3% vs. no RT 33% (SS). In Stage III, also benefit to DSS and OS
***Conclusion: PMRT provides significant clinical benefit for Stage III patients with pCR after neoadjuvant chemo and mastectomy
**'''2006''' (1985-1989) PMID 16750325 -- &quot;Fifteen-year results of a randomized prospective trial of hyperfractionated chest wall irradiation versus once-daily chest wall irradiation after chemotherapy and mastectomy for patients with locally advanced noninflammatory breast cancer.&quot; (Buchholz TA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jul 15;65(4):1155-60.)
***Phase III. 200 patients with clinical Stage III, no inflammatory BCA. Treated with neoadjuvant chemo; if CR then mastectomy and randomized to standard PMRT (60/30) vs. hyperfractionated PMRT (72/60 in 1.2 Gy BID). SCV treated in both arms to 50/25. Median F/U 15 years
***15-year LRR: standard 7% vs. hyperfractionated 12% (NS)
***Toxicity: acute similar, moist desquammation standard 28% vs. hyperfractionated 42% (NS); late similar 6% vs. 11% (NS)
***Conclusion: No evidence of clinical advantage for hyperfractionated regimen

*'''NCI, 2004''' (1980-1988) PMID 15483018 -- &quot;Long-term follow-up for locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer patients treated with multimodality therapy.&quot; (Low JA, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Oct 15;22(20):4067-74.)
**Retrospective. 107 patients with Stage III BCA (46 inflammatory) prospectively treated on protocol. Initial chemo (CAFM), if pCR then PMRT concurrent with CAF chemo and conjugated hormones; if pPR then mastectomy/ALND and PMRT concurrent with CAF chemo and conjugated hormones. Median F/U 16.8 years
**Median OS: inflammatory 3.8 years vs. IIIA 12.2 years vs. IIIB 9.0 years; 15-year OS: 20% vs. 50% vs. 23%

To have a micronation you need to be able to claim a section of land. For instance, you could create your own living space:
*[[/Island/|Create your own island]]

You can also claim territory on the seafloor or in outer space.  The main advantage of these is that you can claim these for purposes of research.
*[[/Seafloor Land Claims/|Claim territory on the seafloor]]
*[[/Extraterrestrial Territory/|Claim terriitory in outer space]]

{{TODO|Cover the basics of claiming land in the polar regions, underwater and space.}}

== Independence ==
''See [[/Independence/]]

== Political and legal decisions ==

=== Constitutional state ===
Next, you have to write a constitution.  If you don't know where to start, look at the constitution of the United States for knowledge of what to include.  You can also include a provision for amending the constitution if you wish.  You can stop at this point, but we recommend going on to step four.

=== Establishing sovereignty ===
Now, you should establish your sovereignty and make your name and that of your micronation known to all who wish to know it.  A website is a useful tool at this point; we recommend using a site like Freewebs to create the homepage and, if preferred, other pages about your brand new nation!

== National Defense ==
Defending your own territory against outside forces (pirates, for example) is a tough problem to overcome if you do not have the means. If you have made treaties with other, more powerful nations that require them to aid you if you so ask of them, this may be of great benefit in terms of defense. However, in the case of a small man-made island, the outcome of an attack against your island depends greatly on whether the other nation's forces arrive to your aid on time or not.

You may happen to have the resources to build your own defense force, too. It would be a good idea, firstly, to set up signs around your island to warn outsiders of your existence and your right to defend yourself. Creating a defense force requires, most basically, firepower. Missile launchers, cannons and the like are useful for relatively long-range attacks across the water, however, this may require a strongly built island with enough room to store ammunition and hold up to recoil, as well as some way to repair or evacuate the island in the case of an ammunition explosion.&lt;br&gt;
However, even if you have the firepower, the next important thing to have are those who will defend. National defense is not usually a one-man job, and it would be preferable to have more people working in the defense force. This is where having a small (or even better, large) population would come in handy. 

If you have claimed a sufficient area of territorial waters for your island, it may then be practical to set up mines around your island. However, this may hamper your own transportation on sea if you plan to do so in the future. Having air-transportation (i.e. helicopters, etc.) would not be a problem, though.

Planting mines *may* be against international law; you must declare that you have mined an area, but how specific you are in declaring it is completely up to you.

== About Introdução á programação ==

Thanks very much, Robert!!! I'm lightningspirit from the portuguese project of Wikibooks, and i saw that you posted [http://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o_%C3%A0_Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o:_%C3%8Dndice Introdução à Programação] book for Wikimania Awards... Awesome :D The book is a Finalist! Thank you very much!
Pela nossa grande aliança entre Ingleses e portugueses. Muito obrigado! :)
:Da nada.  Eu gusto Wikilivros e acha que esta livro e o melhor livro do entro mundo de Wikibooks projectos.  Sendo uma finalista de Wikimania certamente e uma marca de distinção.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:54, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== Checkuser  ==

Thanks for the vote on [[WB:RFA]]. I have to say that I don't particularly ''want'' the checkuser rights, but I think that we do need them, and that I could get the votes together to make it happen. I agree with you on all counts: Bureaucrats probably should get checkuser rights immediately and the bureaucrat creation process should be more strict. I would like to incorporate text like that into the [[Wikibooks:Administrators/Proposal|new administrator policy that I am drafting]], but I don't know how best to do it. Certainly, we can't make our policy say that &quot;every bcrat automatically gets checkuser&quot;, because the stewards have their own policy on the matter, and they are unlikely to follow ours. However, i think that an RFA vote for a bcrat should be done in conjuction for an RFA for checkuser rights. For instance, all the votes to create a bcrat, if successfull, would be automatically rolled over to support that bcrat getting checkuser rights as well. If a bcrat is elected with 10 votes, that means only 15 additional votes would be required to get checkuser rights.

On my policy proposal, I state that a bcrat candidate must currently be an admin, but we could make the requirements more strict then that: there are plenty of admins here (mostly inactive) who simply don't deserve to have any additional tools at their disposal. I realize that I am more strict when it comes to admins then you are. Perhaps we could include text that a bcrat candidate must be an admin in good standing, who is &quot;reasonably&quot; active, has no recent history of abuse, and uses the admin tools to benefit the community.

On a personal note, I've considered for some time now nominating you for the position of bcrat, I'm sure you could get the votes without any problem. If you feel like you are too busy with your other projects, I can understand that. If you are not too busy elsewhere, I would like to see you get nominated for it. Let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:52, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:By the way, before I even had a chance to nominate you for bcrat, [[User:AlbertCahalan]] has nominated you for checkuser rights. I'm in favor of it, if you will accept your nomination. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:07, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== Mentor ==
Hi, I'm looking for a mentor -- see [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=WV:CC#Deon555_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29 here]. I saw your name on the list of mentors, and I see your not at your limit of 2 Probationaries like sebmol, so I was wondering if you would take me on :) Let me know on my talk page, or [[w:User_talk:Deon555/WV|here]]
--[[User:Deon555|Deon555]] 08:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC) (currently [[User:61.68.178.39|61.68.178.39]])

== Wikistandards ==
Robert. I notied that you played a central role in the voting for wikistandards. I have a thread going on foundation-L where I proposed such a project. And I was directed to meta where I eventually found the now-defunct effort. Can you tell me in your opinion why it died, and whether I can work to revive it? The thread on foundation-L is titled &quot;proposed new project - wikistandards.&quot; My name shows up there as &quot;No Spam.&quot; The first standard I want to get going is a Project Management standard (similar to the for-profit effort at PMI.org). [[User:Cacace|Cacace]] 00:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

== Welcome back! ==

Welcome back from your wikibreak, Rob! I've held off proposing some new projects so you had the opportunity to comment on (and hopefully help out with, if you have the time!) the projects. Hope to see you around a lot more, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:20, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

== ht wikisource ==

you proposed yourself as an admin for ht.wikisource.org.
currently this site is not maintained at all, and we are wondering whether it should be closed or not.

could you please become a sysop there (ask a steward, eg Yann), 
and import all the pages in Haitian from wikisource.org ?

thanks,

ThomasV on ws.org

== Hi Robert! ==

Good to &quot;see your face&quot;... how's the press idea coming along?

BTW, Import is actually enabled now... there's a request in at bugzilla for the transwiki namespace, hopefully they'll get to it soon (currently you have to import, then move to transwiki, then delete the original file... total drudgery, but a lot better then the copy-paste of yore). Keep an eye on [[WB:RFI]] for incoming requests. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

:Just read the start of your blog... I'll definitely be following :). 
:I was going to leave a comment there, but I have way too many accounts and passwords to keep track of these days. OTOH I've been thinking of blogging myself lately... was it easy enough to set up? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:10, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

::Starting the blog wasn't all that difficult.  The hosting company is one of the &quot;Google&quot; related companies and applying for a new blog was about as difficult as registering an account with Wikimedia projects... well, almost.  But I have put a little more thought into the structure of the blog and while at first it was going to be just general musings of mine, I think something more dedicated to the free textbook &quot;industry&quot; might be a little better.  And certainly here on Wikibooks we are right in the thick of that philosophy and concept.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Untagged Images ==

Hey Rob, I just wanted to let you know that there are currently [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=Robert+Horning&amp;grouped= 4 untagged images to your name], and we are going to move forward with mass deletion of untagged images within a month or so. 

Since it is you, I have no doubt that these images are under an acceptable license. If you let me know what license that is, I will gladly tag them all for you.

== Robert - I still need your help! ==
I need to move Algebra 1 in Simple English to Simple English Wikibooks.  You said that you would move it several months ago, but I guess you forgot. I'm getting lots of contributions, but unfortunately they're from people who do not understand the meaning of Simple English. I need the book to be on the Simple English Wiki so that people will be more likely to write in Simple English. I'm making a big presentation at a Math conference on Dec. 1st, and I really need this situation cleared up before then.  Please point me to someone else if you don't have time or can't help me with this.--[[User:HSTutorials|HSTutorials]] 05:22, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

P.S. I just asked the staff lounge if there was someone there who could help me out.

== Acetone peroxide synthesis ==

I have proposed the acetone peroxide synthesis for deletion. What do you think? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:11, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Mentorship on Wikiversity ==

Would you mind being my mentor as a custodian? I wish to become a custodian to further my contributions on Wikiversity and to improve this project. To tell you a little about what I have done so far, I have set up the [[v:Topic:Spanish|Spanish Language Division]] and am the instructor of the [[v:Spanish|Spanish I and Spanish II courses]]. I have also done some work on templates such as [[v:Template:Talkheader|talk header]], [[v:Template:Spanish|Spanish language]], [[v:Template:To_do|to do list]], and others. -- [[v:User:J.Steinbock|J.Steinbock]]

== Medicine4Kids ==
I'm interested in your opinion on the [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Medicine4kids|VfD for Medicine4Kids]]. Both specifically as it regards that title and more generally how the quoted policy appies to WikiJunior. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

== Tut tut ==

Very naughty - moving a VfD to speedy like that - well I got my wrist slapped earlier so...  Of course I agree with you &lt;g&gt; Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Protection ==

Blindingly obvious when put like that and thanks.  In practice last time the talk page was also used as an apparent &quot;dump&quot; of fiction which made me enquire in the lounge.  In practice I feel less deletionist as time goes on so views on &quot;if they put it on the talk page&quot; again at all?  Thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Stub deletion ==

Have you seen that What is Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|unstable page]] and the accompanying [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|talk page]] lately? I thought it was interesting you commented &quot;at least as long as we don't have a stub deletion policy&quot; as justification to keep Toki Pona. Specifically the following.
:&quot;It may be that, even though a textbook meets the criteria specified in this policy, it is unsuitable for Wikibooks for other reasons. For example, it may be in such a state of disrepair and no one wants to revise into something workable.&quot;
While it doesn't directly come out and say it, I could imagine that being used to justify deleting stubs. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 15:14, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:But that is a ''proposed'' policy and IMHO has not been thought through either, nor has the full definition of a stub been brought forth.  I do believe that there are some stubs that can be deleted that are a paragraph long or even just a few words.  But it is an area that we do need to be careful over and not treat lightly.  And what we currently think of as a very old Wikibook (no activity for two years or so) may not seem so old here in a few years.  There are only two really good reasons to remove very old stubs:

#Server disc space - And this isn't really an argument as Wikibooks take up so little space that it hardly matters, especially compared to Wikipedia.  And besides, the deleted pages still take up server space even after they are no longer &quot;visible&quot; to ordinary users.

#Dealing with indexing of Wikibooks - Acting under the assumption that having more pages to &quot;watch&quot; is going to become an administrative burden for those charged with maintaining Wikibooks as a project.  There is some merit to this idea, but I don't think it is as big of a deal as everybody seems to make it out as.

:I would like to see a better justification to deleting stubs than this before they are deleted in large numbers.  I also don't believe that [[Toki Pona]] fits the minimal definition as an insignificant stub.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:25, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I understand that it is a proposed policy. And I only partially agree with it. And I do not think that Toki Pona should be deleted. I was pointing the page out to you because I think that it will be adopted regardless of how well-thought out it is. For one thing, on the talk page Whiteknight has already put up a vote. For another, on IRC, the admins (that are on there) talk about it almost as if it is already adopted. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 15:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Publishing, etc ==

Hey Rob, it's been a while since you were around alot, so welcome back! I wanted to ask you specifically, what needs to get done for a wikibook to get published? What if we publish through an external publishing house, and dont involve the WMF in the process directly? Many of the policy pages that we are working on now will have some effect on our ability to publish our books, and if we all know the ramifications better, and if we know the current status of the project better, perhaps we can make our decisions better. Would you mind writing up some kind of notice, or even an essay about the status of this? What do we need? What is the stance of the WMF? Who do we need to talk to? I think you are currently the most knowledgible on this topic, so anything you have to say about it will be appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

:We (meaning myself and Gabriel.... er [[User:Munchkinguy]]), have been successful in obtaining some ISBNs for several Wikibooks, and have set up the PDF files with Lulu Press to do the actual publication.  I'm not entirely happy with this arrangement, but it is a way for us to get started and get something going.  Keep in mind that we are doing this on the ultimate shoestring budget, and unfortunatly the prices of the books we are publishing reflect that as well as they are a little high by my taste, with nearly all of money going to publications costs due to low volume.

:My ultimate goal, and what I would really like to accomplish here in terms of a long-term goal is to set up a publishing cooperative that Wikibooks contributors would be able to join and &quot;publish&quot; their books through this &quot;company&quot;.  The purpose of it really is mainly to get the books actually in the hands of kids and &quot;readers&quot; in general.  The problem is trying to find a &quot;white knight&quot; (no pun intended here to you) that would be able to help us out here and help us with the business side of things.  I've talked to Jimbo briefly about this, as I think it may be something he might want to get involved with independently of the WMF (like he did with Wikia), but at the same time we may not want a target that big at the moment either.

:This &quot;cooperative business&quot; (see [[w:Cooperative]] for similar businesses) would not be &quot;owned&quot; by the Wikimedia Foundation, but instead would be jointly owned by Wikibooks users/contributors.  This is important in part because the WMF doesn't want to get into the game for legal reasons, and because I also want to set this up in such a way that those who do the work will get rewarded for their efforts, including contributions to Wikibooks.  Part of that reward certainly is altruistic for the most part, as in giving to the rest of &quot;mankind&quot; in terms of content.  But at the same time, there is nothing explict that is stopping any of us from making a little profit here as well off of our efforts.

:Note that the WMF's &quot;official stance&quot; is that they want nothing to do with being a formal &quot;publisher&quot; of Wikimedia content.  That is something that the Wikimedia user community has to try and come up with on their own without any assistance from the WMF.

:As far as using another &quot;external publisher&quot; is concerned, I'm not completely against that either, but I want to make sure that if it is done that those who put the content together will be properly acknowledged and potentially be able to &quot;give back&quot; to the WMF some financial support for even hosting Wikibooks in the first place.  A private for-profit company may not do this as well as everybody would like.

:I know that there are many Wikibooks users who wouldn't mind trying to get the publication of these books going, for other personal reasons.  I have a little bit of a vanity streak in me as well to doing this, but it has to be a practical business situation as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

Morning or similar and best wishes for 2007.  I think I made it 24 not 25 tho (never mind the discussion on consensus now rumbling!).  I do appreciate the thoughts and the comments.  While I do tend to shoot from the hip and be a bit of a deletionist I am getting better I assure you - hopefully I am still well aware that there are times to ask others for advice, when I know it all it will be past time to leave!

== Wikibooks content ==

Don't talk to strangers if you don't want them to talk to you!! I will pursue this in an appropriate spot when I've thought it thro some more.  I should say I am not a fan of rigid policies and rules (make of that what you want).  

I have posted before in the Staff lounge (&amp; been largely ignored) about the quality of the content of Wikibooks and your posting on original research made me think again.  To me we have many &quot;books&quot; that follow the rules in terms of subject matter etc that are frankly dire.  In the past week there was a &quot;complaint&quot; about lack of content on one of the IB books talk pages &amp; I had to point out that if no one was able to contribute the book would remain dormant sadly - not what I would like to be saying.  Any time I look at Wikijunior I realise just how good the offerings here can be.  To me original research or anything else that is of a high quality seems to offer the reader of Wikibooks something we could be proud of?

Of course the flip side is that I would like to delete (de-list?) books that did not meet a standard - there that should be fun.

I know it would fly in the face of policy etc etc but am I way out of line here?  Thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:33, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:I completely support those who want to help improve the overall quality of Wikibooks, and that I why I support things like the Book of the Month and &quot;cleanup&quot; campaigns in general.

:My main concern over hard core &quot;original research&quot; here on Wikibooks has more to do with procedures the &quot;cull out the cruft&quot; rather than any real issue over having a place to put some of the better original research.  Frankly, admin Wikibookians for the most part simply aren't equiped with the tools necessary to judge original research, and as such it is much easier to simply remove it altogether rather than trying to judge each case by its merits.

:All this said, a scholarly book that happens to incorporate a few good new ideas should not be rationale to delete the entire Wikibook, nor should even those few extra pages that help give further insight into a topic that might be called &quot;original research&quot; necessarily be reason for deletion.  In other words, there is no real hard and fast rule about this concept.  But the problem here is that when pages become sufficient to become &quot;citable&quot; in other context, perhaps this &quot;original research&quot; needs to be examined.

:One of the current outstanding problems with Wikibooks, BTW, has to do with mainly indexing, searching, and bringing up what exactly Wikibooks has to offer.  There are a variety of ways to get this accomplished, which is one of the reasons why I tried to get the [[WB:CCO|Card Catalog Office]] going.  It really needs to be restarted in some ways, or at least significantly expanded.  Your comment about why a certain IB book doesn't have content should also be somewhat termed &quot;why can't I find what I want on Wikibooks?&quot;  At least with Wikipedia you can reasonably find an article about the topic comparatively quickly, with only a minor search or two to get to the page.  Wikibooks seems to be much harder to get the same sort of task accomplished, mainly because of the larger structures that are a part of Wikibooks.  That many redirects get deleted that might gently assist with that task is also a minor issue, even though I will admit that redirects are not the answer here on Wikibooks as they sometimes provide on Wikipedia.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:45, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::Thanks Rob - much sense there but I do think we need to look for quality.  Johnny has just started a &quot;request for comments&quot; page ([[WB:RFC]]) which might be useful.

== Arbitrators ==

Hi Robert. The problem with not having a &quot;system&quot; in place is because in the past it hasn't worked so well. I arbitrated a situation recently, using the informal system you seem to prefer, and it's been a miserable experience. Not only that, but while I was watching that one, another user was asking for arbitration, but I didn't want to take on 2 at once, and no-one else stepped up. Having a &quot;formal structure&quot; says: &quot;this is serious, and needs to be addrressed now.&quot; It might also be useful in cases where one arbitrator needs to step out and hand the magic wand to someone else. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:This is something that has been debated endlessly for more than a year here on Wikibooks.  The problems involved are both need, and find somebody who is willing to take on the job.  Both have been rather lacking here on Wikibooks in the past, although there certainly seem to be some very active users that may be able to take on the job.  BTW, can you point to a specific situation here on Wikibooks that your arbitration skills were invoked?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::That would probably be between Panic and me, I would imagine. Could you provide some more insight on [[Wikibooks_talk:Ownership]]?

== Arbitration == 
Rob, I'm not an admin, but I would be willing to participate in the arbitration process you've set up. I support the structure you have created, and feel that is the best way to achieve a fair result. I am interested in participating because if (as it seems) we are setting a precedent for the future I would like to help make sure that the process is done right. 

I do not have any preconceptions about the situation, do not know any of the parties involved, and feel I can be entirely neutral in this situation. These qualities may be a rare combination around here. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 23:22, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

:Hey Rob. I saw the arbitration thing, and while I support the process, I worry about a few points:
:#Arbitration typically requires arbitrators. Who is going to fill this roll in the current case, and how will arbitrators (or is it &quot;arbiters&quot;?) be chosen in the future?
:#It would seem to me that applying arbitration would require some sort of policy in place that will make the result of the arbitration binding. No sense setting up a whole judicial system if it has no authority.
:#Typically, I would say that Panic2k4 is reasonably unpopular, while SBJohnny is reasonably popular. asking wikibooks locals to make a decision on this matter (considering the small size of the community), would likely be an unnecessary bias immediately. Conversely, asking outsiders to come take care of our affairs opens a much worse can of worms that I dont think any of us want.
:I like the idea of an arbitration process, but I would hate to see us all rush into it without thinking it through. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:40, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
::It should be noted that I am acting as an abritrator at the moment, but &quot;self-appointed&quot;, mainly because this has been agreed upon by both Panic and the other parties involved.  It is more mediation, but I'm forcing to arbitration by virtue of being an administrator, and acknowledging that I can reblock using my tools as an administrator, with a decision like this through this process making it &quot;stick&quot;.  I don't think once this process is completed and most of the current admins can agree to the ultimate decisions made (not to mention vetting of the issues involved) that there will be anybody arguing against the ultimate outcome.
::We really do need to come up with an arbitrator committee, and that is certainly something that needs to be determined in the future.  I have a few additional thoughts about the topic, but I'll add to that once I've gone through this meat grinder process.
::It should be noted that I'm hoping (against hope) that everybody will come to an eventual concensus and not even really force me into a &quot;decision&quot; process.  This is more a fact-finding process that I hope will reveal plainly who has screwed up here the worst, and I'm not trying to rush to a judgement first.  If Panic is making as many problems as is alleged, it should be pretty obvious.  I'm also hoping that he realizes that several people are very upset with his actions, regardless of if he is &quot;in the right&quot; or not.  Johnny and Darklama are both creating waves as well, which is another reason I'm forcing their hand to participate here.
::I'm formatting this as a legal proceeding, as such is really just a formalized debate anyway.  The terms and names could certainly be modifed, but the whole point here is to get the information out in a structured manner.  I've framed how the issues are going to be aired, but it is up to the participants who are complaining to bring the actual issues up.  Again, I'm hoping just to be a referee here and not really make the ultimate decision unless it is being forced.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
:::What I would hate to see is for you to come to a conclusion which not only puts you at odds with the rest of the community (you may be neutral, but much of the community is biased against the defendant). In such a situation, especially without some sort of policy background, I can't imagine that the community will allow you to make a decision &quot;stick&quot;. We also run the risk of establishing feuds between the admins here (which generally represent a tight community) which is much much worse, in my opinion, then not dealing with the issue at all.
:::As to arbitration, as I think about it, I disagree with it more and more. Wikibooks does well by avoiding the bureaucratic nonsense that has plagued wikipedia. In general, the community here favors the &quot;less is more&quot; approach to administration (policy, judiciary, etc), and setting up another level of administrative overhead is more then en.wikibooks needs or (i think) wants. Be careful in this Rob, you're a good wikibookian, but even the best intentions sometimes lead to the worst ends. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

Herr hope that your removal of the block will not get you in any trouble, that done and since the unblock is made, the problem in particular was partially addressed.

I would ask that for a clear process you place a restating of the warning [[User:SBJohnny]] intended or as he said (and now clearly have done so) ''you are blocked because you started moving talk pages around (actually it was more like &quot;re-moving&quot; them), as you were warned not to do.'', so something like ''You shouldn't further reformat(change or alter the format) of work [[C++ Programming]] that originated the initial dispute involving [[User:Panic2k4]] and [[User:Darklama]]'' both in my talk page and [[User:Darklama]], ask [[User:SBJohnny]] to step down and let you take any administrative actions necessary on that subject in the future, so we don't get into any unnecessary (my interpretation) blocks/disputes in the future.

I would also like to have all blocks made by [[User:SBJohnny]] to me analyzed and failing to provide validity to them removed from my block log and some consideration given to what to do to [[User:SBJohnny]] in sequence to the findings.

As for the format dispute with [[User:Darklama]], they can be addressed partially (since they go above and beyond the actual policies), I will once again state the points here to you and you will see what can be done.

Will this be possible and acceptable to all parties ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:I do want to let you know that your concerns will be aired.  As I tried to point out, this was a fight and edit war between two different users (yourself and Darklama), to which unfortunately SBJohnny became a party instead of a moderator.  There is nothing directly wrong with that, but this is precisely why I have requested that this go to a formal arbitration, particularly given an admin involved here.

:I have recieved a general agreement that a cooling off from the C++ Programming Wikibook will happen for the time being, particularly from the two users you have mentioned above, although there is nothing directly here that will stop other editor/contributors from editing the Wikibook.  I have suggested that if this whole thing gets completely out of hand that I will simply freeze the C++ book through page protection, but I don't want to take that very drastic step at the moment.

:I'll let you know when the &quot;plaintiff&quot; has decided to end their list of charges and you can start to formally display your defense here.  BTW, in this whole thing, make sure you are also listing what you saw may have been abuses by Darklama and SB Johnny, including being blocked and why you think it may not have been appropriate.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Since you are considering the &quot;plaintiff&quot; as [[User:SBJohnny]] I must point out that this can probably lead to error, as plaintiff is by definition a person who brings an action in a court of law, in this case the definition would more directly apply to me, as I'm the plaintiff appealing on action by an administrator. No big problem I think I get your point but we should be careful not to mess this up. If legal term are to be used, [[User:SBJohnny]] is the &quot;defendant&quot;. You should probably take this in consideration and be sure no confusion is generated.

:: It all depend on how things are stated (there is still a missing statement that defines the procedure), Is the arbitration about the request of unblock or a justification for the block, that is am I to accuse the other user or wrong doing and invalidate the block or is he to prove my wrong doing by that justify the block ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:21, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: As it is your intention to have [[User:SBJohnny]] write his POV first (I have no problem with it), he must provide information on the actions that created the block dispute, the why, the who, and the how (or other points that can be cross examined/contested by me) and you should give him a time frame to do so, some time constraints should exist in every step of the process.

:: I have noticed in [[Wikibooks talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4 vs. SBJohnny/Plaintiff Charges]]
:: a post from [[User:Iamunknown]], and I agree that any other person with other disputes against me should be encouraged to vent them out and see them registered. But they should be signed posts and with the indication of the person involved and the topic of the dispute they also propose for analysis (if not directly related with the actual motion) and with enumerated points so I will be able to address them point by point and reduce confusion. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I do want to point out that I have repeatedly asked several of those involved, including Johnny himself, to rename these pages if he doesn't want to be named in the dispute, or to be considered the &quot;plaintiff&quot;.  In this case, he is more like a beat cop who perhaps stepped over the line (as you are asserting here) that regardless of what happened certainly performed an action that ultimately precipitated this current course of action.  He was also the one who tried to get me involved, even if this isn't exactly the way he wanted it to go down.  His assertions (as well as Darklama, who perhaps is better named as the &quot;plaintiff&quot;) were also given to me on the Wikibooks IRC channel, so I tried to make them official.  It is not too late to name the &quot;parties&quot; in this arbitration case, but I also consider that to be a trivial detail.

:::As far as signing the posts, I think that is being covered fairly well.  Instead of &quot;signing&quot; the posts, they are being seperated by section heading for each individual who is offering an opinion.  You are, of course, free to use whatever formatting you would like in your reply, including using the more traditional wiki sig.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: I also do formally request that the unblock request (and only that) be moved from my page to an addendum to the arbitration process (for historical reasons) and protected from edits, as it is it's causing problems on my talk page, txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Seems like a very reasonable request.  I'll go ahead and do that right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: After [[User:SBJohnny]] last post to me [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Panic2k4#Just_checking_in... here], it seems the he is unsure what you intentions are and how the Arbitration will proceed, after thinking about it, I must ask if he did agree to it or not ? If he didn't then this will invalidate the Arbitration, did he retract in any way the block or any blocking action ?

:::: Based on his last post I can see that he had no problem with the lifting of the block and he thought  your function would be different, if he is willing to remove all my blocking logs and admit that he probably did them in haste or not in a clear way (even if off the record) and wants the proceeding ended, I will agree if you indeed take care of the other disputes and [[User:SBJohnny]] refrains to take any other action on those subjects, I have no personal grudge with him and I'm not here to humiliate or degrade his image in the community.

:::: It would be a loss to Wikibooks as he is an really active administrator, to make him lose interest in the community or feel that he have lost face, by my actions or yours.  

:::: As an aside and this must be made clear, if there is offside talking of the arbitration subject, they should be avoided, (I know that [[User:SBJohnny]] has an IRC presence on the Wikibooks channel and even [[User:Whiteknight]] mentions that some information regarding the blocking did occur in public with other Wikibookians and that there isn't a record of, as it is stated [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny/Plaintiff_Charges#Comments_from_User:Whiteknight here], it is even my view that [[User:SBJohnny]] may even have been misinformed due to such discussions and lead to actions he normally would be more careful on performing.

:::: I didn't have a particular problem with this cross talking in the past, it is not my main motivation in wikibooks to have friends and know people in general build up a social network here or my ego, but at present it must be made clear that I really don't wish to participate on said offsite discussions, or on site parallel discussions on the subject at hand and I ask you also to avoid doing so (on subject not on format), I don't want to have to deal with the other users and even future participants on the discussion at hand to be influenced by and from such discussions, my task on fighting a decision from a known administrator will be hard enough, a fair &quot;jury&quot; will probably be impossible but I will do my best, please ask (as it can't be imposed or verified) that other participants refrain on extending the already present social influences so to keep the proceeding clear, if I feel overwhelmed or I find other users participation unfair, as it is my right I will have no other resource that to appeal to a hight instance for any decision I fell was a result of an oriented attack to my defense, this indeed would create a huge problem to the whole community. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

::::: Since this is in active arbitration at the moment, I'm going to refrain from trying to give my opinions on this prematurely.  I do want to assure you that I intend to address many of these issues in my formal opinion that I intend to write, including in reference to the IRC conversations that seem to have occured, and the actions of SB Johnny.  This opinion will be a part of the formal arbitration page.  As far as if SB Johnny has agreed to this course of action, he certainly is participating, which implies conscent here.  I think he was hoping I would rubber stamp his actions, which I have not done, but rather have made some serious inquiries as to what has happened.  What I really need is information, not heated opinion, and that has unfortunately proven difficult to get.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:30, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

(''reset tabs'') Um, I don't know why you thought you were pressured... as was mentioned to you on IRC, someone else had already offered to step in (I have the logs if you'd like to review them). My message about the block on this talk page was becaue you were in a dialog with him on another page, and wanted to make sure you knew why he wouldn't be replying there (but that he could edit his talk)... see above[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Robert_Horning#Just_so_you_know...]. My interest is not in getting approval for my actions (I'm perfectly comfortable with them), but rather in having someone else handle this, because I'm tired of it. As I had said to Panic, I'm not willing to adopt his case as a full time job, and at this point they really need another arbitrator because I'd really like to focus my energies elsewhere. 

I've asked one of the Stewards to have a look at the situation just for good measure, as it's clearly getting a bit over the top now. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Please address the problem that exists at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks_talk:Arbitration/Panic2k4_vs._SBJohnny/Plaintiff_Charges this Arbitration talk page] as soon as you can, and I request that you ask user Darklama to close his comments so we can pass to the next phase.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:16, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

== What a mess ==
I've looked at the [[Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming]] history and I don't find any recent discussion between SBJohnny and Panic2k4 there. The discussion seems to have occurred on [[User_talk:Panic2k4]] and [[Wikibooks_talk:Ownership]]. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AC%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=707677&amp;oldid=636990 The History of Talk:C++ Programming] is interesting, though. Manual revert of 37 edits by 4 different users. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 04:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

: Most of my dispute with darklama is on my talk page it started after, if I remember correctly (don't go by my word) he moved the MFC part out of the C++ book without discussion.  But my first interactions with darklama content deletion are in his talk page, as for any missing history I don't know if the previous administrator did merge the talk pages content (he should) and darklama did merge the &quot;forked&quot; book talk pages under consensus.

: If you were checking the why of the block there isn't a reason for it, but my page moves were based in that darklama doesn't like the (actual) structure, the structure was not created by me but by the administrator that forced the merge, as for why he doesn't like it, well I don't know he never did explain it in detail, the changes he made to those pages (and that I reverted) were done while I was under a 2 week block (on a unrelated problem, and I still state wrongly so, but that is another problem), after that I restored them to the same state moved some posts to the proper places (context, like discussions on content etc), humm as I remember Paddu before the &quot;fork&quot; did do some reverts and I also, on that case the disputed changes were based my need to have specific guidelines and order on the discussion (I will see if I can get an example and post it here later), but you can probably mail Paddu, darklama and SBJohnny did contact him after I was blocked, see the other user talk page (the one on the C++ / Q&amp;A page, the post in response to SBJohnny questions), if you have any more questions on the C++ book I will try to address them. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

: I'm sorry to have replied to you on [[User:Robert Horning]] talk page, but I would probably have to state some of this things some were later for him so it serves a dual purpose, please delete if  it is a problem. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:56, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

: I have checked the talk page history it seems all history before the &quot;fork&quot; are missing, if you can  see what you can do [[User:Robert Horning]], txs [User:Xixtas]] for pointing it out, I didn't check it because I didn't know talk history logs could be merged at the time. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:35, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
:: I don't have any questions for you, and I wouldn't ask them here anyway. This was intended to be a message from me to Rob in response to a query on my talk page.

== &quot;What a mess&quot; is an understatement ==

This is not a time to wax philosohpical Robert... nor is it a time to go asking opinions about what to do next. I have serious doubts about your judgement at this point (I have no doubts about your good intentions), and if you are unwilling or unable to take this process by the riens, I suggest you ask someone else to step in for you. I'm willing to take over until [[User:Swift]] has time to do this as a temporary measure, or else you can choose someone else. The way you've been handling this is unfair to me, and unfair to [[User:Panic2k4]]. 

Wikibooks isn't a &quot;neonatal&quot; project anymore. Your hard work has paid off, and we have grown!

:The process that I've taken has been under attack, and I've tried to defend that.  Unfortunately, I also seem (from my viewpoint) to be under attack right now because I'm not rolling over and agreeing with your decisions here 100%.  And as I've said earlier, you were drawn into this fight and have become a party to the whole thing.  It is a very natural and human thing to do, and I'm not necessarily suggesting you are any less of a Wikibookian for having done so.  But to continue to pretend that you are completely neutral in this matter is also not admiting to what is going on here.

:BTW, I havn't really done much of anything here anyway.  I certainly havn't &quot;made a decision&quot; or done anything directly to support Panic or your actions, or suggest that you should be deadmined here.  I do think it is very reasonable, however, to question your actions (or mine for that matter) and to do a reasonable investigation to see if the actions taken were warrented.  Performing a user block because of a content edit war is always a tricky action, and is something that should be strongly cautioned against except as an ultimate last resort.  Much of this whole process is to see if your use of the user block was in fact justified and perhaps needs to be reimposed.

:I am not asking opinions on what to do next, as I have been very clear about what I intended to do here.  And you have participated in that process.  The next step, BTW, is to let Panic have his chance to spill his guts and explain why he did everything.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

::Robert, I know you mean well, but you've really misunderstood the issues here, which is completely understandable because you haven't been around much lately. In you absence (an absence spent doing good things!), wikibooks has experienced something of a growth spurt. You're not being recieved well because you're a bit behind the times. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I think you need to try and see how others see you right now... some of our &quot;community leaders&quot; don't know you at all, some (like me) just barely know you, and others who know you a bit better are getting very frustrated with you (especially with the textbook-l stuff). 

::Neither of the two metaphors below entirely fit the situation, but they do capture some of what's going on, and why you're getting into trouble. '''Don't''' take this too seriously. '''Do''' try to take a step back, breathe, and think. 

::*'''First metaphor''' -- A Good (but divorced) Father goes away for a while to try and do some good in the world. He comes back to find his little girl is a young woman now, and tries to enforce some rules for her own good. When he was gone, the family got bigger, now with step-siblings who don't know their Good Stepdad. Good Stepdad makes a big show about telling Mother that he can handle this, and botches the job from step one (at least in the eyes of the kids... maybe in the eyes of the other Stepdad and Mom too). 

::*'''Second metaphor''' -- A community in a snowy, long-wintered place ''finally'' get's itself organized, and arranges for regular snow plowing. One particular street never gets plowed, because that particular street has cars parked along the street, and the plowing company is worried about liability. The community bands together and ''insists'' that that street should be plowed too (the people who live there are community members too, after all!), but when it comes up in a council meeting, an elderly gentleman starts into a diatribe about how we (the townspeople) did perfectly fine without plowing before, and shouldn't try to force the plowing company to clear that street.

== Appologies ==

I would like to appologize to you if some of my earlier comments on the arbitration process came off as petulant or otherwise unfriendly. While I have some strong feelings on the matter, I don't want them to serve as some kind of dividing line between you and I, or between any other groups of wikibookians. Good luck on this and all your future projects. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

I am not trying to belittle you either, and I hope that we can also work together to try and make this an incredible project that we all know it can be.

== Arbitration Finale ==

&lt;s&gt;I don't mean to step on your toes here, but considering the inactivity on the arbitration hearing, I've posted a potential solution on the talk page. I'm proposing that the arbitration be closed, and that no further action be taken against Johnny or Panic (with certain warnings sent to both users to avoid conduct like the kind that brought us into this mess in the first place). If everbody involved can agree, I think we should end this now, and focus our energy instead on ways to prevent these kinds of situations, and to formalize the arbitration process in a way that we can implement in the future. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:37, 29 January 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

:&lt;s&gt;Panic doesn't seem interested in my proposed solution to the problem, and instead is opting to hear what you have decided on the matter. With that in mind, you haven't spoken word one on this matter in nearly two weeks by my count. I request that you do whatever you need to do to end this matter, and soon.&lt;/s&gt;
:&lt;s&gt;This arbitration, while entered into with good intentions, is an open wound for our project. Some of our most valuable and prolific editors recently have been upset by the process, and the longer it continues, the more we risk to lose. A pervasive negative feeling has entered our community, and we are starting to pay the toll for it. I've been very patient with this whole thing, more patient perhaps then anybody should have been, but I'm prepared to raise hell if this whole mess doesnt get resolved. I don't mean to sound hostile towards you, but I am very serious about this matter, and am not willing to wait any longer. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:44, 30 January 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

After talking to a large number of wikibookians, both publicly (on wiki), and privately (IRC and email), I have decided to end the arbitration hearing early. I have asked [[User:Withinfocus]] to read what information is available, and decide if action is necessary against either Panic or Johnny, if any. This arbitration was a deplorable mess, and I could not stand to leave it open any longer. I also feel that you have not met your commitments in this area, something that many wikibookians agree with.

I ask that you do not attempt to reopen the arbitration case, or undo any of my actions or [[User:Withinfocus]]' actions on this matter without receiving agreement from the community beforehand. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

:I think you are assuming a huge amount of stuff here, and presuming a whole bunch on your part.  You, Whiteknight, have been highly critical of this whole process and claiming that I was going to spell ruin to either my reputation.  It surprises me that you are instead going to be taking the arrows in the back on this issue when clearly you wanted to keep yourself so clean from any final outcomes of this action.

:BTW, excuse me (speaking rhetorically) for being a volunteer instead of a paid professional staff member here.  Perhaps next time I need to start charging some sort of &quot;court fee&quot; or some other silly nonsense if I become a moderator?  This is simply a very confrontational attitude to have toward this whole thing, and you seem to have missed the point of what I was trying to do here.  The whole thing needed a chance to cool down and let everybody take a break from trying to be so confrontational.  It appears as though you have decided to enter the fray here and be confrontational to me as well.

:Unknown to me when I started this whole process, I ended up having a few personal issues that have come into my life where I havn't been able to spend quite so much time on this one particular issue.  Especially over the past couple of weeks.  I felt that to properly come up with some proper remedies and to hear everybody on a fair and impartial basis, as well as to review logs and other items, I needed some more time to go through everything that was presented and give it a good review.  Full-time professional judges in similar situations would demand nothing less, BTW.  And they are people with considerable experience and several full-time assistants who are able to work with them to help prepare formal briefs and do other tasks that I am only able to do on a very part-time volunteer basis.  There have been other issues in my life that have been much more pressing, especially as they relate to trying to teach an adolescent on how to live his life where I have primary parental responsibilities.  Enough said.  Please in the future learn how to treat volunteers much better than this, if you ever care to have any stick around.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

::Rob, I'm hoping that you can see that the decision made isn't an attack on you; it was a collective, collaborative decision made for the best of the community.  I wasn't involved in that, but as it seems to me that you were not able (and this is no criticism; life takes priority over Wikibooks) to notify people of your absence or an expected return date, I can understand that the consensus was that action was appropriate in your absence.  It might be good to take some time to consider that others were not intending to be confrontational; as an observer, your willingness to revert actions of others may be well-intended but could itself easily be seen as confrontational rather than consensus-based.  I believe you meant well, and that your contributions are valuable -- in this case though, circumstances meant that you were not in a position to address the community's perceived needs.  I hope that soon you will see this largely unfortunate episode not as one of adversarial stances between admins but as one where there were difficulties in resolving a situation and a number of people with good intentions had troubling finding common ground.  In the last few days I've seen new names editing the C++ Programming book, and if that's a sign of a trend then it's a good thing; whether the calming effect of this storm on that book is involved or not we will probably never know.  It *is* tough handling perceived criticism when working as a volunteer -- but do try to remember that, online as in life, it's best not to assume malice where incompetence or misfortune is an equally good explanation.

::Thank you for your efforts in working to resolve this.  There was no win-win situation available, I fear, but the damage still need not be extensive or lasting.  Accepting that all admins involved have acted in good faith, even when there are differences of opinion on how best to proceed, could go a long way towards reestablishing a cooperative atmosphere. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 02:00, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
:::Unfortunately, I do see this as a very personal attack against me, particularly when threats of wheel warring have been made against me.  I am very curious about what forii were being used in this situation for achieving a &quot;concenus&quot; on this issue?  IRC?  off-line e-mail exchanges?  Phone calls?  It certainly was not transparent, nor was the discussion directly listed or even pointed to and discussed on the decision page.  I don't even see who was pushing for this final outcome.
:::Furthermore, what I strongly resent was that the process I had established to try and come up with a formal resolution to this (trying to decide what actual actions should happen) was not followed nor apparently even understood.  Precisely to stop the mob mentality that seems to have taken over here, I requested that those who wanted a certain course of action to take place (like a six month user block) speak their piece with room for the &quot;defendant&quot; to reply and suggest perhaps another course of action.  This did not occur, but instead &quot;frontier justice&quot; took over.  This was not a community decision, but rather the decision of a minority of Wikibooks users who happen to be in close contact with each other.  What happened here with Panic is a miscarriage of justice.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::::First off, I do not mean this to be a personal attack on you, more an attack on the process. I never threatened to wheel war with you, I asked only that you receive community support before any attempt to reopen this matter. Even the notes to you that I have struck out did not contain any such threat, and I would appreciate it if you didn't accuse me of that sort of thing. We may not agree on this issue, but that doesn't mean that I am being uncivil, unhelpful, or breaking any sort of rules around here. 
::::I don't feel like you got enough community support to start this process in the first place, a fact that has been bothersome from the beginning. You meant well, that much is undoubtedly certain, and you certainly care for this project. I won't question your motives, nor will I disparage your volunteer efforts here when there are clearly more pressing matters for you to attend to in your real life. However, nobody asked you to take these responsibilities onto yourself, and nobody forced you to start a long and convoluted arbitration process to deal with this mess. In starting this process, you made a committment, and in the end you were not able to do what you needed to do in a reasonable amount of time.
::::Even if you aren't able to spend lots of time on this project, there are several users on this site that do spend many hours on a daily basis here. We have an amazing core of active people here who, every day, are here breathing life into this little project. What alarms me is when a number of these users start talking about leaving this project forever because of this nonsense. Besides the people who felt victimized by Panic originally (and threatened to leave because the administrative staff here were apparently unable to take decisive action), there was also [[User:SBJohnny]] went from being a mediator in a content dispute to being a defendant in an arbitration. We went overnight from a community who prizes trusted users who are ''encouraged to use their judgement'', to a community where suddenly that judgement is suspect and open to endless attacks and accusations of &quot;abuse of power&quot;. There was no disagreement, except from [[User:Panic2k4|the defendant]] about disciplinary action taken against him at the time, and the only criticism came from people who felt the admins did not act quickly enough. On Panic's request, you created an arbitration that this community did not agree to, and one for which there is a precident against. You expect us all to just wait around for you to return in this condition? 
::::I ended the arbitration because I perceived the negative aspects of it as far outweighing the potential positive ones. I've used my best judgement in resolving this problem, and I don't think that I violated any policy, any guideline, or any behavioral norm in doing so. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:31, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== Arbitration Decision ==

There are many things to say about this issue. Unfortunately you were not available during an extremely important time here and you're seeing the necessary actions that had to be taken, actions that didn't have to happen if the process and Panic were handled appropriately earlier. Let me remind you that no consensus ever established your &quot;arbitration process&quot; as the proper solution, even though several parties participated in it for some time. As the &quot;arbitrator&quot; you had the crucial duty of watching this process which you abandoned for over a week, an unacceptable lack of action.

For one, three extremely prominent users and admins here were so distraught over this process and stagnancy that they seriously considered leaving the project, something that would have been terrible for the community. In many ways this process ripped apart the sense of community we have here with its rushed set-up and use. You might consider my action blunt, but I considered it the proper solution to end the already lost process. Panic's comments became more and more insulting, abrasive, and uncivil, never approaching a solution but merely trying to justify himself as doing all the right things and being some sort of victim. Numerous users across the project have noted their agitation towards what was happening and became more and more angered as Panic continued his soapbox. Plenty of opportunities for comments were given and a solution became less and less achievable as time went on.

Panic had months to remedy his attitude and actions and continued to verbally abuse his once-enthusiastic fellow book-writers through the arbitration process. Panic repeated the same statements again and again that he doesn't think he did anything wrong and that no one can prove anything, yet he somehow continues writing because he's &quot;trying to learn&quot; or something along those lines. We have all spent way too long playing along with this fruitless game of arguing and so it was stopped.

You can see the boost of community involvement and relief here now that the arbitration has been ended. The performed action was what the community wanted and so Whiteknight and I acted on it, representing the community. I have no vendetta against Panic and have had little to no contact with him before this process. I read all the &quot;choice words&quot; he and the other parties placed on the page, listened to what many users thought I should do and what they thought of the process, and performed an action I truly believe is correct. That it differed from your process that no one approved of is not an issue. I was not hostile whatsoever.

Panic needs to leave the project for some time to get his attitude straight and over these six months he will hopefully learn how to better interact with users and be a thoughtful, collaborative contributor to a book. Panic would have never stopped responding in his currently abrasive form and no one active was interested in wasting time with the argument. Since Panic has been stopped at our site, he has gone to a Steward who has also denied any requests of his. Jimbo Wales will also most likely ignore his e-mail entirely and the process will hopefully truly end. It may even take a block at Meta to stop his comments.

Almost nothing has been immediate in this drawn out process. We have all heard the issues over and over again. There should be no appeal process. This was a community decision and you are going against that decision, something that I am greatly disappointed with considering all this talk about fairness. This decision has positively impacted Wikibooks and the community wishes that it not continue. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:31, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:I don't understand what &quot;not being available&quot; here meant.  You certainly did not e-mail me asking me for any help or advise, or asking me if I was willing to turn this over to anybody else.  You did not post this on Textbook-l asking for some general help, or in your case even ask me politely even on this talk page if it would be reasonable to take over from me.  There is enough information on my various pages that if you wanted, you could have even given me a telephone call.  There have been other ways to contact me if you had cared.

:What I see here is a virtual equivalent of an unruly lynch mob that has taken over, by a very small sub-set of the Wikibooks community where you and Whiteknight have assumed you are speaking for the &quot;majority&quot; of the community but I am insisting that you are speaking out only for a very vocal minority.  This is one of the things I was specifically trying to protect again, and I believe you have gone way beyond your &quot;authority&quot;.

:I also fail to see why you had to perform the actions you have done here to this degree.

:As to why Jimbo is ignoring his e-mails on this issue, all I can say is &quot;Wow&quot;!  You apparently have not been following that Jimbo is intentionally stepping back from Wikimedia projects in general and refusing to become an arbitrator for petty little decisions like this in particular.  To suggest that you were trying to bring Jimbo into this process speaks volumes about what I think happened here.... this is just a lynch mob where a bunch of people didn't like one particular user.

:No justice or reasonable impartiality took place in this situation, and the preceedence in regards for Wikibooks is going to be permanently harmed if this sort of situation is repeated.  This is not the end of this particular situation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:47, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::It would be nice in the future that if you have a response to me, please indicate it on my talk page like all other conversations around here go. Nonetheless, I believe this will be my final comment on this issue since we're all moving on (besides yourself perhaps, but there are no further places to take this issue in Wikimedia and I consider all this over). Perhaps in six months we can discuss it again in a celebratory sort of way when we welcome Panic back.

::You were definitely unavailable. For one, this is the Internet and doing something like calling you on the phone I find ridiculous and would never do. Whiteknight wrote many messages on your talk page over several days and also e-mailed you. I find those actions more than enough of an attempt to get your attention and am not interested in mailing lists. Since you were so caught up on not being a professional but a volunteer here, I don't see how we're supposed to use any other communication methods to contact you. You should be active at the site you had a duty to and we shouldn't have to hunt you down wherever you are about a process that you neglected. Furthermore, I don't remember signing over legal Wikibooks rights for you to handle business here. Again, since you're a volunteer, others can come in and volunteer too. We don't need your permission to do something here and the matter was becoming especially urgent as well. Even though we don't need that permission, we still tried to talk to you about it anyway and you were unresponsive. I care plenty about Wikibooks and for you to suggest that I don't is offensive to me, but I'll move on.

::I'm not buddies with Wales nor do I care to be and therefore I'm not up on his recent moods and fancies. Wales shouldn't be involved in this at all and it's Panic ridiculous attitude that even suggested he be involved. Redux seems to have fully convinced him however that this is the end and the action is final. I don't understand what you're saying about me involving Wales since I have no interest in that whatsoever since I believe our community took care of this. Also, I have had no interaction with Panic before this besides possibly one or two talk page messages about trivial matters. I developed my decision through Panic's arbitration write-up and constant bad attitude which I'm mentioning here again for probably the twenty-fifth time. Don't try to say I'm &quot;picking on him&quot; since he created that opinion himself.

::If this arbitration had gone through and you had not blocked Panic for a significant period, there would have been a large portion of active users leaving the project. I hope you would have gathered that before making a decision had you been active these past two weeks. I still am one hundred percent confident that I was impartial in this matter due to my almost total non-contact with Panic before this process began. I formed my opinions and ideas from reading the process. You are far less impartial than I am in this matter. Wikibooks users are quite pleased that this process has ended and are now working on forming an actual consensus opinion on how to handle this now at [[Wikibooks:Resolving disputes]]. We certainly will avoid this situation in the future since none of us want to do it, including this unfortunate first and last time it will happen by the looks of how users are commenting on the above page.

::The actual decision had nothing to do with you other than you didn't do the job you took on and so others had to try to repair it. There is no personal attack and I have no problem with you. Next time make a mention of your absence at least so that we can try to work with it if you're doing something crucial in the future. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:24, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

Any kind of accusation of mob mentality, or an accusation that we are acting without the appropriate forethought in this matter is highly offensive, and I believe that it is groundless. [[User:SBJohnny]] was completely neutral during the original mediation when he decided that Panic needed to be disciplined. Because of my involvement in the matter, I asked [[User:Withinfocus]] to handle the final actions in the arbitration, because I knew that he was completely neutral. I went so far as to ask [[User:Derbeth]], our only other active bureaucrat, to avoid the discussion entirely, for fear of getting him involved in the situation (and therefore, potentially, developing a bias on the matter when and if it devolved after the arbitration was ended). Forethought, planning, contemplation, and reflection have all been properly exercised in this matter, and everybody acted in their best judgement, without reducing to a mere &quot;lynch mob&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
:::PS. As an addendum, I wanted to point out that I did propose a solution to the problem that would have ended the arbitration, and not taken any disciplinary action against panic. I offered him the opportunity to end the arbitration, return to work on the C++ book or any other book he saw fit, on the requirement that he be extra careful not to be uncivil, and not to be perceived as uncivil. He declined this request, despite my sincerest efforts to convince him otherwise.

=== An example of on-wiki discussion ===

You may interested in a post on my user page. I noticed Whiteknight post a note to you asking you to stop the arbitration [{{fullurl:User talk:Robert Horning|diff=737117&amp;oldid=735465}}] to which I replied Whiteknight should e-mail you [{{fullurl:User talk:Whiteknight|diff=737124&amp;oldid=737107}}]. He responded on my talk page that he was very agitated and would not for a while, but solicited my opinion, noting that he and I tend to disagree on almost every subject. [{{fullurl:User talk:Iamunknown|diff=737127&amp;oldid=736664}}]. I replied with (what I consider) three significant points: that I did not consider your actions reprehensible, but a good-faith effort to solve a problem; that, if I were in a position of power, I would attempt to contact you before any action was made; and that I would ban Panic if it were my choice [{{fullurl:User talk:Iamunknown|diff=737304&amp;oldid=737127}}]. You were not contacted prior to the block, but you will note that I was at least one community member who was in support of the block and was engaged in on-wiki discussions. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:As an additional note about this topic (one that I did not talk about in my lengthy response above), I would like to point out that many of the discussions on this topic were simply not appropriate for posting here on the wiki, and a conscious effort was made to move such discussions off wiki. This is especially important for discussions where people are making accusations, where people are making insults or ad hominem attacks, or other instances where discussions are unlikely to remain civil. As a matter of not only policy, but also common courteously, many of these discussions were not posted in a public forum. 
:As Iamunknown pointed out above, he did advise me to email you, and I admit that I did not do this, as I likely should have. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:38, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::I am rather curious about how much of this discussion about this situation was with Panic and insults and exchanges where made off wiki (on IRC or e-mail exchanges) or if this was merely people who felt that Panic had gone too far and talked among themselves, fueling the fire among themselves thinking Panic was far worse that I can possibly see from his edits here on Wikibooks.  For just about everything I have seen so far, Panic himself was not a part of the IRC conversations, and he has shown a general relutances to get involved with e-mail exchanges, and in particular has been very civil in all of his correspondance with me.  I just don't see what the big hurry to block his account was really all about here and why it was such a priority to be done in the way it happened.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:06, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:::In the vast majority of exchanges with me, Panic has been very civil as well. SBJohnny and myself spent some time (several weeks, if I remember correctly) on IRC consoling Darklama about the issue. &quot;It can't be that bad&quot;, or &quot;We've never heard other complaints about him before&quot;, and &quot;Just ignore him, do your own thing&quot;. to his credit, Darklama did seek help off wiki, and did not attempt to start a flame war or a wheel war in a more public forum. Wikimedia does have a policy forbidding transcripts of IRC chats from being copied or distributed, and we also don't have any policy or guideline saying that such conversations should be documented or summarized (whether we should create such guidelines now is an issue worth some consideration). So unfortunately, a record simply doesn't exist. My point being that no short amount of time passed between when the initial complaints were made, and the time when Panic was blocked. The first block was even a nominal short one, 2 hours at a time of day when Panic didn't edit frequently. At no time was anybody jumping into some kind of witchhunt to block panic, or &quot;punish&quot; him, or anything like that. A slim minority has called for panic to be blocked indefinately, a result which I was strongly opposed to. 
:::The big priority was not to block panic (at least not on my part), but instead simply to end the arbitration process. My first attempt to end the arbitration was by offering Panic an informal &quot;probation&quot; instead of any kind of block continuance or extension. He opted not to take the offer, and two days later the negative effects of the arbitration became more then I could accept. 
:::I would hope you could take me at my word on the things for which there is no record, but I have no illusions that you think i'm particularly helpful, trustworthy, or honorable at this point. There is some discussion brewing that panic's block should be reevaluated and possibly shortened. If you feel the 6 months is too long a time period (and I make no real assumptions about your thoughts or conclusions in the arbitration) you would do well to join this discussion. If we decide within two weeks (a short time for any decision, I know) that panic's block should be removed, he will have only been blocked for the amount of time he would have been in lieu of the arbitration entirely. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:01, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Indeed I first went to the IRC channel to ask some questions, because I thought it was likely inappropriate for the wiki and to seek the advice of others more experienced then myself and to vent a little. Most questions where in the form what should I do or not do if anything, because I couldn't find anything having happened before or any help file or policy with advice that covered what I was frustrated over. I was ready to assume the worst and that I was somehow completely at fault and ready to hear what others thought I might need to do differently and take blame for it completely. Through discussion, time passing and following advice and seeing other people experiencing similar problems, I no longer shared the view that it was entirely my fault and even for a time thought it might just be due to miscommunication.

::: I don't seek to punish Panic by my belief that he needs to be blocked indefinitely, but rather a reflection that Panic is detrimental to the mission of Wikibooks and my belief that this will not change. Based on recent efforts by multiple people to reason with Panic in what I believe to be a reasonable requirement, even though Panic has turned each one down, I'm willing to emend my view a little in that I think he should be blocked indefinitely until such time as he demonstrates through his own words that he understands why I and other people find him difficult or impossible to work with and any other issues that people may wish him to show he has an understanding of, and explains what he is willing to do differently to prevent this from continuing to be a problem. After which I think if everyone is satisfied with his response, he should be allowed to return on probation and be required to do as he said he would do to prevent this from being a problem, even after the probation has ended. The probation would involve him getting blocked indefinitely if he breaks the agreement, without any additional warnings and without any more chances to redeem himself. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

=== Why the 6 months? ===

I guess my user talk page has become a user forum here, but I am still not sure why the six month user block here.  If there are so many people who say he won't be blocked indefinitely, six months seems to me to be essentially the same thing, at least from the viewpoint that I was dragging my heels for two weeks and was being an incompitent arbitrator.  This seems like overkill to me, and an attempt to do the next best thing to an indefinite block.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

==Post-arbitration-decision &quot;coaching&quot;==
Considering all the troubles that have come out of the final decision about Panic, I've decided to get involved again to see if there's a way of re-integrating him into the community. My approach will be to engage in calm dialog with him, as a &quot;coach&quot;. You can see the beginning of this [[User_talk:Panic2k4#Trying_to_explain|here]]. My intent is to get to a point where he makes it clear that he (1) understands the problem, (2) will try to avoid the problem in the future, (3) will make a commitment to not getting into trouble again, and (4) will understand that we will prevent him from causing further problems. I've made a more formal proposal of this [[User_talk:Withinfocus#A_suggestion|on Matt's talk page]], since he is ''de facto'' the current arbitrator, and therefore the person in charge.

I must ask you to stay out of this for now (''especially'' during the first step), unless you feel that I'm being horribly unfair. Panic needs to focus on this first point, and having more than one person to talk to will (in my opinion) just spur him into playing us off one another. He needs to look at his own behavior in an objective way, and I'm going to do my best to help him in that task. 

I should point out now that while step 4 might seem harsh and threatening, it's meant to be the opposite. If further blocks are performed, I'd like these to be &quot;time outs&quot;, rather than punitive measures... little breaks where he is given time to rethink and explain. I know this guy a bit now, and I know he likes to see how far he can push any envelope. The point is to allow no games. I strongly suggest that his block be considered indefinite until he agrees to get along, and that he should not be threatened with an ''infinite'' block unless he ''really'' games this system.

This might be a wasted effort, but it's worth a shot. I'm asking for your support. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

:I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to get at here, as Panic percieves you to be an &quot;enemy&quot; now after a sort.  I still fail to see how this is really more than a content editorial dispute, with perhaps some personal attacks (going both ways, mind you, even if subtle) and some issues about multiple reverts on the same content.  But nothing I've seen on the part of Panic has approached the level of blatant vandalism, or being accused of being a &quot;troll&quot;, whatever definition you may be using here (your words, Johnny, on the block log).  Even the points that were brought out in the arbitration pages by you and those issuing complaints against Panic were nothing more (from my perspective) of being more than a strong clash of egos over the direction of the C++ programming Wikibook.  I have seen much worse behavior and much stronger clashes of egos on Wikipedia, where new user contributions are openly reverted on the basis of ignorance and having not participated in the previous discussions, and not being a &quot;major contributor&quot;.
:This isn't to say that I necessarily &quot;approve&quot; of all of this behavior... far from it.  But I just don't know what all of the problem is here that it rises to the level of a user block, or that it has risen to the level of a major controvercy for all of the Wikibooks admins to be dealing with this issue.
:I know, this is all stuff that has been said before, and I was &quot;warned&quot; about this issue that you, Whiteknight, and others have been saying that Panic is trying to expand this whole thing to deliberately blow this out of proportion.  But at the same time you and the others who have been responding here on my talk page are also letting this get the best of you as well.  I think it might be better if perhaps a completely neutral party other than those who have been involved so far try to help out in this situation.  I do think that may be possible.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

::It's nice to &quot;hear you talk&quot; in the calm manner I'm more accustomed to, Robert. Please consider talking to me (off wiki) before you retaliate in your argument with WK and Matt... I really think you've misread them, but even if you haven't, hitting back is not going to be a constructive move. I'm reachable over IRC, email, or phone if you prefer.
::As for Panic, I'd like to stay involved now (a bit of a break from him has allowed sufficient cooling of my head). I don't expect him to to see me as neutral, but he can and should still work with me anyway, given our history together. The way he's talking now, I can't imagine he would see anyone as neutral unless they agree with him, as he's apparently quite firm in his belief that the problems lay with others, not with him. He's a very hard person to talk to, and a slow, patient (but firm) approach is the only way out I can see right now. Working with me rather than you might be problematic in some ways, but the problem with you running it by yourself is that you're just not around enough lately, which is a rather serious issue since Panic needs to have questions repeated rather consistently before he answers them. Earlier I had tried to get him to talk about it, but he kept avoiding the topic... and unfortunately I ran out of patience for a while and stopped trying to interrogate him. Should I lose patience again, I'll arrange for someone to take over before I remove myself. 
::One other favor I'd like to ask of you is that you please refrain from stomping off. &quot;I'm taking my toys and going home&quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Robert_Horning&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=745444] isn't a great approach in this atmosphere, and your blow-up with Matt last night was a blow-up with Matt, not necessarily a blow-up with anyone else. If you're going to help with this, you need to maintain a thick skin and see it through (and '''please''' let us know if you need to take a break for real-life stuff rather than just mysteriously disappearing). Resolving this will not be easy, but will be a lot easier if we can keep cool heads. You've got to be in or out on this, period... and if you feel that this really is beyond us and should be turned over to the Stewards, that's fine too, since each turn lately seems to be a turn for the worse. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Apologies ==

Some of the discussions between us did get a bit heated. I removed the block because of Xania's actions of restoring an arbitrary (to me) block time period. His action invalidated my actions and so I &quot;restarted&quot; the decision process by letting Johnny step in and say his piece on Staff Lounge. I felt that ending the arbitration that so many people disagreed with would be better than reverting Xania's actions since the community should have its say fully and officially (even though I believed my decision had the backing of many community members). We are by no means enemies and I have no problem with you. Some of your opinions I disagree with from time to time but like you said that's natural. You too are a valuable contributor here and since I have, with help from others, brought us out of the arbitration situation, we can work on forming community standards for all future decisions. I don't believe I'll be participating too much in those dispute resolution discussions, but will be reading them over to see how things are adapting here. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[User:Panic2k4]] sockpuppet block ==

I do not know the nature of the dispute and decided to provide my outside opinion. It is intended to be my opinions/advice in the matter. Nothing more.

From what I understand, [[User:Panic2k4]] was blocked and his/her sockpuppets continue to edit during the duration of his/her block. There has been checkuser evidence and confessions to back this sockpuppet allegation. However because of the absence of a policy on wikibooks some people feel the block of sockpuppets is unwaranted.

I am a commons admin, and we too do not have a policy on sockpuppets on commons. However aggressive sockpuppets are blocked on commons left right regardless of the absence of a policy to do so. There is no point in having a checkuser on wikibooks if such sockpuppets are not to be blocked.

: In all wikimedia projects, disruptive editors can be blocked, policy or not. [[User:Drini|Drini]] 16:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

:: I am not objecting here to having others try to help mediate this, or to have some Stewards try to review the situation as well.  The whole thing with Panic resulted in a formal arbitration situation that was by itself (the arbitration process, not necessarily the issues in the arbitration) hotly contested, with individuals hostile to the process and circumventing the arbitration process performing the block.  I also believe that they were biased parties who had reasons to perform this block, but that is water over the bridge.
:: As far as if the block is legitimate is irrelevant at this point.  Blocking the duplicate accounts (read here as a sock puppet but IMHO not strictly the same thing here) by this same individual person simply as a means to block this same individual shows more the weakness of the MediaWiki software and the social policies we have that encourage anonymous individuals to be able to edit here.  I could post more here, but the fact is that Panic2k4 has been largely discredited by many members of this community and the value of having a formal account is moot in his case.  It also demonstrates proof that the behavior of those who want to kick this individual out of the project is likely to encourage vandalism.

:::Robert, I hope you didn't take offense at my use of the word 'absent' on the latest 'mediation' page regarding Panic.  I was trying to provide Cool Cat with a brief summary of all the events so she knew what was going on.  Panic hadn't given any details about the history so I decided to and described you as 'absent' as this was the cause of most of the recent disagreements (although I had absolutely no problem with you being 'absent' as this is your right and it was hardly for several months).  You'll notice that I have blocked Panic again in the past few days.  I felt the block was better coming from me than from SBJohnny again.  Panic had been winding SBJ up, going off on tangents and refusing to address the actual issues of the mediation.  I didn't want an indefinite block but this was the feeling I got from most other users and I understand that by 'indefinite' we mean that he can be unblocked at any time and as soon as he cooperates a little more with the mediation and assumes some good faith with regards to SBJohnny.

::::I think this is coming close to &quot;see, I told you so&quot; in regards to Panic.  It also shows the futility of trying to push somebody off simply because you don't like them personally, when we otherwise welcome anybody and everybody to edit these projects.  It would be a different story if we had a closed list of users that was by approval only or by invitation only.  There is no &quot;approval&quot; process to become a registered user and Panic is unfortunately (through &quot;sock puppetry&quot;) proving this in an oh so clear manner.  He has also been backed into a corner where he is being attacked on a very personal level, and this whole affair is going on in part because of several individuals who want to &quot;stick it&quot; to Panic.
::::As far as the general issue of trying to control/remove a problem user, I think the aggressive approach that seems to be used against Panic is not working.  Even if Cool Cat agrees with the user blocks that have been done, it still doesn't really deal with Panic other than turn Panic into a Wikibooks-specific vandal that we will have to deal with over the next several years.  And it has turned into a fun game for Panic that will do nothing but cause further aggrivation for all of those admins involved, particularly those who have been trying hard to &quot;reign in&quot; Panic.  The only other potential solution would be to close up Wikibooks and force new users to seek permission to become an editor on Wikibooks.  I highly doubt that the WMF will accept that as a solution to deal with only one user who not necesarily the entire community feels is so problematic that he needs to have the welcome mat pulled out and told to go away.
::::The real value that is gained by having a &quot;registered user&quot; account is that over time, you accumulate what could roughly be called &quot;karma&quot; or some other social value, where you are noticed and have value due to the value of your contributions.  Performing a user block under our current system merely throws out any accumulated value from using that account.  That IP blocks may also occur helps to block some users, but it really is an imperfect system.  There is no way on a Wiki such as ours that you can completely kick somebody off.
::::I hope that some cooler heads will prevail here and try to show some genuine leadership that seems to be missing.  What I see is a certain group of administrators that are letting their position of &quot;authority&quot; get to their heads and acting in a despotic manner.  This isn't necessarily something unique to Wikibooks either, and I've been seeing this attitude even on the foundation level.  The situation with Panic is merely the embodiment of this attitude rather than necessarily the real problem here.
::::My religion has a scripture that deals with this very thought:  &quot;We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.&quot; (See [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/121#39])  I do think that is what is happening to a small extent here on Wikibooks, where people are taking that authority to their heads and are not seeing the larger picture of what could happen if they had but a little patience.
::::My big complaint now is that the attacks are moving from Panic and instead headed directly in my direction.  This is something that I don't necessarily want, but I'm willing to defend my actions and stand up for those who I feel are being bullied.  What happens to Panic is now largely out of my hands at this point other than I will continue to be an advocate in defense of Panic and try to see that he gets a fair hearing if he wants to get use of his original account.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== Recent Comments ==

I've gotta say that I find some of your recent comments disturbing and hypocritical. After returning from your earlier absence and viewing what had taken place, your eventual comments on mine and others' talk pages is quite different from what you're saying now. I read statements of yours like on Cool Cat's dispute resolution page and don't understand why you write what you write. It's like a long list of excuses and a big blame sheet for what's occurred. I don't see how you haven't understood the community's voice by now or why you choose to take such a soapbox with this issue but Panic has greatly disturbed Wikibooks. I'm not going to waste the time in responding to each of your excuses and the blame you've wrongly associated me to but as you continue to prolong this issue, something that could have ended some time ago and is now actually over, I am losing faith in the rationality of your edits. I have to discount your earlier apology since it now seems to have been merely an appeasement. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

:No, I don't understand those like you who seem to be speaking on behalf of the &quot;community&quot; here.  You can speak for yourself, but when you try to speak as though you represent the entire community I think you have gone over the top.  Certainly I was not happy with the user block on Panic, even though he has certainly had room to dispute the structure, content, and flow of the C++ Programming Wikibook.  This was a content dispute that has simply gone over the top.  I am also very vocal that I did not like the way the arbitration ended in regards to Panic, and I still think that it was ended by hard-core opponents to Panic, not by people who were objective in seeing a judicious resolution that would come to a conclusion with ultimately Panic realizing that he needed to clean up his act a little bit and some legitimate restrictions within his books.  I believe it is precisely because of the way that you, Whiteknight, Darklama, SB Johnny, and some others have acted that will prolong this mess way beyond what could have been had you simply tried to work within the arbitration process I proposed.
:Indeed, what I take objection to here is that there was so much opposition to even the idea of formal arbitration, even after I obtained implicit and explicit acceptance between the main parties involved and Panic, that I was essentially unable to continue nor really able to act objectively as an arbitrator.  Usurping my role as an arbitrator when the parties involved did not agree (clearly Panic was not one of those agreeing to your intervention) threw out any legitimacy of the eventual outcome, including your user block.
:What has happened now is that I am being personally attacked, and those attacks are continuing where I think incomplete truths to even out right lies are being perpetuated about my actions here.  I have tried to bury the hatchet, but at the same time I feel that Panic does deserve some support.  And if I am attacked in a public form, my gloves are off and I will fight back with a vengance.  And this time I'm the one who is going to be seeking formal arbitration over what seems to be offenses against my account and edits I have been making.  
:Did you really believe that by &quot;going over my head&quot; that I was just going to be happy about this whole situation? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::The only lies that have been propagated so far have all come from your account, Rob. Your continued insistence that you are somehow being threatened or personally attacked, that there is some kind of insidious &quot;cabal&quot;, or that any of us have acted against Panic for personal reasons are both hurtful and offensive. Ever since this whole issue started, you have failed to assume ''any good faith'' on the part of other wikibookians. You have referred to people who disagree with you as being a &quot;very vocal minority&quot; in a way to marginalize and dismiss any criticisms. You have referred to us as an &quot;angry lynch mob&quot; and a &quot;cabal&quot;, and you have called this entire situation a &quot;witchhunt&quot;. You have said repeatedly that we have acted without logic or proper forethought. What &quot;offenses&quot; have there been against your account? What offenses have been made against your edits? What is it that has been done to you that you have not done worse? What gives you the right to repeatedly post, in public forums, long monologues filled with lies, accusations, and misplaced blame? Not once have Withinfocus, SBJohnny, Darklama, or my self used such disgusting or offensive tactics as you have demonstrated recently, Rob. I see in your actions a complete lack of respect or even civility, and considering your history with this project, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::I wrote a decently long response to this but as I tried to post it and saw that Whiteknight responded already (edit conflict), I realized that it's not worth prolonging the argument since you're just way too into this personally. What Whiteknight has said is quite correct and you're being irrational. &quot;Don't disrupt Wikibooks to prove a point&quot; even though I would say none of your points will ever be proven since I am confident the community will dismiss them should you continue. As far as your personal arbitration is concerned, I don't know what you're thinking of doing but it can't be here as of yet and I definitely won't be involved. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I say this is a &quot;Cabal&quot; mainly because it was a self-appointed group that sought to overturn any and nearly all of my actions in this matter.  There was no attempt at all to try and find a neutral party that could take over that would be agreed upon by all parties before action was take in the form of a user block.  And furthermore, as you have both done here on of all places my own talk page, gone after me with very personal attacks.  I believe this to be a very vocal minority and not the will of a majority of Wikibookians, and that both of you are fanning the flame even more.  BTW, how am I disrupting Wikibooks at all right now?  What have I done in terms of edits that have rewritten either policies or content that either of you two have written recently?  I'm speaking my mind and defnding my actions.  And I do think that Panic is unfairly being singled out when I know for a fact there are other users who are just as strong willed as Panic that are editing both here on Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects.  
:::Where it is going now is that this is no longer an issue between you and Panic but with me as a party instead.  And I will not go down quietly.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:05, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

::::This is absurd. There are no personal attacks occurring and to throw a tantrum like this is pretty disappointing. You seem to be living in the past and I see no value in you continuing your rationalizations about the failed arbitration, something that is long gone now. You are disruptive because you're running around writing your personal opinions about how you think you're correct and stirring up old battles that people don't want to be a part of. Maybe this is how you think you'll redeem yourself after your previous errors. Adding all your drama such as &quot;I will not go down quietly&quot; is quite silly; I picture you defending a civil war base with a flag in your hand and the national anthem playing in the background as you say that. I am not doing anything with Panic anymore and am discussing matters with the community. Whiteknight is helping mediate with Panic and find a future resolution. That's just the two of us, but the other cabal members / conspiracy legionnaires are trying to make progress as well. I won't be responding here anymore due to the offensiveness and sheer incorrectness of these comments and I definitely won't be doing any sort of arbitration or mediation with you either, so I'm considering this matter closed. Maybe if you continue to read around and see what's happened lately you'll realize what's actually occurring. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:06, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

::::The absurd part is that you call us a &quot;cabal&quot; because a group of wikibookians decided to defy the Rob monarchy. Wikibooks is about collaborations, not having to do as Rob says. Why is it that you are the only person who gets a license to be bold on matters like arbitration, and you are also the only one who doesn't have to be nice and civil when you post here? You post lies and accusations about me and other wikibookians, in addition to insults, and somehow i'm fanning the flames? You've posted a series of angry, ignorant, lengthy monologues that i've largely ignored until now, and i'm prolonging the fight? When you started the arbitration, you didn't ask a soul. You never said &quot;i think we need to find a better solution&quot;, or &quot;I think we should bring in a neutral party&quot;. I talked to over a dozen people before I shut that disgraceful failure down. I'm not going to claim that a dozen people is enough to make large decisions here, but it's certainly better then zero. 
::::And you've claimed on numerous occasions that I can't speak for the community, and that I dont know what the community wants. Does that imply that you do know? I am here every day, on email, on IRC, talking with wikibookians. What have you read that I haven't? Who have you talked to that I haven't? What do you possibly know about this community that I don't? How is it that you seem to speak for this community, but that I am not qualified to do so? I will not claim that my activity is a metric of my quality as a wikibookian, because we both know that it is not. I will, however, claim that I am more in touch with this community then you are. Withinfocus, SBJohnny, Darklama, and a whole slew of other great wikibookians are more in touch with this community then you are. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Having had a couple weeks to calm down here, I do want to point out that I am still not happy with the process that happened here.  I do not think I was given a reasonable opportunity to mediate in this situation, and the &quot;change of venue&quot; was done without the cooperation of Panic.  I also do not believe that Whiteknight and Withinfocus had the full community concensus to act the way they did.  In fact, that the user block done by Withinfocus was overturned is a clear demonstration that such concensus was not achieved.  This whole thing (IMHO, and speaking just for myself) would have been much better resolved had both of these individuals just had patience to wait for me by just a couple of days.  The wheel warring and edit wars over the arbitration pages were especially disturbing to me, and I feel that I was bullied into giving up there.  That was completely unnecessary and it was a very direct and personal attack against me.
:::::::That there were some individuals very pissed at Panic is true.  And those who weren't upset with Panic had many more important things to do with their time.  It is this reason why I think I can say that this was not a community decision, as those Wikibookians who weren't already involved in the dispute wanted to stay away from the clashing egos.  Time is on my side of the arguments here, and will more clearly seen based on how other actions are done.  That I am now in nearly constant disagreements on multiple issues with Withinfocus is something that I lament now, and certainly this confrontational attitude has spread to other areas of development on Wikibooks.
:::::::The root causes of this dispute have not been resolved, but instead it has become a wider and more diffuse personality conflict that is happening on several levels.  I can't re-open the arbitration I was doing at this point, and the situation with Panic has been resolved more or less.  It isn't perfect, and there are still individuals who would love to see Panic blocked again, this time on a permanent basis.  At this point in time, I will continue to be a staunch defender of allowing Panic (if he wants to) as a contributor to Wikibooks.  As I have said earlier, by kicking me out of a role as a mediator, I feel that instead I have to be a defender.  I don't understand why there are individuals (not just Whiteknight and Withinfocus, but many others as well) who can't comprehend my actions here in this regard, but as a general rule I try to assume good faith, particularly on the part of brand-new contributors.  If it is a choice between a brand new contributor and an old hand, I will defend the new user on the (perhaps mistaken) idea they should have a thick enough skin to take constructive criticism.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:55, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

I (and others) really would like to see you continue to be involved in helping develop Wikibooks if you are willing.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

::Can you give your input on this [[User_talk:Cool_Cat#Sorry_about_all_that...]] see last posts, I can't seem to be understood and I don't agree with some of the points made or the views expressed stating that it is irrelevant.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)


:::I don't want to get directly involved here, but I think Cool Cat is completely mistaken on the part of dual licenses.  You certainly can have very incompatable licenses that are dual-licensed material.  For example, you can have content which is licensed simultaneously under the GFDL and Microsoft EULA.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If you choose one of those licenses (the Microsoft EULA) and decide to stick with its terms, you have to ignore the other one, the GFDL in this case.  All you are doing is offering multiple alternatives for legal republication of content.

:::Also the notion of that all Wikimedia sponsored Wikis are under the terms of the GFDL is also flat out wrong.  Wikinews is under the CC-by license, and some of the Wikimedia Foundation pages are a strict propritary copyright... no license for republication at all.  The Wikimania pages are &quot;free to use, but not to modify&quot;.  I don't know where Cool Cat gets his notion that the GFDL is so universal.  That the WMF is a supporter of copyleft publication is true, but they are not 100% consistant here.

:::I would also discount most of the other legal advise that Cool Cat has offered to you.  Read the GFDL for what is strictly required and stick with that... or go to http://www.gnu.org/ and get some real advise from some people who actually understand the GFDL... as they wrote the thing in the first place.  I did find [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-June/010564.html this post] from over three years ago from Richard Stallman that dismisses nearly all aggrigation arguments that have been used for fair use and license combining on Wikipedia.  How it applies to your situation will vary, of course.

:::You own all your own contributions, and can relicense them any way you see fit.  The only requirement we have here on Wikibooks is that you give us a license to use them under the GFDL.  If you want to use another license, including CC-by-SA-NC or anything else, you are welcome to do that and even post that on your use page (to drive the point home).  But that also applies only to your individual contributions and not to what anybody else has done on previous or subsequent edits.  Since the GFDL is (most likely) the only common license for most Wikibooks contributors, as a practical matter you could say that only the GFDL applies.  But you can seek relicensing from other users as well under other terms, if they are willing to join you in those terms.

:::As far as establishing a policy on a particular Wikibook to have all contributions to that book be under a dual license, that is a bit harder.  I would suggest that it may be possible, but is a very grey area of Wikibooks policies.  There certainly would be many individuals who would object to allowing such manditory dual licenses to be enforced in a particular Wikibook that is different from the rest of Wikibooks.  The GFDL must always be there, and at any time we could simply say that the second license no longer applies for future edits.  This is also something that should be established when the Wikibook is started and can't be retroactive, unless you have the full unanimous agreement with all previous contributors including anon edits.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Yup more or less on the same ideas I have on the subject, but I would even go a bit further (I have mentally toyed with the idea), and I know it would be morally wrong, I could publish as an example the C++ book under a non GFDL license without any input from any other contributors (since the changes Darklama made to the authors page), I'm the single author under the letter of the GFDL at the moment, no one else has &quot;signed&quot; the work. My national copyright law (that can't be much different form the international standard, and a bit more protective than the US version) any work contributed that doesn't constitute a significant change (on the GFDL derivative work) doesn't give authorship, and if the author doesn't expressly state so on the authors page (as required by the GFDL) any work contributed and not expressly authored reverts to the original signing author(s) (there may be a problem with the edit clause), and for instance the FSF expressly states that it will only help actions started by authors of works, the only mine field I have identified is only the edit notice but I think it can't be defended that it applies to the whole site or inside the book's license. To simplify things I could print a full copy as is and then use it to publish the work under a new license, bypassing that barrier. (this is speaking theoretically, I have nor the inclination or intention to do so)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::I would have to agree here that making an administrative edit (adding or removing a category/VfD notice, etc.) does not constitute being considered an author.  Certainly reverted vandals don't count, even though I've seen far too many given credit when it was completely undeserved.  You might be interested in a proposal I made on meta here:  [[meta:Summer of Code 2007#Authorship determination]]  The issue of authorship is indeed something that has not been seriously considered at all.  I even added a bugzilla request here ([[Bugzilla:2993]]) that would have addressed some other authorship issues in at least a voluntary manner.  It seems as though deliberate action on the part of several &quot;upper&quot; Wikimedia Foundation members is explicitly trying to stop any kind of authorship recognition.  A proposal was even made here on Wikibooks to explicitly ban author pages entirely as being against the WMF privacy policy, and had the support of at least one member of the WMF board of trustees.  See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikijunior_Solar_System/Authors&amp;oldid=245027 this edit] by Angela Beesley (former vice-chair of the WMF board) for an example.  I successfully blocked that attempt, BTW.
:::::Again, as a practical matter, if you have contributed nearly all of the content to a Wikibook, removing those minor sections that may have had other contributors is not going to be that difficult to achieve.  You do not automatically lose your ownership of those words as soon as somebody adds a comma.  Since you own the content, you are certainly capable of republishing what you actually wrote yourself under any other content license including none at all (completely propritary copyright).
:::::Keep in mind that explictly &quot;signing&quot; an author's page is not required either, or unfortunately.  From a political point of view, I support the idea that for copyright enforcement you need to explicitly &quot;register&quot; the copyright, but that doesn't seem to be how most international copyright treaties view authorship any more.  Copyright instead occurs when it is &quot;fixed&quot; in a tangible medium, like a computer hard drive.  In this case, the MediaWiki software does list who the contributors really are, and any author pages are merely a tool to help sort out additional details.  
:::::To effectively defend copyright, you need to have the actual legal name of the person making the contributions, their nationality (what nation's passport they hold or citizenship), where they are currently living, and when they were born, and when they died (especially because of the life+70 copyright laws) or if they are still alive.  This is all required for copyright registration, and at least in the USA is required before you decide to enforce copyright (you need to file for copyright registration if you are going to take legal action).  While I could argue that other contributors still don't lose their copyright if they don't provide this information, I don't really know what courts would do with people who insist upon maintaining an alias in terms of being able to force compliance to the terms of the GFDL if they choose not to stand up and assert their copyright.  I should note here this is one of the reasons I edit with my actual legal name here on Wikibooks.... I assert copyright on everything I contribute.  And it is very difficult for somebody else to claim they are &quot;Robert Horning&quot; as I am not using an alias.  This is my actual name.
:::::Yes, I no longer enjoy anonymity here as a result of this, and I am also a bigger target in a libel situation, but I am also very concious about what I write in that regard.  Perhaps not at much as I should be, but it still is a problem.  And this is a choice I have explicitly made, so I'm not requiring this from anybody else.  Posting you name on your user page does effectively the same thing, so I'm not necessarily saying you have to switch the name of your account, but it has become an issue for some individuals, notably [[w:User:Essjay]], if you have been following that situation.  He was presuming anonymity and he hit a situation he had to put up and show who he actually was.  I am not going to face that same situation because I'm up front about who I am.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

*reset 

For what I understand (I did try to find it out), US law doesn't account for the anonymous author, my local code does, protection is granted to the work based on the publication date on those cases, it is up to the author to disclose the information, I can't believe the US doesn't give that protection to authors. On that search I have found that the authorship may be limited by age on the US (I can't get my mind around the logic of that).&lt;br&gt;
I have no problem with Wikimedia or even the community blocking or working to make attributing copyright harder (this ultimately will benefit us all, as consumers), I do consume more than I produce (and most people do if not closed in a box), what irks me is not stating that openly and let people know it, to me it is working equal to be in bad faith against the users.
As an creator my main motivation to participate here was to build stuff and to be able to point to the things I create, by diluting the work one makes how does one state his achievements, or why bother to perform a greater contribution of content if any one can claim to have done it.&lt;br&gt;
I assure you if I had understood from the beginning the implications I would not have used Wikibooks and would have created the content outside even under the GFDL (I have no problem with the freedom of the license), for instance I contribute from time to time to wikipedia but I do it anonymously, what I don't like is the convenient way people brush aside the pieces they don't particularly like. (Referring mostly title/cover pages stating the authors or credits given, granting authorship based on the weak history logs, or just because of spell correction or even the rewording of the text, without taking into account the size of contributions, this to my view will only reduce contributors if they are properly informed of the facts, and I don't see a logical reason to do so since the license gives freedom to the content).&lt;br&gt;
This is also a poor way of educating people, I can't understand how can anyone claim to have built a house if all they did was hammer a handful of nails.&lt;br&gt;
As for anonymity or even stating an &quot;visible&quot; identity it all comes down to how things are verified, for instance I don't particularly like some of the tags people use on their userpages as they can easily be ego builders (ya, I know good faith), the world is as it is and I'm a bit paranoid by nature, having good faith doesn't mean to be blind to reality, people are of 3 types (&quot;idealist&quot;, &quot;realist&quot; and &quot;radical&quot;). My stock of idealism is very low and things have not been as bad to make me a complete radical :)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:26, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

Signing&quot; an author's page ''is'' required to be counted as an author (GFDL - This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.) the license states the authors page as the place to do it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 07:44, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:Unfortunately, the counter argument to this is that you &quot;sign&quot; as an author when you hit the &quot;Save Page&quot; button and your edit gets into the page history.  While the fundimental capability is within the page edit histories to sort out ownership, it is only a theoretical exercise at the moment.  In this case, you can (with a bit of work) be able to identify at least those authors who are willing to stand up and take credit for their work.  I completely agree with you that this situation can and should be explained much more clearly.
:As for anonymous authors, there is sufficient grey area of the laws that I wouldn't try to assume that what they have written is in the public domain, but as I was trying to say, if you aren't willing to appear on a witness stand, clearly state who you are in court, I don't see how you can practically enforce any kind of copyright.  And the nationality of the author is necessary to even determine what court has jurisdiction.  This is why authorship nationality is even requested at all.  You are protected under the laws of your country, even in USA and other Berne convention countries.  In other words, when your content crosses international borders, what is or is not copyrighted does not change.  This hasn't always been the case, but it is international law at the moment.  The only case where there are differences is for older works that were created prior to the Berne convention.
:While not strictly necessary in a legal sense, I think it is strongly recommended that you do sign an authors page, and it certainly helps to simplify trying to determine authorship as required by the GFDL (v 1.2 - section 2-b).  I do not accept the argument that you can choose any random five individuals on the history page, including vandals who have not contributed to the content creation at all and in fact have been counter-productive.... particularly when such authorship claim is at the expense of very legitimate contributors who have made considerable effort to make the content and have stood up to be noticed on the talk pages and elsewhere.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

::But the when you sign with the save button you are using a generic GFDL (no work is specified or by default the Wikibooks namespace), under the aggregation of independent works, the edits you do inside the independent works are not covered by the general license (hence independent) and you are agreeing to the GFDL of the virtualspace you are editing. That is why disagree on how page moves and merges are performed on Wikibooks (most of the time without giving reference to the original work, I have done so in the books I've worked).
::Another important point is that history logs are not exact they are easy to be corrupted, for instance Darklama has in several pages os the C++ book mered old pages into a new ones (even on his user space) and deleted the originals the history of the originals were lost, he is now by using the history logs the &quot;creator&quot; of all the content. (I have asked the correction of this to him and WK (he recognized the fact at least) and so far no actions was taken, this is a further example on not performing the required moves we talked about)
::I agree with all your points except the faith you put on these history logs and the requirement you make that would make it a default to have a reference to a real person to let a user be an author, it should be up to them to decide if in the future they would like take any action that would then require the information to be public, in all the rest I'm in complete agreement with you.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:13, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
:::I really don't have all that much faith in the history log, and the page merger feature does add additional complications that pull edits out of context.  Going through merged page history is very difficult to determine exactly who wrote what and when, or to follow a natural progression of the page as is typical of most edits.  It sounds like Darklama is not doing a proper page merger here.  If there are specific pages that you want the history restored from, I can go back and at least add back in the original edit history to show who added the content originally.  You should not do a page merger by doing a simple cut and paste, and the original edit history ought to be preserved in most cases in some fashion.  This is why we are now using the page import feature for transwikied content from Wikipedia.
:::If you want me to review some of the deletion log of Darklama, I would be willing to do that.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:31, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
::::In going over Darklama's edit log, he certainly has been one very busy admin!  The pages that you mention are not quite so obvious to me, so it will take quite a bit more work to see where there might be some problems.

Please let me know how I can help here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:43, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*reset
Gezzz, he has made so much structural changes that I couldn't point all out but consider examining every one that he is one of the 1st contributors or pages that state a recent creation date, for instance [[C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Basics]] is a merge of 3 pages (and the example I gave above), if you see my Watchlist I remember it could be done (has it changed ?) you can see several pages that were deleted, and he has moved over several original pages with edits or constructs. I can't see anyone being able to retrace all the changes that created corruptions of the history logs, for instance if a move of content is not performed in block (page) it is a simple edit to another location (if the original page is erased and restarted the log is lost) and attribution of the content to the original contributor is impossible.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
:I see that even Darklama noted that he copied the content directly over from what was a transclusion earlier.  I can also see that substantial portions of the edit history certainly are missing.  And because of the massive use of transclusion in the early edits of this page (one of my major complaints about using page histories.... transclusions are the current version not the historical version), it is very difficult to see just where all of the content came from.  As you said here, this is very ulgy in terms of trying to recreate the actual authorship, and you certainly have reason to be upset here.  With the massive use of moving pages to user space and back again, this complicates matters even more as it appears as though talk pages have been removed, moved or deleted completely as well.  Ow, this is a complicated mess, itn't it!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

:I'm not seeing the same as you (I can't as a user), but not all must be blamed on Darklama, remember that the book was forked, and forced merged (during the merge the original pages may have been mangled, I'm not an administrator so I can't be blamed and I even opposed the merge on that basis), but as for Darklama he was aware of the problem and I stated it so especially on that particular page, I did go as far as mark it for rapid deletion with the bases of duplicating content on the book namespace (he then moved it to his userspace), I have informed him of what he was doing and the results (at least 3 times) we was perfectly aware of the consequences I state this fact as it has implications on other discussion I was having on the level of trust and knowledge one deposits on administrators, that discussion is on Whiteknight talk page and I saved it here  [[User:Panic2k4/Sandbox/RapidEdit]] as it is indeed troubling, it was a result of the discussion about limiting the arbitration to only administrators), btw I've used some of your references and wordings without attribution (so not get you into the discussion or seem offensive to Cool Cat).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:57, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

== Sex! ==

I do actually agree with you in general on this - my worry is that I just don't believe it will be fixed - there are already far too many books out there that have had maintenance tags on them for quite a long time.  Frankly I am not a policy person at all - I do however care that the readers of Wikibooks are pleased with their experience and are hopefully tempted to contribute constructively.  This one seems to fail that test (IMO &amp; the talk page tends to bear this out).

In addition there are certainly other chapters that are not well crafted either but I don't see bringing the whole book in as an option (tho I did think about it).

The Island one - one other vote &amp; I will happily &quot;speedy&quot; it myself but I had serious doubts on how many admins had looked into the category. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

On an unhappier note, what's your opinion on [[w:WP:BAN#Community_ban|this Wikipedia policy]]? A few poor souls are really trying to update and improve our policy structure, but it's becoming rediculously difficult to do so. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:The &quot;nominate featured book&quot; link was to the VfD page.  I may even be the guilty party on putting the wrong link there, but instead of creating a new section on the featured book page, it was turned into a VfD.  I'm just glad that I caught the mistake right away.

:I'll look into that policy and add my own comments to it.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:53, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:I have said most of what I can say about this on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Arbitration]], as it applies to Wikibooks.  Certainly the Wikipedia policy does not apply here on Wikibooks other than as a very informal guideline.  Most user bans are for blatant vandalism, and I don't think that is even under dispute at the moment.  Where it gets tricky is in dealing with users like Panic who have obviously made some very good faith efforts but have also creating a screaming lynch mob that is out to kick him off the project.

:Note here that I'm not trying to accuse any individual or reopen wounds, but making enemies and inciting hatreds is not a way to be cooperative.  If you've pissed off so many people, even if what you are doing is completely within the technical side of within project policies, you might want to cool it off for a bit and try to regain some friendships instead.  When working with others, it is far better to be nice and cooperate, even if you have to back down and not get things accomplished exactly the way you wanted them to be working in the first place.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:03, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::That's a very good way to put it :). I find policy writing frustrating to begin with, but I've thrown a monkeywrench in a gear or two as well when I'm worried that a policy is too open to harmful interpretation (like you (I'm pretty sure), I am very much an anti-deletionist except for the obvious &quot;no can do&quot; books). We need some sort of solution for this kind of trouble though, and I'm drawing nothing but blanks, because it seems every attempt at solving it (including yours and mine) causes even bigger problems. It's a really tough call for anyone to make, and the task of making that call is a lot to ask of anyone, especially in light of our ideals on Wikibooks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:22, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Frustrations aside, I dont really believe that blocking is going to solve this particular problem. Wikipedia has a much higher volume of disruptive people, and trying to accept them (or even ignore them) is likely much harder then it is here. For them, to prevent a complete shutdown of the system some elements really do need to be removed so the rest of the community can get on with business. I think we need to remember a point from the decision making guideline that a single stubborn, difficult, or eccentric person isn't enough to stop the forward progress of the community at large. Consensus only requires consideration for all ''reasonable'' objections. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:34, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Well, that doesn't address the (perfectly valid) frustrations of the users being affected by trolling. We ''are'' talking about trolling, which is (thankfully) more common on web forums than wikis, but the pattern is the same: trolls try to get other users/contributors to debate or argue endlessly with them on any subject they can find, often using the other persons words against them in order to keep their opponents on the defensive. It's not the same as vandals... vandals are uncreative, and have no desire for dialog. Trolls want dialog above all else, and while they may make constructive comments or contributions as well (usually they make a point to do this, in order to keep the community from deciding that there's absolutely no reason for tolerating them), they spend most of their time and energy &quot;trawling for suckers&quot; (apparently the etymology of &quot;troll&quot;), and baiting people into further dialog. It's a very hard call, because while on the one hand there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to be in a dialog with members of a community, there comes a point where insisting on that dialog gets in the way of the community members' ability to do what they're here to do (in the case of a web forum, the reason people come to a forum is to discuss whatever the forum topic is; in the case of wikis, people come to wikis to create content). If someone is consistently disrupting the flow or conversation (on forums) or creative progress (on wikis), continues to do so after warnings, and clearly has little interest in moving the project forward, the community needs to have the power to shut them out.

::::There's been a lot of loose talk about &quot;consensus&quot; lately, and in particular some have either taken it to mean &quot;unanimous agreement&quot;, &quot;majority opinion&quot;, or &quot;a new concept that isn't well defined&quot;. All of these are rediculous. As I might have mentioned before, I am a Quaker, and we Quakers have governed ourselves through consensus for a few centuries. I suppose we're famous for &quot;shunning&quot; (a very rare practice that I've never seen), but we also have a process of &quot;standing up&quot;, where the meeting members silently object to inappropriate messages (messages against our faith). I've also seen people (usually over-enthusiastic evangelists who have been disruptive in the past) stopped at the door to prevent them from disrupting a meeting (similar to what a &quot;block&quot; does here on Wikibooks), and it's not done because we love them less, but only because we know they're up to no good. Consensus isn't magic, and you can respect someone as a human being without letting them disrupt your community. '''Both''' of you need to stop fucking around with notions of &quot;users' rights and dignity&quot;, and focus on the goal of creating textbooks that are free for the use of all (or even policies about textbooks that are free to all). This has gone on far too long.  --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::Actually, I am trying to get on with textbook development.  I have spent far to much time on policies and such, with the arbitration experience taking up far too much of my efforts as well.  I have one textbook ([[Serial Programming]]) that I really need to get back to working on.  And there is another textbook that is related which I'm trying to work on with a relatively new Wikibooks user that looks like it could be very interesting if we put it together, going over USB devices.  I'm still trying to come up with an outline and title for that book, however.  This is above and beyond my efforts with [[History of Wikibooks]], which I also want to get going on.

== Copyright ==

You Wrote: &quot;Reever2, I would like to let you know that I'm not so concerned with the &quot;external links&quot; as Herbythyme has expressed here, but I am concerned about the potential copyright violations. We are cautious, almost to the point of paranoia (some would say even beyond that), to make sure that all of the content which is contributed to our project is contributed legally. We go way beyond what is legally required in terms of being a &quot;safe harbor&quot; and aggressively go after copyright violations which we detect through a number of methods. One of the reasons for this is that we do intend in the future to be able to redistribute and possibly sell the content here on Wikibooks in other formats besides just web pages.

A general assurance that you have permission to copy this content is not very comforting, especially when we aren't completely certain that you are who you claim to be here. It makes our job much easier if the web page itself grants explicit permission to use the content under terms like the GFDL, or we have some way to verify independently that permission has been formally granted to this project. This is mainly trying to build some sort of trust relationship that the rest of our on-line community can also rely upon, and to make sure that if we reuse this content elsewhere (under the terms of the GFDL) that we can do that legally. We do not permit a license &quot;for use only on Wikibooks&quot;. I hope you can understand this. We are not asking you to give up copyright here, but you must explicitly grant us a license to redistribute this content to other places, including commercial usage, under the terms of this specific content license. Most of our participants understand this philosophy, so it generally isn't a problem, especially when content is added a paragraph or two at a time and heavily edited and rephrased.

As far as the external links are concerned, we tend to discourage redundant links unless they add significant additional value or are of a bibliographic nature. I understand the desire to try and build up external links to your website, but explicit links with what appears to be a desire to improve page rankings with search engines is seen as a form of link spamming. We deal with this so often that the automatic response is to remove any such links until somebody can give a strong reason for including them in a page. This is nothing against you or your company, but we say the same thing to everybody who tries to do this. I realize that the video files themselves to add some value to these recipes, but our desire is to have all multimedia like this to be included under the same terms as the text itself as well. That isn't strictly necessary, but it does help as we intend to redistribute this content on CD-ROMs and other sorts of formats where an on-line link may not always be easy to access this content.

The Cookbook has a long history with this project, and in fact pre-dates the creation of this website and domain name. I would like to encourage you to continue to make contributions here as long as they are either original creations or you have been given (and are able to document) permission to relicense the content under the terms of the GFDL. --Rob Horning 11:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi, Thanks for your comments. I have read the copyright obligations for Wikibooks, and am happy with your explanation. So can i get this straight- as long as i have permission to distribute this content i am ok to post. You can contact me on robert.reeve@videojug.com if you would like verification that i am in fact an employee of this company, and therefore have copyright permission. As for the external links- Google do not add page ranking (give added Search engne ranking benefits)to our site from any wiki pages, so we are not doing it for those reasons. We are trying to add good quality content to your site, and hopefully (i'm going to be honest) gain some referrals to our site. If you do distribute this material onto CD-Roms etc- our copyright will remain (that is correct isn't it!)

== Sidebar... ==

Two things: first, please run that by the community before making the sidebar bigger. We've always discussed changes to the sidebar, sitenotice, and other highly visible css changes before making them.

Second: I can see the change on the mediawiki page, but not the sidebar itself. Aside from purging, do you have any good ideas? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:32, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:One, I did run it by the community... and this is a very easy thing to change back.  I was merely being bold here.  I mentioned I was going to do this on the Staff Lounge, but ok, I didn't wait.  I am hardly the first admin to make changes like this.  See [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Chat#Moving on policies]] where I did discuss this, or at least talk about ways to help improve learning about current policies under discussion.

:As far as why it isn't showing up yet, that is because the sidebar is cached on the foundation servers and it takes about a day before it is refreshed.  That is just one of the tweaks that Brion and his crew has done to try and improve CPU processing times for making project pages.

== Question ==
I have placed a request in [[User_talk:Xixtas#Need_some_fixes]], so links can change, but I think this is more your subject so I'm asking you. [[C++ Programming/TOC2/Print Version]] uses the template [[Template:Excerpt version notice]] I have some time ago added the GFDL ([[Talk:C++ Programming/TOC2/Print Version|it was first objected to by Darklama and SB Jhonny]]) but no reversion was performed so they must agree to it being there, I noticed that the authors copyright page is still missing (I have no problem in not having in on the TOC2 but print version is different as it is to generate a stand alone work), not wanting to get into any discussion I ask you if a book even marked as an excerpt does or not require the GFDL and the authors copyright statement on the print version ?  Txs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

:You don't explicitly need a &quot;author's page&quot; transcluded here, but I think it would be one heck of a very excellent idea.  I don't understand the whole controversy or why anybody, especially Darklama and Johnny, would be objecting here.  This is so silly that there is any objection at all that removing this sort of stuff is IMHO unjustified.

:On the other hand, the author page is desperately in need of fixing up and actually showing the real authors that have contributed to the creation of the content.  Where possible, you should allow people to put their actual names and even where they live, or at least the country where they are living at.  This is important author information and necessary for copyright enforcement.  I completely disagree that the information in the page histories is sufficient to contain this information.  There is enough information there to glean out the information necessary for a minimum level of authorship recognition, but that is all there really is.  It would take in my mind a very burdensome effort to realistically even determine who the principle authors and contributors to the content are.  I know, I've tried to build such a list for several Wikibooks, and it is not a trivial task at all.

:And, for this to be truly a &quot;printed&quot; version, a hyperlink is not sufficient to build the list of names of authorship needed for section 2(b) of the GFDL.  You need to have the actual names of the authors.  For a web environment, the hyperlink is sufficient, but not for printed matter.

:There are some tools available now on the Wikimedia toolserver to somewhat help with the task of counting edits, but as I have mentioned earlier, that is not really an effective method of determining authorship or quantities of contributions.  And furthermore, as you also pointed out, the repeated page moving, merging, and deletion is something that has lost a significant portion of this edit history as well.  I can totally understand why you are very concerned about authorship of this particular book.  You should not be the only author listed, but there is no realistic way to determine who else should be listed there either.

:What a mess.  I'll see if I can help find a solution to this and at least try to create a realistic list of contributors to this Wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

Reading your post on the staff lounge has pretty much brought me over to the camp of those who say you're more interested in being important ''to'' Wikibooks than you are in the importance ''of'' Wikibooks. I won't waste time reading your wordy comments in the future Robert, because it's pretty clear you're more interested in being a &quot;player&quot; than you are in the simple mission of providing free content to all, and helping to encourage those of good faith to contribute good content. 

You are nothing like the person I once thought you were (and admired). I will never again see your comments as anything other than some wacko political ploy. You really need to stop playing this game with us.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:I am not.  I am so sorry you are so pissed at me and have decided that I am an enemy of yours.  I hardly say that about you, or at least I hope you won't be.  And who is playing games here?  Are you trying to kick me off this project?  Saying &quot;I will never again see your comments as anything other than some wacko political ploy.&quot; is such a strong personal attack that I have no way to respond here.  I tried to calmly explain why I felt that the content needed to remain here, and you have done nothing but do very direct and personal attacks, and quote me out of context, just like you have done here.  And since I got involved with Panic, you seem to have completely mis-interpreted nearly everything I have said.

:The DMCA is hardly a &quot;fancy law&quot;.... it is the very basis to force removal of copyrighted content from Wikimedia servers if there ever is a copyright challenge.  Please re-read (if you care) what I've said here, and that you can remove copyvios but you shouldn't delete them on the spot. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

::Puh-leeze. First, stop being paranoid about people wanting to kick you off the project. There ''are'' a few who might wish you'd go away (I personally wish you'd just mellow out and ''listen'', rather than writing lenghty orations), but no-one wants to kick you off (how on Earth could you be kicked off?... I'm not being in any way flip or sarcastic: Wikibooks just wouldn't be the same without you!). 

::Your explanation was not calm. First you implied that someone (not sure who still) was &quot;flaming&quot; a new user. Then you stated that you would undelete if anyone deleted (despite the fact that the people you were talking to ''all'' felt it was problematic to keep it... if you're so certain about the &quot;silent majority&quot; you keep alluding to, just ask them to speak up rather than pretending to speak for them). Then you imply that anyone who deletes without your saying it's OK are somehow going to be sued in court. 

::And please stop waxing on about how &quot;we&quot; Wikibookians have always done something this way or that. It's great that you've been around long enough to provide us with a living memory, but most Wikibookians aren't from that old guard (most of them have long abandoned the project), and there are more than a few (me ''definitely'' included) who feel rather strongly that wikibooks has been mismanaged in the past (not intentionally, just not enough highly active admins like Az_1568 and Herbythyme around doing good gatekeeping, or &quot;structural maintenance&quot; folks like Jguk, Iamunknown, and me). For example we ''still'' have over [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Uncategorizedimages&amp;limit=1500 1,000 uncategorized images], and uncategorized means no copyright label. It's only been a few months since we even had local checkusers! And in the present case, it's just rather fishy for a commercial site to add all their content onto wikibooks (always with some external links to that commercial site).

::We're all grown up now Robert. We aren't desparate enough to take content that isn't free, because we're getting new free content added every day, and there's no reason to think we won't have even more the next day. There have been massive additions of new, top-quality content to Wikibooks over the past year (there's also been a lot of garbage, vandals, spammers, and iffy stuff too, but of late that's been dealt with in a quiet, professional manner by our &quot;staff&quot; of admin volunteers. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Johnny, why do you keep flaming me and attacking me so much here, particularly on my user talk page?  And for somebody who is a wacko that you won't listen to again, you certainly are responding to quite vigerously.  I want this to end, but I will defend myself when flat out lies about what I said are made.  And you have completely misquoted me on the Staff Lounge page, and are doing that here as well.

:::All I was trying to get across here is that a simple discussion about somebody who may have violated copyright was getting way, way out of hand here.  Particularly when you said that the content needed to be deleted.  Please, and I say this again, please re-read what I said here.  I did not want this individual ([[User:Reever2]]) to think we were going to immediately delete this content if he was able to provide proof that he had permission to add this content to Wikibook, and it was your comments that IMHO went way beyond this to be critical about my suggesting the WMF didn't need to get involved.  In fact, I see far too much of that around here, where people go running off to Jimbo to ask him a question or two to arbitrate a debate, or complain to the chair of the WMF.  In nearly every case where these individuals (meaning Jimbo, Anthere, Danny Wool, or others) get involved with Wikibooks it has been to the detriment of this project, except when they are helping quietly to build content.  In their official capacity to make a call on policy, somebody here always gets pissed, and some really pissed.

:::Please, take a chill pill here.  I admire the very positive work that you have done here on Wikibooks, and I don't want to get you so steamed at me that you will thwart nearly every effort of mine here on Wikibooks.  It isn't worth it for either of us to be this pissed.  You are completely misunderstanding what I am saying here, and your anger toward me is clouding your judgment about what I am writing.  Please relax, and note that I am not trying to wheel war with you or block your efforts if you keep helping out with Wikibooks like you have in the past.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== FHSST images ==

Rob, I know you were around when the FHSST books started being imported. Many of the images are untagged. You may know that we have {{tl|GFDL-presumed}}. I assume that the people who imported the FHSST books knew that they were submitting the textual content under the GFDL; is there any reason to suggest that the images would be licensed otherwise? If not, I will start tagging them with GFDL-presumed. Best, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:I would have to say that if the images were added about the time that the content of the FHSST books were added, that {{tl|GFDL-presumed}} is the correct tag to put on them.  All of this content came from another website (it was more static HTML at the time) where there was some effort to create the textbooks, but found that Wikibooks could offer them a supportive community that could reach out beyond their core development team.

:Like this last situation we encountered with the VideoJug addition, the FHSST folks did have to learn a thing or two about copyright, but in this case permission was granted according to the GFDL and acknowledged by the entire group of developers of the content.  The images that were added at this time were imported from this now non-existent website.  While I don't know if they were as vigorous about determining copyright status as we are here, they did believe they had not only copyright permission to use these images but also to copy them to Wikibooks.  I say this with a little reservation, because my experience in dealing with instructors is that they claim educational fair use on just about everything they find and largely act as if copyright is something left as an historical footnote belonging to the realm of &quot;other people&quot; than themselves.  The text is rock-solid for sure GFDL, but the images I would hesitate a tiny bit, which is precisely why we even bother with tagging images.  

:Thanks for this effort.... it is very much appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:13, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== Chinese Medicine section in Wikibooks ==

Hey Rob,

I saw that you were editing a wikibook on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Is that because you were correcting something or because you are a teacher or student of TCM? I would like to generate some serious effort and establish a larger TCM section in WikiBooks and would like some assistance in just starting off.

Thank you in advance,

== Reply to your comments ==

Hi Robert,
Thanks for your message (over a week ago).  Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time at the moment and so I tend to forget to reply to messages unless I do so immediately.

I can understand your frustration with Wikibooks at the moment and I know only too well that you have always worked for the good of the project.  I see that you are a bit active again at the moment and I hope that you decide not to leave the project.  I don't think people are trying to kick you off the project even if they might give such an impression - everyone reacts badly and on the spur of the moment at times.  All good organizations relish discussion and disagreement otherwise they will remain static and eventually deteriorate.  Your disagreement helps the project in many ways and makes people think before the leap.

Good luck and I hope to see you around on Wikibooks in the future.

It seems unfortunate the way things have turned out. All the contributions of yours that i have seen, I remember them all being constructive and positive for the community. Perhaps this essay on Wikipedia - [[w:Wikipedia:Ignore_all_users|&quot;Ignore All Users&quot;]] - would be of interest. Wikiversity is another rather interesting Wikimedia project, with seemingly boundless long term potential; if you felt like checking that out, I'm sure you are welcome there too. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 22:29, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

==Main page and other issues==

Hi Rob. I am glad you are sticking with us. I am vaguely happy with the way the main page is turning out but would prefer more books &quot;up front&quot;. There is a lot of good faith at Wikibooks but people do get carried away on specific issues. One of the problems with a purely written mode of communication is that we cannot reassure each other after bust ups. As you say, the presence of an elder statesman like Karl Wick might help us.

...for replying on the RFC. I haven't replied yet because I was (to be honest) waiting for you to comment :). I think it's better to leave it open for a couple days (and add some &quot;kink-fixing stuff&quot; on it, and actually announce it in one of the public fora (Staff Lounge/Chat? I definitely ''don't'' want to establish a tradition of announcing these on the admin's noticeboard, because that would only serve to strengthen the impression that Wikibooks is &quot;ruled&quot; by administrators, rather than just maintained by them). 

While I'm on that subject: I didn't respond to you on the RFB page (because I was worried that you'd take my response the wrong way), but while I ''do'' understand that there's a prevalent impression that &quot;tools = political power&quot;, I really ''do'' feel strongly that this should not be the case. They're just tools, which should be given to trusted users that might need to use them from time to time. The &quot;tools = political power&quot; thing is, in my opinion, a distortion of the Wikimedia community, and the ''reality'' of that equation on Wikipedia is one of the reasons I think (English) Wikipedia's community is corrupt (the other reason I think it's corrupted (or perhaps &quot;tainted&quot; is a better word) are the endless restrictions on administrative &quot;power&quot;, but you generally don't get insurrections without bad government, and the best way to create a bad government is to put a government in power in the first place). Webaware, who is an amazing asset to our project, apparently rejected his nomination because he didn't like the political connotations. I think RobinH's reasons are along the same lines. They're just tools, Robert! Tools! We don't give them to people we think might abuse them, but other than that, they really are just access to a couple buttons that we don't give people the first day they decide to pop in.

(&lt;s&gt;Just one thing though: why would you threaten something-or-other if I &quot;refuse&quot; to respond to the RFC?&lt;/s&gt; Heh, just reread and figured out what you meant... but the rest still holds). I ''initiated'' the RFC, so why on earth would I not respond to it??? That kind of goes to the heart of what I've been saying to you on a number of occaisions: you have a tendency to assume the worst intentions in those who have a clear history of having ''good'' intentions, and that applies to Jimbo (he's just some guy who had a nice idea, after all), Jguk (who really was just trying to help organize wikibooks on his &quot;category spreee&quot;), and Whiteknight every bit as much as it applies to me. It just really puzzles me why you so quickly go on the attack, and even more so when you accuse people of attacking you. You and I (and the 3 others I just mentioned) share many of the same desires, and we almost always agree on how to get there! Why does it have to be a battle every time? --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:24, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

:My striked comment above more or less illustrates why I think ''you'' should request a user RFC... it's gotten to the point now that I just expect you to &quot;attack&quot; me (or others), even though I know deep down that you don't really ''mean'' to attack anyone. User-conduct RFCs on wikipedia have a decidedly negative connotation (in fact they have an alternate version for the positive called &quot;editor review&quot;). What I'd like to see with ''our'' RFC process is more along the lines of &quot;what do you think of this user's contributions/behavior/etc.?&quot; Same process for both the &quot;positive&quot; and the &quot;negative&quot;, aimed at helping the subject of the RFC becoming a better Wikibookian. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:04, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

::My main concern about RFCs is that there really is only three possible outcomes:  The person who filed the complaint is marked as a loony and discredited for even bring the issue up; the complaint turns out to be a massive misunderstanding and the issue is dropped peaceably; or the person for whom the RFC is raised is censured or other significant action like a user block is performed.  In short I don't see the real value to these sort of call for comments unless there is a serious issue that needs to be resolved that normal discussions havn't already dealt with.  And the ultimate goal should be to see how drastic of a censure ought to take place, not if it should happen at all.  The act of raising the issue has already pushed the issue to the point that something (from the opinion of the person raising the request) ought to happen that may require invokation of administrator tools.  

::BTW, my main objections about Jguk's actions really didn't center around his implementation of categories (which I considered to be mainly harmless but irrelevant), but around his massive deletion of content on Wikibooks.  During his tenure of being an active administrator, the number of content pages went down significantly, and I believed that he was removing some content perhaps too aggressively than he should have, and in many cases without even so much as a VfD.  In particular a policy he added to [[WB:DP]] regarding the deletion of a significant number of redirects that did not get any sort of widespread policy discussion among Wikibooks users, and then he proceeded to act as though such a policy had concensus.  Some of what he did was of a cleanup nature that really did need to be done, but my strong concern was on where to draw the line and say &quot;STOP&quot;.  He and I did disagree on some content, and I forced a couple of VfD discussions where earlier it had simply been deleted. 

::Regarding Jimbo's actions, he is a man who has been pulled in a dozen different directions and simply doesn't have the time to seriously get into project minutae to really understand the fine points of the discussion.  He certainly has not been an active Wikibookian, although Jimbo does like the general idea of using Wiki software to develop textbooks.  Compounding this disconnect by not being involved with the project (Jimbo certainly has not put any substantive effort to the creation of actual Wikibook content), he is also seen as the court of ultimate appeal with regards to policy disputes, and it was on this basis that I think he came in regarding the Video Game guides and a few other issues here with Wikibooks:  Some people complained about the issues in external forums including personal e-mails to Jimbo or at public conferences and other places, and Jimbo felt compelled to raise a stink.  What seemed to be missed was that in most cases there were existing fora (such as the VfD pages) where legitimate objections could have been raised without having to do something drastic like invoking steward tools and attempting to delete content.  Furthermore, Jimbo displayed a significant lack of knowledge in the use of MediaWiki software and naming conventions on Wikibooks by only deleting the &quot;main page&quot; of each Wikibook he objected to.  I suggested that if he really wanted the content to be deleted, that a simple notice to a couple of Wikibooks administrators used to the idea of deleting whole Wikibooks would have been a much better way to deal with the issue.  Also, I felt that the Wikibooks community was very capable of dealing with these issues, even though the opinions of a well respected individual like Jimbo carried some weight in those discussions.

::I just don't agree with a knee jerk reaction that everything Jimbo says is the gospel truth and significant disagreements with his opinions should not be considered.  Jimbo is capable of making mistakes, and I think far too often his words have been used as official policy when they shouldn't be used as such.  To give his words weight is fine, and to seriously consider suggestions from Jimbo is a good thing.  But it shouldn't end discussion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:09, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Have a few mins this morning (raining). I agree that RFCs have become that on Wikipedia, but there's no reason it needs to follow that example here. The primary goal should be to repair broken lines communications, or at least undo and prevent damage from miscommunications. 

:::I don't agree with knee jerk agreements with Jimbo either, but he did have a good argument for why they're not appropriate. If on the other hand he is speaking for the foundation (as he was with the VGG stuff), then we can look for exceptions to the rules, but we can't simply ignore things. I'm suprised he used admin tools at all, but perhaps it was just to make the point clear. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:31, 30 April 2007 (UTC)
::::Actually, Jimbo was not &quot;speaking for the foundation&quot;, but was talking on his own.  At the time the video game guides became a significant issue here on Wikibooks, the WMF was already well established and anything &quot;official&quot; certainly would have been a joint action.  I'm just saying that his opinions are just that.... his opinions.  They should not have been given more weight than that, although his opinions certainly should have carried some significant weight.  What surprised me more than anything else was a bunch of individuals who were previously saying one thing (to keep the Video Game books here on Wikibooks) and suddenly they changed their tune when Jimbo spoke in a sort of &quot;Jimbo can do no wrong&quot; attitude similar to a cult.
::::And I agreed that there were changes that needed to be made on these and other issues within Wikibooks, I just didn't think such changes needed to be as drastic.  In other words, something that could have been reached with true consensus rather than the bullying that did occur.  And some compromise on the issue could have happened which did not occur either.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:51, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Books a big hit ==

On a more productive note, you might want to direct you attention to the [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Nominations]] page, that appears to be a big hit with the locals. Also maturing quickly is the [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Templates]] page, which is used to prototype book blurbs for the main page.

== 2 other things... ==

Would you mind keeping an eye on [[Television Manufacture and Repair]]? The main author is a retiree who was &quot;recruited&quot; to write the book by [[User:Bastique]]. There are serious formatting problems, and [[User:Editor at Large]] is trying to help clean it up, but the author has apparently been reverting. Seems right up your alley (walking him through the ropes, I mean). 

Second, there's some rumbling on commons about the problems in our Image namespace, namely the copyright issues. Apparently there have been images moved from here to there, which subsequently needed deleting. I'm not sure about the details, but at least one prominent sysop is considering getting the foundation involved. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:36, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

Robert, I'm afraid a legal mess has been made with [[Template:GFDL]].  It does not directly affect us but, if individual Wikibooks were to be published, it would.  You are aware that the [[WB:GFDL|GFDL]] indicates that one must &quot;Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&quot;  If you look at the history of Template:GFDL, there was a point in time where the template was subject to Wikibooks' disclaimers, then later subject to Wikipedia's disclalimers, then finally subject to no disclaimers.  Technically this needs to be sorted out; how to go about it, I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 09:39, 7 May 2007 (UTC)

== Hey! ==

I know you and I rarely like to acknowledge seeing eye-to eye on things, I really am worried about letting [[WB:AN]] become something other than a maintenance tool. Power corrupts, so we should avoid giving it and/or having it... so if you might weigh in [[Wikibooks:Administrators%27_noticeboard#.22Keepin.27_it_real.22|here]], I'd deeply appreciate it. 

BTW: I don't think the guy did anything wrong by asking there, nor do I think WK did anything wrong by answering there, but it's very dangerous to consolidate the SL into WB:AN. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:01, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Wikibooks Organization ==

It's my opinion that [[Wikibooks:CCO Librarians]] can likely be replaced by a link to the staff lounge or even the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk]], which is another under-utilized resource. Condensing under-used resources could help to create a smaller number of resources which are easier to maintain, and easier to watch. 

As for [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]], I agree with you that it either needs to be drastically expanded, or deleted entirely. I would far prefer the former option, but if we just can't find enough material to fill it with, I dont see any reason to keep it around. I'm not looking to delete ''anything'' just yet, or make any changes that are irreparable (or only repairable through an intense amount of work). I have made a number of changes already, and it's my hope that as people see progress being made, that they will be more warm to the idea of further improvements. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:54, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

== [[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania]] ==

Unfortunately, we aren't looking at a national USA chapter, we've been encouraged to think more locally. We were going to do a &quot;Wikimedia Philadelphia&quot;, but we were likewise encouraged to think a little bigger, and so now we are looking at a state-level chapter. 

We will be the first state chapter, and as far as I know we are the only one in active development (although I've heard some rumors of a florida chapter and a New York chapter). Depending on interest and response, we very well might be able to expand our operation to cover a larger area, and possibly the entire US.

:Thanks for your message of support. One of the things that Johnny and I really wanted to do, and the issue that sparked the entire discussion of creating a new chapter, is a grass-roots movement to advertise Wikiversity and Wikibooks (these projects specifically, although others as well). We wanted to keep it local and very hands-on, which is why we originally had wanted it to be &quot;Wikimedia Philadelphia&quot;, instead of a state chapter. I live near philadelphia, and I'm not sure how familiar you are with PA geography, but the western portion of this state may as well be on a different planet some times. 
:What we want to do is hop in the car, go to some place or some group, and sit down with them to show them Wiki. We want to go to schools and talk to teachers. We want to go to Universities and talk to professors. We want students in college and even in highschool to be starting &quot;Wikimedia Clubs&quot;, campus-based organizations that would work with our chapter to perform &quot;charity&quot; editing on WMF projects. I know that highschool students especially are always looking for those extracurricular activites for their college applications, and WMF-related group may be just the thing to get many disenfranchised students active, and set them up for a better chance at college success.
:We also want to get in touch with local groups, to try and raise interest in writing books. An idea that we've been kicking around is to talk to locals like the Quakers, or even LGBT groups to write books about their particular movements. 
:And if you know anything about the Philadelphia-area school district on the news, you will know how much they would benefit from a free textbook alternative. If wikibooks became the &quot;official textbook supplier&quot; of the Philadelphia school district, it would be an amazing boon to our project.
:All of these things really require a hands-on approach. I need to be able to say &quot;Hello, I'm andrew, and I'm here on behalf of Wikimedia Philadelphia&quot;, because having that amount of officiality is going to help people to take us seriously. 
:Anyway, i'll stop wasting your talk space now. I'll let you know how things are going as they progress. There is a philadelphia wikimeetup coming up this month where we want to make an &quot;official announcement&quot;, and after that we are going to start spamming the foundation-l and wikimediaus-l lists to get some participants interested. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 12:43, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

:The beauty of using a single template for &quot;Programming languages&quot; is that we can alter the template to automagically move all the pages to a more appropriate category, if we need to. You are right that the Q subcategory is in need of heavy subdivision, and I am wondering if any of the other categories need it as well. The newly-revamped [[Wikibooks:CCO Resources]] page contains links to online LOC pages too, which should help us until we splurge the money to buy a copy (which we could probably ask the WMF to do, if needed). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:51, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

::It's almost enough to make us reconsider the idea of a proprietary &quot;wikibooks organization Number&quot; or something. I have to look through the staff lounge to see what it was called, but when you start comparing a free system to one that is either crippled or expensive...well it might be worth some kind of thought. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:44, 28 June 2007 (UTC)

== LOC: Category F ==

I replaced category F in the LOC template. Even though E and F are similar, they are different. E is for the history of the USA specifically, F is the history of the remainder of the americas, not including the USA. A small difference perhaps, but a difference nonetheless. Hope you don't mind. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:14, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

:What I would like to avoid is having a person type in {{tlx|LOC|F}} and get some kind of error when it is an acceptable code. I know that there are some books that are classified as F and some that are classified as E in the Temple University library, and i like to think that there is some kind of rationale to differentiate between the two. However, even if we keep strict separation in the LOC template, we don't have to enforce it strictly (especially if we have a very small number of E and F books). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:40, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::In the long term, I think a few people would like to use the categories to create better indices, not rely on the categories themselves as the only listing. If we use DPL, we could have a page like &quot;Subject:History&quot;, and use a DPL list to automatically include all books from E and F. Because of this, I don't really view the category pages as being the &quot;result&quot;, but meerly as a means to an end. If we could magically convince the developers to set us up with the newer version of DPL,  we could do all sorts of fancy magical things (Transclude lists from LOC/E, LOC/F, Shelf/History, DDC/900 together, etc.). 
::There was some discussion on staff lounge about creating a new &quot;Subject:&quot; namespace that we could use as a meta-organizational namespace to group together books into different logical arrangements. For instance, we could have a &quot;Subject:Programming Languages&quot; that would transclude the relevant LOC categories and the relevant bookshelves. We could also use even less traditional groupings such as &quot;Subject:Books that meet California curricula guidelines&quot;, or &quot;Subject:Books for Plumbers&quot;, etc. Instead of using categories directly, we could have a hierarchy of subject pages that automatically transclude category listings in a more aesthetic and useful manner. It's all a lot of wishful thinking at this point, but it really has gotten my attention at least. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:54, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

On a related note, I've taken a preliminary count of books according to LOC subject area, and posted the list on my blog. It should be visible on planet wikimedia within the hour or so (depending on how often it updates). After we get all the sub-categories complete and populated, I would like to get a more precise count and break down all our books by specific subject areas. Considering how much work we have left to do on the basic categorization still, this kind of project is still a long way off. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:44, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== Re:Damn the Torpedos! ==

It's a classic case of everybody having an opinion, but nobody wanting to actually do the work. too much management, and too few employees. And I knew this going in that foundation-l was going to bring more criticism and nitpickery then it would bring actual help. There comes a time when you just have to say &quot;it's not possible to make everybody happy, so we all just need to deal with this compromise&quot;.

I'm sure that mailinglist discussion was sparked by a recent blog post that I made on the planet about the muggles guide. I talked about how the community was excited about the new book, how we were preparing for the influx of new readers/writers, etc. Of course, this being the internet, some people need to jump directly to criticism. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:11, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

== Adminship Policy ==

The whole system of desysopping old administrators has been policy for about a year now (i dont know the exact dates of it), and in that time both affirmations and criticisms have been leveled against it. I am certainly in favor of the current policy, but I also feel that all controversial policies should be reviewed and reaffirmed regularly.

I tried starting a discussion about this issue at [[Wikibooks_talk:Administrators#Inactive_administrators|Wikibooks talk:Administrators]], in an attempt to give the opposition a good place to make an argument. The only critical comment we received was from [[User:Xania]], and his comments were more focused on ''where'' to discuss the issue, and not in discussing the issue itself. That conversation has since died out from lack of interest.

There is a well-publicized unstable version of the policy being formed at [[Wikibooks:Administrators/Unstable]]. This draft reflects a ''tightening'' of activity requirements on admins, not a reversal of it. Discussions on the talk page of that version have not even mentioned removing activity restrictions, but instead are discussing how much tighter those restrictions should be. Of course this draft only reflects a small portion of active users, but users who don't speak up can't possibly be heard.

The only real vocalizations I have heard against this policy have come from [[User:Xania]] and you, although I wont venture to guess what the general sentiment is among unvocalized users. I do believe that if the opposition effort was more organized and centered it's arguments on the relevant talk pages there would be a clearer result. The argument on RFA right now is about not desysopping on one side, and about holding the discussion in a better place on the other. It's apples and oranges, and no results either way are going to arise from it. 

Either way, I'm just giving you a heads-up. [[User:Withinfocus]] feels pretty strongly about not using [[WB:RFA]] as a discussion area for the administrators policy (I tend to agree with him), and it's unlikely that any discussion about it will be fruitful on that page. Maybe for everybody's benefit it would be a good idea to start a very centralized discussion about it at the staff lounge where everybody can participate? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:48, 9 August 2007 (UTC)

:I know this is late in getting back here, but here are a few thoughts.  My main concern here on this de-adminship policy is a perception with the idea that the current &quot;policy&quot; is set in stone and can't be changed.... as is true with any Wikibooks policy.  In particular this policy has so dramatically changed due to the insistance on what I claim is just a few vocal and active users, with the rest of Wikibooks users simply just going along for the ride.  I will agree that the 1 year desysopping policy is something that is more or less policy, but the way that [[User:Withinfocus]] took it upon himself to enforce this policy and invoking it in such a way to convince stewards to act, but giving essentially no time for commentary on the topic from any other Wikibookians is a precedent that I would not like to see on Wikibooks.  Particularly when the real precedent is to treat all desysopping of all users, even those whose &quot;terms&quot; have expired due to inactivity, has been traditionally something that has been open to discussion and something which took time to accomplish.  That did not happen with [[User:Karl Wick]], and I find that lamentable.  That was the real reason for my re-nomination as admin, and if Karl ever gets active on Wikibooks again I will make it nearly automatic to renominate him.  At least if he shows nearly any inkling of a thought of wanting the tools again.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:42, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

::Time in response is no big deal, this isn't an issue where changes are likely to happen fast, or where opinions are needed urgently. Wiki, like a democracy, really only functions when people make their opinions known. Even though we dont have a discrete voting apparatus, if people don't participate in discussions, they can't possibly influence the outcomes. That said, people who did participate at the time were overwhelmingly in favor of desysopping people after a long period of inactivity. I wont deny that there is more opposition to the policy (or at least more vocalization of opposition) now. One of the downsides to using a consensus-based decision making mechanism is that the status quo is maintained except when faced with overwhelming community desire to change. To that effect, the policy at wikibooks is likely to include at least some provision for the removal of inactive admins for a very long time to come, if not a tightening of it. Some opinions I have heard are calling for a reduction of inactive time to ''3 months'' before the user is nominated for desysopping. I consider that a little extreme, myself.
::There are a few reasons why Withinfocus trys so hard to keep the desysop proceedures devoid of conversation. First and foremost (and also the easiest to change) is the fact that the current admin policy says that desysop nominations for completely inactive admins do not require consensus to proceed. Any discussion then, if not required, is likely to be forgotten after the flag is removed and the discussion is lost in the archives. Another good point to consider is that the overwhelming number of opposing viewpoints cast in these discussions are against the policy, and not in favor of the particular admins. In other words, people stop talking about the candidates, and talk only about the process. And if we are going to do that, I think we should talk [[WB:ADMIN|on the page that outlines the process]], and not on the page where we're supposed to be discussing the candidates.
::I can understand your feelings about Karl, I even feel a certain sentimentality about him even though I never dealt with him personally in my time here. However, several people mentioned in the RfA that adminship really isn't a badge of honor, a point with which i fervently agree. I think that there are ways that we could honor members who have been helpful to this project but have since left, besides granting them tools and flags. Maybe, considering that many of the first few generations of Wikibookians have left by now and become inactive, we could start a &quot;user hall of fame&quot;, reserved for users who have been inactive for some time, but have a history of helping the project. Finding a fair and judicious way to induct users into this hall of fame might be tricky, but it would give us the opportunity to really express our gratitude for people who have left their marks. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:42, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

I left replies to your comments on both the arbitration archive page and the decision making talk page. Both replies are relatively lengthy, so I apologize for that. I won't get verbose here, but I really do feel like you're living in the past where the kinds of catastrophes that you mention are still able to happen. I just really think we (the royal &quot;we&quot;, both the english wikibooks project and the WMF board) are in a more stable situation where the kinds of problems from the past are less likely to happen. Anyway, I've made all my points and don't need to say anymore here. I know you are busy, so i'll try not to act either way on the addition to the decision making policy until you have time to come back, read the messages, and formulate a reply. For the sake of simplicy, would you mind trying to keep the discussion at [[Wikibooks talk:Decision making]]? If you would prefer not, that's okay too. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:32, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

== How's your german? ==

Hey rob, how is your german? We're trying to get the new logo discussions going on meta, and already there are criticisms that we haven't gotten the word out to enough non-english speakers. Derbeth is listed as de-2 also, and I asked him about doing a german translation but haven't heard a reply yet (it's only been a few minutes). de, es, pl, are the biggest projects after en, so i really want to hit them especially with an announcement. Johnny can read german, but I don't know if he can write it proficiently. I don't know off the top of my head who else speaks german around here. I also don't know anybody who knows spanish (except my brother, who I might need to hijack for this). Anyway, let me know, I would really appreciate it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:03, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

:My Portuguese is pretty good, and I can write a passable line of prose to get things going.  BTW, on de.wikibooks, many of those involved can read/write English, so a simple request for assistance on the equivalent of the Reading Room is likely to get a response. I can read German fairly well, and can make some replies if they are kept very simple.  I can also read/write some Spanish, but it is very broken and I tend to use far too many Portuguese words that native speakers find archaic even if technically correct.  I'll see if I can get some help with a German announcement.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:09, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

::I actually followed this suggestion last night, and was able to contact some people on de.wikibooks to make the announcement. You may want to check the german equivalent of the reading room, just to make sure that such an announcement actually got posted (and not just translated and forgotten). I posted a message on es.wikibooks (had some serious help from a translator and google translator), I think there is a message posted on pt.wikibooks, I contacted derbeth about pl.wikibooks, mike.lifeguard was going to handle fr.wikibooks, and I think somebody contacted ru.wikibooks as well. All in all, I would say we are pretty well advertised at this point. The only other wikibooks project in the top 10 (according to alexa) that we haven't contacted is arabic wikibooks, and for the life of me I haven't been able to find an arabic speaker. Alexa claims that ar.wikibooks only accounts for 4% of all wikibooks traffic, so that might be a casualty that we have to accept.

== Thanks ==

Hi Rob, Thanks for your participation on the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Categories|categories]] discussion. I also have a question if you have another few minutes. For a newbee, it seems like the &quot;old&quot; leadership of the project is gone and that a few relatively new admins are taking a lot of space within the project (possibly just to fill the gap). If that is true, does the &quot;older&quot; team left because it concluded that the project was not worth it or would not &quot;lift up&quot;? You can answer here or send me an e-mail if you prefer. --&amp;nbsp;[[User:Jacques Bergeron|Jacques]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Jacques_Bergeron|talk]])&amp;nbsp;([[Special:Emailuser/Jacques Bergeron|email]]) 22:59, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

:Ouch!  This is a tough and loaded question.  I'll try to elaborate on an extended e-mail discussion about this topic if you are interested, but there are many factors that have gone into how there have been several generations of project leadership with Wikibooks.  [[User:Whiteknight]] certainly has taken on a strong role at the moment and leading discussions on a number of key topics... although I should point out that [[User:Karl Wick]] is not completely gone from the project either.

:More to the point, most of us who have participated with the development of Wikibooks have real lives and often we just can't spend nearly so much time obsessed with a major project like Wikibooks for such a prolonged period of time.  I do go into manic spurts where I get back into participating with Wikibooks and even get into the troll fighting and content cleanup, but at the moment my interests have called me off to a few other places.

:My love of the basic idea behind Wikibooks is still here, however, and I love the idea of a collaboratively written e-book.  I guess the real point is that writing a book, especially a good high-quality book, is a very hard task.  It was pointed out to me by a very well seasoned professional writer (I think it was Ray Bradbury.... but I may just be making something up here based on faulty memories) that the number of professional writers is basically the number of people who have the internal fortitude to put up with the publishing industry and get something written in the first place.  He quoted all of the barriers that there are to authors on the road from a cool idea for a book until it gets in the hands of a reader in a typical bookstore, and went over some numbers in the process.  As I don't want to misquote this, I'll basically jump to the conclusion:  That the reason we have as many professional writers in the commercial publishing industry is mainly a function of those who are willing to do the job and plow through the BS to get there in the first place.  Failed writers are basically those who haven't really tried in the first place.

:I'll have to say this is more or less the same for adminship of most Wikimedia projects, and in particular for Wikibooks.  In fact, Wikimedia projects seem to be much more friendly and encouraging of new talent than say the commercial book publishing industry, or worse yet the commercial music industry (don't get me started there!)  But this is very hard work, and quite often a very thankless job.

:Wikibooks is also tilting at windmills here in a number of ways, and to progress Wikibooks to the next level beyond just a simple website for writing professionally looking blogs (perhaps I'm being too harsh on Wikibooks here or over simplifying the analogy) is going to be hard, very hard.  Especially if Wikibooks content is going to be treated seriously in the commercial book publishing realm.  We are also hitting the point that we need some very real money in order to make some progress here, and it appears that the Wikimedia Foundation is in many ways thwarting our efforts to continue.  I can go into specifics here, including some really bizarre responses by the WMF board for accomplishing some tasks that have been done by Wikibooks users.  The point here is that even those whom I would have normally looked upon as allies in trying to move beyond the current state of Wikibooks have in fact added additional barriers and jettisoned major groups of participants.  Many of those involved with the &quot;old leadership&quot; left with those other groups of users, I might add as well.

:There has been a need for the Wikibooks community to heal, and I think some of the healing has already taken place.  [[Wikiversity]] has moved on and become a very successful independent community of its own, and other Wikibooks spin-off groups have also done well.  I have voiced my opinion of the &quot;textbook only&quot; philosophy that has pervaded Wikibooks (I'm not completely supportive of the idea), but I can live with the current state of the project and try to find the positive good that can still happen here rather than try to dwell on the problems.  I've been trying on my own to seek other ways to help further the overall goals of the Wikibooks community in my own way, and I also am generally supportive of others who have done their part as well.

:BTW, I hope that you get to love the Wikibooks community as much as I have.  We are not nearly so bureaucratic as Wikipedia tends to be, and keep in mind that action happens here on Wikibooks on much longer time scales than does happen on Wikipedia.  I think in the long run (50 years+) Wikibooks will be a much more significant project than Wikipedia, but perhaps this is only a pipe dream of mine.  It is different environment, and it will take somebody willing to take a longer-term view of life to see things happening.  I also wouldn't count out the old tyme leadership of Wikibooks either, as there is also a strong tendency for the old timers to keep coming back for more punishment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:36, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

::I do not know wikibooks but I was elected, long ago, to be coordonnator of a major student body in Canada. It was a very strong organisation even though &quot;we just could not spend nearly so much time obsessed with a major project like xxxxxx for such a prolonged period of time&quot;. In fact the leadership there changed every year. The organization was strong because it had both:
::* A very active &quot;current&quot; leadership
::* A very strong sense of history, embodied in a bunch of part time &quot;older&quot; poeple that were very supportive of the &quot;current&quot; leadership and could, once in a while, point out that &quot;some things have been tried before&quot;.
::Now I try to evaluate if wikibooks is a viable long term effort because I obviously don't want to waste my time (I've past that age). I certainly see an active current leadership. Mike, Andrew and darklama where very supportive right from the start and I have no doubt that they try their best to advance the project. I fully respect their contribution and for exactly the same reasons I fully respect the contibution you did a while ago.
::On the other hand the &quot;sense of history&quot; and the &quot;older contributors&quot; are just not there, in my newbee point of view. There were even some very harsh exchanges, some still on your talk page, that look more like a putch then an orderly evolution.
::This is by no mean a criticism, but if you combine that with the fact that the stats do not show a clear progression of the project (the database alright but not the project) someone can be prone to ask &quot;tough and loaded questions&quot;.

::That said I am very open to any insigth you can give me (or any other wikibookian btw) on the project and its history. I leave it to you as for the mean of communication. 
::In the mean time I will continue my slow and steady work on the categorization issue. I think your can help a lot because the problem will be with the identification and clean-up of the &quot;older books&quot; since the naming policy makes the job much easier for newer books.

== RFC for a book ==

Hi Robert, when you have a few minutes, could you take a look at [[.NET Development Foundation]] and its talk page. This is an old book that I have been working on for the past month and a half. Initially the content was spread over more then 150 pages that where for the most part &quot;link only pages&quot;. I consolidated all the content, changed the section name, begun putting structured content in the &quot;topics&quot; sections, etc. Now I am developing navigational templates and continuing to add content.

Since I would like that book &quot;to progress to the next level beyond just a simple website for writing professionally looking blogs&quot; I would really love to have pointers on what to do next. Since I know nothing about textbook editing I am essentially putting in place suggestions made by others (see talk page). I think you can really give me a hand on this one.

I was over there with little inactivity from about July 2006 to about September/October 2007 and I was ''never'' attacked for a non-Latin user name (I am Laleena over there, and that is a Turkish name). Could be that it was against things with characters like Ł,Đ,α, et cetera, but I'm not too sure. Could you check? Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 01:41, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

== My closing of [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/General]] VfD ==

:::I never said that this '''topic''' could never be presented as NPOV. I merely said that what is written here is never going to reach that point, regardless of how you massage the text. I'm a little disappointed that you closed the discussion when you clearly were taking sides in the argument, but I'll leave it as it is. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:13, 20 June 2008 (UTC)
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;The preceding [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/Drugs:Fact_and_Fiction/General&amp;curid=161873&amp;diff=1215587&amp;oldid=1215552 Comment] was copied from [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Drugs:Fact and Fiction/General]]&lt;/span&gt;

Dear Robert Horning,

I'm sorry you were disappointed in my closing of the VfD. I don't see, however, how my closing was in any way controversial. The majority of participants in this discussion disagreed with the assertion that the content couldn't be made into a good wikibook and found it to fall under the scope of the project. The rest of the arguments against the book (that it was &quot;irrisponsible&quot; and hadn't been fixed yet) weren't shown to derive from policy.

If you'd like to reopen this discussion, I'd be happy to oblige. Otherwise, would you allow me to remove your comment from the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Drugs:Fact and Fiction/General]] archive. I believe that closing a VfD closing closes the discussion. I already removed a keep comment but hesitated to remove you since it might give off the wrong impression.

I have no interest in cutting valuable discussion short, and would be unhappy if anyone thought I didn't value input that I disagreed with. Quite the contrary.

Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
Martin [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 05:01, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

:My only issue here is that by closing the VfD with the &quot;resolution&quot; of the issue to have the outcome you have advocated for, it gives the appearance of strong-arming the outcome by an administrator.

:At best, all I can say is that there was no clear consensus on deletion of this content.  

:As for if an assertion comes from policy or not.... I would have to point out that a great many policies have their origins in one form or another from the Votes for Deletion pages in the first place.  It has often been used in the past to illustrate a specific issue that perhaps policy hasn't covered yet as an official policy but perhaps that policy ought to be created.  Certainly there is a &quot;policy&quot; that was put forward by Jimbo Wales that some content simply is so offensive that it has no place on Wikibooks.... where Jimbo even decided to unilaterally delete content without even putting it up for a vote.  While I don't know if this page under discussion would pass the Jimbo test, its deletion certainly is in keeping with other content that has been deleted from Wikibooks in the past.

:Generally speaking, Wikibooks gives quite a bit of latitude to new contributors.  I think this is a good thing, but the policies haven't really addressed what happens when those new contributions become old contributions.  IMHO the standard ought to be considerably more stringent in terms of what is allowed on this project, and I still say that this page about drugs is in the long run harmful to the project. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 17:50, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

:: I understand your point about &quot;the appearance of strong-arming the outcome&quot; but feel that the surrounding discussion discussion shows that I was not manipulating anything. With a strong bias towards deleting the module my closing would certainly have been controversial. In reality, however, the majority of those weighing in didn't accept the arguments for deletion and something drastic would have had to happen to convice the community to change its stance. Without a consensus to delete, I saw no problem with closing as &quot;keep&quot;.

:: If you still feel I acted improperly or would like to continue the discussion, I have no problem with re-opening it. I recognise that you may feel a little betrayed and would gladly like to earn your trust. If you're fine with keeping it closed, I'd like to ask for your consent to remove your last comment from the archived page. As I said before, it would be mainly for the sake of formality, not any form of censorship or strong-arming.

:: On the topic of policies; I don't see how the historic factor that policies derive from VfD discussions somehow places these discussions above our policies. Quite the contrary, I'd argue that these are evidence that policies were seen as necessary to provide some consistency to community decisions. When issues not covered by policy are discussed, I would personally advocate for beginning with the policy and then applying it once ratified.

:: I agree that some modules are poor and will not be fixed for some time. I don't, however, see that as a great problem. I'd tend to agree with the [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy]] which [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy#What_to_keep.2C_what_to_delete|recommends]] that &quot;modules that need heavy editing&quot; be kept and listed on [[Wikibooks:Pages needing attention]]. I guess we could do this better with a nice template that mentioned that the book/module was considered to need special attention to bring it up to standard and adding pages to a category from where one could monitor these. How would that be as a compromise? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:18, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

== Help with transmitting data with a laser using rs-232 ==

Hello Robert Horning!

My name is Julius Lundh and me and my friend Oscar Olsson are two Swedish students who are currently reading your wikibook [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Serial_Programming Serial Programming] due to a project we are working with. Your book has really made an impression and therefor we would appreciate your help, even if you do not have the time to help us very much.

We are trying to write a program that will help us to contact the serial port and from there we will connect it with a laser that will send data to a solar cell. The solar cell will receive this data and send it to another computer's serial port and our program will read and receive this data. 

We where wondering if this interests you at least a little bit, because we could really need your help on a distance of course. If you are interested you can contact me on my e-mail juliuslundh@gmail.com and we can tell you a little bit more and when we have finished reading your wikibook we can start to discuss what is needed to be done.

Thank you very much

Julius Lundh &amp; Oscar Olsson


ps. Excuse my lousy English

We have now finished your wikibook. So if you are interested, please contact us.

== Politics ==

Hey, you mentioned some controversial parts of [[WB:WIW]] and I was wondering if you could fill me in on the history from your prospective.  I am probably a fan of the more restrictive point of view, but I am also always interested in understanding the history of our project a bit better.  Also, it is always nice to learn from someone more experienced from myself.

{{recipe}}

'''Peanut Butter Cookies''' are one of the most popular kinds of cookies. 

== Ingredients ==

[[Image:2006-June-26-Peanut-Butter-Cookies-Cooked.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Peanut butter cookies from the alternate recipe, made with chunky peanut butter.]]

* 1/2 cup (120ml) of [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* 1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]], melted
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]]
* 1 1/4 (300ml) cup of [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda

== Procedure ==

# Start by preheating oven to {{#invoke:temperature|f|355}}.
# Cream together sugars, melted butter, egg, and vanilla until creamy and smooth. If you're low on brown sugar, seek tip section below.
# Combine flour, peanut butter, salt, and baking soda in the mixture from step 2.
# After mixture is complete, flatten small pieces into cookie shapes with a fork and place on ungreased cooking pan at least 2 inches apart.
# Bake in oven for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown.
# Pull out of oven and allow to cool.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* If low on brown sugar, combine white sugar and 1 tablespoon of molasses together.
* To give a sparkly look, dip cookie in step 4 on a small saucer sprinkled with sugar.
* Smooth peanut butter works much better than chunky.
* To flatten with a fork, press the tines of the fork across the cookie and then repeat going in the other direction to give a criss-cross pattern.
* For the alternate recipe (see below), you can use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

== Alternate Recipe ==

[[Image:2006-June-26-Peanut-Butter-Cookies-Uncooked.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In the process of being flattened by fork.]]

This recipe has no egg or baking soda, and uses vegetable oil instead of butter / margarine; it adds honey.

===Ingredients:===

* 1/2 (120ml)cup peanut butter
* 1/4 (60ml)cup [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:oil|Vegetable Oil]] (see tip above)
* 1/4 cup brown sugar (or white sugar and molasses, as above)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 1/4 (300ml) cup whole wheat pastry flour (other flours likely work fine)

===Procedure:===

# Preheat oven to 375ºF
# Cream all ingredients except flour together.
# Add flour and mix sparingly (should be dry enough to form into balls by hand without sticking).
# Form into walnut-sized balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet.
# Flatten with fork (see tip above).
# Bake for about 8-10 minutes.

A double recipe makes about seventy 1 1/2&quot; cookies.

==Ongoing Trials==
*'''[[Radiation Oncology/RTOG Trials/0126|RTOG 01-26]]''' -- ''A Phase III Randomized Study of High Dose 3D-CRT/IMRT vs. Standard Dose 3D-CRT/IMRT in Patients Treated for Localized Prostate Cance''

==Outcomes - Toxicity==
Toxicity appears to be comparable or better to 3D-CRT, at higher doses

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 18164858 -- ''Ultra-High Dose (86.4 Gy) IMRT for Localized Prostate Cancer: Toxicity and Biochemical Outcomes.'' ('''2008 Cahlon O''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Jun 1;71(2):330-7.)
**478 pts (50 as part of dose-escalation trial), retrospective. 86.4 Gy / 48 fx / 180 cGy. Planning: prescribed dose 86.4 Gy to PTV covers 87% of PTV; 95% of PTV covered by 83.1 Gy (96%); Dmax 110% of prescription dose. PTV = P + SV + 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.6&amp;nbsp;cm at prostate-rectum interface). Rectum max dose limited to 99%=85.5 Gy. No image guidance used (weekly port films only).
**Median f/u 53 mo. Acute GU toxicity: 59% Gr 1, 22% Gr 2, &lt;1% Gr 3. Acute GI toxicity: 34% Gr 1, 8% Gr 2, no Gr 3+. Late GU: 16% Gr 1, 13% Gr 2, &lt;3% Gr 3. Late GI: 13% Gr 1, 3% Gr 2, 0.4% Gr 3.
**5-yr PSA relapse free survival: 99% low risk, 79% int risk, 72% high risk - original ASTRO definition (vs 98%,85%,70% for Phoenix def)
**Conclusion: ultra-high dose RT for prostate cancer is well-tolerated

*'''William Beaumont''' PMID 15667959 -- ''A dose-escalation trial with the adaptive radiotherapy process as a delivery system in localized prostate cancer: analysis of chronic toxicity.'' ('''2005 Brabbins D''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.)
**3 dose groups: 70.2-72 Gy, &gt;72-75.6 Gy, and &gt;75.6-79.2 Gy
**Constraints: &lt;5% of the rectal wall has a dose &gt;82 Gy, &lt;30% of the rectal wall has a dose &gt;75.6 Gy, &lt;50% of the bladder volume has a dose &gt;75.6 Gy, and the maximum bladder dose is 85 Gy.
**280 patients, mean follow-up 29 months
**Toxicity at the high dose level was not different from toxicity at the intermediate or lower dose levels. No significant difference was observed in any of the individual toxicity categories.

*'''MDACC''' PMID 15990025 -- ''The calculated risk of fatal secondary malignancies from intensity-modulated radiation therapy.'' ('''2005 Kry SF''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.)
**IMRT required 3.5-4.9 times as many monitor units as did the conventional treatment
**Maximum risk of fatal second malignancy was 1.7% for conventional radiation, 2.1% for IMRT using 10-MV X-rays, and 5.1% for IMRT using 18-MV X-rays.

*'''Centre Alexis-Vautrin''' PMID 15679257 -- ''Preliminary results of the assessment of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostatic and head and neck tumors (STIC 2001)'' ('''2004 Marchal C''', Cancer Radiother.)
**88 patients (39 3D-CRT and 49 IMRT) with a mean dose of 78 Gy at the ICRU point at 2 Gy/fx; mean follow-up 11.5 months
**Clinical study: Acute reactions do not show any difference between groups, but we want to point out the short follow-up and the relatively high dose delivered to cancers of the prostate.
**Physics study: IMRT is technically feasible in good clinical conditions with high quality assurance, a good reproducibility and precision.
**Cost study: The direct costs of &quot;routine&quot; treatments for the prostatic cancers were 4911 euros for IMRT versus 2357 for 3D-CRT.

*'''Ghent University Hospital''' PMID 15465194 -- ''Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.'' ('''2004 De Meerleer G''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.)
**114 patients, follow-up unclear
**GI toxicity: None 34%, Grade 1 39%, Grade 2 27%, no Grade 3
**GU toxicity: None 10%, Grade 1 47%, Grade 2 36%, Grade 3 7%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Anatomy-based IMRT to treat prostate cancer is incorporated into our daily routine without any problem. Acute toxicity is very low. Most of the recorded symptoms decrease over time, except for GI urgency and incontinence.

*'''Val-d'Aurelle-Paul-Lamarque''' PMID 15063872 -- ''Pilot study of conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer'' ('''2004 Ailleres N''', Cancer Radiother.)
**16 patients treated to 78Gy, follow-up unclear
**95% of PTV1 received 5 Gy more using IMRT (compared to theoretical 3D-CRT) with protection of the bladder and the rectum walls.
**GI toxicity: Grade 2 25%, no Grade 3
**GU toxicity: Grade 2 31%, no Grade 3
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Dose escalation with IMRT is feasible with no grade 3 or higher acute GI or GU toxicity. Examination of a larger cohort and longer-term follow-up are warranted in the future.&quot;

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 12128109 -- ''High-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: early toxicity and biochemical outcome in 772 patients.''' ('''2002 Zelefsky MJ''', Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys.)
**772 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with IMRT (698 patients (90%) treated to 81.0 Gy, and 74 patients (10%) treated to 86.4 Gy); median follow-up 24 months
**3-year actuarial rectal Grade 2+ toxicity: 4%
**3-year actuarial urinary Grade 2+ toxicity: 15%
**3-year actuarial PSA FFS: 92% favorable, 86% intermediate, 81% unfavorable
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;These data demonstrate the feasibility of high-dose IMRT in a large number of patients. Acute and late rectal toxicities seem to be significantly reduced compared with what has been observed with conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy techniques. Short-term PSA control rates seem to be at least comparable to those achieved with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at similar dose levels. Based on this favorable risk:benefit ratio, IMRT has become the standard mode of conformal treatment delivery for localized prostate cancer at our institution.&quot;

*'''MSKCC''' PMID 10869739 -- ''Clinical experience with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in prostate cancer.'' ('''2000 Zelefsky MJ''', Radiother Oncol.)
**132 patients with T1c- T3 (61 with 3D-CRT and 171 with IMRT) treated to a prescribed dose of 81 Gy
**IMRT improved the coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV) by the prescription dose and reduced the volumes of the rectal and bladder walls carried to high dose levels (P&lt;0.01)
**2-year actuarial risk of grade 2 rectal bleeding was 2% for IMRT and 10% for conventional 3D-CRT (P&lt;0.001)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The data demonstrate the feasibility and safety of high-dose IMRT for patients with localized prostate cancer and provide a proof-of-principle that this method improves dose conformality relative to tumor coverage and exposure to normal tissues.&quot;

==Dosimetry==
*PMID 15922172 -- '''IMRT versus conventional 3DCRT on prostate and normal tissue dosimetry using an endorectal balloon for prostate immobilization.''' (Vlachaki MT, Med Dosim. 2005)
**Insignificant differences in tumor control probability (TCP) values between IMRT and 3DCRT were calculated for prostate (p = 0.320) and seminal vesicles (p = 0.289).
**Compared to 3DCRT, IMRT resulted in significantly reduced normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) only for upper rectum (p = 0.025) and femurs (p = 0.021).
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;IMRT achieves superior normal tissue avoidance, especially for rectum and femurs compared to 3DCRT, with comparable target dose escalation.&quot;

*'''MSKCC''' - PMID 15913914 -- '''Whole pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer using 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy.''' (Ashman JB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**Sequential IMRT plans: 45 Gy to pelvic LN, then boost to prostate / SVs (75.6-81 Gy).
**Bowel: 3D-CRT resulted in 40% relative reduction ( p &lt; 0.001) in the volume of bowel receiving 45 Gy compared with 2D, and IMRT provided a further 60% reduction relative to 3D-CRT (p &lt; 0.001).
**Rectum: IMRT reduced the volume of rectum receiving 45 Gy by 90% (p &lt; 0.001) compared with either 2D or 3D-CRT
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Compared to conventional 2D planning, conformal planning for WPRT resulted in significant reductions in the doses delivered to the bowel, rectum, and bladder. IMRT was superior to 3D-CRT in limiting the volume of bowel and rectum within high-dose regions. These dosimetric findings correlated with low rates of acute and late GI morbidity.&quot;

*PMID 15010385 -- '''Sparing of the penile bulb and proximal penile structures with intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.''' (Kao J, Br J Radiol. 2004)
**10 consecutive patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer were planned with IMRT to dose of 74 Gy without specifically constraining the plans to spare the penile bulb.
** IMRT reduced the mean penile bulb doses compared with 3D-CRT (33.2 Gy vs 48.9 Gy, p&lt;0.001), the percentage of penile bulb receiving over 40 Gy (37.7% vs 67.2%, p&lt;0.001) and the dose received by &gt;95% of penile bulb (5.3 Gy vs 11.7 Gy, p=0.003). Maximum penile bulb doses were higher with IMRT (81.2 Gy vs 73.1 Gy, p&lt;0.001) although the volume of this high dose region was small.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;IMRT may potentially reduce long term sexual morbidity by reducing the dose to the majority of the penile bulb.&quot;

==Pelvic nodal IMRT==

**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This is the largest series in the literature thus far that quantitatively assesses radial extracapsular extension.

How does one read the alphabets without the vowel markers?



::I am a native speaker of Hebrew. I explain the problem:

#Children/Adults (foreigens) that want to learn Hebrew, need to learn with vowels.
#Children that Hebrew is their native language normally used vowels.
#Most of the &quot;Adults&quot; (usually from the age of 10) stop to use vowels, and able to read Hebrew text without any vowels.

Therefore, in this book, the author always needs to add vowels.

But if someone become accustomed read without vowels, for him this is not a problem to read without them.

Hey. I don't actually speak much (really any) Italian but at the moment for a major Romance language the Italian Wikibook looks rather like the odd one out amongst the language books, so if anyone is still working on this book, would you mind if I changed the look of the book so we can get some more similiarities between books? (still using the content that you guys have already created, which is great). THis doesn't mean Italian Wikibook has to use the exact same layout as German, French, Spanish etc...(which are all different anyway) because it all depends on content - but breaking up the text into subpages would probably help. Cheers - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 09:01, July 26, 2005 (UTC)

I loved the first half of what's available of the book and it helped me a lot, but after that it seems to be still more or less devoid of real teaching content. I don't want to sound pedantic about this and I appreciate a lot what's already there and written, because it's very good and helpful, but I also know that there are loads of things you can forget writing these kinds of texts and details you have to include for foreign speakers etc. etc., so here's a small list of wishes and improvements:

* generally include translations for every word not translated in a text before. This is especially true for the &quot;irregular verbs&quot; section which is without any, at the moment, and thus useless for a learner. Learning translations gradually while reading and applying is much easier than hammering them in later with vocabulary lists, so this is quite important.
* properly describe the composite construction of verbs. The current instruction saying &quot;Using with have and is will put into past tense&quot; is far, far from enough, seeing as those auxiliary verbs have their own declinations and can't be applied at all without knowledge of which tempi the two verbs would be in for a composite case.
* include a description and or sub-chapter about the use of the ''Congiuntivo'' in Italian - this form sees many uses across languages and can't really be used or understood without
* sections on indefinite articles, question words
* extend the vocabulary section with:
** a slightly more detailed section on counting
** many common phrases and questions, like &quot;Where can I find a youth hostel?&quot;, &quot;How much is that?&quot;, &quot;Ok/Understood&quot;, &quot;Is that correct?&quot; &quot;...
** many basic verbs, like go, find, like, search, see, learn...
** times, dates, seasons
* include the basics about further grammar details that would come confusing if seen on a trip, like comparative/augmentative/pejorative forms of adjectives

Surely you can always find more work and refinement to do, but this is what sprung to my mind when I read this book and later switched to another, more detailed resource.
[[User:Kohlenfresser|Kohlenfresser]] 08:58, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

== Exactly ==

Good points have been brought up, but it seems no one with a good understanding of Italian has stepped up to start improving this book, so I'll start work on that now, starting with the sadly lacking verb section, and then moving on to the rest of the grammar section. Eventually, we can maybe add lessons.

-- The topics in the current set of lessons repeat a lot, conjugation of ''essere'' is done in three of them; please cover more topics extensively, community will eventually refine them /&lt;M&gt;/</text>

I see that you added [[User:60.228.84.48]] to [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]]. As far as I can see, that user has made only two edits to [[World History/Age of Discovery &amp; Imperialism]], that doesn't really constitute a sustained attack, so doesn't really need to be reported. See [[Wikibooks:Dealing with vandalism]] for how to deal with newbie experiments like that. You did the right thing in reverting the damage. I have warned them, and I have added the page to my watch list, so I'll help by fixing any further damage when I see it. PS: I suspect that all of the 60.228.84.XX IP addresses belong to computers in the same classroom in a school somewhere.

== HTBAEWTAL ==

Thanks for your comments on my talk page. Whilst one might get the idea that the wikibook is a personal project (since I did much of the work to start it out), it certainly isn't meant to be. This wikibook needs high visibility, and to send it off ot my user page would just obscure it and make it inaccessable by most users. I don't know everything that makes a good wikibook on foreign languages, so I want as much feedback and help in making this a comprehensive guide to make excellent wikibooks for foreign languages.

I speak English as my native language, but I am also learning Hebrew and hope to learn Japanese as well. I may even learn Spanish (out of necessity; I live in Texas). I was actually driven to make this wikibook after looking at the status of the Japanese wikibook and finding it difficult to follow it in many situations. I decided that what they and others needed was a set of guidelines to give them an idea of how to improve and plan out their book. I didn't want to limit the guidelines to just the Japanese wikibook, I wanted all the foreign language wikibooks to benefit from the guidelines.

Whilst I won't be able to help build content for most foreign language wikibooks at the moment, I can surely continue building the guidelines help you and other wikibookians make excellent wikibooks! --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 14:25, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Additional personal suffixes */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Personal suffixes and name usage ==
When addressing other persons, one should always be aware of three things: the status (in the social hierarchy) of the person one is addressing, the difference between one's own status and the listener's status, and one's degree of familiarity with that person. Depending on this information one chooses a particular way of addressing the other person.

In Japanese, personal suffixes are used for expressing the speaker's honor, respect or friendship. Sometimes titles or professions may also be used as a suffix.

Please note that to say &quot;you&quot; in Japan when addressing someone is quite rude, sometimes even offensive. That's why this is one of the first topics in this course, so every student, who has just started to learn Japanese, will not offend anyone by mistake.

The most common way of addressing is by surname with an appropriate personal suffix. Japanese people always put their family names before their given names when both should be told (for example, when introducing themselves or writing letters). Unlike Western society where it is common to address people by their given names, in Japanese society even friends may not know each others' given names, and even if they do know, it is not common to use given names very much except between very close friends. Note that the term &quot;given name&quot; is used where in Western languages the term &quot;first name&quot; would normally be used.

Close friends may address each other using given names or nicknames (for example, a given or family name shortened to one to two first syllables). Appropriate personal suffixes may or may not be added to the end of these names. Addressing one without a personal suffix indicates an almost family-like level of friendship.

Another way to address a person is by title or profession, sometimes appended with an appropriate personal suffix. Yet again, addressing a person this way is more polite than saying &quot;you&quot;.

One more note: never ever use any personal suffix when referring to yourself in a conversation. Titles and suffixes are used to indicate honor and respect, and it is inappropriate for you to honor yourself this way.

== Popular personal suffixes ==
;～さん
:～さん is the most universal and commonly used suffix. May be used in every situation, even when just meeting or greeting someone. Romanized as San.

;～さま (様)
:～さま is more honorable than ～さん, it emphasizes the fact that the speaker is (or wants to express that he/she is) '''far''' below the addressed person's social status. This is the common way to address clients/customers (for example, at stores and markets), and it is also sometimes used for one's parents. Other popular uses are to indicate extremely deep respect and honor to the person addressed, or to express that the speaker is a servant (in more like the medieval meaning of this word) of the person addressed. It is also universally used after the name of the addressee when writing an address on an envelope. Romanized as Sama.

;～ちゃん
:～ちゃん is typically used after girls' names, but is also used for small children of either sex. Among adults, it may be used between close friends. It is commonly regarded as a &quot;girly&quot; suffix (used when speaking to, or among girls), but it is sometimes used to address boyfriends or other boys or adult men, so perhaps a more correct translation would be &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;little&quot;. Pets are frequently referred to using this diminutive as well. ～ちゃん often indicates a certain fondness. Romanized as Chan.

;～くん (君)
:～くん is typically used after a boy's name, but may occasionally be used after a girl's. It is also sometimes used when referring to males of equal or lower status than oneself (for example, when a boss speaks to a subordinate, or a professor speaks to a student). Schoolteachers typically address male students using ～くん, while female students are addressed with ～ちゃん until they enter junior high school, at which point they are addressed as ～さん. ～くん is also used among friends of similar social standing, and by parents and relatives to address older male children (instead of ～ちゃん). ～くん often indicates a certain fondness. Romanized as Kun.

;～せんせい (先生)
:used to refer to teachers, doctors, or ''smarter'' (older) people. Also you can just shout to an older person, ''sensei!'' instead of using a name.

;～せんぱい (先輩)
:Used to address senior (usually elder) students or coworkers, that have the same status as the speaker. Romanized as Senpai.

== Additional personal suffixes ==
;～どの (殿)
:Nowadays mostly used in letters. It is also seen on drug prespcriptions, certificates and awards, and in written correspondence in tea ceremonies. Romanized as dono/tono.

;～うえ (上)
:うえ literally means &quot;above&quot; and, appropriately, denotes a high level of respect. Old-fashioned and not widely used anymore. It can be used to address parents or older siblings, instead of using ～さま. Romanized as ue.

;～し (氏)
:A neutral honorific. Used in some situations where, for whatever reason, the writer feels ～さん is inappropriate. It is preferred in legal documents, academic journals, and certain other formal written styles. It is fairly common in the news. Once a person's name has been used with ～し, the person can be referred to with し alone, without the name, as long as there is only one person being referred to. Romanized as Shi.

;～かっか (閣下)
:&quot;Your Excellency&quot;, used for ambassadors and some heads of state. Romanized as Kakka.

;～でんか (殿下)
:Affixed to the end of a royal title, with a meaning roughly equivalent to &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. It is used for royal family members. Romanized as Denka.

;～へいか (陛下)
:Affixed to the end of a royal title, with a meaning roughly equivalent to &quot;Majesty&quot;. It is used for the King and Queen (or Emperor and Empress). へいか by itself can also be used as a direct term of address (&quot;Your Majesty&quot;). Romanized as Heika.

== Examples ==
Standard salutation: surname with ~さん:
: ほんださん - Mr/Mrs/Ms Honda

Title only:
: しゃちょう (社長) - President (of a company)

Name and profession:
:たかはしせんしゅ (高橋選手) - Athlete Takahashi (gold medal in the women's marathon in the 2000 Olympics)

Profession and honorific:
:こうちょうせんせい (校長先生) - The principal/headmaster

==Monoploy rule clarification==

From http://boardgames.about.com/library/faqs/bl-faq-monopoly-buildevenly.htm 
:''&quot;I own all properties of one color. Can I build three houses on one property and none on another? No. In Monopoly, players must build evenly. That means that you cannot have more than one house worth of difference between any two properties of a particular color. If you own all of a three-property color set, you must build one house on every property before adding a second house to any of them. '''Before you can build a hotel, you must have four houses on all the properties of the color you wish to build on.'''&quot;''

::I was playing Monopoly last night and we had a disagreement about the interpretation of this rule and specifically the last sentence. My interpretation is that you cannot go from an undeveloped street to hotels on all of the properties in a single turn, you must spend at least one turn with four houses on all of the properties. But my opponent contended that it simply means that you must have 4 houses paid for on all of the properties before you buld a hotel and that you can do this in a single turn, jumping from an undeveloped set of properties to hotels on all without actually getting the green houses out of the box. Who is correct? [[User:Jooler|Jooler]] 10:54, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:::The [[Official rules of Monopoly|official rules]] state:
::::''A hotel may be built on a color group only after all properties in the group have four houses. A player purchases a hotel by paying the price of an additional house, and returning the four houses on that property to the bank in exchange for a hotel. If there are not enough houses in the bank for a player to build four houses on each property before building a hotel, the player may not skip directly to buying a hotel by paying the full price at one go.''
:::The rules do not mention that you need to wait a whole turn, you just can't go directly from no houses to hotels, even by paying enough - you just need to first pay to get 4 houses on each property, after which you can then pay for hotels. (There is no rule that the building process cannot be split into several parts during a turn.) --[[User:Pidgeot|Pidgeot]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Pidgeot|(t)]] [[Special:Contributions/Pidgeot|(c)]] [[Special:Emailuser/Pidgeot|(e)]]&lt;/small&gt; 13:49, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't know about the official rules, but everyone I've ever played with interpret the rule to mean that you can go from no houses to a hotel in a single turn by paying enough. &amp;mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|&lt;FONT COLOR=#808080&gt;Talk&lt;/FONT&gt;]] 14:22, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::::That is typically a house rule. If playing &quot;by the book&quot;, you can only do that if the bank has enough houses that it could be split up (8 or 12, depending on which properties we're dealing with). --[[User:Pidgeot|Pidgeot]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Pidgeot|(t)]] [[Special:Contributions/Pidgeot|(c)]] [[Special:Emailuser/Pidgeot|(e)]]&lt;/small&gt; 20:14, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Keep a workbook of notes and measurements, so that you can track back specifics 
*Extra space at bottom of frame, unless frame re-use needed.
*Always measure off the frame

[[Image:Framing_calculations_template.png|Diagram showing coloured areas for art (red), matting (green), and frame (blue).]]

Matt width - 5cm.

The calculations are in centimeters.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!            !! Width      !! Height  !!
|-
| Artwork || &lt;ArtWidth&gt; || &lt;ArtHeight&gt; ||
|-
| Inner edge (red) || &lt;ArtWidth&gt; '''- 1''' ||  &lt;ArtHeight&gt; '''- 1''' || Need overlap to keep picture in place
|-
| Matt size (green) || &lt;ArtWidth&gt;-1 '''+ (2*&lt;MattWidth&gt;)''' || &lt;ArtHeight&gt;-1 '''+ (2*&lt;MattHeight&gt;) +1''' || extra matt at bottom to stop optical illusion of frame leaning forward 
|-
| Frame size (blue) || &lt;ArtWidth&gt;-1+(2*&lt;MattWidth&gt;) '''+(2*&lt;FrameWidth&gt;)'''|| &lt;ArtHeight&gt;-1+(2*&lt;MattHeight&gt;)+1 '''+(2*&lt;FrameHeight&gt;)'''
|}

Which means that ...

you need this much frame prior to cutting: left + right + top + bottom

2*(&lt;ArtWidth&gt;-1+(2*&lt;MattWidth&gt;)+(2*&lt;FrameWidth&gt;))+ 2 * (&lt;ArtHeight&gt;-1+(2*&lt;MattHeight&gt;)+1+(2*&lt;FrameHeight&gt;))
=
(2*&lt;ArtWidth&gt;)-2+(4*&lt;MattWidth&gt;)+(4*&lt;FrameWidth&gt;)+ (2*&lt;ArtHeight&gt;)+(4*&lt;MattHeight&gt;)+(4*&lt;FrameHeight&gt;)

== Measuring for Mounts ==
:''Someone should merge this section into the above.''
Calculating the Mount Size (to be cut from a sheet of mount board).
# Decide how much of the picture you want to show (add to, or take away from the art size) = WINDOW SIZE.
# Decide how much mount you want around the window (margins).
#*Top and both sides are the same.  
#*For bottom margin allow extra 20% to compensate for the optical illusion which makes the bottom border seem narrower than it actually is. 
#*Standard margin sizes: 
#**Top and sides 50mm, bottom 65mm.  
#**Top and sides 65mm, bottom 75mm.  
#**Top and sides 75mm, bottom 90mm.
#* Allow for width of frame rebate by adding that amount to each margin width = MARGIN WIDTH.
# Therefore MOUNT HEIGHT = rebate allowance + top margin + window height + bottom margin + rebate allowance.
# Therefore MOUNT WIDTH = rebate allowance + right margin + window width + left margin + rebate allowance.
# Therefore MOUNT SIZE = MOUNT HEIGHT * MOUNT WIDTH

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Tips ==


Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when dealing with the fairer sex (or pretty much anyone, it's just a matter of application).

Don't lie. It's simple, but its really important. Always be honest, and you'll avoid many a headache. This doesn't mean you can't exaggerate, but don't over do it. If you say you're going to do something you had better do it. If you can't do it, come up with a really good reason why (i.e. the truth), or make sure your intention to accomplish whatever it is was clear from the start. Lying rarely yields a sustainable benefit.

Don't gloat. No one likes a bragger. Sure, you can reminisce of something awesome, but it needs to be an engaging story.

Always be respectful. Not just to your date, but to everyone you encounter (with or without her). This will build a solid reputation for yourself and leave you in good standing with many. If you are in a position to help, help; even if it is a minor inconvienance. Be curtious and patient with all. Maintain a clean sense of humour, jokes at the cost of others just aren't worth it. Actions always speak louder than words, and by the end of the day if your the woman you're interested can see or has heard of your kindness and generosity you will get you in her scope even if you aren't the best looking or an excellent conversationalist.

While being direct has its benefits, keep it in context. Women tend to enjoy a mystery. Don't skimp out when building a mystique. Keep it fun and interesting. So when a lady asks you who you like don't be a moron and just flat out say &quot;I like you.&quot; Not like that, build it up first. &quot;Well I'm sure you know her, blah blah blah.&quot; (but only if you're really corny)

== recipe formatting ==
Hi, thanks for contributing [[Cookbook:Almond_Fudge_Brownies]]. Just a couple of notes about formatting:
* You can put your intro at the top of the page (i.e. without a &lt;nowiki&gt;==Intro==&lt;/nowiki&gt; header). If a TOC ever gets added, the intro will still be at the top of the page
* If you're going to sign your recipes, it is customary to do so on the talk page, rather than the main module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cryptographic [[../Hashes|hashes]] (designed with the intention of hiding/protecting information) are one of the more difficult, from a cryptography perspective, things to break. This is because they are so designed, making them in theory hard, in useful time frame (if not algorithmically impossible, by today's standards), to be reversed from its final state, back to its original state. If effect, this relationship is not observed: &lt;math&gt;f'(hash) = message&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attacks still exist against it. Even though these hashes are not designed to be reversed, the methods for computing hashes are widely known, making some of attacks possible to succeed: [[../Brute_force_attack|Brute Force]], [[../Frequency_analysis|Frequency Analysis]], [[../Social_Engineering_and_Coercion|Social Engineering and Coercion]] and [[../Birthday Attack/]]. Also, it should be mentioned that some hashes, [[w:MD4|md4]], [[w:MD5|md5]], [[w:SHA-1#SHA-0_and_SHA-1|sha-0]] notably have been found to have [[../Collisions|collisions]] that allow one to take an existing hash and compute a value that, once been hashed, will yield that value. This means that one can create other values that may or may not be the actual original but since it brings about the same hash it allows exploitation.

{{raw-meat}}

'''Steak tartare''' is a meat dish made from finely chopped, or ground raw [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]. It is often served with [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] and seasonings, and sometimes with raw [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]].

This dish is popular in Belgium, where it is known as ''Filet américain'' (&quot;American fillet&quot;).

== Ingredients == 
* 1/2 pound (225g) of quality beef (filet mignon) with all connective tissue removed.
* One egg yolk. 
* One Teaspoon [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire]] or [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|Soy]] sauce. 
* One Tablespoon whole grain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]. 
* 1-3 drops of hot pepper sauce, as desired. 
* 2 Tablespoons of chopped onions.
* Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.

In Poland - (Steak Tartare called - &quot;Tatar&quot; or &quot;Stek Jednojajeczny&quot; ) - in some recipes diced Polish style pickled cucumber or polish Gherkin &quot;ogorek konserwowy&quot; are added.
Traditional Polish recipe involves meat (filet mignon), egg yolk, chopped onions, diced Gherkin, Salt and fresh ground pepper plus salt to taste; sometimes served on the wheat white bread.

== Procedure ==
# Finely chop the beef, or run twice through a meat grinder with 1/4 inch (0.75cm) plate.
# Mix all the ingredients loosely and spread on bread slices ([[Cookbook:Rye|Rye]], [[Cookbook:Pumpernickel|Pumpernickel]], etc.) to make open-faced [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]].  The steak tartare may also be served on buttered [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]]. Serve on chilled plates with a favorite beverage.

Note that consumption of steak tartare made with contaminated ingredients can cause serious illness or death.  It is very likely that one can contract either pathogenic E Coli infection or salmonellosis since even the best ground beef is a composite of many different slaughtered animals, increasing the risk incrementally.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The book is off to a good start.  What other sections are people thinking of besides &quot;What Makes Me An Aspie?&quot;

Could I suggest, &quot;Coping Strategies&quot;?  Under that would be &quot;Conversation&quot; and &quot;Executive Dysfunction&quot; and many others.

On the AFF forum someone suggested stories about our day to day lives and such.  That would be a great idea to contribute as well.

:You should write about aspies in general, not about what you are like. Not all your traits are included in the official definition of Asperger's syndrome. The definition doesn't mention long attention span, actually there are aspies that have ashort attention span, too. The official defintion has a list of Asperger traits, and you have to have several of them to be Aspie. You should have the official definition here, and then you write about only the related traits and experiences.

:Also you shouldn't introduce here a neologism that only one or five people use. See [[wikipedia:Talk:Autistic culture]], and [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aspiette]]. Wikipedia and Wikibooks are not places to market new, unknown words. Similarly, I am not pushing the word &quot;cap&quot; to an article about the [[wikipedia:Black-headed Gull|black-headed gull]] although me and my family use the word in that sense regularly. -[[User:Hapsiainen|Hapsiainen]] 12:24, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Measurements==
Perhaps there should be a standard for adding recipes. I see some people listing in oz, others in ml others in &quot;shots&quot;, i.e. 1/2 shot tequila. Every cocktail book I've read is in oz. and drams.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Bpeikes|Bpeikes]] ([[User talk:Bpeikes|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bpeikes|contribs]]) 16:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;

Well none ive read are. All recipes should be in parts, measures or shots because generally those are internationally understood. 1 shot/measure is 1 fl oz imperial (28.4ml) or 1fl oz american (29.6ml) or 25ml which happen to be nearly the same measurement but regardless 1 shot or 1 measure will make sense to anyone and make little difference to the recipe (you might end up with a little too much to fit in the glass). I happen to prefer measure, if theres anyone about any preferance between measure shot or part? if not im going to start changing everything to say measure. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 18:44, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

One 'shot' or 'measure' is not always 1 fl oz imperial. In Australia and the UK, a 'shot' or 'measure' can be 25ml or 35ml depending on what that particular establishment deems as their serve. As for find gills, drams, parts, glasses, shots, measures and a whole heap of different terms, I guess it depends when and where the guide was written. I will say that in my opinion, cocktails and mixed drinks are about ratios. For example; a simple sour; 4:2:1, spirit:citrus:sugar. Then you can take that formula and utilize it anywhere in the world depending on what their single serve is, be it 25ml, 30ml or even 50ml. --[[User:Steviepee|Steviepee]] ([[User talk:Steviepee|talk]]) 05:33, 5 October 2009 (UTC) 

== Style guidelines for WB Bartending Guide ==

As I'm working on merging [[Transwiki:Caipirinha]] (from Wikiquote) with the pre-existing [[Caipirinha]], neither of which are formatted nicely, I am wondering about style guidelines for the [[Bartending|Wikibooks Bartending Guide]]. Not a word appears in [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]]. I see that some articles have the following format:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bartending]] &gt; [[Subcategory]]
 ----
 Basic description.
 
 ==Ingredients==
 * 1 part something
 * 2 parts something else
 . . .
 * 1/2 yet another item

 Serves N

 ==Procedure==
 # First step.
 # Next step.
 . . .
 # Last step.&lt;/nowiki&gt;


I would also add some additional information, like usage tips (e.g., can it be refrigerated? must it be drunk right away? what can you substitute?), related drinks (e.g., &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Other drink]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: an X using Y instead of Z), and trivia (e.g., its origin, made famous how?). Has this topic been covered somewhere I haven't found yet? If not, what does everyone think about adding a section to WB:MOS for this? ~ [[User:Jeffq|Jeff Q]]&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Jeffq|(talk)]] 02:42, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

I agree, we want to be aiming for something like [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]]. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 20:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

After reorganising and moving pages in accordance with the naming policy the initial line with links back is redundant and navigation should really be done with templates. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 20:53, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

== Mergable ==

Could not these recipes for various drinks just be merged into the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]]?  It makes sense to me since the two share a fair bit of subject range.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 19:30, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:No, this was split out from the Cookbook. After I spotted an &quot;Apricot Pie&quot; recipe that was definitely not a pie, I brought up the name conflict problem on the Cookbook talk page. I got agreement to split this out, and I'm very happy to have it this way. There must be millions of cocktail recipes, many with grossly misleading names. The ingredients are used differently too; it's nice to have separate pages. The split also helps people ignore whichever it is that they find less interesting in the [[Special:Recentchanges]] page. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:17, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

== A fun source ==

There's a free [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13487 bartending book] out there.  Does anyone want to write a bot to convert Tom Bullock's format to the one specified above?--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 00:20, 1 October 2005 (UTC)



== Random broken crap ==

How the crap are you supposed to make a bartending book?  Look at [[Bartending:Shirley Temple]].  The basic recipie there I gave was from going around and asking people to mix them -- mostly bartenders -- which always got me grenadine on ice with sprite on top, nice and separated.  Looking around, I find all kinds of kooky things:

*[http://www.barmeister.com/cgi-bin/drink.view.pl?drink=1383 Barmeister] says to mix them
*[http://www.idrink.com/drinks/Shirley_Temple.htm iDrink] claims lots of ingredients
*[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink1923.html Drinksmixer] decrees the use of ginger ale
*[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink3399.html Drinksmixer] specifies another way to make a shirley

If we look at [[Bartending:Black Cow]], which we also say is a &quot;Brown Cow,&quot; it's root beer and ice cream, a root beer float.  We list it as non-alcoholic.

*[http://www.barmeister.com/cgi-bin/drink.view.pl?drink=162 Barmeister] lists a Black Cow as beer and kaluha
*[http://www.barmeister.com/cgi-bin/drink.view.pl?drink=253 Barmeister] gives a Brown Cow as vodka!
*[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink1277.html Drinksmixer] shows a Black Cow as kaluha and cocacola
*[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink1279.html Drinksmixer] does however list a rootbeer float as a Black Cow too
*[http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink1628.html Drinksmixer] has Brown Cow as kaluha

So what the hell?  Maybe I should run around asking bartenders, if I can get into the bars; I'm 20, but I shouldn't have much of a problem talking my way past the guards.  I don't drink anyway, nasty clear liquid. . .

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 05:30, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

Its like cooking people change recipes to whatever they feel like, going and asking bartenders wont help much either. Itd be best just to find what recipe is considered 'historical' and have that as the main article and spread the variants out from that. Printed sources are better as online websites usually have unsourced user contributions [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 15:16, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

My source says a brown cow is kahlua and milk. Id break it down into two pages
*Brown Cow (kahlua, milk)
**variant vodka + choc milk
*Black Cow (brown cow variant) (kahlua, coke)
**non alholic variants
***root beet floats
**guiness and kahlua and baileys (yuck! ive heard of this its an irish speciality designed as a drinking 'trial' and likely to make you ill)
[[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 15:36, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

Actually better idea? variants should be sup-pages unless they can be considered a cocktail in their own right and we should have a parentage section? something to denote what this cocktail is based on. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 15:48, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

== Templates ==

Check out [[Bartending:Information_from_Web_sites]] and the several templates therein.  That REALLY needs a rewrite, it's late, I'm writing crappy.  I made good use of them on [[Bartending:Shirley Temple]].

Should we move to [[Bartending:Cocktails:Shirley Temple]] type notation instead?  Also I believe non-alcoholic &quot;mock-tails&quot; (is that a real term?  Google thinks so but. . .) should be listed on their own page sub-titling cocktails in the TOC.

The introduction should have subsections for how to be a bartender; legal obligations of running a bar; and the effects of alcohol, both short and long.  The dangers of tending bar should also be outlined; consider that people will probably try to stab you, shoot you, set fire to the building you're in, hit you with a truck, or do any number of nasty things.

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 05:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

The templates shouldnt span the whole page can we limit their width like normal WP notices? also why not stick to WP citing style? and we should probably be listing page numbers when a recipe is taken from a book. 

mock-tails doesnt sound correct to me but yes it should be in its own section as should shooters,
*cocktails
*shots
*mocktails

[[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 15:44, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

I've started making some useful templates for cocktail recipe pages. {{tl|vodka}} and various other spirits will insert a link to the correct ingredients page and will add a page to [[:category:Cocktails with vodka]] so dont wiki-link ingredients, template them but watch out for garnishes like onion that could be cookbook ingredients id make {{tl|cocktailonion}} instead. {{tl|cocktails}} at the moment will just add a recipe to the cocktails category but it should be worked into an infobox template.

== The Picture ==

The picture looks a LOT better on the left; but not with the TOC wrapping about it and sinking to the left when it gets beyond the picture.  A dangling TOC in the middle looks like ass.  If somebody can write enough filler text to get the TOC down below the picture, that would make it great on the left; but it would also put the TOC low, which looks like ass.

A type of background that would look good under the picture would be great.  We could have it patterned as a repeating background in a table, and have it simply be as wide as the picture, and start directly below it, unbroken.  Then it'd make a full column; the TOC could be placed in the column to the right of the picture, which would cause the background to stretch down with the TOC.  This would look much better.

  (PICTURE) * toc
  (PICTURE)  * toc
  (PICTURE)  * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;  * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;   * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;   * toc
  &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;  * toc

== Thanks to kieff ==

Thanks to kieff for his work on the front page.  I picked the coloring for the background stuff below the image, yes it's an ugly brown.  He wrote the tables around it.

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 07:32, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

== More to do ==

OK I've made some really crappy pages, especially on alcohol.  I'll have to fill out the recipies when I get some free time later.  I'd also like to go over a few more things.

* Most popular drinks &amp;mdash; Harvard's guide gives an order involving what's most popular, what's semi-common, and what's rare but fun.  I'll work from that.
* Setting up a bar &amp;mdash; We should look at a few configurations, see if we can draw one diagram and say to eliminate X Y or Z as fitting.  I mean, a wet bar minus the sink is a bar; a food bar (a what?) minus the grill would be a bar or a wet bar, depending on if there's a sink.  Sinks are good, you have somewhere to wash your glasses out.
* Utensils &amp;mdash; We definitely need to go over what speedpours do and what spoons are for.  I just got a speedpour today for my grenadine; I can make shirley temples in under 5 minutes now.  In fact I can do it in under five seconds.  It's the difference between uncapping, tipping slowly, pouring in the right amount, trying to shake off that last drop, capping up, wiping the bottle down because that last drop still ran down the side, wiping up the mess you made, then continuing on; or tilting the bottle sideways, letting the liquid flow, tilting it back, throwing it back in the fridge, and finishing up.  It's clean, it's fast, there's no screwing around.
* Glasses &amp;mdash; We need a picture of every one.
* Split cocktail pages &amp;mdash; We should split up the cocktail pages, instead of having a superpage.  I already did non-alc and alc.

--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 08:32, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

== Purpose of this guide? ==

I dont quite get who this guide is aimed at, is it meant to teach someone how to actually serve behind a bar. If it is then there are a few things missing. 

The legal implications of bar service fails to note that, in the UK at least, it is illegal to serve drug dealers, prostitutes, on-duty police, as well as minors - i presume it is similar elsewhere. 

There is no mention of health and safety either; bar staff routinely work with pressurised gas, chemicals, and broken glass. And the section that mentions bar tenders carrying a cloth rag is nonsense (its illegal in the uk because of the risk of cross contamination) as is the bit about using soda water/seltzer for cleaning when there are sanitising fluids designed for that job which will do the job properly.

I was going to make changes but i thought id ask for opinions first.--[[User:Doo666dah|Doo666dah]] 02:51, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
:I'd imagine that the advantage of Seltzer, in context, is that it is safe to consume and relatively tasteless, as well as not being sticky, so it is a good 1-round cleaner for the serving area, leaving it clean but not smelling of cleaner.

Very nice Drhees. Perhaps try to cover liqueurs as well though? You used spirits in the ingredients section but then later you have pouring liquor perhaps change it to spirits and liqueurs? liquor is far too confusable a term and should be avoided where possible. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 14:01, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
:It often seems to refer to spirits and liqueurs but sometimes it refers to beer and other things which youve covered further on.[[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 01:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

I moved your proposed structure to [[Bartending/Contents]] [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 00:55, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Ah you did have liqueurs down as cordials thats another wierd word over here it means the same as fruit squash or fruit concentrate. So ive changed that to liqueurs. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 01:06, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

===Cocktails===

Maybe it would be best to merged all cocktails into a glossary arranged on alphabetical terms. It would leave everything easy to find, would impose much needed structure, allow lots of stubby pages to be removed, and make maintenance easier (especially as it appears we're about to get 90 cocktail recipes from wikipedia in soon), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:40, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

Doesnt sound too bad an idea, but im still really in favour of individual pages for the purposes of indexing. Perhaps as a compromise we should merge the cocktails into a glossary as a holding ground and then someone can take the time break them off into individual articles like the [[B-52]].  do intend to expand as many recipes as possible to the same standard [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 19:07, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
 
I think, with the exception of most bar standards ie. glassware, jiggers, alcohols, garnishes etc., that each establishment will have their own policies regarding cleaning, tipping, cooperation between servers, etc. This is a great start but any truly great bartending book should be, first and foremost, easy to understand. Most people have no idea what either a julep strainer or a dog house arrangement is and probably do not care to know. Make it simple, make it easily applicable to any home or business and format it in such a way that will make people want to read it... don't make it like a car manual. Cover all of the basics and have standard recipes. Done.

==Formatting of Title Page==
It was impossible to read the Table of Contents because it was a narrow column to the right of the image.  I have reformatted it in a layout that is now legible but it probably is not standard formatting.  I didn't ask permission because that is too complicated for someone with neurological damage (I'm not kidding) ... If you don't approve of it, revert it but try to reformat it yourself so that the Table of Contents can be read.  What is the purpose of one if you can't read it? [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] 09:26, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

== Major renovation underway ==

Just a note to let everyone know that I am part-way through a major renovation on the book. While the basic structure discussed above is a great start, there are some practical problems with the way the articles have been arranged. The biggest problem I've seen is that the articles run way too deep. Trying to get to the information on vodka in the past required going to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits#Vodka]]. Now you just go to [[Bartending/Alcohol/Vodka]]. As a result, I changed '''[[wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Hierarchy|the hierarchy]]''' to something wider and less deep. Many of the articles are still [[w:Wikipedia:Red links|red links]], and I am in the process of [[wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Hierarchy#Redirecting_to_a_different_page|creating redirects]] to sections of larger articles or splitting content out of larger articles into smaller articles and filling in key information into a sort of overview article on the general topic with links to the more specific article. You can compare the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Development/Old contents|old layout]] to the [[wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending/Hierarchy|new one]]. The new [[Bartending/Contents|table of contents]] is far too long and complicated to use in the long-run, but I am using it right now to keep track of all the current and planned links. Feel free to add things to it, but it would be really nice if major changes could be avoided until most everything is moved into their new places. Other things that need to still be done are setting up all the new categories and templates to help this book stay organized.

In case you are curious about my motivation, I completed a major renovation of the Wikipedia mixed drinks articles in early 2007. I also brought much needed energy to the [[w:WP:MIX|WikiProject Mixed Drinks]] over there. A year and a half later, the efforts the Project members and I made back in 2007 are still evident, and the articles are markedly improved compared to pre-2007 era articles. I want to see that happen here, too. I'm sick of Wikibooks being the Wikipedia dumping ground. As long as this book is seen as a hodgepodge of drink recipes, that will never change. If we can focus on the information that a novice professional bartender needs to know (and delve into some more advanced stuff as desired), and build the book from that point of view, then this book can really become something useful to people and a featured book here.

I'm not really asking for additional help at this time, but I will be soon. I know I'm being bold by making these changes without a long discussion period, but I looked at the traffic here, and the whole book has been pretty stagnant for several months (except for occasional Wikipedia dumpings). I carefully reviewed all the discussions above, surveyed the entire book to see what was already here, and combined that with my experiences with the Wikipedia WikiProject Mixed Drinks, and that is what led me to this point. Hopefully nobody will be terribly upset by the changes, and even more, I hope that people will like the changes and embrace them.

One final note is that due to family medical issues, I may have to start commuting back and forth over a fairly long distance, staying with my family members for days at a time. That may interfere with my being able to complete this renovation as quickly as I'd hoped. I just wanted you to know that if I seem to disappear for a while, I am not flaking on this project. Whenever I get the chance, I will pick right up where I left off (unless someone else already did the work), and get right back to it the next opportunity I have. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 20:29, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

:That's fine but now the links are all red to the stuff I took weeks doing.  Never mind, it is not difficult to fix, just time consuming. [[User:Mike Hayes|Mike Hayes]] ([[User talk:Mike Hayes|talk]]) 02:43, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

== Anyone actively working here? ==

Haven't checked very throughly but it seems like this project is more or less orphaned. Without objection I'm going to start in doing some re-working. I saw this proposed somewhere else as well but it doesn't seem like anyone acted on it: I think we should move away from the citation banners in favor of standard citations - it's unclear with the banners precisely what information is sourced and banners are more commonly used to flag problems so that may cause some confusion for readers skimming through quickly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Laws ==
There are probably some laws that you do not agree with in your home country.  For example, in the U.S., to drive a car in most states you would have to pay $1000-$2000 a year in car insurance.  If you created your own island, you would be able to enact your own government.  Along with the benefit of likely not needing a car on your own island, if you had an island big enough to need cars, you wouldn't need automobile insurance.  

When you create your island, you can base your government on those already in place, with your modifications to the current systems, or devise your own system.  You could base it on historical models, like the Roman triumvirate, or you could take it from a theoretical system, such as that in Thomas More's ''Utopia''.  With your own island, you can change the government so that you are the government.

== Money ==
If you have limited funds, cannot earn enough money to survive, or simply cannot find a job, building an island may be right for you.  Provided you live near a body of water, you can build an island which has shelter, food from fishing, and a possible income generating potential in the tourists that would come to visit your island.

There are also many ways an island can be utilized to generate both raw materials and energy. The sea can be farmed just like ordinary land, only the products are different.

== [[w:Stateless person|Stateless individuals]] ==

There are some people who for reasons not entirely under their control have been denied citizenship in all countries of the Earth.  People who are in this position literally have no where else to turn; however, it could be argued that people who are in this position are also incapable of gathering the resources necessary to build an island.

==Grammatica 8 ~ Er and the pronominal adverbs==
===Locative adverbs===
The word '''''er''''' is one of the most ubiquitous words in the Dutch language and often rather hard to translate, because it does not have an exact counterpart in most other languages, French being an exception with the words ''y'' and ''en''. Compare:

|}

'''''Er''''' relates to more specific indications of place like ''here'', ''there'', ''where'', or ''somewhere'' in a similar way as the word ''it'' does to the more specific ''this'', ''that'' or ''what''. The word is a kind of '''''locative wildcard'''''. 
:In computer terms you could say that ''er'' is ''*ere'', with * being a wildcard for h-,th- or wh-. 
:Another way of putting it is that ''er'' is a ''clitic'' (weak) form of ''hier'' or ''daar''. Indeed it never carries emphasis. Historically, however, the word only ''partly'' originated as a weakening of ''hier'' or ''daar''. In part it also reflects an old genitive of the pronoun &quot;het&quot;. The two sources have coalesced so strongly that they cannot be distinguished anymore.

In many cases where Dutch uses '''''er''''', English will resort to a more specific ''there'':

:Is ''er'' koffie - Is ''there'' coffee?
:Ken je Londen? Ja, ik ben ''er'' geweest. - Do you know London? Yes, I have been ''there''

This is also true in the relatively few cases that English uses pronominal adverbs like ''thereof'', ''therefore'', ''thereafter'' etc. Dutch will distinguish a more general (clitic) ''ervan'', ''ervoor'', ''erna'' from a more specific (accentuated) ''daarvan'', ''daarvoor'' and ''daarna''.

===Pronominal adverbs===
In English pronominal adverbs like ''therein'' or ''hereby'' are a remnant from the past. They are quite old and occur in most Germanic languages, both of the Western and the Northern (Scandinavian) group. However, pronominal adverbs are much more prominent in Dutch than in English or the other Germanic languages. Their formation is still an active mechanism. If anything their use is increasing (due to the [[Dutch/Lesson_3#The_reference_problem|gender problem]]). They form an important part of the grammar and have to be mastered to speak the language properly. 

Pronominal adverbs are commonly used in Dutch to replace the combination of &lt;font color=green&gt;''preposition''&lt;/font&gt; + ''pronoun'', particularly if the latter is an inanimate ''it'' or ''them'':

:&lt;font color=green&gt;of&lt;/font&gt; it → there&lt;font color=green&gt;of&lt;/font&gt; = er&lt;font color=green&gt;van&lt;/font&gt;
:&lt;font color=green&gt;for&lt;/font&gt; it → there&lt;font color=green&gt;fore&lt;/font&gt; = er&lt;font color=green&gt;voor&lt;/font&gt;

Notice how the elements swap place: the prepositional part moves to the end. This is true in both languages.

While rare in English, in Dutch this replacement/swap is not just common, in many cases it is ''mandatory'' .

====Pronominal replacement====
Although in the spoken language even this is slowly changing, it is uncommon, even somewhat disrespectful to apply pronominal replacement to people (animate nouns):

:after her = na haar ('''''not''''' erna)
:for them = voor hen ('''''not''''' ervoor)

In all other cases pronominal replacement is frequent or even ''mandatory''. It is a major way of avoiding m/f gender references for inanimate nouns, because ''er'' is '''''genderless'''''. This means that replacement can also be applied to common gender words that do not really have a personal pronoun to refer them by.

The most common pronominal replacements (from the table above) are:

:van het huis → (van het)* → ervan
:van dit huis → van dit,deze → hiervan
:van dat huis → van dat,die → daarvan
:van welk huis → (van wat)*, van welk(e) → waarvan
:van iets → ergens van
:van niets → nergens van
:van alles → overal van

:(...)*: In this case the replacement is so common that not using the replacement is simply bad Dutch.

Notice that if the replaced pronoun is personal (''het''), demonstrative (''dit'', ''dat'') or interrogative/relative (''wat'') the resulting pronominal adverb is written as one word (''ervan'', ''hiervan'', ''daarvaan'', ''waarvan''). In other cases an adverbial expression with two separate adverbs results.
====Drill 8-1. Pronominal replacement ====
{{Dutch/Exercise|Pronominal replacement drill

[[Image:Nl-Dutch-ch8-pronominal replacement-drill.ogg|40px|noicon]]
Replacement drill. Replace the following expressions by the correct proniminal adverb. Run the audio to hear the results.

E.g.: &quot;in welk huis?&quot; would be replaced by &quot;waarin?&quot;

:in het huis - in the house
:op het dak - on the roof
:tussen de planten - between the plants
:naast een boom - beside a tree
:tussen huizen - between houses
:onder de deken - under the blanket
:in een boom - in a tree

:op dat dak - on that roof
:in dit huis - in this house
:naast deze boom - next to this tree
:onder deze daken - under these roofs
:voor deze planten - before these plants
:achter de boom - behind the tree
:achter deze huizen - behind these houses

:op die boom - on that tree
:naast deze garage - next to that garage
:onder dat dak - under that roof
:achter een huis - behind a house
:achter die boom - behind that tree
:in die boeken - in those books
:tussen die dekens - between the blankets

:in welk huis? - in which house?
:naast welke boom? - beside which tree?
:voor welke planten - for which plants?
:in die garage - in that garage
:onder welke dekens? - under which blankets?
:naast dat huis - next to that house
:op welk dak? - on which roof?
:onder een boom - under a tree

You can do this exercise a number of different ways. This is one:
#First work out on paper which pronominal adverb to expect
#Then run the audio to check your results
#Make sure you repeat in the pauses
#Repeat the drill without looking at the text

Some people may prefer to run the audio without the visual text first. Remember: learning by ear is superior to the visual way.
The exercise also introduces/ reinforces some vocabulary. Make a list of the nouns used with their proper definite articles te ensure you memorize their gender.
}}

====Translating ''its'' by replacement====

In English it is common to use the possessive pronoun ''its'' to refer to a noun that indicates a thing. In Dutch, a pronominal adverb like ''ervan'' is used instead, again representing a convenient way to avoid the gender issue:

:This tale is nice. '''Its''' beginning is spectacular.
::Deze vertelling is leuk. '''Het''' begin '''ervan''' is spectaculair. (Yes, please..)
::Deze vertelling is leuk. '''Haar''' begin is spectaculair. (No, please..)

Yes, in principle the latter is correct. A word in '''''-ing''''' is feminine, but who remembers? Occasionally a writer will try to dazzle the reader with this kind of superior knowledge, often only to get it wrong... Please use the adverbial '''''ervan''''', especially if the noun is inanimate. This is true for neuter nouns as well

:Dit verhaal is leuk. Het begin ervan is spectaculair (Yes, please..)
:Dit verhaal is leuk. Zijn begin is spectaculair. (No, please..)

The latter is strictly speaking correct Dutch, but a neuter (inanimate) possessive ''zijn'' is so uncommon that it is better avoided. Possessives like ''zijn'' and ''haar'' are more and more reserved for animate masculine and animate feminine nouns (person, pets) and indicate ''natural'' rather than grammatical gender, just like the personal pronouns ''hij'' and ''zij''.

====Formation====
A pronominal adverb is formed from the locative adverb that corresponds to the replaced pronoun + the preposition in adverbial form. Usually this prepositional adverb is the same as the preposition itself

:('''van''' het)* → er'''van'''
:('''tussen''' het)* → er'''tussen'''

But this is not always the case:

:('''met''' het)* → er'''mee''' (''arch.'' ermede)
:('''tot''' het)* → er'''toe'''

Pronominal adverbs can be formed from most prepositions. Words like ''ertussenin'' (''lit.'' thereinbetween) or ''ergens achter'' (''lit.'' somewhere behind) or even ''nergens onderuit'' (''lit.'' nowhere from under out) do not raise any eyebrows.

A few adverbial forms do not have a corresponding prepositions:

:er'''af''' (off of it)
:er'''heen''' (expresses a direction: ''to'')

Conversely, some prepositions (like via, behalve, mits etc.) do not have a corresponding prepositional adverb. This makes it difficult to use them in relative clauses or in combination with ''it''. Compare:

:Dit is de weg '''''waarlangs''''' ik naar huis fiets.
:Dit is de weg '''''via dewelke''''' ik naar huis fiets.

::This is the road ''along which'' I ride my bike on the way home.

Because ''via'' does not have a prepositional adverb one is forced to use a relative pronoun like ''dewelke'' that is more and more experienced as awkward and archaic, because in most constructions it is replaced (''langs dewelke'' → waarlangs).

{{Dutch/Exercise|Pronominal replacement

#: hieronder
# tussen iets
#: ergens tussen
# binnen dit
#: hierbinnen
# het binnen* (movement)
#: ernaarbinnen
#zonder het
#: erzonder 

The latter is quite common in the South, still avoided in the North but gaining acceptance: pronominal adverbs are ''productive'' in Dutch.
}}

====Separation====
To further confuse the enemy, pronominal adverbs are usually split apart in the sentence. Compare:

:He has a remedy ''for it''.
:Hij heeft een remedie *(''voor het'').
:Hij heeft een remedie ''ervoor''.
:Hij heeft ''er'' een remedie ''voor'.

The first translation is unacceptable. The second one is awkward, the third one is what most people would say.

In the case of the preposition ''van'' (''of''),  the van-part may be omitted, giving the word ''er'' a partitive flavor:

:He has seven ''of them''.
:Hij heeft zeven *(''van ze'').
:Hij heeft zeven ''ervan''.
:Hij heeft ''er'' zeven ''van''.
:Hij heeft ''er'' zeven.

The four translations are unacceptable, awkward, reasonable and most common respectively.

The partitive flavor extends to the negative:

:Is er koffie - Is there coffee?
:Ik heb er nog geen (van) gezet - ''I have there(of) yet none made'' - I haven't made any yet.

Sometimes the two parts of the pronominal adverb can end up quite far apart. Notice what happens to &quot;by it&quot; (door *het) =&gt; &quot;erdoor&quot;:

:Lance Armstrong heeft kanker gehad.
::Lance Armstrong had cancer.
:Hij heeft {{C|zich|himself}} '''''er''''' {{C|echter|however}}, {{C|blijkens|as evidenced by}} zijn zeven {{C|opeenvolgende|consecutive}} {{C|overwinningen|victories}} in de Tour de France, {{C|op geen enkele manier|in no single manner}} {{C|in zijn loopbaan|in his career}} als {{C|'s werelds|genitive: the world's}} {{C|sterkste|strongest}} {{C|wielrenner|cyclist}} '''''door''''' {{C|laten|let, allow}} {{C|weerhouden|keep from, thwart}}.
::However, given his seven consecutive victories in the Tour de France, he did not in any way allow himself to be thwarted '''''by it''''' in his career as the world's strongest cyclist.

Getting used to understanding such sentences, let alone producing them in speech, takes a lot of practice. As an exercise: identify all the parts of this sentence to see how different the word order is.

==Exercise 8.1==

e.g. Het boek ligt ''in de kast'' → Het boek ligt ''erin''.

#:Je schrijft ''er'' altijd een punt ''boven''. 
#Hij ging ''met de trein'' naar London.
#:Hij ging ''ermee'' naar London.
#:Hij ging ''er'' naar London ''mee''.

:'''Remark:''' Please do not worry too much about the word order at this point. As you can see it is quite irregular and sometimes there are various possibilities. It is one of the hardest aspects of West-Germanic languages (other than English). Unfortunately, for English speakers they lost that after 1066 or so. The preponderance of separable pronominal adverbs in Dutch only acerbates the situation. It is perhaps a consolation that even our German neighbors are baffled by this particular aspect of Dutch grammar-and-syntax. 

If you must know: In general the locative part ''er'' tends to follow the ''persoonsvorm'' -the conjugated part of the verb- whereas the prepositional part (like ''mee'') moves to the end of the sentence. This is true for 1,4,5,8,9. The prepositional part may have to compete with other parts of the verbal expression for a spot as in 2 or 7. In questions or emphatic expressions the locative may precede the persoonsvorm (see 3,7). In 6 the position can be influenced by the verbal noun ''verschil'' as ''ertussen'' refers to ''..difference between..''

==Other uses of &quot;er&quot;==
===Impersonal passives===
Many Dutch verbs can be used in the passive voice, which we'll discuss in [[Dutch/Lesson 12|lesson 12]] in greater detail. In fact in Dutch the passive voice is more recognizable and more common than in English. It uses the verb ''worden''.

:Ik bak het brood  - I bake the bread
:Het brood ''wordt'' door mij gebakken  - The bread ''is''  baked by me.

Here &quot;het brood&quot; is a definite noun and the passive centers around it as the object. 

In more indefinite cases Dutch often uses an ''impersonal passive'' initiated with the adverb ''er''. 

:Er wordt hier brood gebakken - (There is bread baking going on here)

Notice, the indefinite &quot;brood&quot; instead of the definite &quot;het brood&quot;. 

The active form of this sentence is not very common in Dutch. It involves the indefinite pronoun ''men'' (people, they, one)

:''Men'' bakt hier brood  - (''People'' bake bread here)

English will opt for the active form more readily in this case, but in Dutch the passive sounds much more natural.

Impersonal passives can even be formed from many verbs that do not have an object:

:Er werd gelachen - (There was laughter)

Notice that in this sentence there is no subject if we continue to call ''er'' an adverb. Some grammars will therefore call it a dummy subject, but most do not. 

English does not really have a direct equivalent of this type of sentence, which adds to the fact that the use or the word &quot;er&quot; is a considerable difficulty for people learning Dutch.

==Long-term outcomes==
*'''RTOG 75-06''' - PMID 9531359 &amp;mdash; Ten-year outcomes for pathologic node-positive patients treated in RTOG 75-06. (Hanks GE, IJRBOP 1998). 
**Conclusion: A small fraction of node-positive patients are cured at 10-year follow-up by radiation therapy (2 of 90 with PSA +3 of 90 by clinical endpoints). Innovative treatment programs should be directed at node-positive patients in an effort to improve the fraction cured.

==Local Therapy vs No Local Therapy==
*'''SEER/U. Colorado''' PMID 24661660 - &quot;The Impact of Definitive Local Therapy for Lymph Node–Positive Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study &quot; (Rusthoven CG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2014; 88 (5); 1064-1073. )
**1995-2005, 796 clinically node positive (cN+), 2991 pathologically node positive (pN+), analyzed as separate cohorts. 
***For cN+ patients, 43% had EBRT vs 57% had No Local Therapy (NLT). 10-yr OS 45% vs 29% (P&lt;.001) (median OS 9.6 vs 5.9 yr)
***For pN+ patients, 78% had local therapy (radical prostatectomy (RP) 57%, EBRT 10%, or both 11%) vs 22% had NLT. 10-yr OS 65% vs 42% (P&lt;.001) (median OS 13.6 vs 8.3 years)
***Local therapy beneficial across subgroups, including age &gt;=70 years and multiple +lymph nodes
**Secondary comparisons of RP vs EBRT and RP +/- Adjuvant EBRT: no significant differences between modalities. +Trend toward improved OS with RP + Adjuvant EBRT over RP alone (p=.08).
**Conclusion: &quot;RP and EBRT were associated with substantial improvements in OS and PCSS. The best available evidence suggests that patients with N1M0 PCa can achieve improved long-term survival outcomes with definitive local therapy and these strategies should be considered in appropriate candidates.&quot;
**'''&quot;Mixed Population Model&quot;''' - authors propose a model to account for potential &quot;under-ascertainment&quot; of radiation data (ie, coding &quot;no radiation&quot; in SEER registries when radiation was actually delivered to the patient [Jagsi Cancer 2012;118:333-341, Walker IJROBP 2013;86:686-693]):
***OSmixed_population=R(OSradiation)+(1−R)(OSno_radiation)
****&quot;...where OSmixed_population is the observed survival in the population coded as undergoing no radiation therapy (eg, NLT or RP alone), OSradiation is the observed survival for patients known with certainty to have received radiation therapy, R is the proportion of patients in the mixed population who actually received radiation therapy (ie, the rate of underascertainment), and OSno_radiation is the derived survival estimate for a given value of R. Notably, this model assumes that patients in the mixed population who actually received radiation have survival outcomes similar to those in the population known to have received radiation (OSradiation)&quot;&quot;
****Using this model, with hypothetical under-ascertainment rates of 10% and 20%, the authors find that SEER could potentially underestimate the 10 year OS benefit of radiation (vs NLT) by 2-4% and the 10 year OS benefit of adjuvant radiation (vs RP alone) by 0-1% in this population.

==Prostatectomy vs Radiotherapy==
*'''Ulm, Germany / U. Michigan''' PMID 15356680 -- ''Comparison of external radiation therapy vs radical prostatectomy in lymph node positive prostate cancer patients.'' ('''2004 Kuefer''', Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis. 2004;7(4):343-9.)
**Retrospective.  102 pts RPX, 44 pts ERT. Adjuvant androgen ablation was given in 76 of 102 RPX, 21 of 44 ERT. 
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In case of positive lymph nodes, RPX and ERT might be considered and need to be explained to the patient. For future treatment decisions, the presented findings and a potential survival benefit need to be evaluated in a larger prospective setting.&quot;

==Radiotherapy alone==
'''''Dose for positive nodes:'''''
*''From Fletcher, Texbook of Radiotherapy, 3rd ed. (1980)'' - For lymphangiogram positive pelvic nodes, extend field to L4-L5 interspace, 45 Gy to pelvis + boost positive nodes to a total of 55-60 Gy.

==After prostatectomy==
===Hormonal therapy after prostatectomy===
'''''Randomized data:'''''
*'''Messing / ECOG EST-3886''' (1988 - 93)

***98 pts. Pts were found to have node-positive disease after radical prostatectomy + pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Randomized to adjuvant goserelin (or bilateral orchiectomy) vs observation until disease progression (based on local or distant disease progression, not PSA). 
***Median 7.1 yrs f/u. 77% (antiandrogen) vs 18% (obs) were alive with no evidence of recurrent disease and undetectable PSA. Death from any cause in 7 of 47 men (antiandrogen) vs 18 of 51 (obs), S.S. 
***Conclusion: survival benefit for immediate hormonal therapy. RT not used.

**731 pts treated with RP with positive regional LNs. 209 men received ADT within 120 days of RP. Compared men receiving adjuvant ADT vs those without adjuvant ADT.
**OS: no sig difference between adjuvant ADT and non-ADT groups (HR 0.97).
**CONCLUSION: &quot;Deferring immediate ADT in men with positive lymph nodes after RP may not significantly compromise survival.&quot;

===Adjuvant hormonal therapy plus RT===
*'''Italy, 2011''' (1986-2002) - Retrospective, multi-center
**364 pts (of a series of 703 pts), pLN+ treated with RP. Matched analysis comparing 117 pts treated with HT + RT vs 247 pts treated with HT alone.
**'''2011''' PMID 21354694 -- &quot;Combination of adjuvant hormonal and radiation therapy significantly prolongs survival of patients with pT2-4 pN+ prostate cancer: results of a matched analysis.&quot; (Briganti A, Eur Urol. 2011 May;59(5):832-40.)
***Median f/u 95 mo. (7.9 yr).  5/8-year CSS 90%/82%, OS 85%/70%. Pts treated with RT+HT had higher CSS and OS rates (5/8-year CSS: 95%/91% vs 88%/78%, OS: 90%/84% vs 82%/65%).
***Conclusion: &quot;Adjuvant RT plus HT significantly improved CSS and OS of pT2-4 pN1 patients, regardless of the extent of nodal invasion. These results reinforce the need for a multimodal approach in the treatment of node-positive prostate cancer.&quot;

*'''Italy, 2009''' (1988-2002) - Retrospective
**Retrospective review of 250 consecutive pLN+ patients treated with RP, followed by HT alone (48%) or HT and RT (52%). Seventy-four percent of patients received pelvic and prostate bed RT. Median dose 66.6 Gy. 
**'''2009''' PMID 19211184 -- &quot;Long-term follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and nodal metastases treated by pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy: the positive impact of adjuvant radiotherapy.&quot; (Da Pozzo LF, Eur Urol. 2009 May;55(5):1003-11.)
***5/8-year bRFS 72/61%, CSS 89/83%. In multivariate analysis, adjuvant RT and # of positive LN predicted bRFS and CSS. Patients treated with aHT alone had 2.6× risk of prostate cancer mortality vs. HT and RT after accounting for other predictors.

==Hormonal therapy and radiotherapy==
*'''MD Anderson, 2001''' (1984-1998) PMID 11489709 &amp;mdash; &quot;Addition of radiation therapy to androgen ablation improves outcome for subclinically node-positive prostate cancer.&quot;   Zagars GK, Pollack A, von Eschenbach AC. Urology. 2001 Aug;58(2):233-9.
**Retrospective. 255 pts N+ found on lymphadenectomy treated with early androgen ablation alone (n=188) or with 70 Gy EBRT (n=72). Median F/U 9.4 years for ablation alone, 6.2 years for ablation + RT
**10 year outcome: Adding EBRT improved OS from 46 to 67%. Freedom from relapse improved from 25% to 80%
**Conclusion: Early androgen ablation alone not helpful. Addition of RT offers substantial and significant improvement

*'''[[Radiation_Oncology/RTOG_Trials/8531|RTOG 85-31]]: Subset Analysis''', PMID 15681524 &amp;mdash; &quot;Androgen suppression plus radiation versus radiation alone for patients with stage D1/pathologic node-positive adenocarcinoma of the prostate: updated results based on national prospective randomized trial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 85-31.&quot; Lawton CA et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 Feb 1;23(4):800-7.
**Updated analysis of pN+ pts (median f/u on all pts (6.5 yrs) and all living pts (9.5 yrs))
**98 pts XRT + immediate adjuvant goserelin, 75 pts XRT alone w/ delayed goserelin @ time of failure.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: Multivariant analysis shows XRT + immediate adj goserelin have SS benefit in all four end points analyzed-- biochem control, met failure, DSF, absolute survival.  Need prospective randomized trial to confirm, but until then, pN+ pts should be considered for XRT + immediate hormonal manipulation rather than XRT alone with hormone manipulation at the time of relapse.

*'''(closed due to poor accrual ) [[Radiation Oncology/RTOG Trials/9608|RTOG 96-08]]''' (1997-98)
**Randomized node-positive pts to indefinite total androgen ablation vs total androgen ablation plus RT to the pelvis + prostate. 50.4 Gy to the pelvis (to L4/5 interspace) with boost to 68.4 - 70.2 Gy.



==Hormonal Therapy Alone==
*'''EORTC 30846''' - Randomized to immediate ADT vs delayed ADT; no treatment of the primary tumor
**234 pts with prostate cancer and nodal metastases. No treatment to the primary tumor was given. Pts randomized to early ADT vs delayed ADT. Non-inferiority trial
**'''2009''' PMID 18823693 -- &quot;Early versus delayed endocrine treatment of T2-T3 pN1-3 M0 prostate cancer without local treatment of the primary tumour: final results of European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer protocol 30846 after 13 years of follow-up (a randomised controlled trial).&quot; (Schröder FH, Eur Urol. 2009 Jan;55(1):14-22.)
***Median f/u 13 yr. Median duration of protocol ADT 2.7 yr (delayed) vs 3.2 yr (immediate).
***59.4% of pts died from PCa; 82.5% died overall. Median OS 6.1 yr (delayed) vs 7.6 yr (immediate) (HR 1.22), not signficant (non-inferiority not proven). 
***Conclusion: &quot;After 13 years of follow-up, survival or PCa-specific survival between immediate and delayed ET appear similar, but the trial is underpowered to reach its goal of showing non-inferiority.&quot;</text>

'''Muffins''' are individually-sized  baked goods, made from a thick batter, and baked in a [[Cookbook:Muffin Tin|muffin tin]], possibly lined with [[Cookbook:Muffin Liner|muffin liner]]. Muffins are similar to [[Cookbook:Cupcake|cupcakes]], and are characterized by a mushroom-like &quot;head&quot; or &quot;crown&quot; which is formed when the cooking batter rises above the top of the muffin tin. Muffins are usually sweet, and often involve [[Cookbook:Berry|berries]] suspended in the batter. Though sweet, muffins are usually eaten at [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]].

Unfortunately, the information shared on that site is frequently repeated because the same questions are asked due to the difficulty of finding what is needed. This book is an attempt to capture that knowledge, allow users to improve and keep it current by editing, and organize it for quick retrieval.
