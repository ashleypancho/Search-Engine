      <text xml:space="preserve">Feeling suicidal, or having suicide ideation is not inevitable when you have depression, but it is quite common. Don't hate yourself for having these thoughts, but don't dismiss them either. The most important thing to do is to talk to someone. If you can talk to your regular doctor immediately, then do so. You can also call a suicide-prevention or crisis helpline. These are generally confidential and staffed by people who are trained to receive those kinds of calls. Some helplines are listed in the [[Living_With_Depression/Resources#Telephone_helplines|resources section]]. If you feel that you're in danger of acting on suicidal thoughts, or that you can't cope with your feelings, go to your nearest hospital emergency department and tell them that you're feeling suicidal.

Remember, although it seems strange, that sometimes antidepressants can increase suicidal thoughts when you start to take them. If you think this is the case, as well as any other course of action mentioned above, make sure that you tell the doctor who prescribed the antidepressants to you so that they can take the best course of action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Diet==

We all know that good nutrition is important for our general health. Many people also think that it has a big effect on out mental health. When you're depressed, it's easy to neglect yourself. Many depressed people find themselves either forgetting to eat, or falling into unhealthy patterns and perhaps overeating, or existing on food that's easy to make, but has little nutritional value. Try and get into a pattern of regular meals and making sure you're getting enough of all the basic food groups. Some nutritionists believe that certain micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals) can improve mental health, or that deficiencies in these micro-nutrients can make you feel worse. If you don't think you're getting enough vitamins and minerals from your food, it might be worth taking supplements.

As with everything else, nutrition is one part of managing your depression and probably won't be a cure in itself. Many claims of health benefits from supplementing nutrients have not been well studied or scientifically proven; much of the evidence is anecdotal. Before starting to take supplements, read as much as you can about them, and for anything other than a general multivitamin, consult a qualified nutritionist or your doctor first.
==St. John's wort==
St. John's wort has received a lot of press as being a &quot;natural anti-depressant&quot;. Studies have shown that it may indeed be effective against depression, and works in a similar way to modern anti-depressants, but with fewer side-effects. Talk to your doctor if you want to try St. John's wort, and don't start taking it if you are already on anti-depressants.
==Omega-3==
Omega-3 is a type of fatty acid found in oily fish like salmon, mackerel and sardines, eggs and flax seeds (linseeds). It is thought to be beneficial to general health as well as brain health. Some studies have shown that it may help speed up recovery from depression.
==Folic acid==
==Vitamin B==

A deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may contribute to symptoms of depression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Holons and a Holonic Society ==

The concept of a holon forms one of the central ideas proposed for forming technical side of a technate.

===Holons===

The word ''holon'' comes from the Greek ''holos,'' meaning 'whole', and ''-on,'' meaning 'part'.  The word aptly captures the duality of entities which are at once single, distinct en­tities, and at the same time parts of a more comprehensive whole.   For exam­ple, a cell in your body falls under the holon category. Cell exists as a distinct, living entity; it has inputs, out­puts, and a distinct cell wall defining its interface with the rest of the world. A cell, however, consists of smaller and more fundamental parts, such as RNA, DNA, mitochondria etc. Each component can be studied as a separate entity; however, each component can be broken down further - into molecules, atoms, and ultimately to quarks. This decomposition of cells is characteristic for a holonic organisation.

We can also go the other way, and see that cells group togeth­er with other cells to become organs.  Organs, in turn, form parts of the human body.  Here, we see that holonic organisation also supports composition as well.

We can find many other examples of this part-whole relation­ship in the world around us.  Ants, for example, exhibit such characteristics. We can study ants as separate entities in their own rights; but, they also form parts of a society. Trees and forests as well as people and cities form other examples. More artificial examples would include agents that have been used in Distributed Artificial Intelligence and even the humble sub routine in a program.

===Characteristic of Holons and Holonic Systems===

In addition to the part-whole characteristic, holons have a number of other characteristics:

* Each holon can function autonomously. It means that each holon carries out its own activities without the direction of oth­er holons; yet, it still forms a part of, and contributes to, the overall functioning of a larger system.

* Holons naturally form distributed systems. This comes on from the autonomous attribute.

* Each holon has a simple, singular task to perform and con­centrates exclusively on that task.  The system accomplishes larger  scale  tasks  through  the  combination of a number of holons, either through combining them together to form a large­er  holon,  or  through  cooperation  or  competition  between holons.

* Although holons function autonomously, their interaction with other holons may yield complex flows of information in order to achieve each interacting holon’s goals. Therefore, a holon must process and respond to in-bound data from exter­nal sources, as well as provide other holons with requested information.

* As holons interact, the sum of their actions could become greater than the action of the individual holon.  Some exam­ples could include ant hills, where a number of ants cooperate to construct a mound, yet no single ant would have the capa­bility to achieve the construction individually.  The construction of cities forms another example. The shapes of many of the world's cities were not the result of centralised plan­ning.  Nonetheless, the organisation and interaction of a num­ber of people and organisations has resulted in some of the most spectacular cities on Earth, such as San  Francisco,  New York, Rome, and others.
The Advantages of Holonic Systems

Holons are particularly well suited for complex and/or dis­tributed systems. Some reasons follow:

* Scalability  As each holon has the property of being au­tonomous, it can function with little or no knowledge of other holons.  Thus, we can add additional holons to the system, de­pending on the system in question, without affecting the oper­ation of the previously existing holons.  As additional holons are contributed to the system, a coherent organisation will tend to form naturally, such as a hierarchy where higher-lev­el, more abstract holons manage lower-level, more detail-ori­ented holons.  Consider, as another example, any plant or ani­mal, which starts as one cell, but which divides and grows to many cells, forming organs along the way.

* Robustness  Robustness also results from the autonomous na­ture of a holon.  Just as we can add holons, we can also re­move them without, in general, affecting the functioning of other holons or the system as a whole. For example: human body can lose many cells without even noticing it. It can even survive the loss of a substantial por­tion of the body, such as a limb.

* Simplicity of control As each holon has a simple, usually singular, task to accomplish, it only needs a simple control mechanism, which can be understood more easily when compared to a centralised control system.

=== Disadvantages of Holonic System ===

Distributed and autonomous holons, for all their advantages, also have some disadvantages compared to centralised mechanisms.

* Tragedy of the commons  The autonomous attribute can lead holons to consume shared resources without consideration for others, and end up taking more than their fair share.  This could limit the ability of other holons to work, and may even bring an end to the common resources. Example: a farmer allowing his cow to eat all the common grass, preventing other farmers from grazing their cattle.

* Losing their way  We can see another problem with the autonomous attribute. Autonomous holons could conduct activi­ties that do not contribute to the overall goal of the system. They could even conduct activities that are contrary to the overall goal.  Cancer cells would form an example of holons that have gone out of control and became a danger to the sys­tem as a whole.

The root cause of the first deficiency we can usually at­tribute to a lack of negative feedback in the holon’s opera­tion.   For example, if the farmer knew a priori of the impact the cow would have on the field, and therefore other farmers, he would take steps to alleviate the problem before it got out of hand. The farmer would need a bigger picture to achieve this in­sight. However, this leads to one possible solution, where a higher-level holon could administer lower-level holons. Not an ideal situation. It is pre­ferred that the other farmers communicate with the offending farmer, so that issues are resolved locally and quickly.

We may, however, have difficulty understanding the cause for the latter deficiency, since there is a number of issues to consider. For in­stance, simple miscommunication or misunderstanding may result in an erroneous interpretation of the holon's goal. Indeed, scientists have traced most causes of genetic defects that, in a sense, we can consider as miscommunication in genetic programming of the cell.  We could see another cause as the autonomous nature of the holon, which could deliberately decide to change its own goals.  The &quot;bait-and-switch’’ manoeuvre that con-artists and other petty criminals use exemplify this.

=== A Holonic Structure for Future Technate ===

Peak oil could mean that future societies need to localise to reduce energy consumption, as future societies may well have less energy available than present-day societies.  Climate change could mean that future societies may need a high level of cooperation to handle an increasingly hostile world.  This could mean a social structure that has both the characteristic of being composed of parts and the characteris­tic of networking.  This would represent a different form of organisation from our current national, centralised system. Holons represent a different approach towards governing systems that has the characteristic of being composed of parts. Thus, a holonic structure represents a potentially vi­able form for future society.

As a means of allowing this organisation, we propose the fol­lowing holoarchy:

1. Individuals

2. Groups

3. Zones

4. Areas

5. Sectors

6. Technate

Individuals form the basic building blocks of societies, and each individual has his/her own goals and objectives as well as skills and interests.  Any social structure should take this into account. The author hopes that the holonic structure would allow people to utilise their interests and skills to achieve their own desires in such a way as to con­tribute to the whole structure.

To achieve this, individuals form interest groups, such as research, medical, and food production. Individuals who have skills and interests in common with a specific group could choose to join that group. However, not all groups would have specialised interests; some groups would have a more mixed membership.  This would depend on the size of the group and the number of members.

Groups maintain goals and monitor projects. The goals of any group should be compatible with the overall goals of the technocracy. Likewise, the projects within the group should contribute, in some way, to the group and thus to the imple­mentation of technocracy.

Some projects, of course, may turn out to be too large for a single group to undertake (e.g., repairing the Golden Gate bridge or the construction of an airplane).  To deal with this, groups can form areas, where areas act in sim­ilar ways to groups.  Instead of being composed of individu­als, however, areas are comprised of groups (think of a consortium or standards organisation, like OSI, OMG, and ANSI). Areas cooperate with each other to fulfil the goals defined for each area. Those goals, like the goals of groups, are compatibile with the goals of technocracy.  And, of course, the projects run within areas will have similarity to the projects of groups in that they would also contribute to the goals of technocracy but on a larger scale.

Again, like areas, sectors form the next level up in the holoarchy and run larger projects. Areas compose sectors.

The technate forms the final layer of the holoarchy.  This layer runs large scale projects over the whole operational area of the technate and has goals in accordance with technocracy's goals.

Thus, the whole system becomes a gestalt - one composed of individual, goal orientated parts that use projects to achieve their goals.  As each part lines up with other parts in the holoarchy, through cooperation, the system achieves the over­all goals of the technate.


===Control and Direction in the Holoarchy===

As each group, area, or sector can act autonomously, the sys­tem has the potential to develop some problems, as noted above.  Some of the holons could end up repeating work that other holons have conducted and other holons could conduct work that does not contribute to the whole.

To prevent such problems, we propose a hierarchical structure that lays on top of the holoarchy. This overlapping structure would have the following goals:

1. Maintain direction of the system

2.  Act as a communications channel to facilitate cooperation between holons

3. Ensure efficient utilisation of resources, thus preventing unnecessary repetition of work

The proposed structure would follow the classic Technocracy, Inc. sequence structure with a board at the top which acts to direct the whole system.  A number of functional sequences would then form under the board, with the director of each se­quence being represented on the board. For example, the structure could have functional sequences for health, research, manufacturing, mining, recycling, energy, transporta­tion and space.

Each sequence would have a sub-sequence for each sector.  So, for example, the Sequence of Research would have a number of Sector Sequences of Research below it.  Each sector sequence would then have area sub-sequences below it, and the area se­quences would have group sub-sequences below it.   Each sequence at each level would have a director.  For example, the Sequences of Research would have a Director of the Sequence of Research and the various sector research sequences would have various Directors of Sector Sequences of Research and so on for areas and groups.  We can see this as being analogous to a commercial company in present-day economic systems, where you have a Chief Technology Officer, Director of Research, with indi­vidual project directors below them.

This means that an individual would have membership both in a group and a sequence and, hopefully, will actively participate in a project.


===Roles of Directors===

Directors of each sequence have overall responsibility of ensuring that each holon contributes to the overall goal of technocracy.  Thus, the directors at each level have to approve each project, and can cancel a project if that project has wandered away from the goals of technocracy.  The director can also cancel a project if it is in conflict with another project; for example, if two holons attempted to do the same pro­ject.  However, once a project has started, and so long as it remains compatible with the goals of technocracy, the director has no control over the project in keeping with the autonomous nature of the holon.

Each project would have a project manager. The project manager has the administrative responsibility of running the project, including the allocation of resources, time schedule, etc. The manager runs the project without any inter­ference of the directors as long as the project remains within the goals.

For projects that involve cooperation or coordination between a number of holons, the holon director has the responsibility of ensuring communication with other holons. For example, within an area the Area Director must ensure that all holons have adequate communications in order to allow them to conduct their projects.  Thus, the sequences act as a communications channel for each holon.

===Goals===

Goals become the most import attribute of the above structure. Goals give direction and purpose to the system as a whole.

Technocrats have the following top level goal:

The highest standard of living for the longest time possi­ble.

To achieve this goal, sequences and holons may have other goals, but those other goals must contribute to the overall goal.  For example, the Sequence of Research could have the goal of conducting an energy survey and may run one or more project to achieve that goal.  However, the goal of the energy survey also contributes to the overall goal of technocracy in that it determines the kind and quantity of resources available and the energy re­quired to build a sustainable society that has a high standard of living.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is all about the things you can do to help yourself, but don't forget to get help from other people too. Clinical depression is a serious mental illness that can be seriously debilitating and even fatal. It's very important to get the professional help you need and to make the most of whatever services are available to you. Health systems vary widely from country to country, but the basic advice here still applies.

;First time?
Some people may be afraid of getting help in the first place. It's common to feel embarrassed or ashamed; you may be unwilling to admit that you can't &quot;cope&quot;. Or you may think that your problems aren't serious enough to bother the doctor with, or that they'll think you're being silly. Some people may try to tell you that people choose to be depressed, or that you just need to &quot;pull yourself together&quot;. Although they often mean well, usually these people don't have any first hand experience of serious mental health issues. They don't know what you're feeling, only ''you'' do. If your depression is making your life unbearable, or having a negative effect on your relationships, job or family life, then it's time to get help. Make an appointment to see your GP or family doctor and tell them how you feel. If you're worried about getting it out once you're in front of them, write a few things down that you want to say before you go in. Doctors nowadays are very experienced with dealing with people with mental health problems, and often have some training in this area. Attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few decades. You won't be laughed out of the door, or carted off to the asylum. Remember too, that doctors are human, and may not give you the exact response you would hope for. If your doctor is dismissive or unhelpful, try and see a different one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;A Note on Anti-depressants
[[File:Prozac pills cropped.jpg|right|200px|Fluoxetine pills]]
Prescribing anti-depressant medication is one of the main ways that doctors treat depression. The use of anti-depressants can be controversial. As with all issues related to your health, it’s important to educate yourself. Read as much as you can and don’t be afraid to ask your doctor any questions. If you are taking anti-depressants, it’s important to be aware of the side effects they may have on you. When you are prescribed a new medication, always take the opportunity to talk to your doctor. Ask them any questions about any possible side effects or how long it should take before you will feel different. Read the information provided with the drug. Report any unexpected or distressing side effects to your doctor.

If you decide you want to stop taking anti-depressants, talk to your doctor first. Your decisions may be affected by your mood. Also, some anti-depressants can have severe side effects if you stop them abruptly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Get Moving!
Exercise can be extremely beneficial to mental health. When you are depressed, exercise may be the last thing you feel like doing, but even gentle exercise can lift your mood. Exercise makes the body release endorphins which lift your mood for the time you are exercising. It can also be very effective for helping you to focus your mind and think clearly.

The type and intensity of exercise that will help you the most depends on what you enjoy and how physically fit you are. If you are out of the habit of regular exercise then one of the best ways to get moving is to start walking. This is also a low-stress way to force yourself out of the house if you are becoming isolated. Set yourself goals, starting with something fairly easy, say a five minute walk up the road. Each day, try to go a little further until you are walking at least 30 minutes a day. Try to vary your route and try to find pleasant surroundings to walk through. If you live in the countryside or near or a park, so much the better. If you have a dog, then that can be a great motivator for getting out for walks. If not, consider offering your services as a dog walker.

If you are functioning quite well and already manage to leave the house every day, then you need to set different goals for yourself. Maybe you are already getting some degree of physical activity, but it could be increased or focused. Why don't you take up a new sport, or join your local gym? Going to the gym doesn't have to mean working out on exercise machines or pumping iron (although that may appeal to you!) See what other activities or classes your gym provides; you  may be able to take part in aerobics, kick-boxing or squash. They might also help you with setting personal fitness goals. If you don't have a local gym, or don't want to join, look for adverts in the local paper that might advertise classes, groups or teams looking for members. Look on the internet.
;Some ideas
If you want to increase your activity levels, it's the perfect time to try something completely new.

&lt;big&gt;'''Thymoma Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;


*There is no universally accepted system; no AJCC staging exists
*Historically, a classifiaction system used both histological features and clinical behavior
*Masaoka staging is the clinically used staging system, although it may not be predictive for thymic carcinoma
*GETT staging is the surgical staging system, and may have better correlation with outcome
*A meta-analysis from UCLA suggests that evaluation of transcapsular extension (Stage I vs. Stage IIa) is of no clinical value, as they have same DFS and OS outcomes



'''Historical Classification'''
*Benign Thymoma (histologically and behaviorally benign)
*Malignant Thymoma (invasive)
**Type I - histologically benign, but behaving aggressively with local invasion
**Type II (&quot;thymic carcinoma&quot;) - histologically malignant, aggresive behavior

*Stage I - Macroscopically and microscopically completely encapsulated 
*Stage II - Macroscopic invasion into surrounding fatty tissues or mediastinal pleura or microscopic invasion into the capsule
*Stage III - Macroscopic invasion into adjacent organs or intrathoracic metastases
*Stage IVA - Pleural or pericardial implants/dissemination
*Stage IVB - Nodal or hematogenous metastases


'''GETT Staging'''
*Stage IA - Encapsulated, completely resected
*Stage IB - Macroscopically completely resected but suspicion of mediastinal adhesions or potential capsular invasion at surgery
*Stage II - Invasive tumor, completely resected
*Stage IIIA - Invasive tumor, subtotal resection
*Stage IIIB - Invasive tumor, biopsy alone
*Stage IVa - Supraclav or pleural met
*Stage IVb - Distant metastases</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Thymoma Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Arises from thymus epithelial cells
*Mostly considered indolent, but does have potential for local invasion, pleural dissemination, and distant metastases
*Malignant thymoma (see below, but in the SEER study defined as microscopic or macroscopic evidence of invasion) is rare; there were 849 cases in US SEER database between 1973-1998 (incidence 0.15/100,000)
*Age typically 40-60 years; though highest incidence in 70's
*M:F ~1:1
*20% of primary mediastinal neoplasms in adults
*Risk factors:
**Myasthenia gravis in 35-50% (conversely, 75% patients with MG have thymus abnormalities, of these 85% have hyperplasia and 15% have thymoma)
**Red cell aplasia in 5%
**Hypogammaglobulinemia in 5%
**Ionizing radiation
*Clinical presentation:
**~1/3 asymptomatic, found incidentally on CXR
**~1/3 local symptoms (chest pain, neck mass, [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/SVC_Syndrome|SVC syndrome]]
**~1/3 concurrent diagnosis with myasthenia gravis


*'''SEER; 2003''' (1973-1998) PMID 12712448 -- &quot;Malignant thymoma in the United States: demographic patterns in incidence and associations with subsequent malignancies.&quot; (Engels EA, Int J Cancer. 2003 Jul 1;105(4):546-51.)
**Population study. Malignant thymoma (vs. benign thymoma and possibly vs. thymic carcinoma) reviewed. 849 cases (0.15/100,000). Male slightly more than females. Highest incidence in Pacific Islanders (0.49/100,000)
**Follow-up malignancies: Sarcoma 11.1x, NHL 4.7x (all after RT), GI cancers 1.8x

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Tumor_Thymoma1.JPG|thumb]]
*Mediastinum borders
**Superior: thoracic inlet
**Inferior: diaphragm
**Anterior: sternum
**Posterior: vertebral column
**Lateral: parietal pleural
*Thymoma typically presents in the anterior/superior mediastinum
*Spread is mainly local invasion; pleural mets may occur in more advanced disease

==Histology==
*Thymus is unique among human organs because its &quot;normal&quot; appearance varies considerably depending on age of the patient
**At birth, weight is 10-35gm
**Functional maturity during childhood/adolescence, with weight 20-50gm
**In adults, progressive atrophy of thymic tissue, and replacement with fat
**In elderly, weight 5-15gm
*Two predominant cell types in normal thymus
**Thymic epithelial cells
**Lymphocytes (T-cell lineage)
*Thymus anatomy
**Two fused lobes, comprising of multiple lobules
**Each lobule has an outer cortex and inner medulla
*Thymic epithelial tumors arise from thymic epithelial cells, but due to the role of thymus in lymphocyte maturating, they may predominately contain lymphocytes
*There are multiple classifications of thymic epithelial tumors, making things confusing for clinicians
**The WHO 1999/2004 morphologic classification is the most commonly accepted, and has been shown to have correlation with clinical behavior and outcome
**A proposal has been made for a more simplified classification parallel to other carcinomas (thymoma, atypical thymoma, thymic carcinoma)


'''Bernatz Classification System for Thymoma (1961)'''
*Spindle Cell (favorable outcome)
*Lymphocytic
*Epithelial (aggressive)
*Mixed (aggressive)


'''WHO Classification of Thymic Epithelial Tumors (1999/2004)''' - based on shape and lymphocyte/epithelial ratio
*&lt;u&gt;Thymoma&lt;/u&gt; (Type A, B, and AB)
**Type A - Spindle/ovoid shape, homogeneous neoplastic cells, few lymphocytes; equivalent to &quot;spindle cell tumor&quot;
**Type AB - Mix of Type A and Type B, with foci rich in lymphocytes
**Type B - Round/polygonal shape, with varying proportion of lymphocytes/epithelial cells, and increasing degree of atypia
***Type B1 - Resembles normal thymus, with areas resembling both cortex and medulla. Few neoplastic epithelial cells, predominance of lymphocytes; equivalent to &quot;lymphocyte-rich tumor&quot;
***Type B2 - Increased number of epithelial thymic cells, among populations of lymphocytes; equivalent to &quot;mixed tumors&quot;
***Type B3 - Predominately neoplastic epithelial cells, more atypia, with few lymphocytes
*&lt;u&gt;Thymic carcinoma&lt;/u&gt; (Type C)
**Over features of malignancy independent of shape, no immature lymphocytes
**Multiple histologic subtypes


'''Suster and Moran (1999)''' - based on degree of differentiation; PMID 16627265
*Thymoma - well differentiated
*Atypical thymoma - moderately differentiated
*Thymic carcinoma - poorly differentiated


*'''Osaka; 2002''' PMID 11857293 -- &quot;The World Health Organization histologic classification system reflects the oncologic behavior of thymoma: a clinical study of 273 patients.&quot; (Okumura M, Cancer. 2002 Feb 1;94(3):624-32.)
**Retrospective. 273 with thymoma (no thymic carcinoma).
**Invasive by class: A 11%, AB 42%, B1 47%, B2 69%, B3 85%
**Great vessel invasion by class: A 0%, AB 4%, B1 7%, B2 17%, B3 19%
**20-year OS: A 100%, AB 87%, B1 91%, B2 59%, B3 36%
**By Masaoka stage: I 89%, II 91%, III 49%, IV 0%
**Multivariate predictors: Masaoka and WHO class; not related R-status, great vessel involvement
**Conclusion: WHO histologic appearance reflects oncologic behavior

==Work-Up==
*CT scan
*MRI yield over CT minimal
*Serum AFP and b-HCG to rule out [[Radiation_Oncology/Germ_cell|germ cell tumors]]


*'''UCLA; 2008''' -- PMID 18517274 -- &quot;Evidence-based pathology and the pathologic evaluation of thymomas: transcapsular invasion is not a significant prognostic feature.&quot; (Gupta R, Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2008 Jun;132(6):926-30.)
**Meta-analysis. 21 retrospective publications, 2451 cases (Stage I 1419, Stage II 1032)
**Outcome: No difference in DFS or OS for Stage I and Stage II
**Conclusion: Evaluation of transcapsular invasion is of no clinical value in tumors that lack invasion of neighboring organs or the pleurra

*'''MSKCC; 1999''' (1949-1993) PMID 9475524 -- &quot;Thymic carcinoma: current staging does not predict prognosis.&quot; (Blumberg D, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1998 Feb;115(2):303-8; discussion 308-9.)
**Retrospective. 43 patients, Masaoka Stage I 7%, Stage II 35%, Stage III 47%, Stage IVA 11%. Well-differentiated 16/43, type II malignant thymomas 27/43
**Outcome: OS 5-years 65%, 10-years 35%; recurrence rate 65% and 75%
**Predictors: multivariate only invasion of innominate vessels, not age, sex, size, or Masaoka stage
**Conclusion: high rate of recurrence; invasion of the innominate vessels poor sign. Masaoka staging not useful for thymic carcinoma, only for thymoma
**Masaoka comment: PMID 10047676

==Treatment Overview==
*Total thymectomy with en bloc removal of all affected structures is the surgical procedure of choice.  Degree of resection appears to affect prognosis (GTR &gt; STR &gt; biopsy alone)
*Patients with Stage I disease and R0 resection do not need adjuvant treatment
*Adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage II disease is controversial; adjuvant RT may be indicated
**Recent pathological meta-analysis (see above, PMID 18517274) suggests that there is no difference in outcome between Stage I and IIa
**If pleural invasion (T2b), should consider RT
**If close (&lt;1mm) surgical margin, can consider RT
**If &quot;higher&quot; grade (e.g. WHO B3), can consider RT
*Adjuvant RT appears indicated with Stage III/IVA or subtotal resection (R1 or R2)
**'''NCCN Adjuvant Guidelines (2012)''' - Conventional fractionation (1.8-2Gy per fraction)
***45-50 Gy for clear margins
***54 Gy for residual microscopic disease
***60 Gy for gross residual disease
**'''NCCN for Unresectable Disease''' - 60-70 Gy with conventional fractionation (1.8-2Gy per fraction)



===Adjuvant Radiation Therapy===
'''Randomized'''
*'''Peking; 1999''' (China)(1981-1996) PMID 11593579 -- &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy for stage I thymoma: a prospective randomized trial in 29 cases.&quot; (Zhang H, Chin Med J (Engl). 1999 Feb;112(2):136-8.)
**Randomized. 29 patients, Stage I, age &lt;65 years. Arm 1) surgery alone vs. Arm 2) surgery + adjuvant RT. RT AP and/or two anterior oblique wedge fields. If lymphocytic predominant, used 50 Gy/25 fractions, if epithelial/mixed used 60 Gy/30 fractions.
**Outcome: No recurrence or metastases in either group; 10-year OS surgery 92% vs. surgery + RT 88% (NS)
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT not necessary for Stage I thymoma


'''Retrospective'''
*'''Indiana University/SEER; 2010''' (1973-2005) PMID 19427738 -- &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy after surgical resection of thymoma: differing roles in localized and regional disease.&quot; (Forquer JA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):440-5. Epub 2009 May 8.)
**SEER database analysis. 901 patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma, surgically resected; excluded patients dying within 3 months after surgery. SEER localized (Masaoka Stage I) stage 275 (31%), regional (Masaoka Stage II-III) stage 626 (69%). Post-op RT in 65%
**Outcome:
***SEER localized disease - Radiation may cause adversely impact 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS) PORT 91% vs. No PORT 98% (SS).
***SEER regional disease - 5-year CSS 91% vs 86% (NS); 5-year OS 76% vs 66%
**Conclusion: Postop RT no benefit in Masaoka Stage I, but possible OS benefit in Stage II-III

**Retrospective. 47 thymic tumors treated by adjuvant RT (thymoma 78%, thymic carcinoma 12%; Stage II 70%, Stage III 26%, Stage IVA 4%). RT dose 26-60 Gy. Median F/U 10.6 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS 73% (thymoma 77% vs. thymic carcinoma 33%, SS), DFS 67%, median time-to-recurrence 8.3 years
**Stage II 5-year OS: RT dose &lt;=45 Gy 59% vs. &gt;45 Gy 100%; DFS 37% vs. 100%
**Predictors: lower disease stage (II vs. III/IV), surgery (resection vs. bx), higher RT dose (&lt;=45 vs. &gt;45 Gy). Thymic carcinoma histology no impact on OS, only DFS
**Conclusion: Post-op RT should be &gt;45 Gy, may improve DFS and OS, especially stage II

*'''Okinawa; 2002''' (Japan)(1979-1998) PMID 11920495 -- &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy for patients with completely resected thymoma: a multi-institutional, retrospective review of 103 patients.&quot; (Ogawa K, Cancer. 2002 Mar 1;94(5):1405-13.)
**Retrospective. 103 patients, completely resected thymoma + adjuvant RT. Masaoka Stage I 17%, Stage II 59%, Stage III 24%. RT median 40 Gy, 51% IFRT vs. 49% whole mediastinum. No chemo. Median F/U 9.3 years
**Outcome: 10-year OS 81%, Stage I 100%, Stage II 90%, Stage III 48%
**Recurrence: Stage I 0%, Stage II 10%, Stage III 44%; no recurrence in-field, 70% within pleura. If no pleural invasion initially, 0% pleural failure; but if pleural invasion initially, then 38% pleural failure. No dose-response seen (&lt;40 Gy vs. 40 Gy vs. &gt;40 Gy)
**Conclusion: RT to 40 Gy effective, if pathologic pleural invasion, mediastinal RT insufficient

*'''FNCLCC; 1995''' PMID 7790251 &quot;Radiotherapy and chemotherapy for invasive thymomas: a multicentric retrospective review of 90 cases.&quot; (Mornex, Int J of Radiat Onc, Biol, Phys.  1995; 32(3): 651-9)
**Retrospective review of 90 cases tx'd with incomplete surgery or bx alone, GETT III-IVa.  Pts received surgery + xrt (median 50 Gy to tumor bed + margin, 2/3 tx'd to supraclav).
**Cumulative local control at 8.5 yrs was 66%; if subtotal resection local control at 5yr 64% vs 39% if bx alone.  Conclusion: Need &gt;50 Gy given the high rate of local failure w/ +margins/bx alone.

**Retrospective. 103 patients with thymoma. Masaoka Stage I 42%, Stage II 20%, Stage III 35%, Stage IV 3%
**5-year outcome: OS Stage I 67%, Stage II 86%, Stage III 69%; RFS 100%, 58%, 53%
**Recurrences: R0 Stage I 0%; R0 Stage II-III no RT 53% vs. +RT 0%; also compared with R1/R2 Stage II-III +RT 21%. Recurrence rate for entire cohort: no RT 28% vs. +RT 5%
**Conclusion: R0 resection alone inadequate in Stage II-III

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obviously, one of the most important ways you will want to collect input is from a field which accepts a single line of text, and we have already covered basic usage of the '''gtk.Entry''' field in earlier chapters.  The GTK+ toolkit, however, has many more widgets for receiving input, such as check boxes, drop down boxes, radio lists, large multi-line text boxes, toggle buttons and date/time choosers - just to name a few.

This chapter takes you through the basics of the most common input widgets, how to configure them to suit your application, and how to retrieve data from them.  We will be using the following example programme as a reference point - don't be frightened if there is anything in it which you don't understand, things will be explained in due course.  Copy the following source code and save it as a python file:

{| style=&quot;border:solid 1px #999999; background-colour: #22HH9D; padding: 5px; margin:10px;&quot;
| &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot; line&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important to be able to understand how to effectively interpret and write social research.

==Key Terms==
Key terms that are important in understanding the reading and writing of social research include:

*'''Abstract''': A summary of a research article. The abstract usually begins the article and states the purpose of the research, the methods used, and the major findings.
*'''Research Monograph''': A book-length research report, either published or unpublished. This is distinguished from a textbook, a book of essays, a novel and so forth.
*'''Search Engine''': A computer program designed to locate where specified terms appear on websites throughout the World Wide Web.
*'''URL''': Web address, typically beginning with &quot;http://&quot;; stands for &quot;uniform resource locator&quot; or &quot;universal resource locator.&quot; 
*'''Plagiarism''': Presenting someone else's words or thoughts as though they were your own, constituting intellectual theft.

==Reading Social Research==

There are many things to keep in mind while reading social research. Social researchers have access to resources like the internet and libraries for organizing a review of the literature. Keep in mind that reading scholarly literature is different form reading other works. Begin by reading the abstract, skimming the piece, and reading the conclusion to get a good sense of what it's about. Readers of social science literature should also form questions and take notes as they go along. When reading a research report, be sure to consider theoretical orientation, sampling, and other data-collection methods.

When conducting research, sources are of outermost importance. It is always beneficial to check the sources of newspaper reports, academic articles, and even books, as there may be information that is left out or simply a more in-depth information. A researcher should always prioritize academic works before any popular media sources or periodicals, because information in those can often be biased and unreliable, as it is often &quot;third-hand&quot;. Academic works, on the other hand are subject to intensive reviews by other scholars. 

When locating literature, the ease of access does not always mean usefulness. As such, online databases make it real easy to locate literature on the subject of interest but there are often way too many and it is hard to distinguish the truly important ones. This is why, for a good research, a researcher should take the time to review all the relevant works, in order to narrow the literature spectrum, and draw out what is important for his/her research. This does not mean that internet can not be used as a powerful research tool, yet a researcher should be very selective when choosing sources.

==Journals vs. Books==

Unlike novels, journals are structured in a formal manner opposed to the subjective ways a novel is formulated (Ex: Novels encourage the reader to finish the piece with suspense in many cases). A journal introduces an abstract which has two purposes: first, to give a broad overview of what the piece will entail and what is being researched; second, to set  the framework leading into the journal. Upon this, the summary outlines the remainder of the journal and the conclusion offer a summary to the result. If the reader has questions concerning procedure or how the the experiment was conducted, he/she may continue to read the journal for the details. Among these details, heading should be applied within the article for easy reference to what questions you may wish to ask. For example, methods would entail how the procedure was carried out as well as the sampling groups selected. Graphs can usually be identified by skimming through the article which is another good way to summarize the journal before you read the piece in its entirety. One helpful tactic to use when reviewing a journal is recording questions before hand and during the reading to better examine what the journal offers and outline any particular faults/recommendations to better the piece.

Research formatted to a book are similar to journals and can be referred to as '''research monographs'''. Instead of using am abstract, these lengthy books offer a preface that focuses on purpose, method, and main findings of the study. This preface can also be written more informally to make the study an easier read to the readers. Considering graphs and harts, it is ideal to skim though the book similar to a journal to grasp the general feel of how the piece is written. Also, reading the full piece of material is ideal. However, sometimes selecting only portions of the work to read or skimming through in search of material that is of particular interest as opposed to the whole body of work may be ideal to save time.

'''Identifying Academic Journals:'''

•Authors' academic affiliations and contact information (usually email)
•Begin with an abstract of the article
•Reference list at the end
•Tend to be exclusively black and white

Academic journals are typically edited by full-time faculty members at major universities. An editor’s roles include soliciting articles, arranging reviews, and making final decisions as to what gets published in the journal. Editors generally serve 3-5 year terms, often without pay, as a service to the profession. Every article is reviewed by 2-3 professionals in the same field, and articles are sent to reviewers who have established publication records in the same area. This has both benefits and detriments—reviewers can make legitimate contributions; however, they can also reject new ideas that do not confirm to their beliefs. An article can be accepted, rejected, or given a “revise and resubmit.” Publishers range from an academic or commercial press to a professional association. The responsibility of the publisher is to handle printing, distribution, and finances.

==Goals to Meet When Writing a Literature Review==
There are four goals that should be met when writing a literature review:
1. '''Demonstrate familiarity with the body of knowledge'''
-cite important authors and show that you understand their main points and findings

2. '''Show the path of previous research and how your project can be linked to it'''
-organize your review in a historical way, starting with general sources and narrowing down to more specific sources

3. '''Summarize what is already known in the field'''
-weave the sources together to integrate and interpret their meanings

4. '''Learn from previous research and generate new ideas'''
-identify existing gaps, offer explanations for your ideas that may help yourself and others gain a clear understanding

==Evaluating the Quality of Internet Materials==
&lt;u&gt;How to evaluate the quality of Internet materials:&lt;/u&gt;
*Who/what is the author of the website?
*Is the site advocating a particular point of view?
*Does the website give accurate and complete references?
*Are the data up-to-date?
*Are the data official?
*Is it a university research site?
*Do the data seem consistent with data from other sites? Is the site making extraordinary claims?

==Elements of a Proper Citation==
&lt;u&gt;Elements of a proper citation for internet materials:&lt;/u&gt;
*Title
*Author
*Publisher information
*Date and time site was accessed
*URL; web address

When citing sources, proper grammar and spelling should always be used. Also, the researcher needs to consider which type of style to use. (MLA, APA, ASA)

===ASA Style===
'''Use of ASA Style'''
*ASA style uses parenthetical referencing in the writings, and has full references appearing at the end of the sentence. (ex. Smith 2008)
** When referring to a specific page or section of the article, and not the entire article, page numbers are to be used. (ex. Smith 2008:16)

==Sections of a Research Paper==
'''Parts of an effective research paper'''

1. Start with and an overview
* Provide a short overview of what is being researched, and the main findings. Introduction should be both engaging and readable.
2. The body
* The main body is where findings will be presented--tables and graphs are effective ways to get a point across.
3. Methodology
* Be sure to include; population,sample frame, sample method, sample size,data collection method and data processing and analysis.
** Be sure to clearly present information in table or graph form.
4. Conclusions and Summary
* Review all significant findings, review all shortcomings, and suggest future research. 
** The conclusion section can be more informal. In this section, opinions are to be expressed; this is the only section where persuasive writing is tolerated.

==Helpful Hints for Writing a Research Paper==
'''Keys to writing a research paper'''
*Keep the sentences simple, stay away from using subordinate clauses and other complex sentence structures.
*Keep average lengths of the paragraphs to around five sentences.
*Always write in the third person.
*Writing in a passive voice is very important.
*Never express opinion in first person.

'''Six suggestions for writing a research paper (George Orwell)'''
*Avoid metaphors or others figures of speech.
*Never use a long word where a short one will do.
*If it is possible to cut a word out, do so.
*Never use passive tense when the active can be used instead.
*Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon if you can thing of an everyday English equivalent.
*Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

==Regular School Paper vs. Research Paper==
'''Regular school paper v. Research paper'''
*Normal school papers are usually essays or library papers. In essays the writer will present the opinion of the author but not any new facts. In a library paper, information that is already known about a subject is presented. Whereas a research paper is suppose to provide an original contribution to society about that certain topic.
* The writer must review all the literature on the subject, similar to a library paper, and then the writer must make an original contribution to the subject.
* The writer must then make an interpret the new findings, with this part the reader may or not not agree, similar to an essay.
* The original contribution discussed in the research paper can be a new theory, new data, new analysis, or new interpretation of facts that are already known.

==Quantitative Research Papers==
'''Quantitative research papers''' are usually highly formulaic.
*Introduction, presentation of the problem, literature review
* Sampling, methods, variable definition
* Results
* Discussion and Conclusion
 
==Research Proposals==
'''Research Proposals'''
*The organization of research proposals are very similar to that of a research paper, minus the results section.
*Start with a very detailed literature review and methods sections.
*End with a discussion about why the proposed research is so important.
*Usually written in the first person.

==Goals of Literature Reviews==
The Four Goals of Literature Reviews (According to Neuman):
1. Demonstrate familiarity with a body of knowledge
*find (and cite) the important authors in the particular field
**the most important and/or influential authors will be cited many times by other authors
*show that you understand the main ideas and results of these authors
**you don't have to agree with them, but be sure to discuss their work and why it is significant (or not)
2. Show the path of prior research and how a current project is linked to it
*the easiest way is to organize research historically or chronologically 
**begin with the seminal/earliest works and trace the development of the field  
*use the funnel approach
**start with general sources (usually books), narrow to specific topic sources (usually journals)
3. Integrate and summarize what is known in an area
*work your sources into a coherent account of the debate over your research question
*don't summarize one source at a time
**instead, weave the sources together, interpreting what each means for the other
4. Help both yourself and the reader to learn from others and stimulate new ideas
*when you've finished reviewing the literature, you should have a better understanding of the material 
*when you organize what is known in a field, it becomes more apparent what gaps still exist
**this will both help focus your own research, as well as give others ideas about future research

==Abstracts==
An abstract is a summary of a research article. The abstract usually begins the article and states the purpose of the research, the methods used, and the major findings. Research monograph is a book length research report, either published or unpublished.  This is distinguished from a textbook, a book of essays, a novel, and so forth. A search engine is a computer program designed to locate where specific terms appear on Web sites throughout the World Wide Web. URL is a web address, typically beginning with http:// stands for uniform resource locator or universal research locator. Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s words or thoughts as though they were your own, constituting intellectual theft.

==Sources==
Popular books and magazines should be avoided. Although they may offer brief insight to a topic, true, credible sources are maintained in scholarly, peer-reviewed journals. The author of a popular book or magazine may get his/her information from second- or third-hand sources; they do not create information, rather they collect it. Social journals can be differentiated in that they do not contain many colored graphics, since these are expensive. The University of Pittsburgh offers two major sociological sources: PsychLit, EconLit, or Anthropological Index.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:BYR color wheel.svg|thumb|300px|Color Wheel]]
Before you go to the paint store, it might be a good idea to review color schemes.  For this, we turn to the color wheel, which shows all the colors of the rainbow cycling from red, to yellow, to blue, and cycling back to red again.  These are the ''primary colors'' and all the other colors in the wheel can be formed by mixing them together.  If equal amounts of primary colors are mixed, we get a secondary color: red and yellow make orange, yellow and blue make green, and blue and red make violet.

Mixing a secondary color with an adjacent primary forms a tertiary color.  For example, blue mixed with green makes blue-green.

Black and white are not considered colors, though they do affect the way colors look.  Mixing white with a color produces a tint.  Mixing black with a color produces a shade.

Many types of color schemes have been devised for all sorts of purposes, but we will focus on three:
* Monochromatic
* Complementary
* Analogous
From these three recipes, you can easily make ten color schemes (just choose a couple of different &quot;base&quot; colors for each until you have ten). 
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;
Image:Gablefront1.jpg|Monochromatic
Image:BHHouse.jpg|Complementary
File:Ivory McKusick 2.JPG|Analogous
&lt;/gallery&gt;
===Monochromatic===
In this scheme, only one color is used, but various tints and shades are combined, such as blue, light blue, and dark blue.  The painter may also use various tints, such as light blue, lighter blue, and a blue still lighter than that.
===Complementary===
Complementary colors are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as blue and orange, red and green, purple and yellow.

The high contrast between the colors creates a vibrant look, especially when used at full saturation. Complementary colors can be tricky to use in large doses.

===Analogous===
Also called harmonious colors, are colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. Some examples are green, light green, and yellow or red, orange and yellow. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are pleasing to the eye.

Hello

I bought a 780 Bertone. from 1990
Chassis number is: YV1 78 2 28 2 0 D 0 10 327
It amazes me to figure No. 10 is a 0 -?
That should be an L
The car is in the club's list of chassis number.

Can the club provide an explanation for that?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd like to make changes to this page to reflect a couple of important aspects that aren't mentioned in the original introduction.  While most individuals associate Behavior Analysis with the assessment and treatment of significant impairments (e.g., autism), the field of Behavior Analysis comprises both basic and applied branches, and is much more diverse than the layperson is normally led to believe.  This should be part of the introduction, as well as the role of B. F. Skinner and other important theorists in establishing the technology.</text>

:Hello, as the creator, I'm sorry if it comes off looking like spam. That wasn't my intention at all, and I despise spam. It's not even my favourite family tree website by far (and I do quite a lot of online genealogy). I was merely trying to dip my toes into Wikibooks, so to speak, and saw this page [[Genealogy]], which had some red links, so I picked one and wrote something about it. I'm still getting used to the way Wikibooks works - I'm far more used to Wikipedia - so if this kind of page is unacceptable here, then that's fine. I was just trying to add some useful content.

:If there is some way I could improve it, then I would appreciate suggestions. I realise it's only a positive portrayal of the website, but really, it's a useful website. That's all. Would it be better to not have any web-related content in this particular book? Over the past decade or so, the internet has become a huge part of genealogy and family history, with many people coming new to the hobby who only do it online. I would think it would be useful to have descriptions of valuable websites. FamilySearch, (like I said, not my particular favourite) is a well-known and popular one. Like I say, I'm fairly new to Wikibooks and don't want to unwittingly contravene guidelines. Just trying to help out.--[[User:Belovedfreak|Belovedfreak]] ([[User talk:Belovedfreak|talk]]) 18:45, 7 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

:I've just posted a message to [[User:QuiteUnusual]]. I removed the tag of this work but agree with issue raised by QU  
:&quot;Remember, this is for textbooks - it's not an encyclopedia. So, you need to think what this book is going to be - an instructional guide to boxing?&quot;
:So much that I similarly &lt;nowiki&gt;{{query}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tagged your other newly created pages [[Canada]] and [[Yokosuka]] as with that titles I can't see a subject matter that wouldn't be encyclopedic in nature, feel free to respond to the queries if you disagree on those pages discussions...
:In any case I'm willing to help you turn the [[Boxing]] stub into a working project, I think it has potential. If you lack material, ask me on.
:You should try to keep the focus on a single work at a time even if you don't get it into a usable stage, stubs can get deleted bu useful content will always survive.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:31, 8 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 4: Authentic (Real-World) Learning'''

===Overview ===
What is Authentic (real-world) Learning and Assessment? 
Authentic real world learning and assessment consist of constructivist theorists approaches that are learner centered. These learner centered principles move instruction away from the teacher and toward the learner or student. These principles are important to the teacher as they instruct their students. A constructivist learning design has been implemented that contain six important elements: Situation, Groupings, Bridge, Questions, Exhibit, and Reflections. Use of these elements by a teacher in their planning provoke the learner centered approach. We will look at each element in more detail now. Teachers may develop a &quot;situation&quot; for their students to experience or be a part of and able to explain. &quot;Grouping&quot; has to do with pairing students together either homogeneously or heterogeneously and in groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending on the situation. &quot;Bridge&quot; is tapping into a students prior knowledge to see what they already know, what they want to learn (a KWL chart is often used). While bridging, a student naturally has &quot;questions&quot; to ask or answer about the situation. Students then are encouraged to &quot;exhibit&quot; an understanding of their thinking or their learning and share it with others and finally &quot;reflect&quot; on their own learning.

===Rationale ===
Why is authentic (real-world) learning important to constructivism?. Advocates of constructivism say that a direct instruction approach turns children's into passive learners. With constructivist approaches, children focus on collaboration with others to produce knowledge and understanding. As schools approach and grow to meet constructivist goals it is important they require a new and appropriate forms of assessment. Having a range of assessments allows differentiation of student learning styles and yields  better more usable information to assess student learning. Assessment strategies include: Performance tasks, Portfolio development, and Scoring Rubrics. Other assessment tools include: Learning logs, Reflective journals, Graphic organizers, Interviews, Peer editing and Interactive Notebooks. These types of assessment tools help students develop problem solving skills and provide relevance and rigor. Most of all, it makes the student responsible for their own learning.

===Authentic Learning &amp; Assessment in Humanities and Language Arts ===
&quot;Real world&quot; themes are often used in Humanities and Language Arts and combine a variety of resources and activities to allow students to have many different types of authentic literacy learning experiences. Authentic literacy learning experiences are those that individuals would naturally have in real life. For example, you might go to a museum to see an exhibit about ancient Egypt. A booklet on mummies is available. As a follow-up to the visit, you might read the booklet and write to the sources listed for more information. &quot;Real world&quot; themes will allow for these same types of experiences to take place as a part of school learning. These themes have the following important characteristics: 

A clear focus around one or more meaningful, key concepts. 
A balance of high-quality, authentic narrative and expository texts as appropriate to the theme. 
A balance of authentic &quot;real world&quot; resources. 
A variety of authentic learning experiences involving both discovery and direct instruction.

===Authentic Learning &amp; Assessment in History and Social Studies===
Project-based learning is yet another authentic type of learning that can be used in History and Social Studies. Students try to answer a question -- one that has relevance for them -- that is greater than the immediate task at hand. Students then conduct surveys, do research, build models, and take field trips with the goal of determining the best answer or solution to the problem. An example of project based learning was in my own classroom, students were given information about different geographical areas. As a group, they had to decide which place was the best to call home, build a colony and live. In the end, they are told which place was the actual spot the first colonists landed in Jamestown, and like the first colonists, the students understand why they landed in Jamestown. This put the learning into the students hands, making it more relevant to them without just being told information to memorize. Engaging activities are more likely stored in long term memory.

===Authentic Learning &amp; Assessment in Science, Mathematics, &amp; Technology===
Children's thinking and problem solving can be compared to that of a scientist. Both children and scientists ask fundamental questions about nature and reality. Both also seek answers based on prior knowledge and experimentation. Math and Science authentic learning should emphasize discovery and hands-on investigations. Constructivist teaching emphasizes that children have to build their own scientific knowledge and understanding. In math and science, each step is formed on this.

===Conclusion===
Some critics argue that such constructivist approaches give too much attention to inquiry skills and not enough to discipline-specific information. However, Paiget and other constructivist theorists reveal how cognitive chane is likely to occur if the contes is structured to allow gradual movement to the next higher level and that a concept does not emerge suddenly, full-blown, but rather through a series of partial accomplishments that lead to increasingly comprehensive understanding. Having highly relevant and highly rigorous authentic learning and assessment accomplishes this goal.

===Glossary===
Authentic Learning- In this type of learning, materials and activities are framed around &quot;real life&quot; contexts in which they would be used. The underlying assumption of this approach is that material is meaningful to students and therefore, more motivating and deeply processed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 5: Dialogue, collaboration, reflection &amp; personalization of learning'''

===Overview ===
Dialogue, collaboration, reflection &amp; personalization of learning in Constructivism allows for the 
person to become ceative in their learning in order to bring new understanding for him/herself. The teacher role is to coach, moderate and suggest. This allows the students room to experiment, ask questions and use trial and error on things that may or not work. Learning activities give the students the opportunity to have full participation and ownership in all things. Many of which will be hands on to gain further experience. This learning process allows students to reflect, and talk about their activities. These activities lead the student to reflect on his or her prior knowledgeand experience to enhance the learning process.
 
The main activity in a constructivist classroom is solving problems. Students use methods of inquiry to ask questions and investigate a topic. Various resources are used to find solutions and answers. The students draw their conclusions, and later revisit those conclusions to generate more questions which will eventually develop into answers that can bring revolutionary ideas and solutions. 
In the book, The Necessary Revolution, &quot;How Individuals and Organizations are Working Together to Create a Sustainable World&quot;, by Peter Senge, Bryan Smith, Nina Kruschwitz, Joe Laur and Sara Schley, they write that organizations are developing and encouraging new, &quot;specific tools and ways of thinking - to help us build the confidence and competence to respond effectively to the greatest challenge of our time. By using the tools of Constructivism, students will be prepared to meet the needs of the ever-growing, innovative time in which we live.

===What is dialogue and collaboration in a constructivist classroom?===
The constructivist classroom relies heavily on collaboration among students. There are many reasons why collaboration contributes to learning.  The main reason it is used so much in constructivism is that students learn about learning not only from themselves, but also from their peers. When students review and reflect on their learning processes together, they can pick up strategies and methods from one another.

===What is reflection &amp; personalization of learning in a constructivist classroom?===
 
Building powerful learning communities where faculty use data, research, dialogue, and reflection to examine instructional strategies and improve classroom practice. The lesson or activities are geared toward the students indivdual strengths and interest so that their on experinces and prior knowledge comes into play. This creates a safe, healthy environment for each student to flourish.

===Rationale ===
Building powerful learning communities where faculty use data, research, dialogue, and reflection to examine instructional strategies and improve classroom practice. The main reason it is used so much in constructivism is that students learn about learning not only from themselves, but also from their peers. When students review and reflect on their learning processes together, they can pick up strategies and methods from one another.

===Examples of Reflection / Personalization Activities in Various Subjects and Grade Levels===
&quot;We investigate the use of mobile and sensor technologies for school science investigations, to bring about a more engaging and hands-on approach to science learning. We report early findings from two trials carried out within the Participate project, where schoolchildren were given a range of off the shelf and newly developed technologies to carry out data collection and analysis tasks. Indications are that, not only are the tasks engaging for the pupils, but aspects such as personalization of data, contextual information, and reflection upon both the data and its collection, are important factors in obtaining and retaining their interest.&quot; http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/

===Examples of dialogue and collaboration Activities in Various Subjects and Grade Levels===
&quot;A collaborative group of junior high students worked on the economic development of several nations. They accumulated a lot of information about the countries and decided that the best way to present it was to compare the countries. But they were stymied as to how to organize the information so they could write about it in a paper, the product they chose to produce. Their teacher hinted that they use a matrix--a graphic organizer they had learned--to organize their information. When the group finished the matrix, the teacher gave them feedback. In so doing, he did not tell them it was right or wrong, but asked questions that helped them verbalize their reasons for completing the matrix as they did. The principle the teacher followed was to coach enough so that students could continue to learn by drawing on the ideas of other group member.&quot; &quot;What Is the Collaborative Classroom?&quot; http://www.arp.sprnet.org/admin/supt/collab2.htm

===Conclusion ===
Individual Responsibility for Learning is difficult to solve unless major changes in other areas of schooling are also undertaken. Students are used to being graded for individual work; parents expect to know how their students fare in school. School staff and state departments depend on traditional assessments. In collaborative classrooms, it is often difficult to assign individual grades. Some teachers give group grades, but many students and parents are uncomfortable with these. Ideally, assessment practices should be changed so that they are consistent with collaboration, with a new view of learning and with a thinking curriculum.

===Glossary ===
Dialogue: 
A. conversation between two or more persons. 
B. the conversation between characters in a novel, drama, etc. 
C. an exchange of ideas or opinions on a particular issue, esp. a political or religious issue, with a view to reaching an amicable agreement or settlement.
 
Collaboration: The act of collaborating

Collaborative writing: Activities involved in the production of a document by more than one author, then pre-draft discussions and arguments as well as post-draft analyses and debates are collaborative components.   

Metacognition: Awareness and understanding one's thinking and cognitive processes; thinking about thinking

'''BC''' - Branch on Condition - RX type instruction - Opcode 47

==Format==
:BC 2,LABEL
:BH LABEL - Special opcode, same as BC 2,LABEL
:BC 1,L1
:BO L1 - Same as BC 1,L1
:BC 15,106(0,10)
:B 106(0,10)  - B opcode is unconditional branch and is same as BC 15
:BC 3,256(7,6)

The specific syntax is
:BC ''mask'',''offset''(''index register'',''base register'')
Where the ''offset'', ''index register'' and ''base register'' values will be determined automatically by the assembler if the [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/USING|USING]] pseudo-instruction has been used, and the target address label used is within 4096 bytes of the value of some base register.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin:0.5em auto; font-size:95%;text-align: center;&quot;
|-
|colspan=&quot;7&quot;|RX Instruction (4 bytes)
|-
|colspan=1 rowspan=2|Byte 1
|colspan=2|Byte 2
|colspan=3|Bytes 3 and 4
|-
||''mask''
|colspan=4|Target Address
|-
||(8 bits)&lt;br&gt;Opcode&lt;br/&gt;'''47'''
||(4 bits)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; '''0..F'''
||(4 bits)&lt;br&gt;''index&lt;br/&gt;register''&lt;br/&gt;'''0..F'''
||(4 bits)&lt;br&gt;''base&lt;br/&gt;register''&lt;br/&gt;'''0..F'''
|colspan=2|(12 bits)&lt;br&gt;''offset''&lt;br /&gt;'''0..FFF'''
|}

*The first argument is a ''mask'' which the condition code is compared against.
*The second argument is the location to transfer to if the mask matches the currently set condition code.  The offset value is added to the values in the base and index registers to form the target address.  Most instruction usage tends to use one base register with an index register of zero, but if two non-zero registers are used, the target address will be the same no matter which register is the base register and which is the index register.
* The ''mask'', ''base_register'' and ''index_register'' values are 0 to 15.  The offset value is 0 to 4095.
* If the ''mask'' or ''base_register'' is zero, the instruction is a no-operation, and does not branch.
* If the ''mask'' is 15 the branch is unconditional (unless the ''base register'' is 0, in which case it does not branch).
* The value in the ''index_register'' is not used if the index_register specified is 0.

==Other Opcodes==
The assembler provides the mask as part of several optional opcodes.  These simply require the target address.  These opcodes are:

 47176100        BO   X1      branch on ones - '''BC 1,X1'''
 4740A06A        BM   LABEL   branch on mixed - '''BC 4,label'''
 4780A06A        BZ   LABEL   branch on zeroes - '''BC 8,label'''
 47E0A06A        BNO  LABEL   branch on not ones - '''BC 14,label'''

==Availability==
The BC instruction is available on all models of the 360, 370 and z/System.  
==Operation==
Upon performing an arithmetic operation or a comparison, certain bits in the Program Status Word called the Condition Code are set or cleared.  In the case of comparison of two fields, the left value is considered the &quot;A&quot; value, and the right value is considered the &quot;B&quot; value, and the result of the comparison of A to B tests how A compares to B, either low, high, equal or not-equal.

In the case of an arithmetic operation, the result being plus, minus, zero or having had an overflow is tested.

In the case of the test under mask instructions, the result of the test being all ones, all zeroes, or mixed ones and zeroes.

The Branch on Condition instruction is used following such a test to compare the condition code bits to the mask value.  If bits set in the mask match bits which are set in the condition code (or all of the bits in the mask are set), and the base register of the target address is not 0, the target address is placed into the PSW as the new address of the current instruction and the branch is taken.  Otherwise execution continues with the next instruction following the branch on condition instruction.

The target address is constructed by adding the contents of the base and index registers to the offset address.  If the index register is zero its value is not used.
==Purpose of Instruction==
The '''Branch on Condition'' instruction is the general purpose branch within a program.  It has three variations: no branch or No Operation, conditional branch depending upon a test, or unconditional branch.
===No Operation===
The 'no branch' - BC 0 - or 'NOP' is typically used to create a label which is not tied to an existing instruction.  It may be used by a macro for alignment to force an instruction or data onto a specific boundary but without causing a program exception if the instruction is branched to.  It can also be used to provide 'slack' space to allow later patching of the binary without having to reassemble the program.  A NOP will also occur, regardless of the mask value, if the base register of the branch is also zero.
===Conditional Branch===
The bits in the mask are compared to the bits in the condition code.  If the bits in the mask match the bits in the condition code, (and the base register of the target address is not zero) the branch is taken. 
===Unconditional Branch===
A branch to another location (the equivalent of a GOTO in high-level languages) is performed by setting all the bits in the mask, e.g. '''BC 15''', or using the B instruction.  As long as the base register of the target address is not zero, the branch will always be taken.  
==Typical Usage==
The branch on condition and optional formats are typically used after performing a comparison or arithmetic operation.  In the following code, a question is asked, the response is compared to yes or no, and the question is re-issued if not either.  The 'CALL' macro is used to create a standard subroutine linkage.

 CHECKINQ NOP  0(0)                                                            
          CALL INQUIRE,(QUES,1,RESP)                 Call an external module called INQUIRE 
          CLC  RESP(1),QY1                           Compare one byte
          BE   YES                                   &quot;Resp&quot; is the A value in an A:B comparison 
          CLC  RESP(1),QY2
          BE   YES
          CLC  RESP(1),QN1 
          BE   NO                                    Answer was 'N'
          CLC  RESP(1),QN2                           Is it 'n'?
          BNE  CHECKINQ                              Something else, try again
          B    NO                                    Answer was 'n'
 QUES     DC   C'Are you ready to start?'            Construct a 'C' language-type
          DC   X'00'                                 string, zero terminated
 RESP     DS   C                                     One byte response
 QY1      DC   C'Y'                                  Available responses
 QY2      DC   C'y'
 QN1      DC   C'N'
 QN2      DC   C'n'
==Exceptions and Faults==
* The target address must not be odd, or an operation exception occurs
* The target address must be within the range of valid memory or an operation exception occurs. 
* The storage key for the target address must be the same as the current process (or this process must have a key of 0) or a memory protect violate exception occurs.
==Alternative branch instructions==
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BALR|BALR]] instruction is used to branch to the address in a register and save the current address as a return address, similar to a procedure or function call in a high-level language
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BCR|BCR]] instruction is used in the same manner as the BC instruction, but is used to branch to the address in the specified second argument register.
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BCT|BCT]] instruction is used is used to subtract 1 from a register then branch to the specified address if the result is not zero.
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BCT|BCT]] instruction is used is used to subtract 1 from a register then branch to the address in the register specified in the second argument if the result is not zero.
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BRC|BRC]] instruction is used to branch to the address relative to the current program counter, contained in an immediate (16 bit) value.
* The [[360_Assembly/360_Instructions/BRCL|BRCL]] instruction is used to branch to the address relative to the current program counter, contained in an immediate (32 bit) value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinetic Energy is the energy of a body in motion K = (1/2)mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; .
where K is kinetic energy, m is mass of body and v is the velocity of body; so if a body having some velocity (speed is a direction) there is kinetic energy in the body apart from other forms of energy (like potential energy).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tilde before \ref ? ==
The &quot;~&quot; (tilde) does not seem to be explained when used as a prefix for &quot;\ref&quot;, as in, &quot;~\ref&quot;.  Why is that?  What is the tilde for?
--[[Special:Contributions/169.234.25.104|169.234.25.104]] ([[User talk:169.234.25.104|talk]]) 20:58, 1 October 2010 (UTC)

: The &quot;~&quot; (tilde) [http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/latex/ltx-143.html makes a non-breaking space], so you don't end up with something like Table (newline) 2. [[User:Jevon|Jevon]] ([[User talk:Jevon|talk]]) 01:49, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

== Label with Custom Text ==

I wanted to create a label with a custom text in one of my documents and I didn't find any good information on the net describing how to do it exactly, so I figured this out:

&lt;nowiki&gt;\newcommand{\customlabel}[2]{\newcommand{\@old@currentlabel}[0]{\@currentlabel}\renewcommand{\@currentlabel}[0]{#1}\phantomsection\label{#1}\renewcommand{\@currentlabel}[0]{\@old@current}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It introduces a new command named \customlabel that takes 2 parameters: first the label name (just like \label does), the second parameter is the text that will later appear when you do a \ref to the label. E.g. if you put \label{foo,bar} in any place of a LaTeX file, you can refer to it by \ref{foo} and the text displayed as the link will be &quot;bar&quot;.

I found it quite hard to figure out how to do it, but surprisingly easy to do once I did. I also think this might be usfull for quite a number of people. Since I really don't know how to edit this properly I hope somebody might be able to insert it on this page: But keep in mind I'm not proficient in writing latex macros, so showing this to somebody who is beforehand might be a good idea.

Changed the &quot;append&quot; in the \numberwithin{equation}{section} example to &quot;prepend&quot;, because this is the case.

== Limits/ requirements on Marker ==

Dear all,

I think it would be helpful to explain what type of characters are usable for the marker. It seems to me that prettyref does not like the underscore &quot;_&quot; character as part of a single marker.

== Issues with links to tables and figures handled by hyperref ==

The behavior described in &quot;Issues with links to tables and figures handled by hyperref&quot; seems fixed. Can someone else test this on his setup with up-to-date version of the packages. I am using hyperref with the following options: &quot;\usepackage[pdftex,hidelinks]{hyperref}&quot;.</text>

== Creating pages in my Primer ==

I am continuing on in the project, making a seventh grade Chemistry book from the bones of the General Chemistry WikiBook.  I am cutting and pasteing.  This technique does not take the art with it, so I suppose if the art is available, I will have to cut and paste it through another technique.  I'd love to know if there is a way to copy a page over with the art intact.

Thanks for the information, but I've requested deletion of the work.  The amount of time spent on this learning curve didn't offset the quality of the product, or too moch time for too little output.[[User:Mike1722|Mike1722]] ([[User talk:Mike1722|talk]])

== Chemistry ==

I am a seventh grade teacher who would like to severly, probably too strong a word but you get the drift, edit the General Chemistry textbook for my classroom use.  I am not a writer.  It is my hope to edit and use the book without causing any difficulty for the current book.  I suppose you could consider my request, may I create a General Chemisty lite version for kids?  How do I do this without harming the original?[[Special:Contributions/99.145.93.221|99.145.93.221]] ([[User talk:99.145.93.221|talk]]) 20:31, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:Before you do anything, check out [[Subject:Chemistry]] to see if we have anything like what you're looking for, and aimed at the middle school audience.  If we have something, then you are free to edit it to your heart's content.  If we don't, then I suggest that you go ahead and start a new book, using [[General Chemistry]] as a starting point.  You would want to come up with a new title, perhaps suggesting the intended audience, as [[High School Chemistry]] does. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 20:57, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

I'm looking to join into the General Chemistry book myself, and I'd like to shape it as a college introductory text. From looking at the book I'm not entirely sure what level the book is targeted to and looking through the related changes for General Chemistry I was not able to find any active authors. What would be the best way to go about finding any other current authors and then form some idea of an intended audience?

:Post a message on the book's talk page, express your intentions for the book's evolution. You should also include a deadline for the conclusion of the proposals discussions with a minimum of 7 days, as to permit you to check if any opposition materializes to the proposed changes. At the same time if may you wish look into the edit history of the book and try to send using Wikibooks an email to the top editors calling attention to your post. This should bring any interested user into the discussion, if not, you can then implement your changes uncontested.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:09, 11 March 2010 (UTC)

: A [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer|general disclaimer]] applies to all works on all wikimedia projects as I understand it.

== Bots for automatic vandalism reversion ==

On Wikipedia they have something called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot ClueBot] to revert vandalism automatically, which seems to work quite well. There is less vandalism here but fewer admin staff too, so perhaps it would be worth a trial, if only to free people for more rewarding work. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:01, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

:I'm sure the bot has matured over time and I personally don't have any objections to seeing how well it would work.  Looks like it checks for open proxies and puts warnings on the vandals' talk pages too.  However, the real question is whether the bot's operator would run it here.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:32, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

::I suppose the guy would need to adapt his bot programs to use the equivalent Wikibooks pages, but presumably that would be fairly easy. In case there are technical issues to resolve, it is probably best if you or another admin approach him if you think it is a good idea. I had a quick look at some changes the bot had made on Wikipedia and all the changes I saw were sensible except on one heavily vandalized page where it was not clear what the correct version should have been. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:18, 19 March 2010 (UTC)
== Templates for playing speech recordings ==

At least 3 of the language books use a similar table template to play speech recordings, when you click on &quot;audio&quot; (French, Spanish &amp; German). This takes you to a new screen with a sound-to-light show. 
{| {{French Table|Grammar|The Definite Article|L'article défini|78|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular||feminine||la||la fille||the daughter
|-
|masculine||le||le fils{{ref|fils}}||the son
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular, starting with a vowel sound||l’||l’enfant||the child
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | plural
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|les||les filles||the daughters
|-
|les fils||the sons
|-
|les enfants||the children
|}
I think it would be more useful to be able to stay on the original screen and read the text at the same time as listening to the recording. 
{{Listen
|filename=French_Grammar_-_The_Definite_Article.ogg
|title=info
|description=
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The Listen template does something like this, but the icons and text layout are rather larger and do not fit into the tables so neatly. Would it be possible to combine the two templates so that the layout of the books is not significantly altered, but the audio can be played at the same time as reading the text? It's a bit too technical for me, so that's why I am asking here! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 17:55, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
:I guess this issue is not really specific to Wikibooks, as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have similar templates with (IMO) similar room for improvement and perhaps more people available to spent time on it if they are interested. If I get any more joy over there, I'll announce further developments here. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:48, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

:I guess most readers just open the link in a new window with a right-click (but considering touch-based input devices this is something that probably should be avoided). Maybe the table template should be adjusted to include the play button (which can be configured to require less space, see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_by_Choice/SpanishPod_newbie_lesson_A0001#Dialogue here] for examples). By the way, the Listen template has the problem that the built-in Firefox audio player ignores the horizontal HTML layout; thus, if it is used, there should be enough white space to the right of it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:24, 2 March 2010 (UTC)
::Thanks for the help. The right clicking does work after a fashion, but as you say is not the ideal solution. I tried making a test template based the French_Table template, but so far have not achieved the compact layout I was aiming for as the audio player seems to be adding line-feeds to the layout. (see below) 
::{| {{Recent Runes Table|Grammar|The Definite Article|L'article défini|78|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular||feminine||la||la fille||the daughter
|-

== Naming new pages as far as &quot;directories&quot; ==

I am only working on [[Calculus]] and I see some pages named in one way and some named in different ways.  For example, there is [[Calculus/Limits/An Introduction to Limits]], which is under the Limits heading and also its page name has /Limits/ in it.  But, [[Calculus/Finite Limits]] is also under the Limits heading and its page name does not contain /Limits/.  Most pages in [[Calculus]] are named based on the second example but several are named the way of the first, though most of these are named Exercises and possibly it was done this way since there are several sections with the same name.  However, it just seems unorganized to do some one way and some another.  So, which one should it be in general?  Thanks.  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 15:53, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:This will heavily depend on the book.  Consistency is key.  If pages have to be linked to by many others in the book, using a flat structure would make linking easier.  However, if there are a lot of pages in the book, you can have a shorter table of contents on the main page and tables of contents for each chapter in the book.  See [[Network Plus Certification]] or what I'm trying to do with [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] for an example. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:29, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

::Okay, well, there are a lot more important things for this book than renaming a whole bunch of stuff right now, so I'll just keep naming like most sections are already named, which would be like this [[Calculus/Finite Limits]], without the extra /Limits.  Thanks. [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 17:36, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

: I noticed this inconsistency when I was doing some work recently. I didn't really touch it since I wasn't sure which I thought was a better way to organise the content. The benefit from these sub-pages is pretty much just the extra link below the page title (the top level heading). It helps with structuring the book, but isn't really all that useful given the decent navigation templates. In that case, keeping the structure flat is probably simplest and therefore best. I agree with NumberTheorist that there are other more important things to do right now, but I'll get around to it at some point unless I'm beaten to it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:19, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

== Na'vi dictionary ==

Hi, 

[[Na'vi/Na'vi-English dictionary]] exceeds the template include size. This is because each lexical entry is formatted with a template inherited from Wiktionary. As a dictionary, it isn't a good idea to split it up. Is there any way to fix/override the limit? [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 20:19, 1 March 2010 (UTC)

:I don't know how to avoid the limit. Since the page is really long, I would suggest to split it up according to letters, i.e. one page per letter. Alternatively, you might simplify the templates (as far as I understand it, all the intermediate expansions count to the limit, even if they don't show up in the result). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 00:22, 2 March 2010 (UTC)

Thanks. I can't see any good way to simplify the templates: they're pretty well designed. 
: They appear a bit overengineered to me: you are using only a fraction of the possibilities, right? One way of simplifying the templates might be to define a whole set of expanded versions of these templates (by using &quot;subst&quot;). And then defining expanded versions of the templates that you are using with the specific parameter values that you are using most often. I assume that this will reduce the size significantly. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:23, 8 March 2010 (UTC)
::Thanks. The writer of the templates is taking another look. (The way they are makes it easier to make formatting changes, but hopefully they've stabilized.) The dict will probly be significantly expanded soon, but hopefully this will work. [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 20:47, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

::Thanks! [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 08:58, 8 March 2010 (UTC)

Now that I've broken up the dict, it's still too long for the Print version. (I can't even get it all the links in the Print page.) I thought I'd just have two Print volumes, the grammar and the dictionaries, but Template:Print version appears to not work properly. The book link no longer works, whereas the dictionary link points to the book. I can't see how I'm doing anything differently than what the template doc instructs. 

(Actually, even w the dictionary separated, it's too long to print. But one problem at a time!) [[User:Kwamikagami|—Kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 16:21, 24 March 2010 (UTC)
:I fixed the boxes.  I think that if any parameter is specified, you'll have to provide the full path to the print version.  Additionally the documentation for that template may not be entirely correct.  We're going to have to break the dictionary down into multiple print versions or take a look at the templates used. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:31, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

:It might be useful to have a description of the proposed scope and audience of the book. Then there would be something to judge the proposed structure against. Some of the link headings talking about &quot;vicious hegemons&quot; and &quot;time for some hereditary monarchy&quot; look a little opinionated or quirky, so you are wise to use more neutral text for the actual page names. People here are generally happy to help out with technical matters, but you would probably not get much help with the content itself as people are mostly busy with their own books.

== Book of (the best) mathematical proofs ==

Hi all, a group of mathematicians (including me) would like to create a wikibook in where the famous proofs of mathematics are presented. I have two questions about it. 

1) Despite the fact that in wikibooks, there are no pages like &quot;Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics&quot; or &quot;Portal:Mathematics&quot;, we would like to create a Project Page in order to collect the members, organize the work and present the best selected wikibook-sections. Is there any possibility to create a portal-like (a quasi-portal) page in wikibooks?

2) Do we continue the wikibook [[Famous Theorems of Mathematics]] (in a higher level of organization)? Or, should we create a new one?

I'm happy to accent any help or proposals. Regards, [[User:Mozo|Mozo]] ([[User talk:Mozo|talk]]) 15:41, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

:If you'd end up not using any of the existing content in [[Famous Theorems of Mathematics]], you could start a new book and the edit history of the two could be combined if the new is superior.  But you could certainly continue on that existing book, refactoring it as necessary if it will improve upon it in order to avoid duplicating content.  Keep in mind {{tl|now merged}}. We do actually have [[Wikibooks:Chess]] and [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Bartending]], amongst others.  You could create a project page in the Wikibooks namespace with {{tl|wikiproject}} at the very top to organize the contributors.

::Thank you very much for your quick response. I'll talk to the others, and sooner or later we will start writing the book. On the other hand, it is a good news that we can  create an own project page. Thanks a lot! [[User:Mozo|Mozo]] ([[User talk:Mozo|talk]]) 20:19, 18 March 2010 (UTC)</text>

==Blio ebook Reader==

===What is Blio?===

[[Image:Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg|right|thumb|161px|  Books]]

[http://blioreader.com/ Blio] is eReader software that presents electronic books, magazines, and other digital content. Designed for readers on the go, Blio keeps printed books in their original format. Not only does Blio have ebooks, but also cookbooks, travel guides, instructional books, and children’s stories. The Blio Bookstore offers a wide selection, which includes over a million free books. Books that are downloaded are stored in a virtual library that can be accessed on multiple devices [KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. 2010] &lt;ref name=&quot;Blio&quot;&gt;KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. (2010) ''Blio''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===What are the features of Blio?===
Blio allows readers to highlight, underline, and annotate to easily recall information later. Readers can adjust reading speed when accessing text-to-speech, as well as font size. To create study materials readers can save images, videos, or notes from Blio documents and export them to use in a document. If reading on a small screen, students can view text only, which will make the most of their screen space. In 3D “book view” realistic page turning provides students with a real-life reading experience. Different page views allow students to customize their screen layout [KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. 2010] &lt;ref name=&quot;Blio&quot;&gt;KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. (2010) ''Blio''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Where can the Blio reader be used?===
Available soon, Blio can be used on a Windows, Mac, or Linux system, as well as on the Android, Symbian, Windows Mobile, or iPhone. The supported eBook formats include XPS, PDF, and ePub [KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. 2010] &lt;ref name=&quot;Blio&quot;&gt;KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. (2010) ''Blio''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===How can Blio be used in the classroom?===
The books from the Blio Bookstore can be read to students aloud using TTS (text-to-speech).  Students can also follow along with the audio while the words being spoken are highlighted. The read-aloud feature allows readers an audio experience that would benefit visually impaired students and auditory learners. The embedded multimedia gives students a graphics-rich experience.  The color books offered in the Blio Bookstore come to life with the 3D “book view” for life-like page turning. Students will be able to read books on mobile devices, as well as PC’s in the classroom.  The amount of books available for a classroom will no longer be an issue, as students will be able to access Blio even from home or on their mobile device [KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. 2010] &lt;ref name=&quot;Blio&quot;&gt;KNFB Reading Technology, Inc. (2010) ''Blio''.&lt;/ref&gt;

I didn't get to use WiZiQ in class, so thanks for the informative page. I really liked using Eluminate, and after looking at your page, I hope I get the opportunity to work with WiZiQ in a class someday. - alk308</text>

===Patterns in nature ===
Many forms observed in nature can be related to geometry (for sound reasons of resource optimization). For example, the [[chambered nautilus]] grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a [[logarithmic spiral]] to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, [[honeybee]]s construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey. These and other correspondences are seen by believers in sacred geometry to be further proof of the cosmic significance of geometric forms. But scientists generally see such phenomena as the logical outcome of natural principles.

==Sacred geometry==
[[File:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|270px|Luca Pacioli]]
Sacred geometry may be understood as a worldview of pattern recognition and a complex system of religious symbols and structures involving space, time and form. According to this belief, the basic patterns of existence are perceived as sacred. By connecting with these, a person contemplates the Mysterium Magnum, and the Great Design. By studying the nature of these patterns, forms and relationships and their connections, insight may be gained into the mysteries – the laws and lore of the Universe.



The [[golden ratio]], geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the design of [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], ancient Indian, [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[architecture]]. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and [[fortification]]s on design plans of mandala and yantra.  For examples of sacred geometry in art and architecture refer:

===An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything===

An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything is a theory proposing a basis for a unified field theory or possible theory of everything, using some ideas from loop quantum gravity .

Consider a wavy, two-dimensional [[surface]], with many different [[sphere]]s glued to the surface—one sphere at each surface point, and each sphere attached by one point. This geometric construction is a [[fiber bundle]], with the spheres as the &quot;fibers,&quot; and the wavy surface as the &quot;base.&quot; A sphere can be rotated in three different ways: around the x-axis, the y-axis, or around the z-axis. Each of these rotations corresponds to a [[symmetry]] of the sphere. The fiber bundle [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] is a [[field (physics)|field]] describing how spheres at nearby surface points are related, in terms of these three different rotations. The geometry of the fiber bundle is described by the [[curvature]] of this connection. In the corresponding [[quantum field theory]], there is a particle associated with each of these three symmetries, and these particles can interact according to the geometry of a sphere.

In Lisi's model, the base is a four-dimensional surface—our [[spacetime]]—and the fiber is the [[e8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Lie group]], a complicated 248 dimensional shape, which some mathematicians consider to be the most beautiful shape in mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIM_atlas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aimath.org/E8/ |title=Mathematicians Map E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; |accessdate=2007-12-30 |work=AIM }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, each of the 248 symmetries of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to a different [[elementary particle]], which can interact according to the geometry of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. As Lisi describes it: &quot;The principal bundle connection and its curvature describe how the E8 manifold twists and turns over spacetime, reproducing all known ﬁelds and dynamics through 
pure geometry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;paper&quot; /&gt;

The complicated geometry of the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; Lie group is described graphically using [[group representation]] theory. Using this mathematical description, each symmetry of a group—and so each kind of elementary particle—can be associated with a point in a diagram. The coordinates of these points are the [[quantum numbers]]—the [[Charge (physics)|charges]]—of elementary particles, which are conserved in interactions. Such a diagram sits in a flat, [[Euclidean space]] of some dimension, forming a [[polytope]], such as the [[Gosset 4 21 polytope|4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; polytope]] in eight-dimensional space.

In order to form a [[theory of everything]], Lisi's model must eventually predict the exact number of [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]], all of their properties, [[mass]]es, [[Fundamental interaction|forces between them]], the nature of [[spacetime]], and the [[cosmological constant]]. Much of this work is still in the conceptual stage—in particular, [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] and predictions of [[Particle physics|particle masses]] have not been done. And Lisi himself acknowledges it as a work-in-progress: &quot;The theory is very young, and still in development.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Roger Highfield |title=Surfer dude stuns physicists with theory of everything |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2007/11/14/scisurf114.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2008-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tonic Pedals: A tonic pedal is a single bass note that is sustained under the libretto or other parts. This can be used to emphasise the meaning of the text or to highlight a particular theme or motif. 
* Metre: The metre of the text is important in emphasising the meanings of the text, as well as creating more contrapuntal rhythms and rhythmic interest. The metre is where the stresses fall in the words. See &quot;Metre&quot;.
* Affection of Key: Various keys are used to assert different themes or emotions. For example G Minor is the &quot;Death&quot; key, and C Major is the &quot;Royal&quot; key. Theory of affection is a typically baroque characteristic as musical theorists of the time believed different keys could conjure different emotions. 
* Word Painting: Is an originally renaissance technique, however it is predominant in Baroque Music as well. See the baroque and renaissance sections for a description. 
* Circles of 5ths and 4ths: The use of this sequence can tell you which baroque style the passage is idiomatic of. For example, the German baroque style very often makes use of the whole circle of fifths, and incorporates it as a main feature of the music. English baroque tends to use part of the circle as a stylistic feature, or a way of modulating between keys. It is not necessarily a unitary feature but is used as a way of changing key. 
* Types of Baroque: ENGLISH BAROQUE- Very often makes wide use of chromatics. FRENCH BAROQUE- Uses dotted rhythms and spritely metres. For an example see the overture. GERMAN BAROQUE- Very defined key structure, and very organised and strict rhythmic structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Metre is important when a musical passage has a text. However it can be relevant in other music. Metre refers to stresses on notes or words in passages of text or music.

==Iambic Metres==

The stress falls on the second syllable. 

_ I (the _ refers to a un-stressed and I refers to the stressed syllable) 

Iambic metres are flowing and allow for lyrical patterns. They could be used in &quot;love&quot; songs, and in impressionist music. Any music that has a flowing lyrical feel could have an iambic metre. 

==Trochaic Metres==

The stress falls on the first syllable.

I _ 

Trochaic metres are disjointed and jarring in their feel. When passages are conflicting they may use a trochaic metre. For example in the set work &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; (Next year Mozart Jupiter Suite), the fight between Dido and Aeneas has a trochaic metre when she refers to Aeneas as a &quot;deceitful crocodile&quot;. 

The extension of these two metres is Anapaestic _ _ I, and Dactylic, I _ _

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;Chords&lt;/u&gt;

Chords can have different inversions which alter the &quot;feel&quot; of the chord. For example chords can have different notes in their bass. Here is 3 different inversions of C Major.

&quot;C Major, with a C in the Bass&quot;- This is a strong solid chord.
&quot;C Major, with a E in the Bass&quot;- This is more of a passing chord and would not be used in a cadence.
&quot;C Major, with a G in the Bass&quot;- As above

When these &quot;weaked&quot; inversions are used, they can imply different things. In most music, they are just used as part of a harmonic progression. In other pieces, such as choral pieces, an inversion can be placed under certain words to reiterate the meaning of the text. For example if the libretto is unsure and ambiguous the composer could use weaker inversions to emphasize this.

==Notes==
*As with most other verbs (except for ''esse’''), ''havè'' has no conditional and future tenses
*''Havè'' is used mainly as an auxiliary verb, otherwise it means &quot;to must (have to)&quot;; ''tenè'' is used for expressing ownership

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cree were a First Nations people that mostly lived on the territory of modern Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba, though they spread as far east as Quebec. Their culture and lifestyle were that of the Plains people, a large group of tribes living in the Interior Plains. There were three general types of Cree-the Plains Cree, in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Woods Cree, in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Swampy Cree, in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec.


== Plains Cree ==
The culture and lifestyle of the Cree depended largely on the bison. Bison made up a large part of their lives, including clothing, shelter, and food. Items such as clothing, cups, spoons, teepees, strings, and weapons were created using the various parts of the bison, among others.


==Cree Language ==
The Cree language was a language of the Algonquin family. Despite not developing a written syllabary until the early nineteenth century with contact with Europeans, by the beginning of the twentieth century the Cree had one of the highest literacy rates in the world.


== Spirituality ==
Cree spirituality was based on interactions with animals and other spirits that appeared in dreams, as was common among Native Americans. 

An event called the Thirsting Dance by the Cree, and the Sun Dance by other Plains Nations, was central to Plains spirituality. 
The Sun Dance was an annual event, taking place in the summer generally right before the big bison hunt, as that was when most members of a nation were present in one place. The sponsor of the event would often be either a much-admired woman or a man who had experienced success in a war raid.

A lodge would be built for the ceremony, and when it was completed, the dances would begin. The dancers were those who had made a vow to the tribe. Without food, drink or rest, they danced for the several days the ceremony took place. Staying on the spot, they danced with their eyes permanently focused on the top of the centre pole. To prove themselves, the young men of the tribe would have their chests pierced with skewers of bone, which were attached by a rope to the centre pole. While dancing, they would lean back until the skewers were ripped out.


== Cree in Modern Times ==
Today, the Cree is the largest First Nations group in [[Canada]], with 200,000 people members and 235 registered bands. A Cree band, the Lac La Ronge band, is the second largest in Canada.

      <comment>/* Cash budgetting */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* Money
* Prompt payment for goods or services in currency or by check

Cash is necessary for finalization of business transactions.

* With respect to special journals, and specialized ledgers, or prime books of accounting, cash control forms one of the main motivating factors for the system of use. 
** Separating bookkeeping from cash handling as a form of internal fraud control. Similarly, job rotation and enforced holidays and limited overtime help to prevent cooking of books.
** centralising payment and receipts of cash for better tracking and easier bank reconciliation.
** documents that support bookentries, such as invoices and receipts issued, can be numbered , so that any lost numbers in a series can be accounted for , without relying on just the bookkeeping
* cash budgetting is like a concession that despite accrual accounting making the tracking of credit sales and purchases easier, it is still necessary to minimise the risk of a cash flow problem  by trying to predict how much cash is being used or received for a given period . Estimation are often made in terms of percentages of a period income or expense arriving in subsequent periods, and with income, a percentage of eventual bad debt ( with expense, there is usually no deliberate planning of jibbing creditors ). After adding the different stages of cash collection for a given period (e.g. a month), a projection can be made as to what the cash balance may be, or what remains to be collected in trade debtors balance, and a plan for cash outflows can be made (e.g. how much to pay the creditors for each period). Financing cash flow , with interest, principal repayments, and projected borrowing needs, can also be factored out period by period. Cash budgetting falls partly in management accounting.

=== cash at bank reconciliation ===
This serves as a confirmation that what is written down as the current balance at cash in bank account can be eventually accounted for by what is being recorded through the bank statement, as the bank statement is an arm's length record of cash transactions.
The aim is to have everything recorded in both the books and the bank statements, and recorded correctly. 
* items that appear both in the bank statement and the cash receipts or cash payment journal are likely to be correct , and the item in the bank statement and the relevant journal can be marked off. 
* this leaves items in the bank statement, and the journals, that aren't marked off. 
* items in the bank statement only, may be missing in the journals.
* items in the journals, may be missing in the bank statement.
* or items in either, may not be correctly entered, either by the bookkeeper ( more likely), or by the bank's bookkeeper (less likely). 
* items that were missing in the journals in the last period, may be present in the journals this period (less likely). 
* items that were missing in the bank statement last period, may be present in the bank statement this period ( more likely).
* items that haven't been accounted for from previous periods, should be also checked, and accumulated like bad debt records if still not confirmed.
* any items that are found to be bank only recorded transactions, like electronic transfers, bank fees and interest, should be
updated to the journals. 
* cash payments journal entries incorrectly recorded can be more easily detected from the bank statement if they were paid by cheque and a correcting entry should be made (in the general journal).
* cash receipts incorrectly recorded may be more easily correlated with bank statements if cash received is banked daily.
* Checking original receipts to customers may help in finding incorrectly recorded receipts in cash receipts journal.

In summary , there is a list of outstanding deposits and payments from the previous reconciliations, which should be checked first against a current bank statement; then run through the cash payments and cash receipts journal sequentially, and tick off each against a corresponding bank statement; unticked bank only items should be written to the journals if missing; anything left in the journals is either outstanding (unpresented cheques, undeposited payments),  or incorrect (and written back in the previous step), and should be reversed.

After doing the above, then a bank reconciliation statement can be done (assuming a credit balance at the bank):
 Balance at Bank             1200 CR
 less unpresented cheques     200
   1022 blogs bales   100
   1025 purple taxis   25
   1027 corn cutters   75
 add outstanding deposits     100
 Balance at cash in bank      1100 (DR)

=== Cash budgetting === 
An example budget may run for one quarter. Like bank reconciliation, there may be a present record of future cash receipt and cash payment,
such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, in the current balance sheet . These should be included in the cash budget, as they are likely to
fall due and be settled in the budgetted quarter.
A cash budget may include predictions of cash flow , based on previous patterns of cash flow. e.g. 60% of credit sales are collected in the same month, with 30% collected in the next month, and 8% collected in the second month.

Operating cash flows include sales revenue, and inventory purchases. Each can be divided into smaller periods of cash flow,
e.g. immediate payment, payment within a month, payment in the next month, payment in 2 months, estimated bad debt ( never paid, this pertains
to sales revenue, as it would be unethical to plan for inventory purchases that are intended never to be paid). 
When these payments are viewed within a longer budget period, it is usually the ones at the end of the period that partial cash
collections occur , of the sales or purchases that occur in the ending months for example. So if credit extends for up to 2 months,
then the predicted 30+ days credit receipts for sales in the last month, and the predicted 30+ days credit payment for purchases in the last month, will
not be part of the cash flow for the quarter being accounted for.

Apart from operating cash flows of sales and inventory purchases, there will be operating cash expenses such as wages, rent, interest, and any
cash prepayments that fall due like rates and insurance. Depreciation is not a cash expense, and shouldn't be included. 

In the second division of investing cash flows, sale of equipment and purchase of equipment and the cash that is exchanged in those transactions
should be considered. Interest income from non-core investments is often cash. 

In the third division, there may be regular cash flows of a financial nature, such as payment of dividends on shares, payment of principal on bank loans,
and possibly extraordinary items like issuing of shares with cash from subscriptions.

These cash receipts and payments can be worked out for the period in question (e.g. a quarter), and the net cash flow can be determined , in order to
see if there is any danger of a cashflow stoppage, because of excessive cash outflow.

==What is cryptography?==


A cipher is a way of representing a message by changing it according to some set pattern or method. The method must preserve the meaning to decrypt it meaning to change it back into its original form.  Encryption is to write something in a cipher so that only those authorized to do so can decode it and read it. The study of encryption is called cryptography (Lehtinen, 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehtinen&quot;&gt; Lehtinen, R., Russel, D. &amp; Gangemi, G. (2006). Computer Security Basics. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea behind cryptotography is as follows:  The message, sent in plaintext, passes through a filter to encrypt it into ciphertext. The ciphertext then goes to the receiver who passes it through a related filter to decrypt it and obtain the plaintext (Schneier, 2004). &lt;ref name = &quot;Schneier&quot;/&gt;

Encryption has been around for centuries. However, at first is was thought of as something that only pertained to government. For example, in times of war, messages were encrypted in case the soldier carrying the message was captured.  In today's modern age of computer, encryption is something that affects every computer user.  Instead of physical interception of messages, encryption is used on electronic networks to protect messages against virtual intruders (Lehtinen, 2006). &lt;ref name=&quot;Lehtinen&quot;/&gt;

==Early Ciphers==
&lt;br&gt;
===Transposition Cipher===
The transposition cipher does not change the letters in a message, but only puts them in a different order.
====''Example''====
:::The message below is encrypted using transposition. Try to decrypt it: (Answer below)&lt;br&gt;
:::::::::YAOPRGYHTCPR &lt;br&gt;

===Caesar Cipher (rot-3 cipher)===
This cipher takes each letter of the plaintext and replaces it with a letter three letters later in the alphabet.  In the case of letters near the end, the alphabet is looped around back on itself, so Z would be replaced by C. (Schneier, 1996). &lt;ref name =&quot;Schneier2&quot;&gt; Schneier, B. (1996). Applied Cryptography. New York, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. Inc.  &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Caesar3.svg|right|200px]]
====''Example''====
:The message below was encrypted using the Caesar Cipher. Try to decrypt it: (Answer below) &lt;br&gt;
::::::::::BHOORZ

===Substitution Cipher===
Instead of a preset rule to always substitute each letter with another letter according to a rule such as the Caesar cipher, with a substitution cipher, each time a character is shown, a certain other character is written.  All 26 letters of the alphabet are used and there is no overlap.  An example may be to send A to T, B to K and so on.  Because each letter has a unique mapping onto the ciphertext, in mathematical terms, this particular cipher is called one-to-one.  One of the simplest and oldest substitution cipher is to simply write the alphabet forward and then backwards underneath (Gardner, 1972): &lt;ref name = &quot;Gardner&quot;&gt; Gardner, M. (1972). Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing. New York: Dover Publications, Inc.     &lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::&lt;big&gt; A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z&lt;/big&gt; 

:::::::::&lt;big&gt; Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A&lt;/big&gt;
====''Example''====
::The message below was encrypted using the above substitution cipher.  Try to decrypt it:  (Answer below) &lt;br&gt;
::::::::HFNNVI EZXZGRLM

[[Image:AlbertiDisk1.jpg|right|175px]]

===The Alberti Disk===
The Alberti Disk is a simple wheel device which provides 26 different substitution cipher alphabets. From the picture to the right, note that the 26 inner letters are in alphabetical order, but that the letters on the outside of the circle are in random order. For two people to send messages encrypted with an Alberti disk, they must have identical wheels (Gardner, 1972). &lt;ref name = &quot;Gardner&quot;/&gt;  

====''Example''====
The message below was encrypted using the Alberti disks to the right.  Try to decrypt it: (Answer below)
::::::PJLBLSKER
&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Enigma.jpg|left|110px]]‎

===Cyclic Cipher===
With the cyclic cipher, a filter is applied to a filter where the master filter is time dependent and the lower filter time independent.  There is a regular rule to transcribe one letter to another, such as a rotation. But, rather than a constant rotation, the lower filter which actually encrypts the message is changed each time by the higher level filter. This concept introduces the concept of a key, which is commonly used today. That is, in addition to the knowledge of the method used to decrypt the message (cyclic cipher,Caesar cipher, etc.) one must also know the key in order to successfully decrypt the message. One of the most famous uses of this type of cryptography was the [http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinbocek/3161684103/ Egnima machine]
developed in Germany during World War I (Lehtinen, 2006). &lt;ref name = &quot;Lehtinen&quot;/&gt;

==Today's Encryption==
Today we are dealing with computers and numbers rather that machines and letters, but today's encryption still proceeds by some of the age-old principals of substitution and transcription.  Every encipherment, no matter how complex can be broken down into combinations of simple elements (Singh, 1999). &lt;ref name = &quot;Singh&quot;&gt;

[[Image:Icon_of_two_keys_on_a_keyring.png|left|100px]]‎ 
===Keys===

In addition to the knowledge of the [http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/a/algorithm.html algorithm ] being used, in order to decrypt a message, one must have knowledge of the encryption key(s). 

[[Image:ClockWiseSpiralPath.png|right|300px]]‎
====''Example (Clockwise Spiral Path)''====

To the right is an illustration of an algorithm called a ''clockwise spiral path'' (Gardner, 1972) &lt;ref name = &quot;Gardner&quot;/&gt;.  To decrypt a message using this algorithm, put the groups of letters in the message in the columns of the 4 X 5 matrix. Then follow the arrows to read the message.

::::::EITR MYAD METH TGHU ENXS

Did it work? It should not. That was because you also needed to know the key and know how to use it.
The key is ''FRANK''.  It represents the order of the columns.  Simply translate FRANK into numbers which represent the alphabetical order that the letters in the key appear. Then place the columns in that order in the matrix (table).  

'''Hint:'''  ''FRANK'' translates to ''25143''.  (That is A gets a 1, F gets a 2, K gets a 3, N gets a 4 and R gets a 5.)  (Solution Below)

===Secret Key===
As is seen in the above example, in order to decrypt a message, one must have knowledge of the ''algorithm'' used as well as the ''key''.  In today's information age, messages are transmitted via networks. Therefore, it is important to keep the key secret from intruders. It should also be noted that all information stored on computers is stored as a series of 0s and 1s or binary.  That means that even words are converted and stored as binary. Therefore, today's algorithms are mathematical. To make it harder for intruders to decrypt messages, the algorithms used should be one-way mathematical functions rather than two-way mathematical functions.  This is because one-way functions are much harder to reverse (Singh, 1999).  &lt;ref name = &quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

====''Examples''====
[[Image:Arithmetic symbols2.svg|right|125px]]‎
'''Two-Way Function'''  (multiplication)
:::y = ab   (a times b)&lt;br&gt;
:::If y is 6 and a is 2, the function is easy to reverse to calculate that b is 3. (reversed using division)



'''One-Way Function''' (modular arithmetic)
:::y = a mod b &lt;br&gt;

:::What is a if y = 4 and b = 3?

:::To answer this question, one must have a knowledge of modular arithmetic which is sometimes referred to as ''clock'' arithmetic (Gardner, 1972).&lt;ref name = &quot;Gardner&quot;/&gt;  y represents the remainder of the division operation.
::::::Example:
:::::::: 7 mod 4 = 3       because    7 divided by 4 = 1 with a remainder of 3
:::::::: 15 mod 2 = 1      because   15 divided by 2 = 7 with a remainder of 1
:::::::: 12 mod 5 = 2      because    12 divided by 5 = 2 with a remainder of 2

:::Therefore you can see that there can be several answers to the above question:

::::: 4 mod 3 = 1
:::::10 mod 3 = 1
:::::16 mod 3 = 1
:::::31 mod 3 = 1

Using the concept of a a secret key, Bob and Alice exchange information. The information is not the key, but used in a one-way function to establish a key.  Therefore, even if Eve intercepts the information, she still does not have access to their secret key.

[[Image:Ombrellino-keys.svg|left|70px]]‎

===Public Keys===
The encryption methods mentioned so far have been ''symmetric''. That means that the unscrambling process is the opposite of the scrambling process. With ''symmetric'' encryption, the same key is used both to encrypt and decrypt a message. With ''asymmetric'' encryption, the encryption key and the decryption key are different.  The decryption key, known as the private key, is used to decrypt a message. The encryption key, known as the public key, is used to encrypt a message.  In addition, it is published so that it is available for everyone to see (Singh, 1999).   &lt;ref name = &quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

==Encryption Strength==


The technique or rule selected for encryption is known as the encryption algorithm. Most encryption techniques use rather simple mathematical formulas using functions such as modular arithmetic, but applied to very large numbers and in conjunction with other functions. The type of encryption algorithm, the secrecy of the keys and a number of other characteristics together form what is referred to as the strength of the encrypted message (Lehtinen, 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehtinen&quot;/&gt;

==Cryptography in Education==
Currently, most schools use computers to store academic files as well as personal information about students and employees. Encryption can be an effective way to protect this information. 
Schools, in fact, are bound by several laws and regulations regarding the security of student information. Cryptography is core to this security (Schneier, 2004).&lt;ref name = &quot;Schneier&quot;&gt; Schneier, B. (2004). Secrets and Lies. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc.  &lt;/ref&gt;



===FERPA===
[http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html FERPA]stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.  This federal law governs the privacy and handling of educational records.  Under this law, non-directory information which includes such information as ethnicity, grade point average and test scores is considered private information. This information is not to be released to anyone without written consent from the student (FERPA, 1974). &lt;ref&gt; FERPA. (1974). Retrieved April 19, 2010 from https://sa.uab.edu/enrollmentservices/ferpa/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===PPRA===
[http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ppra/index.html PPRA] stands for Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment. This amendment &quot;seeks to ensure that schools and contractors obtain written parental consent before minor students are required to participate in any ED-funded survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals information concerning:

:::Political affiliations;
:::Mental and psychological problems potentially embarrassing to the student and his/her family;
:::Sex behavior and attitudes;
:::Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating and demeaning behavior;
:::Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships;
::: Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers; or
::: Income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such program).&quot;  &lt;ref name = &quot;PPRA&quot;&gt; PPRA. (2005). Retrieved April 19, 2010 from  http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ppra/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore the confidentiality of student information is imperative.

==Disk Fonts==

AROS can use two different fonts: Bitmap using the diskfont.library. A font is basically a mixture of the typeface (shape of letters), style (bold, plain, italic) and size (measured in fonts). The AROS has one built in font called Topaz which can be accessed at all times. If using a disk based font, then you need to use the diskfont.library to load a font from disk. Other font types such as the more common TrueType fonts, you need to use another library (See below).

Wanderer calls IconList with NULL font, because diskfont.library is not able to open &quot;arial.font&quot;. This happens on the other hand because diskfont.library is not finding the arial.font in FONTS:, because ExAll call returns 0 (== done) on its first call. This means not all fonts are returned, because the passed 1024 bytes buffer is too small to get them all in one go.

Loading a disk font

To load a diskfont, use the OpenDiskFont() function. You need to specify a TextAttr structure to state which font you require, the format of the command is:

TextFont font = OpenDiskFont(struct TextAttr textAttr)

The format of the TextAttr is:
&lt;pre&gt;
struct TextAttr {
   STRPTR ta_Name; /* name of the font */
   UWORD ta_YSize; /* height of the font */
   UBYTE ta_Style; /* intrinsic font style */
   UBYTE ta_Flags; /* font preferences and flags */
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, to specify a Topaz font, size 11 with Bold and Italic:

&lt;pre&gt;
struct TextAttr myta = {
   &quot;topaz.font&quot;
   11,
   FSF_ITALIC | FSF_BOLD,
   NULL
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are drawing with this font, you can change the default Rastport font with the SetFont() command and when done with it using the CloseFont() functions:
e.g.
&lt;pre&gt;
struct TextFont *myfont, *oldfont;
struct RastPort *myrp;
struct Window *mywin;

if (myfont = OpenDiskFont(&amp;myta))
{
  /* you would probably set the font of the rastport you are going to use */
  myrp = mywin-&gt;RPort
  oldfont = myrp-&gt;Font;
  SetFont(myrp, myfont);

  /* perform whatever drawing you need to do */

  /* time to clean up. If the rastport is not exclusively yours,
  you may need to restore the original font or other Rasport values */
  SetFont(myrp, oldfont);
  CloseFont(myfont);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to know what fonts are available in your program before trying to load one from disk, then you can use the AvailFonts() function which can read all the fonts from memory and disk and present them in an AvailFontsHeader structure, followed by a number of AvailFonts structures to be read by your program. You need to allocate some memory before calling this function to store the font information.

LONG error = AvailFonts(struct AvailFontsHeader *buffer, LONG bufBytes, ULONG flags )

For example,

&lt;pre&gt;
int afShortage, afSize;
struct AvailFontsHeader *afh;

afSize = 400;
do {
   afh = (struct AvailFontsHeader *) AllocMem(afSize, 0);
   if (afh) {
       afShortage = AvailFonts(afh, afSize, AFF_MEMORY|AFF_DISK);
       if (afShortage) {
         FreeMem(afh, afSize);
         afSize += afShortage;
       }
  }
  else {
     fail(&quot;AllocMem of AvailFonts buffer afh failedn&quot;);
     break;
  }
}while (afShortage);
&lt;/pre&gt;

For each font size described in a FontContents (or TFontContents) structure, there is a corresponding file in that font's directory whose name is its size. For example, for the font size Sapphire-19, there is a file in the Sapphire directory called 19. That file is basically a DiskFontHeader disguised as a loadable DOS hunk and is known as a font descriptor file. 

For a bitmap font, the &quot;.font&quot; file is a FontContentsHeader structure:

&lt;pre&gt;
struct FontContentsHeader {
    UWORD   fch_FileID;             /* FCH_ID */
    UWORD   fch_NumEntries;         /* the number of FontContents elements */
    struct  FontContents fch_FC[];  /* or struct TFontContents fch_TFC[];  */
};

#define MAXFONTPATH 256
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where the fch_FileID field can be either:

 FCH_ID    0x0f00    uses FontContents structures to describe the available sizes of this font.


 TFCH_ID   0x0f02    uses TFontContents structures to describe the available sizes of this font.


The FontContents structure:
&lt;pre&gt;
struct FontContents {
    char    fc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH];
    UWORD   fc_YSize;
    UBYTE   fc_Style;
    UBYTE   fc_Flags;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
struct TFontContents {
    char    tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-2];
    UWORD   tfc_TagCount;       /* including the TAG_DONE tag */
        /*
         *  if tfc_TagCount is non-zero, tfc_FileName is overlaid with
         *  Text Tags starting at:  (struct TagItem *)
         *      &amp;tfc_FileName[MAXFONTPATH-(tfc_TagCount*sizeof
         *                                 (struct TagItem))]
         */
    UWORD   tfc_YSize;
    UBYTE   tfc_Style;
    UBYTE   tfc_Flags;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
struct DiskFontHeader {
    ULONG     dfh_NextSegment;
    ULONG     dfh_ReturnCode;
    STRUCT    dfh,LN_SIZE;
    UWORD     dfh_FileID;
    UWORD     dfh_Revision;
    LONG      dfh_Segment;
    STRUCT    dfh,MAXFONTNAME;
    STRUCT    dfh-TF,tf_SIZEOF;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;



Does anyone know what program was used to generate the ttcourier fonts? They were committed by Georg in 2001.

IIRC BitLine (see Aminet, comes with source code). Loads font into memory using diskfont.library and then saves it to disk. Source font was truetype font which diskfont.library transforms into bitmap font during loading (if there's a font engine like the freetype based ones which can handle it). 

There's a small problem with these fonts: the glyphs are all aligned to the left of their box rather than to the centre (this is one of the papercut bugs). 

I did a quick look at the ttcourier font (with tools like sys:tools/fontinfo and the bitmap font editor &quot;TypeFace&quot; in sys:extras/misc/aminet/). It seems only some sizes (like 14) have the problem and problem is missing/zero kerning/spacing tables. 

Also looking at the svn log of the font files (&quot;14&quot;, etc.) in workbench/fonts/ it seems problem may have happened when the Euro character was (manually) added to the fonts (IIRC with Typeface font editor running under AROS -&gt; maybe a bug there), as I did a quick test with the initial revision of the &quot;14&quot; file which did not seem to have the kerning/spacing tables missing. 





==FreeType Fonts==

Note that depending on style and other things fonts are not not always rendered with the same HIDD method. See rom/graphics/text.c. The text not visible on the screenshot is those which gets rendered with BlitColorexpansion method.

==Introduction==

The datatypes.library was introduced to decode file formats (#?.png #?.jpg etc.) easily using different classes which can be installed as they are needed. 

The descriptors in devs/datatypes contain the information how to identify a file type. Usually the file is opened only once by datatypes.library and a small buffer is used for comparisons which contains the first few bytes of the file (64 bytes IIRC).

Most datatype descriptors are held very simple, for example &quot;compare the first 12 bytes with the pattern FORM????ILBM&quot;. The comparison is done by datatypes.library, there is no foreign code involved.

Only very few descriptors actually contain code. In this code everything can be done, though. For example the code can close and reopen the file and read it entirely if needed. But this should not be done because identification needs to be very fast.

Once the file type is identified and the application wants to load the file, the class library from classes/datatypes is called. This library contains the code to decode the file contents and to make it available to datatypes.library.

First you should learn about BOOPSI. If you understand BOOPSI, it's easy to understand datatypes, ReAction, MUI, ... 



The only problem with AmigaOS implementation of datatypes is that they aren't really bidirectional. You can generally only save in IFF. 

The ideal implementation would allow each datatype superclass (picture.datatype, sound.datatype etc) to provide a list of all currently known sub-classes that support encoding. You'd then be able to pick one and encode data for that datatype and write it out to disk in that format. 

Wanderer (AROS WB replacement) does not utilise the datatype subsystem directly &quot;except&quot; for loading window background imagery. The datatype system cannot deal with progressive loading and streaming yet. 



assume you are trying to manipulate images? Forget clumsy datatype system. Load images using datatypes but read image data to ARGB array using ReadPixelArray methods and dispose source object. For images, to get the raw data use PDTM_READPIXELARRAY (that's the uncompressed data). 


concerning Sounds ? Should it be better to use DTMethod to uncompress on a buffer and then use this uncompressed buffer ? For sound, get the data using the SDTA_Sample (or SDTA_LeftSample/SDTA_RightSample) attributes. You can retrieve sample data using SDTA_Sample tag but AmigaOS lacks support for SDTA_SampleType so you can get only 8-bit sample data there. AROS and MorphOS are more advanced there but generally it is better drop datatypes and write your own wave loader. 

Setting SDTA_BitsPerSample, 16 will make SDTA_(Left|Right|%)Sample be in 16-bits (32-bit is also supported).





===How to===

create a Datatype Object, use the NewDTObject function ...

&lt;pre&gt;
gd-&gt;gd_DisplayObject = NewDTObject ((IPTR)gd-&gt;gd_Unit, DTA_SourceType, DTST_CLIPBOARD, GA_Immediate, TRUE,
                                     GA_RelVerify, TRUE, DTA_TextAttr, (ULONG) &amp; gd-&gt;gd_TextAttr, TAG_DONE)) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The parameters of this functions uses Tags as defined in datatypes/datatypesclasses.h and intuition/gadgetclass.h 

&lt;pre&gt;
gf-&gt;gd_Unit = the Clipboard unit number
DTST_Clipboard = the Clipboard is the data source
GA_Immediate = Should the object be active when displayed
GA_RelVerify = Verify that the pointer is over the object when it is selected
gd_-&gt;gd_TextAttr = Pointer to text font attributes
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once a datatype object is no longer required, it is disposed of and memory released: e.g.
 DisposeDTObject (gd-&gt;gd_DisplayObject);

To get attributes from a datatype object, you can use the GetDTAttrs function e.g.
 GetDTAttrs (gd-&gt;gd_DisplayObject, DTA_DataType, (ULONG)&amp;dtn, TAG_DONE);

and examining the results from the dtn structure you can retrieve: 
 dtn-&gt;dtn_Header-&gt;dth_Name = Descriptive name of the datatype
 dtn-&gt;dtn_Header-&gt;dth_GroupID = The group the datatype belongs to

The function GetDTString returns a localised Datatypes string of the id given. This string could be syst, text, docu, soun, inst, musi, pict, anim or movi (see datatypes.h). e.g.
 GetDTString (dtn-&gt;dtn_Header-&gt;dth_GroupID)





===Change State - Set/Get===

what you usually do is, to create a object (initial state), get/set some attributes (attribute change) and then do layout or extract a type. 

in that case there many programs that call remap but doesnt have a gpinfo structure.

is there some info what remap have on initial state ?

AROS dt set it to true.

 pd-&gt;Remap = TRUE;

when a program have no gpinfo with screen, then i think remap should be set
to false.maybe AOS do that somewhere.

same can happen on AROS dt too, maybe on AOS dt bitmap (state change and get/set); however it is not clearly defined in which way state changes may affect attributes (screen, colors) or what happens in case some attributes have not been set prior triggering the state change; it's not even exactly clear which states are possible




===Refresh===

Your application can find out when a refresh is appropriate by using the Boopsi ICATarget attribute with the ICTargetIDCMP value. This causes the datatype (gadget) to send an IDCMP_IDCMPUpdate IntuiMessage to the window port on certain status changes. That message carries a pointer to one or more attributes and if DTA_Sync is in that list with a value of 1 then the datatype object is ready for refresh. 

You get one of these on attaching the datatype object to your window, and also a stream of them when the window is resized. 





==Creating datatype object of specified subclass==

In order to create a jpeg datatype object (jpeg subclass of picture class) 

&lt;pre&gt;
DTImage = NewDTObject(NULL,
DTA_SourceType, DTST_RAM,
DTA_BaseName, &quot;jpeg&quot;,
PDTA_DestMode, PMODE_V43,
TAG_DONE);
&lt;/pre&gt;

==How to compile datatypes==

Build dtdesc tool, this is what you need. The source is located in tools/dtdesc. 
This tool is used in order to make a datatype descriptor from .dtd file. Class library is built in a usual way, using a usual crosscompiler. 

A package so that it will be easy to build datatypes independently of the whole build system. 
Compiled createdtdesc and examinedtdesc for native AROS. One other tool that is needed is genmodule. 


What is needed is a READ/WRITEPIXELARRAY interface, that replaces the former SET PDTA_BitMap and GET PDTA_DestBitMap interface. If a Bitmap was SET (legacy interface), it gets converted to LUT8 format during layout. A destination BitMap is only created, if this is set by Prefs or an applications requests it by GET PDTA_DestBitMap. 

RENDER Method chooses one of these functions for displaying

* cgfx/WritePixelArray: Truecolor pic -&gt; Truecolor screen
* cgfx/WriteLUTPixelArray: Colormapped pic -&gt; Truecolor screen
* graphics/WriteChunkyPixels: Colormapped pic -&gt; Colormapped chunky screen
* graphics/BltBitMapRastPort: Colormapped pic -&gt; Colormapped planar screen

Truecolor pic -&gt; Colormapped screen is handled during layout, with a fixed colormap and some simple but fast dithering algorithm (one dimensional error propagation). Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm could be used for slightly better results (two dimensional error propagation). Much better results could be obtained by a calculated colormap (e.g. median cut algorithm), but this is much slower. 

Colormapped data is always stored in LUT8 format, or BitMap format for legacy. Truecolor data is always stored in ARGB format. This isn't memory effective, but makes things more simple and faster. Some optimization could be done here. 


Created a template for new graphic datatypes [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=datatype/utility here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Configuration ==
Configuration options affecting the XSLTForms transformation are taken from the sources below,
where the value for each option is the one found first: &lt;br/&gt;
# externally-defined XSLT Parameters, 
# &lt;tt&gt;config_LANG.xsl&lt;tt&gt; file, 
# Processing-Instructions(PIs).

=== XSLT Params ===
Under the &lt;tt&gt;xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; the following xsl-params are accepted:
* &lt;tt&gt;'''baseuri'''&lt;/tt&gt;: If unspecified, defaults to the base-name of of the &lt;tt&gt;xsltforms.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; href.
* &lt;tt&gt;'''xsltforms_caller'''&lt;/tt&gt;: 
* &lt;tt&gt;'''xsltforms_config'''&lt;/tt&gt;: A nodeset having as child the configuration &lt;tt&gt;&lt;properties&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element that are to be copied on the result xforms-page.  Defaults to the ones specified in &lt;tt&gt;config.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; file.
* &lt;tt&gt;'''xsltforms_debug'''&lt;/tt&gt;: &lt;tt&gt;'yes'&lt;/tt&gt; or anything else.  If unspecified, assumed no-debug.
* &lt;tt&gt;'''xsltforms_lang'''&lt;/tt&gt;: The suffix to use when selecting the language file &lt;tt&gt;config_&lt;SUFFIX&gt;.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; which specifies messages, calendar and other localizations/I18Ns.

Note that &lt;tt&gt;'''xsltforms_config''', '''xsltforms_debug''', '''xsltforms_lang'''&lt;/tt&gt; params are further applied to any subsequent transformations of documents containing a ''xsl-stylesheet'' PI, either on submission with &lt;tt&gt;replace=&quot;all&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or SVGs, or when applying the &lt;tt&gt;transform()&lt;/tt&gt; extension function.

=== Config File: &lt;tt&gt;config.xsl&lt;/tt&gt; ===
Sample configuration file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
	&lt;xsl:template name=&quot;config&quot;&gt;
		&lt;options&gt;
			&lt;nocss&gt;&lt;!-- When existent, no css-conversion hapens. --&gt;
		&lt;/options&gt;
		&lt;properties&gt; &lt;!--  Accessible at run time from within model('xf-model-config')/instance('xf-instance-config'). --&gt;
			&lt;language&gt;navigator&lt;/language&gt; &lt;!-- navigator or default --&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day0&gt;Mon&lt;/calendar.day0&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day1&gt;Tue&lt;/calendar.day1&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day2&gt;Wed&lt;/calendar.day2&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day3&gt;Thu&lt;/calendar.day3&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day4&gt;Fri&lt;/calendar.day4&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day5&gt;Sat&lt;/calendar.day5&gt;
			&lt;calendar.day6&gt;Sun&lt;/calendar.day6&gt;
			&lt;calendar.initDay&gt;6&lt;/calendar.initDay&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month0&gt;January&lt;/calendar.month0&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month1&gt;February&lt;/calendar.month1&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month2&gt;March&lt;/calendar.month2&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month3&gt;April&lt;/calendar.month3&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month4&gt;May&lt;/calendar.month4&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month5&gt;June&lt;/calendar.month5&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month6&gt;July&lt;/calendar.month6&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month7&gt;August&lt;/calendar.month7&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month8&gt;September&lt;/calendar.month8&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month9&gt;October&lt;/calendar.month9&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month10&gt;November&lt;/calendar.month10&gt;
			&lt;calendar.month11&gt;December&lt;/calendar.month11&gt;
			&lt;format.date&gt;MM/dd/yyyy&lt;/format.date&gt;
			&lt;format.datetime&gt;MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss&lt;/format.datetime&gt;
			&lt;format.decimal&gt;.&lt;/format.decimal&gt;
			&lt;status&gt;... Loading ...&lt;/status&gt;
		&lt;/properties&gt;
		&lt;extensions&gt; 
		&lt;!-- JS script code to add. 
		   - When none of the following child elements exist, any elements here are copied 
		   - just after xsltforms.js and before init-scripts. 
		   --&gt;
			&lt;beforeInit/&gt;	&lt;!-- Added in a separate &lt;script&gt; element, after xsltforms.js and before init-scipts. --&gt;
			&lt;onBeginInit/&gt;	&lt;!-- Added within init-code &lt;script&gt; at the begining of initImpl() function, before any definitions. --&gt;
			&lt;onEndInit/&gt;	&lt;!-- Added within init-code &lt;script&gt; at the end of initImpl() function, after xforms.init() invocation. --&gt;
			&lt;afterInit/&gt;	&lt;!-- Added in a separate &lt;script&gt; element, after init-scripts. --&gt;
		&lt;/extensions&gt;
	&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Processing Instructions ===
A xforms page can specify the following processing-instructions(PI) that act as configuraton parameters:
* '''&lt;tt&gt;xsltforms-options&lt;/tt&gt;''': It accepts 2 pseudo-attributes, sample:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;?xsltforms-options debug=&quot;yes&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
* '''&lt;tt&gt;css-conversion&lt;/tt&gt;''': sample:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;?css-conversion no?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Elements ==
* '''xforms:tree''': content-model: &lt;tt&gt;(xforms:label?, xforms:item/xforms:label*)&lt;/tt&gt;

== Functions ==
Extension functions supported by XSLTForms:

* '''is-valid(nodeset?)''': returns &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; when all nodes in the nodeset are valid.
* '''transform(nodeset, xslt-href)''': transforms the node from the node-set which is first in document order using the specified xslt, see https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4BB26785.4070807@agencexml.com&amp;forum_name=xsltforms-support
* '''serialize(nodeset?)''': serializes the node from the node-set which is first in document order into string(??)

== User-Defined Functions ==
Here is a sample of how to define user-defined XPath functions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;xsltforms/xsltforms.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
    xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
    xmlns:nfunc=&quot;http://example.net/xforms/new-functions/&quot;
    nfunc:bogus=&quot;Workaround for FF's bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94270&quot;
&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;User-Defined XPath functions&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is for old versions of XsltForms:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    XPathCoreFunctions['http://example.net/xforms/new-functions/ new-func'] =
        new XPathFunction(
            false,                       /* is accepting context as 1st-arg? */
            XPathFunction.DEFAULT_NONE,  /* context-form as 1st-arg, when (args.length == 0): [ DEFAULT_NONE | DEFAULT_NODE | DEFAULT_NODESET | DEFAULT_STRING ] */ 
            false,                       /* is returning nodes? */
            function() { 
              return &quot;NEW FUNC&quot;; 
            } 
        );
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
This works for new versions of XsltForms:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
    XsltForms_xpathCoreFunctions['http://example.net/xforms/new-functions/ new-func'] =
        new XsltForms_xpathFunction(
            false,                       /* is accepting context as 1st-arg? */
            XsltForms_xpathFunction.DEFAULT_NONE,  /* context-form as 1st-arg, when (args.length == 0): [ DEFAULT_NONE | DEFAULT_NODE | DEFAULT_NODESET | DEFAULT_STRING ] */ 
            false,                       /* is returning nodes? */
            function() { 
              return &quot;NEW FUNC&quot;; 
            } 
        );
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Hello to &lt;xf:output value=&quot;concat('My ', nfunc:new-func())&quot; /&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Arithmetic expressions ==

== Objects in the &lt;tt&gt;javascript:&lt;/tt&gt; pseudo-URL in &lt;tt&gt;xf:load/xf:resource@value&lt;/tt&gt; ==
When the &lt;tt&gt;javascript:&lt;/tt&gt; pseudo-URL is used within the &lt;tt&gt;xf:load/xf:resource@value&lt;/tt&gt; attribute,
the ''id'' of the enclosing &lt;tt&gt;&lt;xf:load&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; element is contained by the following js object-property:
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
  XSLTFormsContext.elementId
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arexx==

A scripting language for processing text and files. 

A script is just a plain text file. 

 rx script.rexx

Copyrighted (William S. Hawes) extension to Rexx from IBM

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARexx ARexx] is a scripting language and although you can use it to launch applications, you're better off using a regular DOS script for that, if it's required.

ARexx is far more powerful than DOS, but isn't really intended as a replacement. ARexx's principal strength is that it allows you to write scripts that can talk to &quot;hosts&quot;; that is, any application that has an ARexx port. This allows ARexx to control the application (within the limits of what features it exposes to ARexx). As a single script can communicate with multiple hosts, it can coordinate activity between applications. Any command it doesn't understand, it forwards to the currently selected host. By default, the host is the shell itself.

You invoke CALL searching for a function from a library (according to the documentation in this search order):
̊1) Internal functions
2) Built-in functions
3) Function libraries and Function Hosts
4) External AREXX programs - forward the Msg to the AREXX process itself and scan for files loaded

There are three different 'modes':
- ARexx command host 
- function host
- function library

    DO UNTIL [condition]
    [instructions]
    END

DO WHILE:

    DO WHILE [condition is true]
    [instructions]
    END

Stepping through a variable:

    DO i = x TO y BY z
    [instructions]
    END

Looping forever until exiting with LEAVE - BREAK has other possibilities, but you probably want LEAVE:

    DO FOREVER
      IF [condition] THEN LEAVE
    END

Looping a fixed number of times

    DO i = x TO y BY z FOR a
    [instructions]
    END




===Conditionals===

    IF [condition] THEN
      [instruction]
    ELSE
      [instruction]

Testing for multiple conditions

    SELECT
      WHEN [condition] THEN
      DO
      [instruction]
      END
    OTHERWISE
      DO
      [instruction] or NOP
      END

NOP indicates no instruction is to be executed.





===Variables===

There is a command that looks if a var is a integer or not... DATATYPE(WHOLE)





=== Command and Function ===


Rexx makes difference between commands and functions. With ADDRESS you indicate a place to send a command to. Commands are always one line. Functions have to be in a library with ARexx support and be added with addlib. You seem to want function syntax but are using command port.

Changes the way that arguments passed on the command line are made available to the called Rexx program. With this switch each parameter on the command line is available as a separate argument, rather then the normal behaviour of only making the combined command line arguments available as one internal argument. 

seems indeed that 'command'-mode is not to receive more then 1 argument (arg[0]). 




===PARSE===

The PARSE instruction is particularly powerful; it combines some useful string-handling functions 

 parse [upper] origin template

where origin specifies the source:

* arg (command line variable)
* linein (keyboard)
* pull (REXX data queue)
* value (a literal or a function)       '''with''' required to indicate where the literal ends 
* var (a variable)
* version (version/release number) 

and template can be:

* list of variables
* column number delimiters
* literal delimiters 

upper is optional; it you specify it, data will be converted to upper case.
use 'PARSE PULL var' if you don't want the input to be uppercased. 'PULL var' is the same as 'PARSE UPPER PULL var' 


Examples:

Using a list of variables as template

    myVar = &quot;John Smith&quot;
    parse var MyVar firstName lastName
    say &quot;First name is:&quot; firstName
    say &quot;Last name is:&quot;  lastName

displays the following

    First name is: John
    Last name is: Smith

Using a delimiter as template:

    myVar = &quot;Smith, John&quot;
    parse var MyVar LastName &quot;,&quot; FirstName
    say &quot;First name is:&quot; firstName
    say &quot;Last name is:&quot;  lastName

also displays the following

    First name is: John
    Last name is: Smith

Using column number delimiters:

    myVar = &quot;(202) 123-1234&quot;
    parse var MyVar 2 AreaCode 5  7 SubNumber
    say &quot;Area code is:&quot; AreaCode
    say &quot;Subscriber number is:&quot; SubNumber

displays the following

    Area code is: 202
    Subscriber number is: 123-1234

A template can use a combination of variables, literal delimiters, and column number delimiters.





===Advanced Data Structures===

&lt;pre&gt;
array(var, var)
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
record.field1
record.field2
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
/* check if a library function is available */
SHOW (L, 'rexxsupport.library')

/* if function not available - add library*/
ADDLIB ('rexxsupport.library',0,-30,0)

/* SHOWDIR (directory, {mode), [pad]) */
SHOWDIR ('sys:')

/* if function  - remove library*/
REMLIB ('rexxsupport.library')
&lt;/pre&gt;

 parse arg height, width, depth

 PROCEDURE EXPOSE WORD


You can pass a whole stem to a function declared in THE SAME script via the &quot;PROCEDURE EXPOSE&quot; statement, e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
...
test: procedure expose stem.
say stem.1 stem.a stem.a.ciao
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
(take care to put the '.' or just the stem var will be visible to the function 'test', not the all stem.
Any modificiation to 'stem.' will be global. There is no way to pass a stem to an external function 

ARexx will also search for the function in a file with the same name as it and as &lt;name&gt;.rexx), both in current dir and REXX:. Don't put .rexx on my files, as ~(*:*) matches functions, *.rexx ordinary scripts, *.ced ... 






===File Manipulation===

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Create a file */
if open('file', 'ram:test', 'w') then
  call writeln('file' 'data')
  call close('file')
else
  say 'unable to open'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Read a file */
if open('file', 'ram:test', 'r') then
  call readch('file' var) /* read first var characters */
  do while ~eof('file')
    say line
    line=readln('file') /* read next line */
  end
  call close('file')
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
/* Read a file */
if open('file', 'ram:test', 'a') then
  say 'it is here'
else 
  say 'it is not here'
&lt;/pre&gt;


 position = seek ('file', var, string) /* var is +/- bytes from start and string can be b, c or e */
 
&lt;pre&gt;
IBM EOL (end of line) = &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; or (^M^J)
Amiga/UNIX EOL = &lt;LF&gt; or (^J)
Macintosh EOL = &lt;CR&gt; or (^M)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
IBM EOF = &lt;EOL&gt;&lt;CTRL-Z&gt; or (^M^J^Z)
Amiga EOF = &lt;NULL&gt; or (), optionally &lt;LF&gt; or (^J)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Null of course being the absence of any data. 

IBM text editors do a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; at each &lt;RETURN&gt;. Most Amiga software, AFAIK, only does &lt;LF&gt; and the end of the file is simply indicated when there are no more bytes to be read. 

The ARexx EOF() indicates when you've run out of stuff to read from a file. It does not (to my knowledge) look around for whatever the IBM thinks signifies the end of a file on top of simply noticing when the file has reached it's end of capacity. (say you have a 1024 byte file, after reading 1024 bytes you will have reached the end of the file, or EOF.) 

&lt;code&gt;
do UNTILEF(&quot;FILE&quot;)
/* Do some reading here or something */
end
&lt;/code&gt;


Change &quot;call readch('rfile',1)&quot; into &quot;say c2d(readch('rfile',1))&quot; to display the &quot;ascii&quot; code. (Note that only charcodes &lt; 127 is ASCII) 





===Debugging===

Syntax, loop errors, etc. 

Trace

Signal





===Program IPC===

 rx &quot;address command Dir&quot;

Talking to DOS, 

 address &quot;program-name&quot;



You can get the ARexx commands of any MUI program with the HELP command. Here is an example for IBrowse. 

&lt;pre&gt;
/* CheckIB.rexx*/

address IBrowse

'HELP vd0:IB.txt'
&lt;/pre&gt;

The drive specification after the HELP command is the drive and file name for the output. Of course, the program you are checking must be running so the port is available. The output will show the standard ARexx commands that every MUI program has followed by the commands specific to the particular program being checked. 




===Hooks===

Normally you would provide a commandlist with your application and those command would 'automatically' be processed by the hooks installed.

It's when you use commands that does not get 'processed automatically' (because they are not in the commandlist) you need to make use of the functionality you presented (like MUIA_Application_RexxHook).

Since those attributes does not seem to be in place, you would need to fallback to the ordinairy way of doing things, meaning you would somehow 'invent' how to 'sync' your normal commands with the arexx commands

==Adding Regina/Rexx to Programs==

http://aminet.net/search?query=Minrexx
http://www.pcguru.plus.com/tutorial/introduction.html

It's really easy to set up your own Rexx port. It's just a standard MsgPort. If you are just going to exit on any message and not parse commands sent to the port then you don't even need to open rexxsyslib.library... 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct MsgPort *CreatePubPort (UBYTE *name, LONG pri)
/* create a port if port name is not already used */
{
struct MsgPort *pubport;

port = NULL;
Forbid ();
if (FindPort (name) == NULL)
pubport = CreateMsgPort (name, pri);
Permit ();
return (pubport);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



Now that the port is created we just need to wait for a message.

&lt;pre&gt;
static void PubPortWait (struct MsgPort *pubport)
/* wait for a message or signal on our pubport */
{
ULONG port_mask, signals;
struct RexxMsg *msg;

port_mask = (1L &lt;&lt; RexxPort-&gt;mp_SigBit);
while (1)
	{
	signals = Wait (port_mask | SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
	if (signals &amp; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
	Quit(&quot;Aborting&quot;);
	if (signals &amp; port_mask)
		{
		while ((msg = (struct RexxMsg *) GetMsg (pubport)) != NULL)
			{
			ProcessRexxMsg (msg); /* routine parses the REXX message */
			ReplyMsg ((struct Message *) msg);
			}
		}
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


ProcessRexxMsg() can print your message and exit but remember to ReplyMsg(). If you want to parse the Arexx commands, it's not much more work. The above is pulled from a longer printed code example and uses some REXX includes from &quot;arexx.h&quot; and &quot;arexxsyslib.h&quot; but it should NOT be necessary to open rexxsyslib.library if you will exit on any message received at your port.

You can now send a message to this little program with the following script:
&lt;pre&gt;
/* Testing the variable interface */
a = 1
say 'a before call' a
ADDRESS 'VARTEST' test
say 'a after call' a
&lt;/pre&gt;

Save it as (example) 'vartest.rexx' and run it with:
&lt;pre&gt;
rx vartest.rexx
&lt;/pre&gt;

(All on one line)

CTRL-C will stop this thing. Note here that the above and RAW-KEY Intui-messages (OpenWindow()/intuition,
IDCMP flags) are about the only easy and *system legal* way to obtain information about keys pressed. 


This will extract the filename extension (such as .lha or .8svx) along with its length. It can be useful, when renaming files. Used it in a conversion script, that can convert different file- types, so archive.lha gets archive.lzx and pic.gif gets pic.png.

This one makes a valid path, which is better to use. No more RAM:Envfilename mistake, but RAM:Env/filename
Additional it makes RAM: out of Ram Disk: 

Nothing special, though, you can achieve the same result (except for RAM:&lt;-Ram Disk:) by using rexxdossupport.library/AddPart(pathname,&quot;&quot;) - Do not forget the &quot;&quot;. 

&lt;pre&gt;

this little sub-routine used in all my ARexx scripts, that need external ports to be available. (WaitForPort) 
Since not liking to write the same lines in any script, just select this routine from a GoldED list requester and it is appended to my source. The function is simple: 
&lt;pre&gt;
BOOL = IfPort(portname, prog, mode)
&lt;/pre&gt;

portname is the ARexx-port name of the application,
prog is the full path to the application, in case it needs to be launched mode can be either empty or WB. If WB is used it will be started with WBRun. Sometimes this is quite useful. 

The function results in a BOOL (either TRUE or FALSE) so it is easy to handle flow control. 

In this routine you will find another function I use: 

 myERR()

You can replace it by anything you want or just take it away. Use such general routines, because they are more powerful, so could have some logging in myERR() or WB requesters or whatever. 


&lt;code&gt;
/*///------------------------------ &quot;IfPort(portname,prog,mode)&quot; ------------------------------ */

/*
** IfPort(portname, prog, mode)

** Freely usable, freely distributable, intellectual properties:

Here ya go, the fastest SQRT function in Rexx I have seen yet, found in c.l.rexx 

&lt;code&gt;
/* */

x1 = 1
x0 = N
if N ~= 0 then
do until x1 = x0
x0 = x1
x1 = ((x0 * x0) + N) / (2 * x0)
end
else x1 = 0
say x1
return
&lt;/code&gt;


a very simple one, seldomly used, but given as some example of the Translate() function to newbies and to make the function set a bit more complete. (Since there is an Upper() why shouldn't be there also a Lower()) 
&lt;code&gt;
/*
** Lower()
** Like Upper(), but this one makes a string lowercase.
** Considers german unmlauts and some accents.
** TODO: Add more national characters. Do you know of any missing

Suggest that when you open files you do something more like this to check that it was opened successfully: 
&lt;code&gt;
if open(tempfile,'t:ms_scenes',w) then do
call writeln(tempfile,'SCENE1')
/* blah, blah... */
call close(file)
end
else do
say 'Unable to open temp file!'
exit
end
&lt;/code&gt;


Get the file size
&lt;code&gt;
/* */

if file=&quot;&quot; then do
say &quot;no file given&quot;
exit
end

s=statef(file)
if s=&quot;&quot; then do
say &quot;can't find file '&quot;file&quot;'&quot;
exit
end

parse var s type size d d d d d comment
if type~=&quot;FILE&quot; then do
say &quot;'&quot;file&quot;' is not a valid file name&quot;
exit
end
say &quot;file '&quot;file&quot;':&quot; size

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Changing Counter-Strike materials'''

One thing that I hate about Counter Strike is what bots follow (there is a map that have buttons to switch the light off and these bots always play with it). Don't worry; it's very simple and very easy. In Counter-Strike files there is a file called &quot;materials.txt&quot;. Open this file and change the first option in the 12th line. It's 'M' for metal and it can be changed, but be careful to not add or remove options or CS will not run. Now run CS and see how it worked. Enjoy playing CS.

One thing that i hate about Counter Strike is what bots follow (there is a map that have buttons to switch the light off and these bots always play with it).Don't worry its very simple and very easy, so in counter strike files there is a file called &quot;materials.txt&quot;so i entered this file and change some settings for bots so i changed the first option in the 12 line and its 'M' metal and i change it but be careful don't add or remove options or cs will not run and edit it safely like they did.Now run CS and see how it worked,enjoy playing CS</text>

==[[WB:WikiProject Mathematics|WikiProject Mathematics]]==
Hi, I have been trying to restart the Mathematics project here at Wikibooks.  The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics coverage here.  Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;);  or actual mathematics content.  I have noticed you've been editing [[Algebra]] fairly regularly and thought you might be interested in joining.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:21, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

== Hyperbola ==

Hello.  I rejected your edit to [[Intermediate Algebra]], as y = 1/x is indeed a hyperbola[http://www.math.uoc.gr/~pamfilos/eGallery/problems/HyperbolaRectangular.html].  Please do continue to contribute.--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 11pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Arthur &lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Arthurvogel|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Vogel&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:41, 8 October 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phase modulation is most commonly used to convey digital signals. All high performance modems today use phase modulation.
Similar to FM (frequency modulation), is Phase modulation. (We will show how they are the same in the next chapter.) If we alter the value of the phase according to a particular function, we will get the following generalized PM function:

sPM = Acos(2πfct + αs(t))

It is important to note that the fact that  for all values of t. If this relationship is not satisfied, then the phase angle is said to be wrapped.

Now look at &lt;kuid2:86627:1731:3&gt; and look at the queues.  Note how it can accept three different types of passenger.

Copy this queue bit into anything else you want to passenger enable. You may have to add a few kuid numbers to the table at the end.

Any passenger active station can use different passenger sets. Just change the kuid for the passenger set.

      <comment>Not toxic.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Discovered=
&quot;Sir Humphry Davy electrolytically isolated pure magnesium metal in 1808. Before Davy isolated magnesium, it was recognized as an element by Black in 1831.&quot;

isolated in 1808 and discovered in 1831? There must be something wrong!

==Toxicity==
I removed the text stating that magnesium, if eaten,  would kill you before it hit your stomach.  This is simply not true.  http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/magnesium/ indicates that &quot;Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health.&quot;  Eating too much of it can cause problems, but this hardly seems worth mentioning.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''''And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.'''''

''Commentary:'' The beast from the sea, the dragon of chapter 12, and the Babylon of chapter 17 are all described as having seven heads and ten horns, indicating a connection between them. The sea here may represent the Gentile nations of the world, from which the Beast will come. The Beast has been suggested to represent a so-called &quot;anti-christ&quot;, the &quot;false messiah&quot; of Matthew 24:5 and I John 2:18, and is also the &quot;little horn&quot; of Daniel 7:8, 20, 21, 24, 25. The Beast could to be understood either or both as a person and an empire. As a man, he is the &quot;willful king&quot; of Daniel 11:36, the &quot;coming prince&quot; of Daniel 9:26, and the &quot;man of sin&quot; of 2 Thessalonians 2:3. As an empire, he represents the revival of the Roman Empire, both with respect to lands and belief systems. The leopard, bear, and lion refer to the first three beasts of Daniel Chapter 7. The horns and heads will be discussed in Chapter 17. He speaks blasphemy against God because his power and authority come from Satan himself.

The seven heads have been known to represent the Rome because the capital is built on seven hills. The ten horns represent the ten provinces of the Roman empire. The appearance of the beast as a whole (looking like a leopard with bear feet and a lion mouth) also relate to the Roman empire because by giving an analogy of the qualities of the empire. 

If we assert that there is a possible connection between the number of the beast and Nero and if not Nero, then at least some would agree that John may be using the beast as a symbol for the governing Roman Emperors at the time he was writing and aligning them with the anti-christ.. If so, the sea could be a connection to the Roman emperor's proconsul emerging from the sea at the arrival for his annual visit to Ephesus (Witherington III, Revelation).
Also important to note is that the according to ancient beliefs the sea was a symbol of chaos, evil, and demonic powers. While the sea may be a symbol of chaos and evil, historically speaking, the sea was a major source of the Roman Empire as far back as Julius Caesar's defeat of the Medditerranean pirates and Caesar Augustus' naval defeat of Cleopatra and Marc Antony.  This comparison lend some credit to the argument that much of John's revelation is a warning against the pagan religion of the empire.

===Verse 3===

:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And I saw one of his heads, as it were, wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world wondered about the beast.'''''

''Commentary:'' It is unclear how to understand the Greek verb &quot;esphagmene&quot; at work in this verse.  Generally, this verb is translated to mean &quot;to slay&quot; or &quot;to murder.&quot;  One interpretation that could be taken from this verse is that the wound was nearly mortal, thus causing the head to die.  However, another interpretation is that the wound was actually mortal, and only the head survived.  This verb is also used in Revelation 5:6, referring to the death of the Lamb.  Recall that the Lamb rose again though.  Scholars have argued that the reader is meant to see a demonic imitation of Christ in this verse.

A prophetic reading of this passage could refer to the Holy Roman Empire and its collapse in the fifth century. This reading is only possible if the Beast with seven heads is understood to be the Gentiles of the world and represent the kingdoms who had succeeded the empire. One of the heads, presumably the seventh head, is mentioned specifically in this text and could possible represent a succeeding kingdom that was lead by Satan. This head, being &quot;wounded to death&quot; and then healed is Satan overtaking and rule the kingdom. Satan will enter the body and proceed to deceive all those who did not believe, ultimately overtaking the kingdom. But, this can only be done because God wants it to be done. All of these events (even the absolutely horrible ones) are only done because they are God's will.

===Verses 4-6===

:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?&quot;''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and power was given to him to continue forty-two months. ''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.

''Commentary:'' John may be discussing living in the day when the government saw themselves as deities and required everyone to worship them. The dragon is Satan. People will not realize they are worshiping Satan; they will believe the Beast must have divine (messianic) power because of the things he is able to do. He will deliberately foster this belief in his speaking, which constitutes blasphemy since he is claiming God's authority.The word &quot;great&quot; in this text can be translated as arrogant words. The blasphemies allude to Daniel 7 v 8 &amp; 20.  He will have worldwide power during the last half of the Tribulation: forty and two months or three and a half years. Satan gives the beast freedom of speech and the authority to continue for forty-two months, as God limited the beast's power of influence and reign.

It is highly unlikely that Satan would limit his time to create havoc. With this we must consider how did he get his power? Ultimately God has allowed Satan to have this capability which is hard to imagine if you only see his work as positive without considering the opposite. This time period of 3½ years occurs in several places in Revelation: Gentiles tread the holy city underfoot for &quot;forty-two months,&quot; or 3½ years (11:2); the two witnesses are given power to prophesy &quot;1,260 days,&quot; or exactly 3½ years, according to the Hebrew year of 360 days (11:3); the &quot;woman clothed with the sun&quot; is protected in the wilderness for &quot;1,260 days,&quot; or 3½ years (12:6); and in this passage, we see that the beast is given authority to continue for &quot;forty-two months,&quot; or 3½ years (13:5). It is very likely that all of these passages refer to the same time period, and that they coincide with either the first or the second half (depending on interpretation) of Daniel's 70th week (cf. Dan 9:26-27).

===Verse 7===

:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues, and nations.'''''

''Commentary:'' The Beast will challenge and create war with the true believers (saints) and overcome them. This war may be seen more as a war of persecution as opposed to an actual war with soldiers. Because God has given Satan control over the Earth and its inhabitants, he has decidedly not protected the saints who are instead supposed to endure there tribulations. The saints were defined as “the women’s children who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. The power of this beast is not meant to be underestimated, he is predicted to have power over the earth and its inhabitants.

===Verses 8-9===

:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And all who live upon the earth will worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.''''' &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;''''' If anyone has an ear, let him hear.

''Commentary:'' The figure of the lamb indicates some sacrifice and in relation to the mentions of humanity, &quot;the book of life&quot; and its relation with salvation, it seem to indicate the initial sacrifice by Adam, the initiation of the human condition. The foundation of the world predates the coming of Christ, the last Adam. If the effects of Adam’s original sin are not undone before a person dies or before judgment day, then they are doomed. Numerous passages in the Bible refer to “the book of life”, this seems to indicate a book with a genealogical record of some type, for registering peoples names for divine purposes. Accordingly, this reference indicates one of God's records of men, that is kept in heaven (Luke, 10:20) as &quot;the book of life&quot;. There are many other books/records kept (Revelation, 20:12), this particular one was started in the foundation of the world (Revelation, 17:8). Names are added and removed from this record in accord to their relation with God. Only the righteous (Psalm, 69:28) are kept, and only those will be saved (Daniel, 12:1), the others will suffer (Revelation, 20:15) as they will believe the falsehoods of the Beast and will worship him. Verse 9 is an often repeated formula originating in Isaiah 6:9-10 used in the Gospel of John to emphasize the importance of a concept. Here he is pointing out that the Lamb offers the ''only'' path to salvation, and that all who reject Him will be lost.

===Verse 10===

:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;''''' He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity. He that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.'''''

''Commentary:'' God will punish the evildoers when their allotted time is over. The Beast and his followers will be defeated, judged, and punished. Patience here is the Greek hupomonē, meaning &quot;endurance&quot;. Saints, in this verse, is the Greek hagiōn, better translated as &quot;holy ones&quot;. Those who have saving faith will endure the persecutions of the Beast. Some of the saints will be held captive and others will become martyrs according to God's plan. The faith of the saints through such tribulatory periods and through physical death will be the key to saving them in the end from Eternal damnation. They are not to take the sword and attach their foes, but instead they should suffer the evil and end the cycle of killing by revenge.
Some say that the wars that are waged against God's people are brought about by the people of earth alone. It is said that once the time comes for this to be fulfilled, Satain will not even need to wage war because the people on earth will have brought war upon themselves already.

==The Beast from the Earth==
===Verses 11-13===

:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon,''''' &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and those who live on it to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed.''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.'''''

''Commentary:'' The second beast is the False Prophet. His role is to encourage people to worship the Antichrist. His two horns like a lamb represent his attempt to appear gentle, reverent, and harmless. But his power comes from Satan, and he has the full supernatural power of the Antichrist, who is the political ruler. The False Prophet equates to the Holy Spirit in Satan's false trinity. His actions show him to be a religious leader. His wonders and miracles, accomplished through the power of Satan, will convince the world to worship the Antichrist. He is able to make fire come down from heaven (a vision of modern weapons?).

===Verses 14-15===

:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by means of those miracles which he has power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by the sword and yet lived.''''' &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he had power to give life to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.'''''

''Commentary:'' The False Prophet will use the miracles of Elijah (I Kings 18:38 and II Kings 1:10) to trick people into worshiping the false messiah, and to create an image of the Beast in violation of God's commandment. This image will be set up at &quot;the holy place&quot;, which is either the Well of Souls or the Western Wall, both on the Temple Mount at Jerusalem. This is the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; (Matthew 24:15 and Daniel 9:27). The people of the earth must either worship the image or be killed. There is no room for religious freedom in the Beast's empire! Seeing that the second Beast has the power to give life, it has the same ability as the Holy Spirit.

Jesus says: &quot;When you see the 'abomination of desolation' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place... there will be great tribulation.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Mt 24:15,21]&lt;/sup&gt; The &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; is usually understood to mean the setting up of a pagan altar in the temple at Jerusalem. This has happened twice already: once in 168 B.C., when Syrian forces under the Greek general Antiochus Epiphanes invaded Jerusalem, and again in 70 A.D., when Roman forces under Titus destroyed the city. Since Jesus was referring to a future event, the first of these does not apply. Some believe that the prophecy was fulfilled in 70 AD, because Jesus said, &quot;This generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.&lt;sup&gt;[Mt 24:34]&lt;/sup&gt; Others see a partial fulfillment in 70 AD, and a more complete fulfillment at some future date, because many of the contextual details attached to Jesus' prophecy were not fulfilled in 70 AD. This future occurrence of the “abomination of desolation” will herald a time of great tribulation “such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever will be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Mt 24:21-22]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Verses 16-17===

:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;''''' And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, ''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''so that no one might buy or sell except those who have the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.'''''

''Commentary:'' There have been many attempts to identify this mark. Given modern technology, it is quite possible that the &quot;mark&quot; might be an embedded microchip, readable electronically at a short distance, that uniquely identifies every person. This could be tied into financial accounts and used much as a credit card, allowing the transfer of funds without cash. Others believe that this could possibly relate to a bar code since it is imprinted on every product at a store.  Those who refuse the mark are unable to buy food, thus forcing people to accept it. The right hand is symbolic of authority and power as evidenced in the Scriptures when describing God's power (e.g. Ps 63:8; Ps. 139:10). The right hand may be used to show the power and authority Satan will have over those who take his mark. Also, the right hand and forehead are clearly visible demonstrating that there is no secrecy when it comes to this mark. One cannot purchase food or other necessities without taking on this mark. Starvation coupled with poverty or submission to the beast will be the only alternatives to choose from.

===Verse 18===

:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Here is wisdom: Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.'''''

''Commentary:'' 
Of all the verses in Revelation, Rev. 13:18 has easily received the most attention. There have been many interpretations regarding the number 666.  It may simply signify incompleteness and chaos by virtue of the fact it falls short of the perfect 777.  

However, gematria, the ancient practice of assigning letters numerical value, was common in John’s day.  Going the other way (numbers to letters) involves a little more guess work after 2000 years.  Having said this, the Greek to Hebrew to number translation of Nero can produce 666.  Also, the word Beast itself also produces 666.  It seems John is showing as explicitly as he is able that 666 is the Beast is Nero is 666, etc. Nero is also a likely candidate due to his rampant persecution of Christians. Furthermore, he would have been extremely well known to John's audience, so that even after concealing his identity in the number, the beast would have clearly stood as a symbol of Nero.

Additionally significant is the fact that 666 is the eighth sequential doubly triangular number; that is, it is the eighth number which is the sum of successive numbers beginning with 1 whose last number in the series (in this case 36) is also triangular.  Some have argued that this could be the meaning of the symbolism of the beast having seven head, with Nero being the eighth and the beast himself.  This may be pushing the symbolism too far.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is actually some contention that the number is not, in fact, 666, but is instead 616. This can be found in some early manuscripts of the book. These are certainly in the minority, although they are not totally without merit. This comes from using the Latin form of Nero's name, translating it to Hebrew, and then assigning a number value to the letters. This is the same process discussed above which translates the letters of Nero's name to 666. 

Others see this verse differently.  Given that John expected his early Christian readers to understand it, it seems unlikely to be a complex code. Perhaps it is a pointer to the only other place in scripture where this number is given in exactly the same way: I Kings 10:14. If so, the verse itself is not the target; the intent is rather to draw the reader to I Kings Chapter 10. That chapter, taken together with the secular history of Ethiopia's Solomonic Dynasty, would explain very nicely how the Antichrist can fulfill the prophecy of being from the line of King David while also being a Gentile (King Solomon was King David's son). [cf. the Wikipedia article on the [[w:Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic Dynasty]].]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pythagoreans ==
*On the question of whether mathematics was discovered or invented, Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans had no doubt—mathematics was real, immutable, omnipresent, and more sublime than anything that could conceivably emerge from the feeble human mind. The Pythagoreans literally embedded the universe into mathematics. In fact, to the Pythagoreans, God was not a mathematician—mathematics was God!

==Plato ==
*Plato writes: “Geometric equality is of great importance among gods and men.”

*To Plato, the only things that truly and wholly exist are those abstract forms and ideas of mathematics, since only in mathematics, he maintained, could we gain absolutely certain and objective knowledge. Consequently, in Plato’s mind, mathematics becomes closely associated with the divine. In the dialogue Timaeus, the creator god uses mathematics to fashion the world,
and in The Republic, knowledge of mathematics is taken to be a crucial step on the pathway to knowing the divine forms. Plato does not use mathematics for the formulation of some laws of nature that are testable by experiments. Rather, for him, the mathematical character of the world is simply a consequence of the fact that “God always geometrizes.”

*Plato wrote in Timaeus: “As there still remained one compound figure, the fifth, God used it for the whole, broidering it with designs.” So the dodecahedron represented the universe as a whole. Note, however, that the dodecahedron, with its twelve pentagonal surfaces, has the golden ratio written all over it. Both its volume and its surface area can be expressed as simple functions of the golden ratio (the same is true for the icosahedron).

*The note may have been written by the fourth century orator Sopatros, and it reads (in a translation by Andrew Barker): “There had been inscribed at the front of the School of Plato, ‘Let no one who is not a geometer enter.’ [That is] in place of ‘unfair’ or ‘unjust’: for geometry pursues fairness and justice.” The note seems to imply that Plato’s inscription replaced “unfair or unjust person” in a sign that was common in sacred places (“Let no unfair or unjust person enter”) with the phrase “one who is not a geometer.” 

==Archimedes ==
*Archimedes changed the world of mathematics and its perceived relation to the cosmos in a profound way. By displaying an astounding combination of theoretical and practical interests, he provided the first empirical, rather than mythical, evidence for an apparent mathematical design of nature. The perception of mathematics being the language of the universe, and therefore the concept of God as a mathematician,was born in Archimedes’ work. 

==Galileo ==
*Centuries before the question of why mathematics was so effective in explaining nature was even asked, Galileo thought he already knew the answer! To him, mathematics was simply the language of the universe. To understand the universe, he argued, one must speak this language. God is indeed a mathematician. First, we must realize that to Galileo, mathematics ultimately meant geometry
Galileo was not satisfied with mathematics as the mere go-between or conduit. He took the extra bold step of equating mathematics with God’s native tongue. This identification, however, raised another serious problem—one that was about to have a dramatic impact on Galileo’s life. According to Galileo, God spoke in the language of mathematics in designing nature. Moreover, Galileo argued that by pursuing science using the language of mechanical equilibrium and mathematics, humans could understand the divine mind. Put differently, when a person finds a solution to a problem using proportional geometry, the insights and understanding gained are godlike.

==Descartes==
*Functions are truly the bread and butter of modern scientists, statisticians, and economists. Once many repeated scientific experiments or observations produce the same functional interrelationships, those may acquire the elevated status of laws of nature—mathematical descriptions of a behavior all natural phenomena are found to obey. Descartes’ ideas therefore opened the door for a systematic mathematization of nearly everything—the very essence of the notion that God is a mathematician.



For our present purposes the most interesting point is Descartes’ view that God created all the “eternal truths.” In particular, he declared that “the mathematical truths which you call eternal have been laid down by God and depend on Him entirely no less than the rest of his creatures.” So the Cartesian God was more than a mathematician, in the sense of being the creator of both mathematics and a physical world that is entirely based on mathematics. According to this worldview, which was becoming prevalent at the end of the seventeenth century, humans clearly only discover mathematics and do not invent it.

==Newton==

For Newton, the world’s very existence and the mathematical regularity of the observed cosmos were evidence for God’s presence. 

Newton added yet another twist, based on the universality of his laws. He regarded the fact that the entire cosmos is governed by the same laws and appears to be stable as further evidence for God’s guiding hand.

In his book Opticks, Newton made it clear that he did not believe that the laws of nature by themselves were sufficient to explain the universe’s existence—God was the creator and sustainer of all the atoms that make up the cosmic matter: “For it became him [God] who created them [the atoms] to set them in order. And if he did so, it’s unphilosophical to seek for any other Origin of the World, or to pretend that it might arise out of a Chaos by the mere Laws of Nature.” In other words, to Newton, God was a mathematician (among other things), not just as a figure of speech, but almost literally—the Creator God brought into existence a physical world that was governed by mathematical laws.

==Others==
*If you had to choose one concept of our mathematics that has the highest probability of having an existence independent of the human mind, which one would you select? Most people would probably conclude that this has to be the natural numbers. What can be more “natural” than 1, 2, 3,…? Even the German mathematician of intuitionist inclinations Leopold Kronecker (1823–91) famously declared: “God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.” 


*The German mathematician Jacob Jacobi (1804–51) presumably expressed those shifting tides when he replaced Plato’s “God ever geometrizes” by his own motto: “God ever arithmetizes.” In some sense, however, these efforts only transported the problem to a different branch of mathematics. While the great German mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943) did succeed in demonstrating that Euclidean geometry was consistent as long as arithmetic was consistent, the consistency of the latter was far from unambiguously established at that point.

*On the relationship between mathematics and the physical world, a new sentiment was in the air. For many centuries, the interpretation of mathematics as a reading of the cosmos had been dramatically and continuously enhanced. The mathematization of the sciences by Galileo, Descartes, Newton, the Bernoullis, Pascal, Lagrange, Quetelet, and others was taken as strong evidence for an underlying mathematical design in nature. One could clearly argue that
if mathematics wasn’t the language of the cosmos, why did it work as well as it did in explaining things ranging from the basic laws of nature to human characteristics?

*To be sure, mathematicians did realize that mathematics dealt only with rather abstract Platonic forms, but those were regarded as reasonable idealizations of the actual physical elements. In fact, the feeling that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics was so deeply rooted that many mathematicians absolutely refused even to consider mathematical concepts and structures that were not directly related to the physical world.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Learning Outcomes for the Biological Level of Analysis==

:*'''Outline biological principles. Explain how these principles are shown in research, describe why certain research methods are used and the ethical implications of these methodologies.'''
:**'''Behavior can be innate because it is based on genes.'''
:***Twin studies allow researchers to distinguish between nature and nurture influences on psychology. Bouchard did a study using monozygotic twins reared together or apart and found that twins were as similar regardless of whether they grew up together. This shows that genes contribute more to behavior than environment.
:***Twin studies are often used because genes and environment cannot be manipulated by researchers. Also, case studies are used because genes and environment can’t be manipulated, and it is unethical to purposely destroy part of a human brain. Thus, cases where this happens must be used as natural experiments.
:****An ethical concern with this research is that reuniting twins who have been separated or contacting families could harm the people involved. Also, there could be privacy issues with looking through courts records of adoptions.
:**'''Animal research can provide insight into human psychology.'''
:***James Olds used rats to determine the effects of stimulating the pleasure center of the brain. He found that rats would press a lever stimulating that center over and over to the exclusion of other needs such as eating. Because a parallel structure exists in human brains, this research has been generalized to humans.
:****An ethical concern related to animal studies is whether or not it is ethical to destroy parts of their brains or sacrifice them for autopsies in order to learn more about human psychology. For example, sacrificing rats to determine the effects of learning on the cortex.
:**'''Behavior is based on physiology.''' 
:***Destruction of the hippocampus leads to amnesia. This is shown by the case study of Clive Wearing, whose hippocampi were destroyed by encephalitis. He is unable to form new memories following the loss. He can remember emotional things, however, since emotional memory appears to be stored in another structure.
:****An ethical concern is maintaining the privacy of the individuals being studied, like Clive Wearing.


:*'''Explain a study related to localization of brain function.'''
:**'''James Old''' used electrodes to stimulate what he thought was the pleasure center of the brains of rats. When allowed to stimulate themselves, Olds found that rats would do so to the exclusion of fulfilling other needs, like eating. This shows that pleasure (of all kinds, like eating and sex) is localized in a specific brain area.
:*'''Explain the effects of a neurotransmitter, with research.'''
:**A study done with Japanese monks and volunteers who meditated found that when the monks began hallucinating due to the meditation the levels of serotonin in their hypothalamuses and cortexes became elevated.
:*'''Explain the functions of two hormones, with research.'''
:**'''Melatonin''' controls the sleep cycle. For example, when traveling, melatonin cycles cause jet lag as the cycle does not catch up immediately to the body’s location. 
:**'''Oxytocin''' is a hormone that causes bonding. It is released during physical contact and nursing.  
:*'''Discuss the effects of environment on physiology.'''
:**Changes in location and light levels cause a disruption in the melatonin cycle that controls sleep. This leads to jet lag.
:**Famine causes women to stop menstruating because since there is not enough food to support a baby, the body shuts down the mechanisms that allow babies to be made.
:*'''Examine the interaction between cognition and physiology (brain and mind).'''
:**'''Amnesia''' can be caused by the destruction of the hippocampi. 
:***'''Clive Wearing’s''' hippocampi were destroyed by illness, causing him to have anteretrograde amnesia.
:***Also, a subject named '''HM''' suffered damage to the hippocampi in an attempt to treat his epilepsy, causing him to suffer amnesia as well.
:*'''Discuss the use of brain imaging techniques in linking biology and behavior.'''
:**'''EEG''' scans allow the researcher to examine the electrical activity of the brain, isolating which areas are active during certain behaviors.
:**'''PET''' scans allow the researcher to looks at glucose metabolism in the brain. This can allow them to isolate abnormalities like tumors, which metabolize differently.
:*'''To what extent does genetic inheritance contribute to behavior?'''
:**'''Bouchard’s twin studies'' show that genetics contribute greatly to aspects of a person such as personality, intelligence, career and even things like divorce. These things are influenced more, it seems, by genes than by environment. 


:*'''Examine one evolutionary explanation of behavior.'''
:**'''Male sexual promiscuity''' is explained by natural selection. Since men have low investment in each individual offspring, they have promiscuous sex in order to pass on their genes as much as possible. In contrast, since women invest for at least nine months in their children, they tend to be more monogamous.
:*'''Discuss ethical considerations of research into genetic basis’s for behavior.'''
:**The ethical implications  of genetic research include the fact that knowing an individual’s predisposing for diseases with a genetic component could lead to discrimination in marriage, job opportunities, or even the provision of health insurance (since insurance companies would know that a person was likely to make claims due to their risk of disease).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am '''Paul R. Young''', and I have been a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois for over 30 years.  Early in my career, I specialized in teaching Organic and Biochemistry and directed a large research group.  I am the author of '''&quot;Organic Chemistry Online&quot;''', which was the first comprehensive online tutorial in Organic Chemistry.  The product was adopted by Brooks/Cole Publishing Company to accompany McMurry's '''Organic Chemistry''' and is still utilized and the core tutorial in the '''Organic OWL''' product.  I was generally regarded as an &quot;effective teacher&quot; of large lecture sections and I was asked to &quot;try&quot; teaching in the Introductory and General Chemistry sequences.  I currently teach four large sections per year, specializing in Introductory Chemistry (one semester) and the first semester of General Chemistry.

As with many teaching professionals, I have become disturbed by the rising cost of college textbooks. In the race for revenue, publishers seem to cram more and more glossy pictures and extraneous material into textbooks, which are then set as &quot;new editions&quot; on rotating calendars as short as three years.  In response to this, I have written a simple (yet elegant) textbook appropriate for a one-semester course in Introductory Chemistry which was custom-published and made available to my classes for a bookstore price of about $30.  I am now considering moving the core text to Wikibooks to encourage the community of like-minded Chemistry Teachers to contribute to the content.</text>

==Introduction==


Today's schools face numerous regulations, guidelines and protocols that must be met in order for the students, faculty and staff to safely utilize networked resources. Along with meeting these regulations in order to be in compliance, meeting these same regulations can also directly impact access to state and federal technology monies. Two significant laws and corresponding guidelines that schools must be in full compliance with at all times are the Children’s Internet Protection Act and The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. A third law, the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act can also come into play in certain school settings.



==Key Terms==


''An Educational Record'' is a compilation of records, files, documents, and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and maintained by educational agencies or institutions, or by individuals acting on behalf of the agencies.&quot;

''Confidentiality'' refers to your obligation not to disclose or transmit information to unauthorized persons.  

''Privacy'' is a uniquely personal right that reflects an individual’s freedom from intrusion.

''Security'' refers to technical procedures that ensure that only authorized and intended parties have access to data.

''Disclosure'' includes permitting access to, revealing, releasing, transferring, disseminating, or otherwise communicating all or part of any individual record orally, in writing, or by electronic or any other means to any person or entity.

''Protection Principle'': Information users should use appropriate technical and managerial controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information.

==Regulations, Guidelines, Protocols==

===CIPA===


&quot;The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress to address concerns about access to offensive content over the Internet on school and library computers. CIPA imposes certain types of requirements on any school or library that receives funding for Internet Access or internal connection from the E-rate program-a program that makes certain communications technology more affordable for eligible schools and libraries&quot;(CIPA, 2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIPA&quot;&gt;The Children's Internet Protection Act of 2001, Pub. L. 106-554 Sec. 1732. found at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cipa.html&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2001, the Federal Communications Commission issued a set of rules that would be used by the FCC to implement CIPA in all E-rate funded schools and libraries. These rules required all funded schools and libraries to have an Internet Safety Policy that included technology protection measures that address such issues as the filtering and blocking of content by means of email, chat rooms or other means of electronic communications. The protection measured used must specifically block access to content or pictures that are deemed obscene, child pornography or harmful to minors. All schools must include this Internet safety policy (including these technology protection measures) in their application for funding. Prior to adopting this policy, schools are also required to &quot;provide reasonable notice and hold at least one public hearing&quot; (CIPA, 2001).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIPA&quot;/&gt; regarding this policy and plans to adopt it. The CIPA regulations do not affect the E-rate funding received by schools for such things as telecommunications or telephone service.



===COPPA===

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, effective April 21, 2000 regulates the collection of personal information about children under the age of 13 by websites accessed by children through a school Internet connection.  According to COPPA, all website hosts must have a clearly stated privacy policy that states the requirement of parental permission before collecting personal information about a student. 

&quot;The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule apply to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information -- for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms -- when they are tied to individually identifiable information&quot;(COPPA, 2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;COPPA&quot;&gt;The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 2000. Found at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

All website operators must post a notice of their information gathering processes on the home page of their website and a notice containing the same information must be given to parents prior to their signing of a consent form. Parental consent can be obtained by email for internal uses of personal information only.  All external uses of this information require a signed consent form.

There are several exceptions to this policy.  According to COPPA, &quot;prior parental consent is not required when: an operator collects a child's or parent's email address to provide notice and seek consent; an operator collects an email address to respond to a one-time request from a child and then deletes it; an operator collects an email address to respond more than once to a specific request -- say, for a subscription to a newsletter. In this case, the operator must notify the parent that it is communicating regularly with the child and give the parent the opportunity to stop the communication before sending or delivering a second communication to a child; an operator collects a child's name or online contact information to protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site. In this case, the operator must notify the parent and give him or her the opportunity to prevent further use of the information; an operator collects a child's name or online contact information to protect the security or liability of the site or to respond to law enforcement, if necessary, and does not use it for any other purpose&quot;(COPPA, 2000).&lt;refname=&quot;COPPA&quot;/&gt;

All new requests for personal information require a new signed consent form.  Parents may choose to revoke their consent at any time and direct the operator to delete all previously collected information. The Federal Communications Commission may at any time &quot;bring enforcement actions and impose civil penalties for violations of this rule&quot;(COPPA, 2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;COPPA&quot;/&gt;


===FERPA===


&quot;The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C 123g: 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal Law that protects the privacy of student educational records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's educational records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom rights have transferred are eligible students&quot;(FERPA, 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;FERPA&quot;&gt;
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99. found at
http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under this law, parents and students have the right to: inspect and review the students educational records maintained by the school; request that the school correct records which they believe are incorrect or misleading; decide when and to whom their educational records are released.

Under the FERPA regulations, schools must have written permission from a parent or eligible student to release any information pertaining to the students academic records.  Schools do however have the right to release these records without written consent to: school officials with a valid educational interest; schools to which a student is transferring; school officials for purposes of audits or evaluations; appropriate parties regarding financial aid to the student; accrediting organizations; organizations conducting studies on behalf of the school; to comply with judicial orders; state and local authorities or the juvenile justice system according the state law (FERPA, 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;FERPA&quot;/&gt;
Schools may also disclose, without the consent of the parent or eligible student, directory information related to students:
name; address; telephone number; date and place of birth; honors and awards; dates of attendance (FERPA, 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;FERPA&quot;/&gt;

Schools must inform a parent or eligible student of the plan to release this information prior to doing so in order to allow the parent or student a &quot;reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them&quot; (FERPA, 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;FERPA&quot;/&gt;

===HIPAA===


The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act governs how school health services may share student health information with other parts of the school community. In October, 2004, the acting regional director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services noted in a letter to his staff that these health records are actually considered part of a student’s educational records and therefore should be covered by the FERPA laws. As a result of this letter, there was confusion on the part of schools and school health services staff. In November 2008, a joint guide published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Department of Education helped to clarify these apparent dual regulations and where they were to be applied. According to this guide entitled, &quot;Joint Guide on the Application of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to Student Records,&quot; These two departments joined forces in an attempt to clarify once and for all where each of these laws could be rightly applied in a K-12 school setting. What this guide stated was that, because student medical records are part of a student’s educational records, a school is not required to follow the guidelines identified under the HIPAA laws. They are mandated however; to follow all rules and regulations of the FERPA laws because these records are student educational records. Some exceptions to this approach would be adolescent mental health facilities that also provide an educational component and, private schools who do not directly receive educational technology funds.

The common denominator in all of these laws and corresponding regulations is the importance of a comprehensive Information Security Plan. This plan must address all potential threats that could keep the school from being in full compliance with these regulations; especially if they wish to seek federal technology monies such as those available through the E-rate program. All schools receiving federal funds through programs such as the E-rate program must provide an Information Security Plan (including an Acceptable Use Policy) as part of the application process.

==Protecting Student Records==


The protection of student data is a significant responsibility of a school or district administrator, as well as school medical staff.  Access to a student’s educational records (including health information) should only be granted to the administrator, nurse, parent and student.  Access by other parties is not permitted unless specific disclosure permission is granted by the minor students’ parents or student who is over 18 years of age and identified as the eligible student. While the restriction of access can be managed by keeping student records in a locked file cabinet and file room in the school administrative and medical offices, this same level of security can be more difficult to manage when these records are kept in an electronic format. As stated previously, there is confusion regarding which regulations apply when the student records in question are medical records.  This lack of clarity can be further muddied when the school nursing staff comes from a contracted outside medical agency. In this and all situations pertaining to student medical records, it is advisable to comply with both the HIPAA and FERPA regulations.

Along with the need for strict security measures to protect student data transmitted over a school or district wired Ethernet network (through such means as encryption of data, network firewalls etc),there is also the need to protect information that may be transmitted over wireless devices as well. Any wireless device used by medical personnel in a school setting would fall under the standards identified by Lehtinen(2006)as TEMPEST.&lt;ref&gt;Lehtinen, R., Russell, D. &amp; Gangemi Sr., G. T. (2006). Computer Security Basics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lehtinen defines TEMPEST as Telecommunications Electronics Material Protected from Emanating Spurious Transmissions and these standards apply to the electronic transmission devices utilized by those staff members who are transmitting HIPAA protected data.  All electronic transmission equipment used in a HIPAA compliant setting must meet and be approved by these standards.  Because of the level of suppression in these devices, they are often larger, heavier and more costly than those available to general consumers. In order for school and medical facilities to be HIPAA compliant, these devices must be used when transmitting student medical data.


As educational technology leaders in a school or district, it is our responsibility, in concert with school and district administrators and medical staff, to make sure that all technology utilized within the school network is CIPA, FERPA and HIPAA compliant.  This level of compliance should be stated in the Information Security Plan and, appropriate repercussions for non-compliance on the part of school personnel should be clearly spelled out in the district or school policies and faculty and staff handbook.  All school personnel must indicate that they have read and clearly understand these policies before they sign their Acceptable Use Policy contracts.

{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''&amp;mdash;not textbook material. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:25, 12 April 2010 (UTC)}}
This class project is no longer active and is not textbook material.  The pages consist of comments by the students in the class providing advice to the instructor on how to develop the book or what books might benefit from the class's attention.  This sort of discussion would be appropriate for a talk page or possibly on a planning page for a book.  However, that's all that this book consists of, despite the title implying a tutorial of some sort for Wikibooks.  A course with a similar objective at Wikiversity has [http://wikimedia-learning.blogspot.com/2010/03/learning-about-educational.html been proposed] but the content in this book is too specific to be useful for a transwiki in providing a jumping-off point. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:19, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Since you may require a minimum of participation or at least a second opinion, I'm stating full agreement with the points you raise.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:58, 10 April 2010 (UTC)
:{{comment}}Do you know which book they were working on?  Maybe the content should be moved to the talk page. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:45, 10 April 2010 (UTC)
::Ah - looks like it should be moved to [[Talk:The Practice of Learning Theories]]. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:49, 10 April 2010 (UTC)
:::I'm not seeing the connection there.  The original starter of [[How to Use Wikibooks for My Students]] first edited in (but didn't create) [[The Practice of Learning Theories]] in November 2007, then didn't start the former until March 2009 ([[Special:Contributions/Jsnaree]]).  [[The Practice of Learning Theories]] says participants include students from &quot;Indiana University in Bloomington and University of Houston in Texas collaborating during the fall of 2007&quot; while [[How to Use Wikibooks for My Students]] says &quot;students from College of Education and Human Services at University of Wisconsin Oshkosh during the fall of 2009&quot;.  The user also edited [[Web 2.0 and Emerging Learning Technologies]] before the learning theories book.  I don't believe there was any book they were talking about other than performing a meta-discussion on Wikibooks as a whole. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:02, 10 April 2010 (UTC)
:::: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] I suppose you're right.  I was going solely on who had created the page and what else (s)he had contributed to.  It should certainly not stand as it is. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:06, 10 April 2010 (UTC)

== On [[Introductory Chemistry Online/Aqueous Solutions]] ==

Hello,

I just moved the Aqueous Solutions chapter of your book to the hierarchical page title [[Introductory Chemistry Online/Aqueous Solutions]]. By the way, I am glad to see your work with this book - the proposal looks far more consistent than the very messy [[General Chemistry]]. As a chemistry student as well as adept Wikibookian I am willing to help with formatting, feedback and whatever else you may find useful. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|talk]]) 17:47, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;'''Esophageal Cancer Review'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*2009 U.S. Data: incidence ~16,500; mortality: ~14,500 (88% death rate)
*High prevalence worldwide: Asia, southern/eastern Africa, southern France
*Risk factors: age, male gender, Plummer-Vinson, caustic injury
**Squamous cell: smoking, tobacco; risk decreases with cessation
**AdenoCA: GERD, Barrett's (40x), smoking, tobacco; risk does not decrease with cessation


==Clinical Presentation &amp; Work Up==
*Clinical presentation: dysphagia, weight loss, hiccups (phrenic nerve), reflux (suggests EGJ tumor), satiety (suggests infiltration into stomach wall)
*EGD: distance from incisors, extent of lesion/mucosal changes
*CT scan: frequently not helpful, since Barretts shows wall thickening; miss 50% nodes
*Endoscopic ultrasound: T-stage, LN evaluation/biopsy
*PET/CT
*Bronchoscopy: if above carina, to rule out fistulas


==Surgery==
*Surgically resectable: 
**Cervical esophagus: typically not treated surgically for larynx preservation, need &gt;5 cm from cricopharyngeus
**Only 30-40% present with resectable disease, only 50% of these undergo curative (R0) resection
**Technique: Transthoracic (Ivor Lewis) vs transhiatal
**Lymph node dissection: based on SEER data, survival better if &gt;10 LN removed
*Surgery alone:
**5-year OS 20-25%; median OS ~1.5 years
**Local control?
*Surgery vs RT:
**2 older trials showed survival benefit to surgery; recent Chinese trial no difference in 5-year OS (~35%)
*Pre-op RT:
**6 older RCTs. No survival benefit. Meta-analysis using individual patient data showed no conclusive survival benefit for RT
*Pre-op chemo:
**9 RCTs. Two (MRC and Netherlands) showed significant survival benefit. Meta-analysis suggests 2-year 7% OS benefit and 5-year 4% benefit
*Pre-op chemo-RT:
**10 RCTs. Two (Walsh, Tepper) showed significant survival benefit. Meta-analysis showed 2-year 13% OS benefit, which persisted even after excluding Walsh trial
**Dublin (Walsh): median OS 16 months vs 11 months (SS); 3-year OS 32% vs 6% (SS). Critique poor outcome in surgery only arm
**CALGB 9781 (Teper): median OS 4.5 years vs 1.8 years (SS); 5-year OS 39% vs 16%. pCR 40%; Grade 3+ toxicity 40%
*Post-op chemo:
**3 RCTs. Meta-analysis showed no significant benefit
*Post-op chemo-RT:
**Gastric/EGJ trial (INT 0116, MacDonald): 3-year OS benefit 41% vs 50% (SS); 3-year local relapse 29% vs 19%; Grade 4 toxicity 32%
*Pre-op chemo-RT + Surgery vs Chemo-RT alone:
**2 RCTs, majority squamous cell. Non-inferiority 10-15%, both trials negative for OS difference.
**Germany (Stahl): Randomized upfront, no lower esophagus. 2-year OS 40% vs 35% (NS). 2-year local control 64% vs 41% (SS). Periop mortality 13% vs 4%
**French FFCD-9102 (Bedenne): Only responders to CRT randomized. 2-year OS 34% vs 40% (NS). 2-year local control 66% vs 57% (SS). Periop mortality 12% vs 0%
*Concurrent chemotherapy
**CALGB 9781: 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 + cisplatin 100 mg/m2
**RTOG 0436 (ongoing): paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 + cisplatin 25 mg/m2 QW
**German (Stahl): cisplatin + etoposide
*Conclusions:
**If surgery will be done, preop chemo-RT improves 2-year survival
**In patients with SCC at risk for surgical morbidity/mortality, primary chemo-RT may be comparable/superior
**NCCN guidelines (v1.2010)
***T1a: esophagectomy or EMR
***T1b: esophagectomy for non-cervical, chemo-RT for cervical primaries
***T2-T4N0-N1: pre-op chemo (adenoCA only), pre-op chemo-RT, or definitive chemo-RT
***T2-T4N0-N1: if surgery done first, post-op chemo-RT (MacDonald) for distal/GEJ tumors or R1/R2 resections

==Non-surgical approaches==
*RT vs Chemo-RT
**RTOG 8501 (Herskovic)
***Concurrent chemo: cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 (weeks 1, 5, 8, 11)
***Survial benefit: 3-year OS 10% vs 40% (SS); 5-year OS 0% vs 26% (SS); median OS 9 months vs 14 months (SS)
***Locoregional control benefit: 53% vs 38% (SS)
***Worse toxicity: Acute Grade 4-5 2% vs 10% (including 2% deaths)

*Chemo-RT: Dose escalation
**RTOG 9207 (Gaspar) brachytherapy boost
***EBRT 50/25 + HDR 15/3 or LDR 20/1 with concurrent cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2
***Grade 4 toxicity 24% (fistula 18%), deaths 10%
**RTOG 9405 (Minsky) 3DCRT boost
***EBRT 50.4 Gy vs 64.8 Gy with concurrent cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2
***No difference in survival, 2-year 40% vs 31%
***No difference in local failure: 56% vs 52%
***Toxicity: 11 deaths in high-dose arm

*Chemo-RT: Different chemo regimens
**RTOG 0113: Induction chemo -&gt; chemo-RT comparing cisplatin/paclitaxel vs 5-FU/paclitaxel
***Neither arm successful

*Local control: ~50% despite dose escalation or chemo changes
*Survival: median OS ~1.5 years, 5-year OS ~25%</text>

'''“Passwords are often the first (and possibly only) defense against intrusion.” MacGregor (2002)'''&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, T. (2001, May 13) “Password Auditing and Password Filtering to Improve Network Security”. SANS Institute. Retrieved April 13, 2010 from http://rr.sans.org/authentic/improve.php&lt;/ref&gt;


== Introduction ==

Many institutions and businesses invest large sums of money to create and ensure a secure computer system for all its stakeholders. Outlays of monies bring together hardware, software, policies, procedures, physical parameters, and training to construct a fortress of protection for its data, network, and, ultimately, its mission. Without the sense and assumption of a secure computer network, revenues would be lost, data compromised, and secrets unfolded.

But every system relies on identification and authentication of the user. The system would not have been built if not for the intention of users to access and use the system, whatever that system may offer to the users. Almost always is a user accessing the system from a remote area away from the system’s administrators. They need to have a way to identify each user and authenticate that the user’s digital identity matches the physical user sitting in front of the computer or server is mandatory. Add to this drama that the user is human. This very nature is what may bring down and create the weakest link in the strongest fortress. As Schneier (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;Schneier, B. (2000). Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world. Indianapolis, ID: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, &quot;Think of security… as a chain. The security of the entire system is only as strong as the weakest link.&quot; That weakest link is many times the user of the system; unlike the human in the food chain, where man takes a prominent stand, in the access and security of computer networks, the human is many times the weak prey or entry point to what is secure with the assumption that the right users are identified and authenticated.
[[Image:Crystal Clear Password.png|right|thumb|300px]]

== Username/Password Combinations for Identification &amp; Authentication ==


A common way to authenticate users is to assign each authorized user of a specific system a unique username/password combination.  The [[w:User (computing)| username]] identifies the user and the [[w:Password| password]] authenticates him; in other words, a human user proves his identity is true to the nonhuman system. A password is “a word, a phrase, or combination of miscellaneous characters that authenticates the identity of the user” (Granger, 2002)&lt;ref name=&quot;Granger&quot;&gt;Granger, S. (2002, January 17). “The simplest security: A guide to better password practices”. Symantec Security. Retrieved April 9, 2010, from http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/simplest-security-guide-better-password-practices&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the only matter that is sure is that the username and password combination agrees with a username/password combination in the system’s database of valid and authorized users. If the user logs into the system remotely, the only element that the system is sure of is the combination entered matches a stored combination for a user of the system.

Rubens (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubens&quot;&gt;Rubens, P. (June 2008). User authentication beyond the password. QuinStreet, Inc. Retrieved April 1, 2010 at http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsecur/article.php/3756206&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that the [[w:Gartner| Gartner]] research house reported 94% of businesses only require a username/password combination to log into their respective computer systems.  That popularity and reliance illustrates a lot of commercial trust in the simple philosophy of identification and authentication of access.  Passwords are a simpler and cheaper security measure compared to other security hardware and software. Passwords can protect users’ personal information such as private documents, financial data, identity data, or social security numbers. Passwords can also protect professional data, which could mean intellectual property, trade secrets, financial data, human resource records, or customer information. The access or loss of any of this data in the hands of the wrong party could be detrimental and disabling to the person, the profession, or the proprietor. 

As Schneier (2008)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneier&quot;&gt;Schneier, B. (2008). Schneier on security. Indianapolis, ID: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; cautioned, “The problem with passwords is that they’re too easy to lose control of. People give them to other people. People write them down, and other people read them. People send them in email, and that email is intercepted. People use them to log into remote servers, and their communications are eavesdropped on. They’re easy to guess. And once that happens, the password no longer works as an authentication token because you can’t be sure of who is typing that password in” (240)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneier&quot;&gt;Schneier on security&lt;/ref&gt;.

The commonality in all of these passwords flukes is “people”—humans with that imperfect human nature that corporations trust their most valuable asset to in the security framework.

The popularity of username/password combinations reveals the reliance corporations and institutions have on people keeping their passwords private. Considering the unpredictable and imperfect human nature of people, the key to security with username/password combinations is educating and training the users to exercise a regimen that safeguards and secures accurate identification and authentication of the user.
[[Image:computer.png|left|thumb|300px]]

== How Can Passwords be Uncovered ==

Passwords can be found out by guessing or uncovering passwords to gain unauthorized access to computers or the information on those computers. This process is referred to as password cracking. Granger (2002)&lt;ref name=&quot;Granger&quot;&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/simplest-security-guide-better-password-practices]&lt;/ref&gt; stated the most popular ways people crack passwords are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a word list or dictionary attack software
&lt;li&gt;Using password crackers (one example is [http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/'''Packetstorm''']or [http://sectools.org/crackers.html'''Top Ten Password Crackers'''])
&lt;li&gt;Password sniffers – looking at data as it travels through a network or internet with the existence of vulnerabilities, and since passwords are only as strong as their human creators and users, people must be educated to practice habits to keep passwords strong, private, and secure.
&lt;li&gt;Social engineering – human element where one person cons another to give up personal information such as usernames and passwords
&lt;li&gt;Reckless password behavior by user

&lt;/ul&gt;

== Securing Passwords with Secure Practices ==
[[Image:password.svg|right|thumb|100px]]
Some secure password practices are built on commonsense where others take on a more systematic framework. Schneier (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneier Blog&quot;&gt;Scheier, B. (2009, August 10). Schneier on security [Msg 1]. Message posted to http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/08/password_advice.html&lt;/ref&gt; encourages the following password advice: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most important advice? Use a password manager which is an application that keeps track of and manages a user’s passwords.
&lt;li&gt;Change passwords frequently.
&lt;li&gt;Do not reuse old passwords.
&lt;li&gt;Have a scheduled date to change passwords. Password managers can assign expiration dates to passwords and send reminders when to change them.
&lt;li&gt;Always keep passwords secret. Users should not document their passwords manually or digitally. Trust no one with a username/password combination.
&lt;li&gt;Do not use passwords that consist of dictionary words, birthdays, common series such as sequential numbers or repeated characters.
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the same username/password combination for more than one site.
&lt;li&gt;Do not allow a computer to log on or boot up automatically or allow applications to have stored passwords where the user is logged in for a specified amount of time.
&lt;li&gt;Do not log into user accounts on another person’s computer in case there is a key logger installed.
&lt;li&gt;Do not access web sites that require a log in over wireless Internet connection unless the https protocol is used.
&lt;li&gt;Do not log into an account via a link in an email in case it is a case of phishing. Enter the normal URL, Uniform Resource Locator, in the web browser to check the identity of the party asking for information.
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Password Tips for BlackBerry Users == 


The [[w:BlackBerry| BlackBerry]] devices have been touted to perform with the most secure mobile platform (Sacco, 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacco&quot;&gt;Sacco, A. (2010, March 2). Five tips to keep your Blackberry safe. Computer World. Retrieved March 30, 2010 from, http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9165238/Five_tips_to_keep_your_Blackberry_safe?taxonomyName=Security&amp;taxonomyId=17&lt;/ref&gt;.  RIM, the company that manufactures Blackberry devices, has invested time and monies to equip their products with secure and strong infrastructure, software and security certificates. However, as Sacco (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacco&quot;&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9165238/Five_tips_to_keep_your_Blackberry_safe?taxonomyName=Security&amp;taxonomyId=17]&lt;/ref&gt; stated, this does not cover the security or lack thereof practiced by the Blackberry user. In the occurrence of a stolen or lost BlackBerry device, the security of the devince and data on the machine depends upon the security practice of the human owner of the phone. 

Sacco (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacco&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacco&quot;&gt;Sacco, A. (2010, March 2). Five tips to keep your BlackBerry safe. Computer World. Retrieved March 30, 2010 from, http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9165238/Five_tips_to_keep_your_Blackberry_safe?taxonomyName=Security&amp;taxonomyId=17&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged five guidelines, two of which deal with passwords, for mobile owners to use when safeguarding their BlackBerry and its information.


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Enable password-protection on a BlackBerry, if the corporation has not done so before assigning the corporate phone in your possession and use:
&lt;li&gt;Open Blackberry Options menu, scroll down to and click the word Password
&lt;li&gt;Select Password field and then enable option with pop-up box
&lt;li&gt;Click on Blackberry Escape key, save changes, and enter password (minimum of four characters for Blackberry phones)
&lt;li&gt;Confirm new password by typing it again 
&lt;li&gt;Blackberry phone is now locked
&lt;li&gt;Type password to unlock BlackBerry after password-protection has been enabled
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Additional password security features are available on Blackberry phones such as: 
&lt;li&gt;Specify number of password attempts
&lt;li&gt;Choose a security timeout period
&lt;li&gt;Mandate use of password when downloading new applications
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Use the Password Keeper application on Blackberry mobile devices which stores all user passwords by entering a password to open this application:
&lt;li&gt;Open Password Keeper application on BlackBerry 
&lt;li&gt;Create a password to protect all your other passwords
&lt;li&gt;Choose a password that is difficult to guess since this password safeguards all the user passwords
&lt;li&gt;To enter and log each user password:
&lt;li&gt;Click on Blackberry Menu key, choose New to log a password
&lt;li&gt;Type information for Title, Username, Password, Website, Notes for each password to be saved
&lt;li&gt;After all passwords have been saved, the user opens the Password Keeper app and enters the master password to access passwords stored on the device
&lt;/dl&gt;

== Password Management Tips for iPad &amp; iPhone ==

Wagner (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagner&quot;&gt;Wagner, M. (2010, March 23). Apple’s Ipad: Developers discuss their plans for apps. [Msg 1]. Computer World Blogs. Message posted to http://blogs.computerworld.com/15800/ipad_apps&lt;/ref&gt; placed on top of his list of new applications available for iPads, the newest of the Apple computer devices, 1Password. This application, developed by Agile Web solutions, is password management software. This software is also available on iPhones. 

Without this specific application, an iPad owner may still password-protect applications by designating password entry prior to using applications (Brandon, 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandon&quot;&gt;Brandon, J. (2010, April 9). 50 really useful iPad tips and tricks. Apple News. Retrieved April 11, 2010 at http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/50-really-useful-ipad-tips-and-tricks-682306&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;This password protection can be activated on the iPad:
&lt;li&gt;Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions 
&lt;li&gt;Press Enable Restrictions 
&lt;li&gt;Type a difficult to guess four-digit number password (never use birthdates, street address phone numbers, social security digits, or phone numbers.
&lt;li&gt;Turn on restrictions for applications that the user would like protected
&lt;li&gt;If the application needs a password to use it, such as iTunes, the user will have to type in two passwords (Password protection's password and specific application's password).
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Password Protection Feature in Firefox Web Browser ==
[[Image:Mozilla Firefox logo 2013.png|left|thumb|80px]]

Firefox, a web browser, provides the user with a password-protection feature call Master Password. When a user opens Firefox for the first time, the web browser prompts the user for a password. With the awareness of phishing, a fraudulent conspiracy to contrive a user’s sensitive information, unbeknown to the user, has made many people wary of pop-up windows asking for our passwords, usernames, etc. Horowitz (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;&gt;Horowitz, M. (2010, March 3). Trust no one and how it applies to Firefox passwords. [Msg 1]. Computer World Nlogs. Message posted to http://blogs.computerworld.com/15687/trust_no_one_and_how_it_applies_to_firefox_passwords&lt;/ref&gt;  advises to use a [http://www.FreeOTFE.org/] FreeOTFE or [http://www.truecrypt.org/ TrueCrypt] container. These are open source encryption software programs that works on all platforms by creating a virtual encrypted disk to protect a user’s information.

== Facebook and Passwords ==
[[Image:Facebook.svg|right|thumb|150px]]
Facebook, a social networking site that to date has over 400 million users, provides their members quality and strong security information (“Statistics”, Facebook, 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Facebook Statistics&quot;&gt;“Statistics”. (2010). Facebook. Retrieved on April 13, 2010 from, http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics&lt;/ref&gt;. What is beneficial of Facebook purporting secure measures and practices of their users is that many of this social network site’s users are young adults, which supports many of the same security guidelines concerning passwords students learn in high schools and colleges. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Some of these guidelines include:

&lt;li&gt;Use different passwords for different online websites
&lt;li&gt;Be cautious of where a user enters his password. Pay attention to the URL of a website. Additionally, copy and paste that URL into a new web browser window to check the requester's digital source.
&lt;li&gt;Do not share passwords with anyone; no one should ever ask for a password if the organization practices good security principles
&lt;li&gt;Use difficult passwords that would be hard to guess; make sure a password is not contrived with obvious information about user.
&lt;li&gt;Create passwords that have a combination of lower and uppercase alpha characters, numeric characters, and symbols
 (“Facebook Security”, Facebook, 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Facebook Security&quot;&gt;“Facebook Security”. (2010). Facebook. Retrieved on April 10, 2010 from, http://www.facebook.com/security?v=app_4949752878#!/security?v=app_7146470109&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Microsoft Online Safety Password Advice ==
[[Image:Microsoft wordmark.svg|left|thumb|150px]]
Password strength is determined by a combination of different types of characters, the length of a password, and if it does not make a dictionary match (Microsoft, 2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft. (2010). Microsoft online safety and privacy education. Retrieved April 14, 2010 from, http://www.microsoft.com/protect/&lt;/ref&gt;.  



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Microsoft, one of the top the international computer technology corporations, offers users recommendations for creating strong passwords:

&lt;li&gt;Use passwords with 14 characters or more
&lt;li&gt;Use variety in characters (alpha, numeric, symbols)
&lt;li&gt;Use the entire keyboarding; do not only use characters that are often utilized
&lt;li&gt;Another key element is to create a password using the above guidelines, which a user can remember and not write down due to its difficulty. 
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Microsoft)&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft. (2010). Microsoft online safety and privacy education. Retrieved April 14, 2010 from, http://www.microsoft.com/protect/&lt;/ref&gt;. Microsoft offers the following advice to remember long passwords:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;What To Do:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Suggestion:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Example:&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;1. Start with a sentence or two (about 10 words total).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Think of something meaningful to you.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Long and complex passwords are safest. I keep mine secret. (10 words)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;2. Turn your sentences into a row of letters.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Use the first letter of each word.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;lacpasikms (10 characters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;3. Add length with numbers.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Put two numbers that are meaningful to you between the two sentences.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;lACpAsIKMs (10 characters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;4. Add complexity.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Make only the letters in the first half of the alphabet uppercase.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;lACpAs56IKMs (12 characters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;5. Add length with punctuation.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Put a punctuation mark at the beginning.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?lACpAs56IKMs (13 characters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;6. Add length with symbols.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Put a symbol at the end.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;?lACpAs56IKMs&quot; (14 characters)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

After the user constructs a password with the above steps, the user can check the password’s strength and, thus, its safety, by using a Password Checker application offered by Microsoft&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/protect/]&lt;/ref&gt;. It should be pointed out that the password examples users enter is not stored on this site maintained by Microsoft. Each password is checked on the person’s computer and not the [https://www.microsoft.com/protect/fraud/passwords/checker.aspx?WT.mc_id=Site_Link/'''Password Checker'''] by Microsoft&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/protect/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

After a user creates a strong password, the security of the data the password protects will not be ensured if the user does not put into practice and habit ways to keep that password safe and private.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Five tips Microsoft (2010)&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft. (2010). Microsoft online safety and privacy education. Retrieved April 14, 2010 from, http://www.microsoft.com/protect/&lt;/ref&gt; advices to safeguard a strong password are:

&lt;li&gt;Never provide a password to a request made digitally, by email or in pop-up windows.
&lt;li&gt;Do not type in a personal password on a computer that is owned by another person or is a public use computer. Other computers can have key loggers installed to capture guest user passwords.  
&lt;li&gt;Never tell another person your password face-to-face or over the phone. Be cautious of social engineering; people who pose as professionals asking for your password to troubleshoot possible problems in your account (Schneier, 2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneier&quot;&gt;[Schneier, B. (2000). Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world. Indianapolis, ID: Wiley Publishing, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Protect recorded passwords in a safe and secure place. Never store passwords on a computer that one owns.
&lt;li&gt;Use more than one password on different web sites.
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Enabling Firmware Password Protection in MAC OS X ==
[[Image:Apple Computer Logo rainbow.svg|right|thumb|90px]]
Open firmware password protection is turned off by default, but provides password protection on MAC computers that have MAC OS X version 10.1 or later operating system installed. This software only allows a computer to be started from the volume that the user with the correct password designates as the startup volume. For the firmware password to work securely, there must be strong effort by the user to create a safe and strong password as a physical security measure (apple, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Apple. (2010). “Setting up firmware password protection in MAC OS X”. Retrieved April 10, 2010 from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1352&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Full instructions and features of this password protection application can be found at the [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1352'''apple'''] site.

== How to Protect Unattended Computer ==
[[Image:Crystal Project computer.png|left|thumb|100px]]
How does a user protect his computer after he logged on to his computer and walks away, that someone does not sit down to use his computer? One way is to set a screen saver password on a Windows or GNU/Linux PC or laptop. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;The directions to do this on Windows are:
&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the desktop &gt; choose Properties &gt; click on Screen Saver
&lt;li&gt;Click on Password-protected &gt; Change 
&lt;li&gt;Enter a secure password &gt; click OK &gt; click Apply &gt; click OK
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The best way to keep a computer safe is to shut it down when one walks away from his computer.

== Better Password Practices ==
[[Image:Vista-password.png|right|thumb|130px]]
Granger (2002)&lt;ref name=&quot;Granger&quot;&gt;Granger, S. (2002, January 17). “The simplest security: A guide to better password practices”. Symantec Security. Retrieved April 9, 2010, from http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/simplest-security-guide-better-password-practices&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the simplest security of all is in the control of the weakest link in the computer network, humans.  If humans practice better, more private password habits, the infrastructure that is planned, constructed, and implemented has a better chance to be secured. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Granger proposed the following best practices for securing passwords:
&lt;li&gt;Do not use proper nouns, dictionary words, or foreign words, either in its spelling order or typed backwards
&lt;li&gt;Do not use personal information such as first, last, or middle names of self or family or friends, pets’ names, street address, phone number, or any other data that is uniquely the user’s information
&lt;li&gt;Create a password that has length, width and depth. Length represents the number of characters used in a password. Granger (2002) recommended six to nine characters. Width pertains to the combination of different kinds of characters, meaning alpha, numeric, upper case, lower case, symbols. It is recommended to have at least one of the following types of characters:
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;li&gt;upper case letters
&lt;li&gt;lower case letters
&lt;li&gt;numbers
&lt;li&gt;special characters such as symbol and punctuation
&lt;li&gt;alt characters such as µ, £, Æ
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depth in a password means to have a password that has meaning, but hard to guess. This can be done when the user thinks about phrases and mnemonics instead of words. 

One example of this can be found on the University of Michigan’s (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Information and Technology Services. (2009, October). “ITSDocs: Choosing and changing a secure UMICH password”. University of Michigan. Retrieved April 16, 2010, from http://www.itd.umich.edu/itcsdocs/r1162/#protect&lt;/ref&gt; Information and Technology Services web site:

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a strong and memorable password by using the first letter of the words in a phrase, in combination with the other stated criteria. For example, &quot;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth&quot; becomes 4S&amp;7yaofb4th.
&lt;li&gt;Use different passwords for different web sites
&lt;li&gt;If able, find ways to add encryption or a one-time password capability to log-in passwords. The latter requires a user have a password generator, a password list, or a secure card. 
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;li&gt;[http://random-password-generator.smartcode.com/info.html'''Password generator'''] 
&lt;li&gt;Switching to a [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/groove/HA102144291033.aspx'''Smart Card (password)'''] directions
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.pgp.com/'''Encryption (PGP)'''] 
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never disclose passwords to any other party by email, phone, or face-to-face interaction.
&lt;li&gt;Never write down a password. Commit it to memory. If one must write something down to remember a password, write a hint to the password, and not the password itself.
&lt;li&gt;Change passwords at a regular interval. The more sensitive the information the password protects, the more often the frequency of change or shorter the interval
&lt;li&gt;Do not let anyone watch or stand behind the user when typing a password
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Dr. Tim Tyson, an educational consultant and retired middle school principal, offers this advice in his Practical Practice blog: Spring Cleaning: [http://drtimtyson.com/blog/'''Password Security and Organization'''].

== Teaching Students Better Password Practices ==
[[Image:Computer lab.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]

It is mandatory when teaching students about their responsibilities on the school network, in conjunction with the district's acceptable user policy, that we as educators teach and emphasize good password practices. This begins in the K12 level and continues into higher education. The following colleges and universities have specific password protocols, procedures, and education pages teaching students to practice better password guidelines.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://srp.stanford.edu/'''Stanford University SRP Password Generator''']
&lt;li&gt;[http://security.duke.edu/password.html'''Duke University Password Protocols''']
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.tcnj.edu/~it/security/passwords.html'''College of New Jersey Security Password Guidelines''']
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/its/accounts/password.html'''Yale University Password Change Web Site''']
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dd&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/ppdev/Guides/its/passwords.pdf'''Yale University Guide to Selecting Good Passwords''']
&lt;/ul&gt;


At the K12 level, teachers can teach better password practices to students as part of the curriculum and security measure of the district's Acceptable User Policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Example join table association object annotations ==

In the example, after this line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
employees.add(association);
&lt;/source&gt;

shouldn't there be something like

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
employee.getProjects.add(association)
&lt;/source&gt;

or is this done automatically by the persistence handler?

:Correct, this was missing in the example code.  I updated it.  JPA does not maintain bi-directional relationships, it is the object model's responsibility.
::[[User:Jamesssss|James]] ([[User talk:Jamesssss|talk]]) 14:38, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

:: Thanks for the quick response. There's some really helpful stuff in this wikibook, so I'm glad I could contribute at least a tiny bit.


----


Uhm, does this example work for you? I'll get an exception, which is - as far as I understand - caused by the fact that the association class also needs to be persisted. This could be resolved by marking the one-to-may relations as cascading:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@OneToMany(mappedBy=&quot;employee&quot;, cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
private List&lt;ProjectAssociation&gt; projects;
&lt;/source&gt;
respectively
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
@OneToMany(mappedBy=&quot;projects&quot;, cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
private List&lt;ProjectAssociation&gt; employees;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;s&gt;My problem then is, however, that the foreign keys in the project association class are not set and consequently the database throws an &quot;NOT NULL&quot; exception. This means basically, that I have to create and persist the employees and projects inf a first transaction, and create the assicoation between them in a second transaction. Or is there any better way?&lt;/s&gt;

: Sorry this last paragraph was wrong. I messed up my annotations, that was why the relation was not properly handled by the entity manager. In other words, creating and persisting a project association object works perfectly, if cascading is enabled (see above). I'll leave the paragraph anyway, maybe this can help someone with the same problem.

== Please rename the column names ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID, EMP_PROJ.EMP_ID, EMP_PROJ.PROJ_ID, PROJECT.PROJ_ID
&lt;/source&gt;
It is not clear what column of what table is used in annotation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
joinColumns={@JoinColumn(name=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;EMP_ID&quot;)},
&lt;/source&gt;
Is it EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID to EMP_PROJ.EMP_ID or vice versa?

:Fixed in the example.  For a JoinTable the JoinColumn is from the perspective of the JoinTable, the name is the column in the JoinTable, the referencedColumnName is the column in the source/target table.  referencedColumnName is optional unless mapping to a composite Id.

'''Faina''' is a type of flatbread made with chickpea flour (''harina de garbanzos''). It is sometimes eaten with a slice of pizza, in which case it is called ''pizza a caballo'' (pizza on horseback); this is very popular in Uruguayan and Argentine pizzerias. It is also eaten by itself.

==Ingredients==
* 250 g chickpea flour
* 2 generous tbsps wheat flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 500 ml lukewarm water
* 2 tbsp oil &lt;!--any idea what kind?--&gt;

==Procedure==
# Mix chickpea flour, wheat flour, salt and water in a bowl. Beat slowly with a wire beater; alternatively, you may mix in a food processor. After these ingredients are mixed, add 2 tbsp oil.
# Place some oil in a round baking dish (approx 45 cm in diameter) and preheat this in the oven for a few minutes.&lt;!--What temperature and for how long?--&gt; Remove dish from oven and pour the faina mixture into the hot dish.
# Place back into the oven for about 20 minutes, until the upper crust is golden, and the edges are dry (they should have a fried appearance).
# Remove from the oven, and let rest for 2&amp;ndash;3 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper and cut into wedges.

==Variations==
In both the abovementioned countries, a distinction is made between ''faina de orilla'', which has crisp edges that look fried, and ''Faina del medio'', which has a consistency similar to Yorkshire Pudding.</text>

Hey folks,

I just wanted to pass this along although it's old news.  I was reading the book &quot;Λεξικολογία&quot; (Lexicology) by Γιώργος Ξυδόπουλος (Giorgos Xydopoulos) from 2008 in which he surveys everything from current electronic dictionaries to active and passive vocabulary, quite a wide range of things... Anyways in the chapter on morphology he has a chart comparing phonemes and writing for both English and Greek, and he credits en wikibooks [[English/Spelling]] for the data on English :-) Happy trails! -- [[User:ArielGlenn|ArielGlenn]] ([[User talk:ArielGlenn|talk]]) 04:17, 13 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}}

&quot;The Dip&quot; is the end all-be all of appetizers.  People will line up to get another taste of this.  It has enough calories to knock you off your feet.  Be careful when serving it before a dinner, as it is quite filling.  Some people eat so much of this that they can't handle the main course!  This would be suitable as the centerpiece while watching the game, or as a wonderful treat during parties.

==Ingredients==
*1 package of (6) 6&quot; (15cm) pita pockets
*8oz (225g) sharp cheddar cheese
*1 cup mayonaise
*3oz (80g) black olives
*4oz (110g) can diced green chiles
*1 small tomato
*2 green onions
*garlic powder
*Hot sauce

Makes enough dip for 2-6 individuals depending on appetite.  Double (or triple!) the recipe to serve more people.

==Procedure==
Step 1
#Slice pitas as you would a pizza, into triangles.
#Separate pita triangles into halves.
#Place pita triangles on a cookie sheet, inside surface up.
#place in oven to toast until golden brown, but not dark and bitter.
#This results in novel chips used to scoop the dip.
Step 2
#Dice 1 tomato
#Slice the olives into rings approximately 1/4 inches.
#Slice the green onions into lengths approximately 1/4 inches.
#Shred the cheddar cheese or dice into small chunks.
Step 3
#Place the shredded cheese in a microwave safe bowl.
#Add the mayonnaise.
#Add the small can of diced chiles.
#Add 1/2 of the olives you've sliced (1.5oz (45g)).
#Add garlic powder to taste (approximately 2 tablespoon).
#Add hot sauce to taste (approximately 2 tablespoons).
#Mix thoroughly.
Step 4
#Microwave on high until the edges liquefy and bubble.
#Mix the bowl until it is all of the same constancy.
#Repeat process until the whole bowl is creamy and a rich orange color.
#Remove bowl from the microwave when everything is homogeneous.
Step 5
#Standard garnishing technique calls for arranging the remaining black olives, green onions and diced tomatoes into a bulls-eye pattern.
#garnish dip with the other half of the sliced black olives, all the sliced green onions and all the diced tomatoes.
#Place these on top of the dip.  They will float on top.
#Place pita chips in a bowl next to The Dip.
#Enjoy!

==Tips, tricks, and variations==

Scaling the recipe up is easy.  Just procure a larger bowl, and increase the ingredients.


==Warnings==

Do NOT use miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  This totally changes the taste of The Dip.

Family camping, a Bio major at Carleton College, nuclear medicine research in Houston, and an M.A. in Biology from Rice University introduced me to the world of life. Twenty years of teaching biology and anatomy/physiology, international travel, and curriculum work with raptors, Lake Superior, whales, prairies, medicine, neuroscience, and marine aquariums confirmed my passion for all things biological. Newly retired from teaching, I appreciate this opportunity to work in the innovative arena of biology education.

I am currently a doctoral candidate in mathematics education at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My research focuses on the ways students learn algebra through peer discussions, and the interactions between learning mathematics and learning language, with a special emphasis on understanding the mathematics learning of Latino English Learners. Prior to my exciting life as a graduate student, I taught high school math for six years--three years at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, and three years at Saramen Chuuk Academy in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia. While teaching in Chuuk, I first encountered the problem of finding appropriate and affordable texts for my students--and at that time I took the &quot;do it yourself&quot; approach and wrote an entire book based on my class notes. One of my hopes is that our CK12 books can be a resource for schools like the one I taught at in Chuuk. As an undergraduate I studied mathematics and computer science at Boston College, and I also worked with Jerry Keough and C.K. Cheung on the development of several texts for introducing Mathematica and Maple, and doing calculus with Mathematica. Beyond the world of mathematics texts, I am an avid cyclist, and an Oakland A's fan.

      <comment>/* Subtraction of Complex Numbers */  - Adding an 'i' that was missing</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Complex numbers were first developed in the mid 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, as a means for solving certain cubic equations. They consist of an imaginary part (in terms of i, or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;) and a real part ('traditional' numbers, so to speak - numbers such as 1, -324 or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{67}&lt;/math&gt;). Since then, they have become a frequently used type of number in solving polynomial equations and in, unusually, calculations by engineers. In FP1, we consider fairly basic uses of Complex Numbers in solving quartic, cubic and quadratic equations. Similarly, we consider basic arithmetic of complex numbers - adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing complex numbers.

==An Introduction to Complex Numbers==

=== Imaginary Numbers ===

Previously, one has been unable to solve any equation involving the root of a negative number. For instance, the quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;y=x^2+x+2&lt;/math&gt; could not be solved as:

  It cannot be factorised
  It cannot be solved with the quadratic equation (as the discriminate would be negative, and one could not square root a negative number).

However, using 'imaginary' numbers allows for negative numbers to be square-rooted:

 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=i&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this, and knowledge of surds, we can use this for any negative number. Thus:

 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-9}=\sqrt{9}\times\sqrt{-1}=\pm3i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-10}=\sqrt{10}\times\sqrt{-1}=\pm\sqrt{10}i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-8}=\sqrt{8}\times\sqrt{-1}=\pm2\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;


===Complex Numbers===

A Complex Number is a number containing an imaginary part, in other words something containing &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and a real part. So, examples of complex numbers include:


 &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}=1+3\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;z=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+3i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;z=-2+\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;z=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Even in more complicated examples, one should always be able to separate the real part from the imaginary part. Consider the last example above:

 &lt;math&gt;z=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

In this number, the real part is &lt;math&gt;3\over2&lt;/math&gt; and the imaginary part is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}i&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if we were to consider:

 &lt;math&gt;z=\sqrt{3}(\sqrt{2}+i)&lt;/math&gt;

The real part would be &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{6}&lt;/math&gt; and the imaginary part would be &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}i&lt;/math&gt;.

One should also take care here: in cases such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt; is not under the square root. This represents &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}\times i&lt;/math&gt;.

Each of the above examples (and all complex numbers) can be represented by the following:

 &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}=\mathit{a}+\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a\in\Re\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b\in\Re\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It is worth familiarising oneself with notation such as &lt;math&gt;a\in\Re\!&lt;/math&gt;. It means a 'is an element of' &lt;math&gt;\Re\!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Re\!&lt;/math&gt; represents all of the real numbers. This notation in particular is frequently used in FP1.

==Complex Conjugate==

Each Complex Number has a 'Complex Conjugate'. Despite it's rather complicated name, it is a very simple conecpt:

 The Complex Number &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}=\mathit{a}+\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt; has the Complex Conjugate &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}*=\mathit{a}-\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The Complex Conjugate has multiple uses. For instance, if an equation has the complex root (1+3i), the complex conjugate (1-3i) will also be a root. Similarly, in order to divide complex numbers, one must use the complex conjugate, as we will later see, to 'rationalise' the denominator. One does this by multiplying the fraction by &lt;math&gt;\frac{z*}{z*}&lt;/math&gt; (which has the same effect, value wise, of multiplying by one). This then allows for the quotient to be re-written in the form ''a+ib''.


For any complex number, the complex conjugate is denoted with an *. For instance, the complex number 'a' has the complex conjugate 'a*'. The complex number 'y' has the complex number 'y*'. Mostly, the examination will use the complex numbers z and w.
 

== Arithmetic with Complex Numbers ==

===Addition of Complex Numbers===

Say one was to define:

 &lt;math&gt;z=3+\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;w=-2+3\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;

Complex numbers are added together in their separate parts - so, the real parts of the number are added together and the imaginary parts are added. Using our earlier defined examples:

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z+w &amp; =(3+\sqrt{2}i)+(-2+3\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =(3-2)+(\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{2})i \\
 &amp; =1+4\sqrt{2}i \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Addition of Complex Numbers, just as with real numbers, is the same, regardless of the order in which terms are added - in other words, &lt;math&gt;z+w\equiv w+z&lt;/math&gt;.

===Subtraction of Complex Numbers===

Again, if one considers the earlier defined pair of complex numbers, they can be subtracted in the same way.

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z-w &amp; =(3+\sqrt{2}i)-(-2+3\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =(3-(-2))+(\sqrt{2}-3\sqrt{2})i \\
 &amp; =5-2\sqrt{2}i \\ \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

As with subtraction of real numbers, subtraction of Complex Numbers is not the same regardless of the order in which the terms are added - in other words:

 &lt;math&gt;z-w\neq w-z&lt;/math&gt; (provided, of course, both numbers are not zero)

Thus

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}w-z &amp; =(-2+3\sqrt{2}i)-(3+\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =(-2-3)+(3\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{2})i \\
 &amp; =-5+2\sqrt{2}i \\ \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication of Complex Numbers===

Multiplying a Complex Number by a constant is fairly straight-forward - for a constant 'k', you simply multiply the real part by k and the imaginary part by k. So, using our z from earlier:

 &lt;math&gt;kz=k(3+\sqrt{2}i)=3k+k\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt;

If one was to multiply a complex number by another complex number, one follows an process similar to expanding products such as &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{2}x+2)(x+3)&lt;/math&gt;:

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} z^2 &amp; =z\times z \\
 &amp; =(3+\sqrt{2}i)(3+\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =3\times3+3\times\sqrt{2}i+3\times\sqrt{2}i+\sqrt{2}i\times\sqrt{2}i \\
 &amp; =9+6\sqrt{2}i+2i^2 \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It is tempting to leave the solution as one would when multiplying unknowns. However, the value of &lt;math&gt;i^2\!&lt;/math&gt; is known to be -1. So:

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z^2 &amp; =9+6\sqrt{2}i+2i^2 \\
 &amp; =9+6\sqrt{1}+2\times(-1) \\
 &amp; =9-2+6\sqrt{2}=7+6\sqrt{2} \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can multiply different complex numbers:

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} z\times w &amp; =(3+\sqrt{2}i)(-2+3\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =3\times (-2)+3\times 3\sqrt{2}i+(-2)\times \sqrt{2}i+\sqrt{2}i\times 3\sqrt{2}i) \\
 &amp; =-6+7\sqrt{2}i+6\times i^2 \\
 &amp; =(-6-6)+7\sqrt{2}i=-12+7\sqrt{2}i \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;


===Division of Complex Numbers===


This is a slightly more complex process, similar to rationalising the denominator in situations involving surds.

For instance: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2+\sqrt{3}i}{\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt5i}&lt;/math&gt;. In order to 'divide' the top complex number (on the numerator) by the bottom complex number (on the denominator), one must first make the denominator into a real number. In order to do this, one must use the 'complex conjugate' of the denominator. This is, as already seen in section 2, similar to the denominator, only the imaginary part of the number has the opposite polarity. So, in our example, the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+5i&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}-5i&lt;/math&gt;. Since, however, one cannot simply introduce terms to the fraction. If, however, we use the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{1}{2}-5i}{\frac{1}{2}-5i}&lt;/math&gt;, we know that this has value one. Yet, multiplying our original fraction by this will change it, allowing for a simplification to take place.

This can by mathematically solved:

 &lt;math&gt;z=2+\sqrt{3}i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;w=\frac{1}{2}+5i&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;w*=\frac{1}{2}-5i&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{z}{w} &amp; =\frac{2+\sqrt{3}i}{\frac{1}{2}+5i} \\
 &amp; =\frac{2+\sqrt{3}i}{\frac{1}{2}+5i}\times \frac{\frac{1}{2}-5i}{\frac{1}{2}-5i} \\
 &amp; =\frac{(2+\sqrt{3}i)(\frac{1}{2}-5i)}{(\frac{1}{2}+5i)(\frac{1}{2}-5i)} \\
 &amp; =\frac{2\times \frac{1}{2}+2\times(-5i)+\sqrt{3}i\times \frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{3}i\times(-5i)}{\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\times(-5i)+5i\times \frac{1}{2}+5i\times(-5i)}\\
 &amp; =\frac{1+(-10i)+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+(-5\sqrt{3}i)}{\frac{1}{4}+(\frac{-5}{2}i)+\frac{5}{2}i+(-25i^2)} \\
 &amp; =\frac{(1+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})+(-10-5\sqrt{3})i}{\frac{1}{4}+(-25\times(-1))} \\
 &amp; =\frac{\frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{2}+(-10-5\sqrt{3})i}{\frac{101}{4}} \\
 &amp; =\frac{4}{101}(\frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{2}+(-10-5\sqrt{3})i) \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Whilst this process was much expanded for clarity, it does perhaps stress the need for care and the need for accuracy when dividing complex numbers. Similarly, whilst the numbers may be a little complex, the process is fairly straightforward. It is also very similar to 'rationalising the denominator' in that one eliminates the 'i' term from the denominator, allowing the demoninator to become a factor of the overall expression.

===Dealing with &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2&lt;/math&gt;===

Imagine the complex number:

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2=-8+6\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;

How can one then find &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}\!&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;\mathit{a}+\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;?

 Let us initially define &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}\!&lt;/math&gt; as: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}=\mathit{a}+\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;/br&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathit{z}^2 &amp; =(\mathit{a}+\mathit{b}\mathit{i})^2 \\
 &amp; =\mathit{a}^2+2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}\mathit{i}+\mathit{i}^2\mathit{b}\! \\
 &amp; =(\mathit{a}^2-\mathit{b}^2)+2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\! \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This form of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2\!&lt;/math&gt; is particularly useful as it separates the real part &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{a}^2-\mathit{b}^2\!)&lt;/math&gt; of the complex number from the imaginary part &lt;math&gt;(2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}\mathit{i})\!&lt;/math&gt;.

 We can relate the given value of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2\!&lt;/math&gt; to the expansion and, thus, we can relate co-efficients:
 Since &lt;math&gt;-8+6\mathit{i}=(\mathit{a}^2-\mathit{b}^2)+2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;, we can deduce that:
 &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{a}^2-\mathit{b}^2)=-8\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}=6\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now, it is clear that simultaneous equations, in &lt;math&gt;\mathit{a}\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}\!&lt;/math&gt; are present and can be solved using techniques learned at GCSE, and in C1.

 &lt;math&gt;2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}=6\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore\mathit{a}\mathit{b}=3\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore\mathit{a}=\frac{3}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
 Substituting:
 &lt;math&gt;(\frac{3}{b})^2-{b}^2 = -8\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore\frac{9}{b^2}-b^2=-8&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore9-\mathit{b}^4=-8\mathit{b}^2\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore\mathit{b}^4-8\mathit{b}^2-9=0&lt;/math&gt;

We now have a quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}^2\!&lt;/math&gt; to solve:
 &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}^4-8\mathit{b}^2-9=0\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{b}^2-9)(\mathit{b}^2+1)=0\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\mathit{b}^2=9,-1\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 However: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}\in\Re\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\mathit{b}^2=9\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\therefore\mathit{b}=\pm3\!&lt;/math&gt;

We can then substitute these values back into either of our original equations:
 &lt;math&gt;2\mathit{a}\mathit{b}=6\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}=3 \Rightarrow 3\times2\mathit{a}=6 \therefore \mathit{a}=1\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}=-3 \Rightarrow -3\times2\mathit{b}=6 \therefore \mathit{a}=-1\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we have values for &lt;math&gt;\mathit{a}\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{b}\!&lt;/math&gt;.
 When &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2=-8+6\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z=\pm(1+3i)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Roots of Polynomial Equations Containing ''i''==

===Quadratic Equations===

There are only two scenarios for solutions of Quadratic Equations (that is, those where the highest power of &lt;math&gt;x\!&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x^2\!&lt;/math&gt;). If the co-efficients in the quadratic are all real, one can either have two real roots (which also includes a repeated root, as in the case of &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2=0\!&lt;/math&gt;) or two complex/imaginary roots. Only equations of this type (with real coefficients) are needed in FP1.

Consider now the quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;\mathit{z}^2+1=0\!&lt;/math&gt;. Previously, one would have been unable to solve this as it would require one to root &lt;math&gt;\pm\mathit{-1}\!&lt;/math&gt;. Since we now represent this value as &lt;math&gt;\mathit{i}\!&lt;/math&gt;, this quadratic can now be solved with relative ease:

 Using the quadratic formula gives:
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z &amp; ={-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\
 &amp; ={-0\pm\sqrt{0^2-4\times1\times1} \over 2} \\
 &amp; ={-0\pm\sqrt{-4} \over 2} \\
 &amp; ={\pm\sqrt{-4}\over2} \\
 &amp; ={\pm\sqrt{4}\sqrt{-1}\over2} \\
 &amp; ={\pm2i\over2} \\
 &amp; ={\pm i} \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can then use the factor theorem to prove that either &lt;math&gt;z=i\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z=-i\!&lt;/math&gt; are factors of &lt;math&gt;z^2+1=0\!&lt;/math&gt;. 

 Let &lt;math&gt;P(z)=z^2+1\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z &amp; =i \Rightarrow P(z)=i^2+1\! \\
 &amp; =(-1)+1\! \\
 &amp; =0\! \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;/br&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;P(i)=0\Rightarrow i\!&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;z^2+1\!&lt;/math&gt;
 

The same result is achieved for &lt;math&gt;-i\!&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=\pm i\!&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow P(z)=(z+i)(z-i)&lt;/math&gt;

The same can be done with Complex Roots:

 Consider the quadratic equation:
 &lt;math&gt;z^2-14z+53\!&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;/br&gt;
 Using the quadratic formula, one can see that:
 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}z &amp; ={-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\
 &amp; ={-(-14)\pm\sqrt{(-14)^2-4\times1\times53} \over 2} \\
 &amp; ={14\pm\sqrt{196-212} \over 2} \\
 &amp; ={14\pm\sqrt{-16} \over 2} \\
 &amp; ={14\pm4i\over2} \\
 &amp; =7\pm2i\! \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 If one was to now factorise this expression:
 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;z^2-14z+53=(z-(7+2i))(z-(7-2i))\!&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted, once again, that &lt;math&gt;7\pm2i\!&lt;/math&gt; is a conjugate pair (since &lt;math&gt;7+2i\!&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;7-2i\!&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa). This property is extremly useful, and is often examined in FP1.

==Graphical Representations of Complex Numbers==

[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|right|This is the general Argand Diagram, displaying the complex number z = a + bi]]

This is an interesting concept, when one considers that a part of the complex number is totally imaginary. How can one represent something, in a mathematic manner, that is totally imaginary? An 'Argand Diagram' is the tool used to graphically represent a complex number. It does so by treating the real part of the number as an x-co-orderinate and the imaginary part of the number as a y-co-ordinate.

Argand Diagrams are quite helpful when it comes to determining the 'Argument' of the number. It will also allow for a more visual representation of what is meant by the 'Modulus' of the complex number.

===The Modulus of a Complex Numbers===

This is very similar to finding the length of any given straight-line on a graph. Imagine that you had two points - the origin (0,0) and point A (3,4). The line OA is drawn, connecting the two points. To find the length of this line, one would use an application of Pythagoras, as learned in C1 and C2:

 &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}Length OA &amp; = \sqrt{(3-0)^2+(4-0)^2} \\ 
 &amp; = \sqrt{9+16} \\ 
 &amp; = \sqrt{25} \\ 
 &amp; = 5 \end{align}  &lt;/math&gt;
 Thus, the line OA has length 5 units

=== Introduction ===


Computers have not only transformed society overall but they have also enabled schools to run more smoothly.  Large amounts of student and employee data can be managed efficiently, teacher work time is cut down since everything no longer has to be written out by hand and students have access to a multitudes of information.  Unargueably, computers have made life easier.  However, with this access comes risks.  Wherever there are computers there are also criminals waiting to perform malicious acts.  School districts need to be especially careful since there can be both internal and external threats to security.  This chapter will offer educators an introduction to various network defenses.

----

==What are network defenses?==
 
Network defenses are actions that are taken to protect information, computer and networks from unauthorized activity.  These defenses guard against disruption or denial of service, degradation or destruction. &lt;ref&gt;http://http://www.thefreedictionary.com/computer+network+attack accessed April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;, Some examples of network defenses are firewalls, demilitarized zones (DMZ's), virtual private networks (VPN's), intrusion detection systems (IDS's), and vulnerability scanners.

===Firewalls===

====What is a firewall?====

[[File:firewall.png|left|thumb|300px]]

A firewall, according to Schneier (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;Schneier, B. (2000). Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world. Indianapolis, ID: Wiley Publishing, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt;
is a piece of software or hardware that keeps intruders out and allows only authorized users in to a network.  They act as boundaries between private networks and the vast public network. (Schneier, 2004)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;[Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the term ''firewall'' was used in computer lingo it described a wall in a building that was designed to keep a fire from spreading from one area to another  (How Stuff Works)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howstuffworks.com/firewall.htm accessed April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;, A firewall in a computer acts in much the same way as a firewall in a building.  A firewall in a network ensures that if something bad happens in one part of the firewall, the computers on the other side of the firewall won't be affected.  Intruders to a school network can cause problems in various ways.  For example, they can gain access to personal information of staff and students that could lead to identity theft, steal password information, spread viruses, or gain access to stored personal documents.

==== How does a firewall work? ====

When a computer firewall is enabled, everything that goes in and out of the network is monitored. If information is flagged by the filters, it is not allowed through.  For example, in a school district there may be hundreds of networked computers.  In order to protect all of these computers from being directly accessible to anyone on the internet, firewalls are installed at every connection to the Internet.  The IT department can then configure the firewall with a set of rules that determine what information is allowed in and out of the network.  This allows greater security from hackers. Although school districts use firewalls and other security measures to protect their networks they cannot let all of this security give them a false sense of security.  If anyone does get through these defenses,they can live on a network, doing whatever they want for as long as they want. Hackers can find vulnerabilities in networks and silently gather sensitive information or change a system and leave a back door so that he can come and go undetected whenever he wants.  [IT Security]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itsecurity.com/features/intrusion-detection-for-dummies-072906/ April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;, Because of this, school districts need to have other network defenses in place to safeguard their systems.

=== What are Demilitarized Zones? ===
[[File:DMZ network diagram 1 firewall.svg|right|thumb|300px]]

A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a place on a network where public services would be placed. (Schneier)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;[Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world]&lt;/ref&gt;  Devices cannot direclty access the trusted network from an untrusted network so the DMZ acts as a &quot;go between&quot;. For example, you would want to place devices like a web server in a DMZ so that people on the Internet can access the web server in the DMZ but not have access to the protected network. If the web server were to be compromised, this would limit the amount of information that an outside person has access to. The devices on the DMZ may have limited access to certain resources on your protected network such as a school district's student data base.

===Intrusion Detection Systems===

==== What is an Intrusion Detection System? ====


Intrusion detection systems (IDS), according to Schneier (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;[Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world]&lt;/ref&gt; are network monitors. They are devices that have the ability to listen for traffic on a network that may be suspicious such as attacks that are taking place.  IDS's alert the people who are monitoring the system of an attack usually while it is happening. These alerts can come in the form of an email, page, text or pop up window.  The alerts will let the monitor know how critical the attack is and exaclty what kind of attack is happening. The IDS will also suggest some kind of action that can be taken in order to prevent or stop the attack. To be most effective, IDS devices should monitor traffic both on unprotected and protected networks. The traffic on the unprotected network should be monitored in order to listen for threats before they get to the protected network. IDS devices should also monitor the traffic on the protected network  in order to listen for internal threats.

==== How does an Intrusion Detection System work? ====



The job of the IDS device is to listen to all the traffic on the network and look for certain patterns.  It is used to perform the job that a firewall cannot do.  When a hacker attempts to get into a secure network such as a school district's, a firewall blocks these attempts, however, they do not alert a network manager.  Since access logs would need to be continuously checked, it could be a tedious job.  This is where an IDS is beneficial. Any attempts that are made to get into a network will be logged by the firewall and the IDS will analyze this log. If there are a large number of request-reject entries, the IDS will notice this and alert the network manager. The manager can then see what is happening right after or even while the attacks are still happening  [IDS]&lt;ref&gt;http://http://www.skullbox.net/ids.php accessed April 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;, The network manager then has the ability to analyze the techniques being used, source of attacks, and methods used by the hacker [IDS]&lt;ref&gt;http://http://www.skullbox.net/ids.php accessed April 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;, 



===Virtual Private Networks===

==== What is a Virtual Private network? ====

A Virtual Private Network (VPN), according to Schneier, (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;[Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world]&lt;/ref&gt; is simply a secure connection over a public network which allows users to communicate just as they would if they were in the same building.

==== How does a Virtual Private network work? ====
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a way of accessing resources such as printers, servers, and fileshares of a network to remote users. For example, teachers would be able to access the information on their school computer from home.  This is done by creating a &quot;tunnel&quot; that is encrypted through an unprotected network. According to Schneier, (2000)&lt;ref name=&quot;Scheier&quot;&gt;[Secrets and lies: Digital security in a networked world]&lt;/ref&gt; a VPN is like a hole in the firewall.  A person with a VPN is allowed to tunnel through the firewall into the network. Both a home network and a school network could be considered protected networks.  In order to get to the school network from home one needs to go through an unprotected network such as the Internet to access the data.  It is important that this communication be encrypted to protect against hackers stealing protected information as it is being sent from the school district's network to a remote network.  VPN's can also protect against wireless hijacking of data.  Since wireless transmissions are able to be captured by anyone, VPN's can provide an additional level of security to protect against unauthorized viewing of the data.




===Vulnerability Scanners===

==== What is a Vulnerability Scanner? ====

Vulnerability scanners are computer programs that assess all devices on a network for known weaknesses where potential hackers can find a way in. This software finds security holes and classifies the weaknesses into how critical the security hole is. Most vulnerability scanners will also explain how to correct the weakness.

==== How does a Vulnerability Scanner work? ====

A vulnerability scanner works by gathering information from the devices on the network by using a database of known vulnerabilities and then attempts to exploit each vulnerability that is discovered. The scanner will look for security holes in services running on the system or do a port scan to connect to a host that is listening for incoming connections. If the host is running an application that uses a certain port, the scanner will attempt to connect to that port and try to exploit the appliction running on the system.

      <comment>moved [[Talk:How to Achieve Software Quality]] to [[Talk:Software Quality Assurance]]: History merge.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This book which I started was scheduled for merging with [[Software Quality Assurance]]. It's hard to tell what is the scope of the latter book because there's very little there. Nevertheless, I should note that I plan that this book (&quot;How to Achieve Software Quality&quot;) will be somewhat offbeat, and hopefully covering all the bases. From what I see the &quot;Software Quality Assurance&quot; book just contains an introduction which is covered in the scope of the longer introduction I've made with somewhat more accessible phrasing. So I'm not too keen on merging it there. I should note that the reason I started this wikibook is because I needed one as a prerequisite for the [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] wikibook, which now has a different wikibook as a prerequisite, with which I am unhappy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[['''Fundamentals of Geometry''']]
Geometry is something that unlike algebra is plain and simple, black and white. It still has some complex theorems and things to remember but is a lot more simple than algebra. There are two main types of geometry, euclidean geometry and non-euclidean geometry. 
[['''Euclidean geometry''']]
Euclidean geometry is basic geometry of two and three dimensions...(plane and solid geometry). In 1637, René Descartes showed how numbers can be used to describe points in a plane or in space and to express geometric relations in algebraic form, thus she founded analytic geometry which further developed algebraic geometry. Gaspard Monge, who invented descriptive geometry, solved the problem of representing three-dimensional objects on a two dimensional surface.

Security Policies for Mobile Devices


==Introduction==

'''Target Audience'''
This information is intended for K-12 administrators. In addition, it may be helpful to faculty, central administration and parents.  

In today's society, almost everyone has some type of mobile device.  Mobile devices consist of but are not limited to cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smartphones, iPods, Palms, game consoles, and handheld computers. The Pew Internet Project (2009) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults/Part-2/1-Cell-phones.aspx?r=1&lt;/ref&gt; showed seventy-nine percent of fifteen year olds owned cell phones in 2009.  In addition, eighty-two percent of sixteen year olds and eighty-three percent of seventeen year olds owned cell phones. 

Mobile devices have become a part of everyday life for this generation. Cell phones complement the short-burst, casual, multitasking style of today's &quot;Digital Native&quot; learners (Prensky, 2005). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.innovateonline.info/pdf/vol1_issue5/What_Can_You_Learn_from_a_Cell_Phone__Almost_Anything!.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Digital natives were born into technology.  Technology has always played an important role in their lives.  They use technology for entertainment, communication and collaboration in social settings.  As we progress into the 21st century, educators need to recognize this emphasis on technology.   This page will address the risks and benefits of using mobile devices in the K-12 setting.
If your district or institution is planning to use mobile devices, you may find the AUP suggestions and sample policies useful to begin this process.

==The Benefits of Mobile Devices in Education==

There are many reasons why a district or institution might want to use mobile devices in the classroom.  As stated above in the introduction, most students own a mobile device.  Although they are not allowed in most schools throughout the country, studies show that up to 90% of students still possess these devices throughout the school day &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media/Files/Reports/2009/PIP%20Teens%20and%20Mobile%20Phones%20Data%20Memo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Shortages are seen in technology staffing and most districts are unable to supply every student with a laptop.  Ironically, most of these students are carrying mobile devices in their pockets that have the same capabilities as a laptop.  If students were able to use these devices within the educational setting, districts would save a great deal of money. Laptops and iPods cost money, of course, but so do textbooks; some can run a couple hundred dollars each. And because there is so much free educational material online, high-tech can sometimes mean low-cost (Martin,R. &amp; Brouwer, C., 2009) &lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ipods-laptops-replacing-school-textbooks/story?id=8563292&lt;/ref&gt;.  Textbooks purchases are costly and books become outdated within a few years. Some districts are claiming textbook free zones and replacing these purchases with laptops and iPods.  Access to the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) assure immediate updates and free the district of textbook bias.  


Students can download a number of applications (apps) on their mobile devices.  Companies like Apple &lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/education/why-apple/&lt;/ref&gt; offer educational apps that can be used in the classroom to enrich instruction.  Apple is currently researching the educational benefits of these mobile devices in the K-12 environment.  They are using iWork, iPads, and iPods to see the effects on student achievement. So far, their data has shown significant results in favor of the use of mobile devices in the classroom.

Mobile devices are the &quot;swiss army knife&quot; of tech tools.  Students can:
::::::::::~take pictures.
::::::::::~make videos.
::::::::::~listen to music during down time.
::::::::::~collaborate with peers and educators through texting and phone calls.
::::::::::~access the internet.
::::::::::~record lectures.
::::::::::~create podcasts.
::::::::::~listen to podcasts/lectures so there will be more classtime for educational activities.
::::::::::~download educational applications.
::::::::::~access notes when absent through texting and podcasts.
::::::::::~improve bilingual skills through podcasts.
::::::::::~use a calculator.
::::::::::~type documents in Word.
::::::::::~download videos and notes.
::::::::::~improve typing skills.
::::::::::~enhance the learning experience.
::::::::::~have lessons differentiated to assure success.


As these tools improve, this list will grow. It will be up to the educator to effectively integrate these tools into the curriculum to make learning meaningful.

==The Risks Involved==

It is important to identify risks that can be involved when a district decides to incorporate mobile devices in the learning environment.  The greatest risk is not the tool itself but the person using the tool.  Schneier (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Schneier, B. (2004). Secrets and Lies. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; states people often represent the weakest link in the security chain and we are chronically responsible for the failure of security systems.  As districts plan this transformation to include mobile devices in their curriculum, they must consider the human factor.  When technology tools are, used the vulnerabilities to systems security increases.  Instructional practices within the classroom should stress proper uses of the devices to limit risks to the network.

The human factor can attribute to the following risks within the classroom:

::::::::::~Cheating can occur.  Students can text or record answers for classmates.  Students can also hide files and formulas within the device and access the material during assessments.
::::::::::~Students can record teachers during class. Teachers may feel violated if students try to use the recording against the teacher.
::::::::::~Students can arrange drug deals using the devices.
::::::::::~Students can makes threats with the devices.
::::::::::~Students can set up fights, record fights or cyberbully using the devices &lt;ref&gt;http://www.desertdispatch.com/news/school-471-cell-phone.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  
::::::::::~Mobile devices can make disruptive noises in the classroom.
::::::::::~Mobile devices are used to &quot;pass notes&quot; during class time.
::::::::::~Students can take inappropriate pictures and videos with the devices.
::::::::::~Researchers are unsure of the long term physical effects of cell phone use.
::::::::::~In an emergency situation, cell phone use by students can overload the communication system.

==The Consequences of Misuse==
Consequences of misuse of mobile devices can range from confiscation of the device to 90 lashes in front of the student's peers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/01/21/cafferty.saudi.girl.cnn?iref=allsearch&lt;/ref&gt;  http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2010/01/21/cafferty.saudi.girl.cnn?iref=allsearch.  Some districts have adopted an &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; general rule. If administrators can't visibly see the device, it is not confiscated.  If the device is confiscated, most districts will only turn over the device if a parent or guardian of the child comes to pick it up.

It is not uncommon to turn on the news and hear about a story that involves a mobile device.  Some of these cases end up in our judicial system.  When mobile devices are used in crimes, there is hard eveidence of the incident.  Once a statement, picture, or movie is added to the web, it remains on the web even if one tries to delete it.  


There are always consequences for behaviors that are unacceptable &lt;ref&gt;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pXA5Sk606oPICUuLoE_QjQA&lt;/ref&gt;. The district's acceptable use policy (AUP) can address the consequences for these behaviors. If district's plan to use mobile devices in the classrooms to enhance learning, they must plan on educating faculty, staff and students on the appropriate and inappropriate uses of the devices.

==Writing an AUP addressing Mobile Devices==


An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document that explains what actions are acceptable when using certain tools within an institution or organization. A user must agree to follow this policy in order to be provided with access to a network or to the Internet. It is common practice for many businesses and educational facilities to require that employees or students sign an acceptable use policy before being granted a network ID &lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213795,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;


Writing an AUP can be a challenging endeavor.  The best way to approach this task is to form an AUP committee.  Members of the committee should represent the various stakeholders such as administrators, technology coordinators, tech support, educators, curriculum developers, school board members, parents and possibly students.  You want to be sure to write the most effective policy using a number of views.  For instance, the curriculum developers will be concentrating on technology integration and the tech coordinators will be thinking about security issues.  Your district will have a greater chance of covering possible obstacles when a combination of experts are on the committee.

Security policies determine what countermeasures to use.  How should your district deal with security? Will user names and passwords be sufficient?  Will users be able to use their own mobile devices or will the school provide devices?  Should the district address the faculty and staff in the policy?  What would be considered inappropriate use of the device?  Who will be able to access the Internet and WWW from the devices?  Will students be allowed to upload data to the devices? If there's no policy, there's no basis for consistently answering these questions (Schneier, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Schneier, B. (2004). Secrets and Lies. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sample AUP Policies==


When developing an AUP for your district, you may want to visit your state's website for assistance.  The Pennsylvania Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/pennsylvania_department_of_education/7237&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Virginia Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;http://www.virginia.gov/cmsportal3/portalsearch.html?cx=006541648125353085856%3Apxkar5vs7ki&amp;cof=FORID%3A11&amp;safe=active&amp;q=aup#947&lt;/ref&gt;  can be very helpful.  The National Educational Technology Plan (NTEP) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010&lt;/ref&gt; is another great resource to guide your AUP writing.  NTEP stresses the use of  technology tools to enhance and enrich the learning environment.  This plan concentrates on anytime, anywhere learning through the use of 21st century skills and tools.  The goals of this plan are to increase college attendance and decrease the digital divide among our U.S. students.

Here are a few links that will assist you as you develop an AUP specifically for mobile devices.

As your district steps into this new realm of 21st century tools, you must keep in mind that the policy you develop is never enough.  Security is a people issue (Deubel, P., 2007) &lt;ref&gt;http://thejournal.com/Articles/2007/04/02/Data-Security-in-K12-School-Districts.aspx?Page=1&lt;/ref&gt;.  You need to educate the administrators, teachers, staff, and students in order to have a successful outcome.  Make sure your policy addresses all users including faculty, staff and administration.  Modeling proper use of the tools will improve the desired results.

== Downloading ==
: What you have to do first is downloading ISO image of aptosid (former: sidux) from the project page: 
:: http://aptosid.com/index.php?module=Content&amp;func=view&amp;pid=2
: I'll make my installation on old laptop Compaq Evo N620c, Pentium M 1.3GHz, !.5GB RAM, 40GB hard drive,
: graphic card ATI Radeon 7500 so i choose XFCE.
: I suggest to use any download manager such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlashGet FlashGet], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetRight GetRight] or [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html Firefox web browser] with [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201 DownThemAll! add-on].


== Burning ==
: Most burning applications have &quot;iso image burn/write&quot; option so use that one.
: Burning should be make as slow speed as possible to evoid writing mistakes.


== Attention ! ==
If you have only one partition on your computer hard drive with Windows installed on it, you must:
# Make cleaning &quot;C&quot; drive: to remove all unwanted files.
# Make defragmentation of &quot;C&quot; drive.
# Make Back-up of Windows system to an external drive or burn it on CD/DVD drives.
 

== Booting live CD ==
# Put sidux CD/DVD in your computer optical drive.
# Re-start your computer and get to BIOS with F2 or F10 bottom.
## Go to BOOT section - choose BOOT from optical drive as the first booting option.
## Next: SAVE CHANGES.
## Confirm changes with F10 and start sidux live CD.  
# After displaing BOOT LOADER choose F2 from OPTIONS if you want to change language (default=english).
# Click ENTER to load system.


== Network configuration ==
# Having ETHERNET connection do nothing, connection will be established itself.
# WIRELESS (Wi-fi) connection - have a look [[Sidux/System_installation#9._Ceni|Ceni]]


== Installation ==
&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot; color=red&gt;
Any changes you make on hard drive may damage existing file system&lt;br&gt;
- you do that on your own risk!&lt;br&gt;
This is sample partitioning - it may be vary, dependent of existing partitions. 
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== 1. Running installation ===
: Choose &quot;sidux-installer&quot; icon from desktop-&gt; then Next&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Install1en.png|center|600px]]

=== 2. Standard partitioning ===
: Run Partition Manager &quot;gParted&quot; for : /dev/sda -&gt; Forward
[[File:Install2en.png|center|600px]]
:2.1. Partition /dev/sda1 (C:) contains system Windows with ntfs file system.
[[File:Install3en.png|center|600px]]
:2.2. Partition /dev/sda5 (D:) contains ntfs file system - delete it.
:2.3. Create new partition on unallocated space as &quot;Extended partition&quot;.
[[File:Install4en.png|center|600px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Install5en.png|center|600px]]
:2.4. Create new partition on unallocated space as ext4 file system sized 100 MB (sda5).
[[File:Install6en.png|center|600px]]
:2.5. Create new partition on unallocated space as ext4 file system sized 10000 MB (sda6).
[[File:Install7en.png|center|600px]]
:2.6. Create new partition on unallocated space as linux-swap file system sized 500 MB (sda7).
[[File:Install8en.png|center|600px]]
::a. If your RAM memory is up to 1 GB make swap partition two times bigger than RAM.
::b. If your RAM memory is more than 1 GB the swap partition may be the same or smaller than RAM.
:2.7. Create new partition on unallocated space as ext4 file system using rest of it (sda8).
[[File:Install9en.png|center|600px]]
:2.8. Changes have not be made yet - you can still abort it ;) 
[[File:Install10en.png|center|600px]]
:2.9. Click on green bottom-&gt; Apply
[[File:Install11en.png|center|600px]]&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Install12en.png|center|600px]]
:2.10. After that close gParted and get back to installation window; new partitions are visible now. 
[[File:Install13en.png|center|600px]]

=== 3. Partitioning of only one existing partition with Windows system installed on it ===
: Run partition manager gParted for: /dev/sda -&gt; Forward.
:3.1. For Windows XP usually it's partition /dev/sda1 or /dev/hda1
:3.2. For Windows Vista you have to detect partition with installed Windows system,
:: I never work under Vista before.
:3.3. For Windows 7 (on my second laptop) it is partition /dev/sda3
:3.4. Do not delete the partition !!! Just change the partition size for two times bigger
:: than Windows 7 occupy now -&gt; Resize.
:3.5. On a part of partiton you made free create &quot;Extended Partition&quot; first and four other partitons
:: as the same way as above (standard partitioning).
:3.6. Click on green bottom -&gt; Forward - Are yoy sure? -&gt; Forward.
:3.7. When you finish partitioning stop the installation.
:3.8. Run Windows system and wait until Windows checks its own file system and run it normally.
:3.9. If everything is ok, run sidux live CD again and back to installation.

=== 4. Set mountpoints ===
: Set mountpoints for all partitions (remember it's only an example) such as:
[[File:Install14en.png|center|600px]]
:4.1. Main (root): /dev/sda6 as &quot;/&quot;
:4.2. Boot: /dev/sda5 as &quot;/boot&quot;
:4.3. Home: /dev/sda8 as &quot;/home&quot; -&gt; then Forward.

=== 5. Grub/Timezone ===
:5.1. Bootmanager: GRUB
:5.2. Target: mbr 
[[File:Install15aen.png|center|600px]]
:5.3. Time zone: Etc/UTC; if you want to change it click on: PREFERENCE and choose your country, 
[[File:Install15a.png|center|600px]]
: and your city, then-&gt; OK.
[[File:Install15b.png|center|600px]] 
:5.4. Click on Forward.
[[File:Install15cen.png|center|600px]]

=== 6. User === 
: Type root password, user name and password -&gt; FORWARD.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Ordinary least squares|Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression]] (or simply &quot;regression&quot;) is a useful tool for examining the relationship between two or more interval/ratio variables.  OLS regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the two variables.  If the relationship is not linear, OLS regression may not be the ideal tool for the analysis, or modifications to the variables/analysis may be required.  The basic idea of linear regression is that, if there is a linear relationship between two variables, you can then use one variable to predict values on the other variable.  For example, because there is a linear relationship between height and weight, if you know someone's height, you can better estimate their weight.  Using a basic line formula, you can calculate predicted values of your dependent variable using your independent variable, allowing you to make better predictions.

To illustrate how to do regression analysis in SPSS, we will use two interval variables from the sample data set.  These same variables were used in some of the other chapters.  Genetic counselors were asked to rate how religious and spiritual they consider themselves on a 10 point scale - higher values indicate more religious or more spiritual.  In the analysis below, we are going to see how well religiosity predicts spirituality.

Before we calculate the regression line for religiosity and spirituality for genetic counselors, the first thing we should do is examine a scatterplot for the two variables.  A scatterplot will help us determine if the relationship between the two variables is linear or non-linear, which is a key assumption of regression analysis. This is done in SPSS by going to &quot;Graphs&quot; -&gt; &quot;Chart Builder&quot;: 
[[File:23regression01.png|center|thumb|400px]] 

Once you select on &quot;Chart Builder,&quot; you'll get the &quot;Chart Builder&quot; window, which looks like this:
[[File:23regression02.png|center|thumb|400px]]

In the Chart Builder window, toward the middle of the screen make sure you've selected the &quot;Gallery&quot; tab, then select &quot;Scatter/Dot&quot; from the list of options.  To the right of the options you'll see 8 boxes. If you hover over those, they will identify the type of scatterplot they will generate.  Choose the one at the upper left of the choices, which is called &quot;Simple Scatter.&quot;  To choose it, you'll need to drag it up to the box above that says &quot;Chart preview uses example data.&quot;  You'll then be presented with two axes - a Y axis and an X axis.  In our example, since we are using religiosity to predict spirituality, we drag relscale to the X axis and sprscale to the Y axis.  We then select &quot;OK&quot; and get the following in our Output Window:
[[File:23regression03.png|center|thumb|400px]]

Scatterplots with lots of values are often hard to interpret.  SPSS tries to make this a little easier by making the dots with lots of occurrences darker.  In this case, what we can see in the scatterplot is that there appears to be a dark line run from the bottom left to the upper right, suggesting a positive relationship between religiosity and spirituality - as one increases, so does the other.  The relationship also appears to be linear, which is good for regression analysis.  Having checked the scatterplot, we can now proceed with the regression analysis.

To run a regression analysis in SPSS, select &quot;Analyze&quot; -&gt; &quot;Regression&quot; -&gt; &quot;Linear&quot;:
[[File:23regression04.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The &quot;Linear Regression&quot; window will open:
[[File:23regression05.png|center|thumb|400px]]

On the left is the list of variables.  Find your dependent variable.  In our example it is &quot;sprscale.&quot; We move that over to the &quot;Dependent&quot; box with the arrow.  Then find your independent variable.  In our example it is &quot;relscale.&quot;  We move that over to the &quot;Independent(s):&quot; box:
[[File:23regression06.png|center|thumb|400px]]

While there are a number of additional options that can be selected, the basic options are sufficient for example.  Thus, choose &quot;OK&quot; and you'll get the following in the Output Window:
[[File:23regression07.png|center|thumb|400px]]

The first table simply tells you which variables are included in the analysis and how they are included (i.e., which is the independent and which is the dependent variable).

The second table provides a &quot;Model Summary,&quot; which we'll return to in a moment.  The third table is an ANOVA, which is useful for a variety of statistics, but we are going to skip it in this chapter at the present.

The fourth table provides the regression statistics of most interest to our present efforts.  The first column, &quot;B&quot;, in the second row (not the first row labeled &quot;(Constant)&quot;) provides the slope coefficient for the independent variable.  What this means is that, for every 1 unit change in our independent variable, there is an XX unit change in the dependent variable.  In our example, every 1 point increase in the 10 point religiosity scale results in a .506 point increase in the spirituality scale.  This tells us that the relationship between the two variables we noticed in the scatterplot was accurate - the relationship is positive.

The second column, labeled &quot;Std. Error,&quot; provides a standard error for the slope coefficient.  The third column, &quot;Beta,&quot; provides a standardized version of the slope coefficient (in a bivariate regression, this is also the correlation coefficient or &quot;r&quot;).  What this means is that for every 1 standard deviation unit change in the independent variable there is a corresponding XX standard deviation unit change in the dependent variable.  This is less intuitive than the slope coefficient for most variables.  The fourth column, &quot;t,&quot; is the t statistic.  The fifth column, &quot;Sig.&quot;, provides the p-value for the slope coefficient of the independent variable.  In our example, the p-value is .000, which is less than a standard alpha of .05, suggesting the odds of finding the linear relationship we did between religiosity and spirituality by chance, assuming there is not in fact a relationship, is less than 1 in 1,000.  In other words, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two variables and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between religiosity and spirituality.  In practical terms, more religious genetic counselors tend to be more spiritual as well.

The first row in the fourth table provides statistics for the constant, or y-intercept.  Of greatest interest to us in this chapter is the value in column &quot;B&quot;.  That value is the y-intercept, or the point at which the regression line crosses the y-axis.  In our example, it is 3.822.  What that means, then, is that when religiosity is zero for genetic counselors, spirituality is predicted to be 3.822.

Returning to the second table, the astute reader will notice that the first column, &quot;R&quot;, is identical to the Beta column in the fourth table.  As noted, the standardized slope coefficient in a bi-variate regression is the equivalent of the correlation coefficient or &quot;r&quot;.  The second column is the [[w:Coefficient of determination|R-square statistic]], which is the proportion of variability in a data set that is accounted for by the statistical model.  Basically, the R-square statistic can be interpreted as saying the following: Religiosity explains 34.2% of the variation in spirituality.

Finally, to illustrate the regression line as an actual line of best fit for the many cases in our dataset, we have included another scatterplot with the regression line:
[[File:23regression08.png|center|thumb|400px]]

This graph illustrates that the regression line tries to minimize the variation between all of the points in the scatterplot, providing a best estimate of the dependent variable (spirituality) for each value of the independent variable (religiosity).  It also shows the regression line crossing the y-axis at the value noted above - 3.822.

The above explanation should provide individuals with sufficient information to run a regression analysis and interpret it in SPSS.

== '''MLA Style Documentation''' ==

*The MLA style (Modern Language Association) is more generally used because it is more concise and simpler to use. 

*It has been used by schools, academic departments, and instructors for over 50 years.

*A basic MLA citation contains two kinds of information: the author's name and the specific page or pages on which the cite information is to be found.

&lt;big&gt;'''Anal Cancer Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Staging==
:''Note:'' '''anal margin (perianal) cancers''' are staged using the [[Radiation_Oncology/Skin/Nonmelanoma#Staging|Skin cancer staging]] system.

===Current staging===
'''AJCC 7th edition (2009)'''

''Primary Tumor:''
*Tis - carcinoma in situ
*T1 - 2 cm or less
*T2 - 2 - 5 cm
*T3 - &gt;5 cm
*T4 - invades adjacent organ, e.g. vagina, urethra, bladder. (invasion of the rectal wall, perirectal skin, subcutaneous tissue, or sphincter muscle is not included as T4.)

''Regional Nodes:''&lt;br&gt;
:Regional lymph nodes include: perirectal, lateral sacral, internal iliac (hypogastric), inguinal
*N0 - no lymph nodes
*N1 - perirectal lymph nodes
*N2 - unilateral internal iliac or (unilateral) inguinal lymph nodes or both
*N3 - perirectal AND inguinal lymph nodes; and/or bilateral internal iliac; and/or (bilateral) inguinal lymph nodes

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - no
*M1 - yes

''Stage grouping:''
*0 - Tis
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2-3 N0
*IIIA - T1-3 N1, T4 N0
*IIIB - T4 N1, Any N2, Any N3
*IV - M1

===Older staging systems===

&lt;big&gt;'''Anal Cancer Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Rare malignancy, &lt;2% of all GI cancers, 4% of anorectal cancers
*U.S. Incidence (2009): 5290; 0.5-0.7 per 100,000 (1-2% of colonic ca's). Incidence increasing over the last 3 decades
*Anal cancer more common in women (2:1), and women tend to have cancers above the dentate line.
*Mean age 55-65
*Not considered an AIDS-defining illness in individuals with HIV (unlike invasive cervical ca), however the immunodeficiency of AIDS yields a 4-5x increased risk of anal cancer, likely through the combinations of immunodeficiency and an HPV coinfection. 
*No known association b/w anal and rectal ca.

*Risk factors include:	
**&gt;10 sexual partners
**receptive anal intercourse
**immunodeficiency
**hx of genital warts or other STD's (esp. HPV 16 &amp; 18)
**cigarette smoking

==Anatomy==
*'''Anal canal''': 
**Extends from anorectal ring (where rectum enters puborectalis sling) proximally to anal verge distally
**Proximal aspect from anorectal ring to dentate line is colorectal mucosa (~1-2 cm)
**Middle aspect around dentate line is transitional mucosa
**Distal aspect from dentate line to anal verge is modified (nonkeratinizing, no skin appendages) squamous epithelium (~2 cm)
*'''Anal verge''': transitional area at the distal end of the anal canal, where the nonkeratinzing squamous epithelium meets the true epidermis of perianal skin (indistinct on macroscopic examination)
*'''Anal margin''': area of perianal skin in a ~5cm radius from the anal verge. Tumors arising here are classified and treated as skin cancers
*Carcinomas at anorectal junction are problematic: if epicenter &gt;2cm proximal to dentate line, classified as rectal. If &lt;2cm, classified as anal
*'''Lymphatic drainage''':
**1) Near rectum: via rectal drainage, along superior hemorrhoidal vessels, to inferior mesenteric LNs
**2) Proximal anal canal (above dentate line): along inferior and middle hemorrhoidal vessels to perirectal and internal iliac LNs
**3) Distal anal canal (below dentate line) and anal verge: to superficial inguinal LNs

==Pathology==
*PMID 6639856 - 970 residents of LA County between 1972-1981
**Keratinizing squamous cell 63%
**Non-keratinizing squamous cell (transitional, basaloid, and cloacogenic terms now abandoned by WHO) 23%
**Adenocarcinoma 7% - worse prognosis
**Paget's, basal cell, melanoma 2% each


==Spread==
*Primary route local and LN
*At presentation:
**Overall risk of regional LN involvement ~25%
**Pelvic LN+ 30% in some series with APR
**Inguinal LN+ 15-30%
***If clinically negative inguinal LN, 10-15% occult positive
*Extrapelvic visceral mets 5-10%

==Treatment Overview==
*Historically, APR was the primary treatment modality
*Wayne State study in 1973 showed that neoadjuvant chemo-RT had pathologic complete response at surgery, sparking interest in chemo-radiation to preserve sphincter function
*Comparison of retrospective series showed a comparable/improved survival of primary RT (+/- CT) compared to surgery
*UKCCCR and EORTC trials established chemo-radiation (RT + 5-FU + Mitomycin) superior to RT alone as primary treatment strategy
*RTOG 87-04 demonstrated the continued necessity of Mitomycin as part of the protocol
*RTOG 98-11 showed that concurrent 5-FU/Mitomycin remains superior to induction 5-FU/cisplatin followed by concurrent 5-FU/cisplatin

*'''ACR Appropriateness Criteria, 2007''' PMID 17601586 (Poggi MM, J Am Coll Radiol. 2007 Jul;4(7):448-56.)

==Outcomes==
*5-year overall survival (primary RT, 5-FU, Mitomycin)

'''HIV+'''
*'''Multi-National; 2008''' (1988-2006) PMID 18427149 -- &quot;HIV-specific differences in outcome of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal: a multicentric cohort study of HIV-positive patients receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy.&quot; (Oehler-Janne C, J Clin Oncol. 2008 May 20;26(15):2550-7.

**Retrospective. 40 HIV+ and 81 HIV- patients, treated with RT or CRT with 5-FU/mitomycin or cisplain. Median CD4 358. HIV+ younger (48 vs. 62), male (93% vs. 25%), early stage, large-cell histology. 
**Outcome: CR HIV+ 92% vs. HIV- 96%; 5-year OS HIV+ 61% vs. HIV- 65% (NS); 5-year LC 38% vs. 87% (SS)
**Toxicity: Grade 3-4 skin HIV+ 35% vs. HIV- 17% (SS), hematologic 33% vs. 12% (NS)
**Conclusion: Long-term LC and acute toxicity are clinical challenges for HIV+ patients

==Surgery alone==
*'''Local Excision
**Local excision alone considered an investigational approach
**'''Mayo, 1984''' PMID 6326995 -- &quot;Carcinoma of the anal canal. A clinical and pathologic study of 188 cases.&quot; (Boman BM, Cancer. 1984 Jul 1;54(1):114-25.)
***188 patients with anal canal CA. Squamous cell: 20% regional LN+, 2% distant mets. Transitional: 30% regional LN+, 20% distant mets
***Local excision: 13 patients with small (&lt;=2 cm) and superficial invasive treated by local excision. One required APR for local recurrence, others cured
***APR: 114/118 patients treated with primary APR, 40% recurrent disease, but 71% survived &gt;5 years

*'''Abdominoperineal resection'''
**Historically (until 1970s) standard treatment
**5-year OS 40-60%; local relapse common
**Now reserved as salvage for patients who fail radiation, or who had prior pelvic RT


==Surgery vs. Primary RT==
*No randomized comparison with primary chemo-RT
*Shift away from surgery toward primary RT based on improved QOL (sphincter preservation, colostomy-free survival) with comparable/improved overall survival

*'''Stockholm, 1989''' (1978-1984) PMID 2614221 -- &quot;Management of anal epidermoid carcinoma--an evaluation of treatment results in two population-based series.&quot; (Goldman S, Int J Colorectal Dis. 1989 Dec;4(4):234-43.)
**Retrospective comparison of 2 populations: 1) retrospective Stockholm group, 90 patients, treated by combination of surgery alone or by combinations of RT +/- CT +/- surgery, 2) prospective Uppsala trial of RT +/- CT
**5-year OS: Stockholm 43% vs. Uppsala 55%, if no initial dissemination 75% vs. 48%
**Conclusion: initial treatment in anal CA should be RT (+/- CT)

==Radiation alone==
*Control rate depends on size of primary
**Tumors &lt;4 cm and cN0 have excellent 10-year local control (85-90%) and overall survival (~80%)
**Larger tumors have only ~60% local control rate and ~50% overall survival


*'''Hopital Tenon, Paris; 1994''' (1972-1991) PMID 8156483 -- &quot;Epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. Results of curative-intent radiation therapy in a series of 270 patients.&quot; (Touboul E, Cancer. 1994 Mar 15;73(6):1569-79.)
**Retrospective. 270 patients, anal canal epidermoid cancer. T1 8%, T2 51%, T3 30%, T4 10%. Curative intent RT 40-45 Gy, 4-6 week rest, 15-20 Gy perineal electron boost or 30 Gy Ir-192 boost. 4 patients treated with brachy alone (mean dose 62.5 Gy)
**Outcome: Overall local control 80%, anal conservation rate 67%. 5-year and 10-year OS T1 86% and 86%, T2 86% and 82%, T3 60% and 57%, T4 45% and 45%; N0 76% and 74%, cN+ 53% and 53%
**Tumor size: 10-year LC &lt;4 cm 90% vs &gt;4 cm 65%
**Toxicity: 10% required surgical treatment
**Conclusion: Tumors &lt;4cm have good outcomes, larger tumors or cN+ require more intensive therapy

**Retrospective. 72 patients, anal canal. Treated with EBRT 50/20
**Outcome: 5-year local control T1 100%, T2 86%, T3 92% and T4 63%. Anal conservation rate 74%. 6-year DSS 78%, OS 66%. If cN0, 5-year DSS 78% vs cN+ 75%. Local recurrence in 17 patients, APR salvage successful in 41%
**Toxicity: Severe late complications 8%
**Conlusion: RT alone is a reasonble approach, particularly for early stage tumors

==Primary RT vs. Chemo-RT==
*Both UKCCCR and EORTC trials showed improved local control and improved colostomy-free survival for chemo-radiation over RT alone. Neither trial showed a difference in overall survival
*Acute toxicity is worse in chemo-radiation, late toxicity is similar, but tolerable


*'''EORTC''' (1987-1994) -- RT vs chemo-RT
**Randomized. 110 patients, epidermoid ca of the anal canal or anal margin. T3-4N0-3 or T1-2N1-3. Treated with Arm 1) RT 45/25, if CR/PR then RT boost 15-20 Gy after 6 weeks or 2) RT 45/25 + CI 5-FU 750 mg/m2 + Mitomycin 15 mg/m2 single bolus

***Outcome: Local control RT 50% vs. CRT 68% (SS); colostomy-free survival RT 40% vs. CRT 72% (SS); 5-year OS: 56% (NS)
***Toxicity: no difference in severe side effects, but anal ulcers more frequent in CRT
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT improves local control and colostomy-free survivial, no impact on overall survival, with comparable toxicity

*'''UKCCCR ACT I''' (1987-1994) -- RT vs chemo-RT
**Randomized. 585 patients. 40% with large T3 or T4, 20% N+, excluded T1N0. Treated with 1)RT 45/20 or 45/25 depending on institutional preference or 2) same RT + CI 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 + Mitomycin 12 mg bolus. Clinical response at 6 weeks, responders RT 15 Gy boost or 25 Gy boost via Ir-192 BT, non-responders salvage surgery. Primary endpoint local failure

***Outcome: 12-year locoregional control RT 41% vs. chemo-RT 66% (SS); only small change &gt;5 years. 12-year colostomy-free survival 20% (if alive, 73% without colostomy) vs 30% (if alive, 89% without colostomy); 12-year OS 27% vs 33% (NS). Early 9% excess non-anal cancer deaths disappeared by 10 years. 84% recurrences within first 2 years
***Toxicity: Excess of second malignancies RT 6% vs chemo-RT 12% (~50% lung cancer)
***Conclusion: Clear benefit of chemo-RT can still be seen 12 years later, very few patients suffered LRR as first even after 5 years. Majority of failures loco-regional

==RT + various chemo options==
'''''Randomized'''''
*'''UK ACT II''' (2001-2008) -- 2x2: RT + 5-FU + mitomycin vs cisplatin; observation vs maintenance cisplatin + 5-FU
**Randomized, 2x2. 940 patients, 15% anal margin, LN+ 30%. Arm 1) RT 50.4/28 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 D1-4 and D29-32 + cisplatin 60 mg/m2 D1 and D29 vs Arm 2) Same RT and 5-FU + Mitomycin 12 mg/m2 D1. Then randomized for maintenance chemo Arm 1) cisplatin + 5-FU x2 cycles vs Arm 2) observation

***Outcome: Mitomycin vs cisplatin randomization: No difference in colostomy rate. Maintenance randomization: No difference in RFS (3-years 75%) or OS
***Toxicity: Acute Grade 3-4 hematologic MMC 25% vs cisplatin 13% (SS); non-hematologic no difference
***Conclusion: No difference. 5-FU and MMC with RT remains the standard of care
**'''2013''' -- [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23578724 PMID: 23578724 ] &quot;Mitomycin or cisplatin chemoradiation with or without maintenance chemotherapy for treatment of squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus (ACT II): a randomised, phase 3, open-label, 2× 2 factorial trial.&quot; (James, Roger D., et al. Lancet Oncology 2013).  Median F/U 5.1 years
***Outcome: No difference between each of the four arms.
****Colostomy free survival rates at 3 yrs: 73% mitomycin, maintenance group, 75% cisplatin, maintenance group, 75% mitomycin, no maintenance group, 72% cisplatin, no maintenance group (NS).
****3-yr colostomy-free survival was 84% for T1/T2 disease, 61% for T3/T4. 
****CR rate: 90·5% patients in the mitomycin group vs 89·6% in the cisplatin group had a CR at 26 weeks (p=0·64). 
***Toxicity: Acute Grade 3-4 hematologic MMC 26% vs cisplatin 16% (SS); non-hematologic no difference. 112 patients had a post-treatment colostomy because of anal cancer (n=98) and treatment related toxicity (n=14: 3 for necrosis/ulceration, 5 fistula, 4 fecal incontinence, 1 other). Colostomies due to treatment morbidities were split equally between all arms (see appendix).
***Conclusion: No difference for MMC vs Cisplatin concurrent with RT. No benefit of maintenance chemo after chemoRT. Authors conclude 5-FU and MMC concurrent with RT remains the standard of care.
***Discussion: &quot;Grade3—4 haematological toxicity was less common with 5FU +cisplatin (26% vs 16%), however these were almost entirely related to low WBC and were not sufficient to increase neutropenic sepsis. This marginal benefit is likely to be outweighed by the extra resources to use cisplatin (2 courses of either all day or overnight intravenous treatment with hydration) vs single dose of mitomycin (delivered over 10 min).&quot;

==Management of Lymph Nodes==
'''Elective RT'''
*Elective irradiation of pararectal and medial internal illiac LNs accepted
*Inguinal LN RT causes little morbidity, and reduces risk of LN failure from 25% to 5% (Perez 4th ed). However, Lyon experience (PMID 11443612) suggests elective inguinal RT may not be necessary

'''Inguinal Nodes (+)'''
*Surgical approaches vary from radical dissection to local excision
*Surgery usually followed by RT or CRT
*Local control good (~80%) unless LNs ulcerated or fixed (Perez 4th ed)

'''Pelvic Nodes (+)'''
*Primary treatment with CRT or neoadjuvant CRT followed by APR

**Retrospective. 16 patients, localized adenocarcinoma of anal canal. Treated with RT (n=9), excisional bx + RT (n=5), or adjuvant RT after APR (n=2). Concurrent 5-FU in 11/16. Compared with epidermoid group (n=92) treated with chemo-RT. Median F/U 3.7 years
**Outcome: 5-year LR 54% (vs epidermoid 18%, SS). DM 66% (vs. 10%, SS). 5-year DFS 19% (vs. 77%, SS). 5-year OS 64% (vs 85%, SS).
**Conclusion: Localized adenoCA of anus have high rate of pelvic failure and DM compared with epidermoid histology. Recommend APR, and consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy

&lt;big&gt;'''Anal Cancer RT Technique'''&lt;/big&gt;


==RT dose escalation==
*'''RTOG 92-08''' (1992-6) -- split course 59.6 Gy
**'''Preliminary results: 1996''' PMID 9166533 -- &quot;Dose escalation in chemoradiation for anal cancer: preliminary results of RTOG 92-08.&quot; (John M, Cancer J Sci Am. 1996 Jul-Aug;2(4):205-11.)
**Phase II, dose-escalation, split course RT. 47 patients, cancer &gt;= 2cm. RT 59.6 Gy split course with 2-week break. Initial pts treated 1992-3. Comparison with RTOG 87-04
**After unexpectedly high rates of colostomy (23%), treatment break was eliminated. 20 additional patients were treated (1995-6). 9 completed protocol, 9 required treatment break anyway. Median RT dose 41 Gy (&lt;u&gt;Abstract&lt;/u&gt; ASTRO 1997). Colostomy rate 11%
**Conclusion: No improvement in local control in split-course RT. Suggest continuous RT, but may have to accept higher acute toxicity
**'''10-years: 2008''' PMID 18472363 -- &quot;Evaluation of planned treatment breaks during radiation therapy for anal cancer: update of RTOG 92-08.&quot; (Konski A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Sep 1;72(1):114-8.)
***DFS: 5-yr 53%, 8-yr 34% (break); vs 80%/63% (no break). Colostomy-free survival: 58%/34% vs 75%/63%. 
***Pts treated with mandatory break had worse OS, DFS, and CFS compared with 87-04, whereas pts treated with no mandatory break were similar to historical controls. However, the trial was small and not powered to compare efficacy endpoints.

==Segmental boost technique==
Uses wide AP field, narrow PA field, and angled photon inguinal fields (matched to the divergence of the PA field). Single isocenter technique.
*'''Yale, 2004''' 
**'''2004''' PMID 15275740 -- &quot;Improved treatment of pelvis and inguinal nodes using modified segmental boost technique: dosimetric evaluation.&quot; (Moran MS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Aug 1;59(5):1523-30.)
**'''2010''' PMID 19596174 -- &quot;Clinical utility of the modified segmental boost technique for treatment of the pelvis and inguinal nodes.&quot; (Moran MS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 15;76(4):1026-36.)

==Inguinal node photon boost==
*'''Indianapolis, 2001''' PMID 11295207 &amp;mdash; &quot;A technique for inguinal node boost using photon fields defined by asymmetric collimator jaws.&quot; Dittmer PH et al. Radiother Oncol. 2001 Apr;59(1):61-4. 
**Treats the pelvis using PA field, pelvis + inguinals using AP field, plus a further boost to the inguinals using AP photons with asymmetric collimator jaws (using the same isocenter).

==&quot;Diamond&quot; technique==
*'''McGill'''
**'''2007''' PMID 17276620 &amp;mdash; &quot;Conformal therapy improves the therapeutic index of patients with anal canal cancer treated with combined chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy.&quot; (Vuong T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Apr 1;67(5):1394-400.)
**'''2003''' PMID 12788191 &amp;mdash; &quot;Contribution of conformal therapy in the treatment of anal canal carcinoma with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy: results of a phase II study.&quot; (Vuong T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Jul 1;56(3):823-31.)

==IMRT==
*'''Multicenter; 2007''' (2000-2006) PMID 17925552 -- &quot;Concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for anal canal cancer patients: a multicenter experience.&quot; (Salama JK, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 10;25(29):4581-6.	
**Prospective. 53 patients (62% T-2, 67% N0, 15% HIV+) treated with concurrent chemo (5-FU/mitomycin, or FU alone) and RT. Primary sites and involved LN median 51.5 Gy, pelvis and inguinal LN median 45 Gy. Median F/U 14 months
**Toxicity: Grade 3 GI 15%, dermatologic 38%; Grade 4 leukopenia 30%, neutropenia 34%. Treatment break in 41%, median 4 days
**Conclusion: Effective, and compares favorably with historical standards

*'''France (Montpellier), 2007''' PMID 18005443 &amp;mdash; &quot;Optimal organ-sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) regimen for the treatment of locally advanced anal canal carcinoma: a comparison of conventional and IMRT plans.&quot; (Menkarios C, Radiat Oncol. 2007 Nov 15;2:41.)
**Treatment planning study. Compared: 1) AP/PA + 3D-CRT boost, 2) Pelvic IMRT + 3D-CRT boost, 3) Pelvic IMRT + IMRT boost, 4) IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost.
**Conclusion: Compared to conventional plan, all IMRT plans reduced the dose to bowel, bladder, genitalia, and bone marrow.

*'''U Chicago, 2005''' PMID 16168830 &quot;Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the treatment of anal cancer: toxicity and clinical outcome.&quot; Milano MT et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Oct 1;63(2):354-61. 
** IMRT remarkably well tolerated, with minimal toxicity.

==AmigaE==

Read more [http://www.thefullwiki.org/AmigaE_programming_language here]. 

'''Amiga E''', or very often simply '''E''', is a programming language created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the Amiga. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaE Amiga E] is a combination of many features from a number of languages, but follows the original [[C_Programming]] and C++, most closely in terms of basic concepts like in the sense that it is fast and weakly typed, and had a rich set of features from procedural, object oriented and functional programming languages. 

[http://strlen.com/wiki/amiga-e Amiga E]'s main benefits are fast compilation (allowing it to be used in place of a scripting language), very readable source code, flexible type system, powerful module system, exception handling (not C++ variant) and object oriented programming. 

Contact the AmigaE IRC channel irc.freenode.net at #amigaE




==PortablE==

For further information and questions, Portable E has its own forum [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?forum=28 here]. [http://cshandley.co.uk/JasonHulance/ PortablE] is an AmigaE compiler, written from scratch in E, and able to compile itself. There is a [http://www.freelists.org/list/positron mailing list] for E where you might get some answers. 

Read more [http://cshandley.co.uk/portable/PortablE.html here]. 

This is how PortablE works. You write your Amiga E code, use PortablE to translate it into a .cpp file and then use any C++ compiler to compile the file into an executable. I have been using g++ inside AROS. If you want to go to Amiga Classic, you can use PortablE to translate to Amiga E and then move it to Classic where you can use an Amiga E compiler like CreativE. 

If PortablE is not already set up for use, you need to set a Stack of at least 100000 to run PortablE. You can set this up by typing in the AROS shell. 
 stack 100000
You need to do an assign for PEmodules. 
 Assign PEmodules: VolumeName:PEmodules
You can put Assign commands like this in your user-startup file in AROS so you don’t have to do it everytime. User-startup is in System:S (S drawer). 

You also need some Assigns placed in there for g++. The exact Assigns you need can be found in the INSTALL file located in System:Development

So here are the commands I entered on the command line once I had things setup to test a simple program.

 PortablE test.e (This gave me a file named test.cpp)

 g++ test.cpp -o test (This gave me a file named test to run as an executable)

So then I just typed in the name of my executable at the shell and it ran and printed “Hello, World!”.

===Procedures===

A [[hello world program|&quot;hello world&quot; program]] in Amiga E calling another procedure inside  
&lt;pre&gt;
   PROC main()
      DEF z 
      WriteF('Hello, World!\n')
      z:=1
      Another()

   PROC another
      DEF y
      y:=2

         y:=y+2
   ENDWHILE
ENDPROC
&lt;/pre&gt;

* The procedure definition.
* The declaration of the procedure main, with no parameters.
* The declaration of local variables x and y
* Initialization of x and y using assignment statements.
* The WHILE loop
* The loop check for the WHILE loop using the logical operator AND, the comparison operator &lt;, and parentheses to group the expression.
* The call to the (built-in) procedure WriteF using parameters.  Notice the string, the place holders for numbers, \d, and the linefeed, \n. 
* Assignments to x and y, adding two to their values.
* The marker for the end of the WHILE loop.
* The marker for the end of the procedure.

To return a value, replace ENDPROC with ENDPROC value

==Conversion==

The hardest part when moving from BASIC to C, C++ and E is pointers &amp; strings. E &amp; C deal with strings in almost exactly the same way, so there is no great benefit to E there. 

AmigaE's treatment of pointers is far simpler than C's, due to C's design. You have to think very carefully about what kind of pointer is required in case  a &quot;&amp;&quot; or &quot;*&quot; needs to be added. While with E there is almost never any such worry. 

Plus &quot;PTR TO xxx&quot; seems easier to grasp than &quot;xxx*&quot;. 

Note that there are some good C guides that explain the principles of strings &amp; pointers, using 'box &amp; arrow' diagrams, which you may still find helpful when learning E.



You can just open workbench.library (version 44 or newer required) and call OpenWorkbenchObjectA() as it is documented in autodocs. 





==Examples==

STATIC app_name = 'DirList'

PROC main()
	DEF dirPath:STRING, dir:PTR TO cDir, dirList:PTR TO cDirEntryList

==Reference==

AmigaE works well and integrates with Assembly well also. Just don't go writing shared libraries with it since there are design flaws with the library mode. Also, if you plan on using multiple return codes, keep them in the same source as your application code because the module generation doesn't work right with multiple return codes. Lastly, don't nest the function form of the IF keyword (the AmigaE equivalent of the ? : operators in C). Those are all of the bugs I can think of in the compiler.</text>

== Blacklist ==

Dear Kenneth,

Spamming us is bad for us and it's probably bad for your business if you're as persistent and indiscriminate as you've been. You're forcing us to add your domains to the Wikimedia Foundation's global spam blacklist.

The global [[:meta:Talk:Spam blacklist|spam blacklist]] is used by more than just our [[:meta:List of Wikimedia Projects by Size|700]]+ [[:w:en:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] wikis (Wikipedias, Wiktionaries, etc.). All 3000+ [[:w:en:Wikia|Wikia]] wikis plus a substantial percentage of the [http://s23.org/wikistats/largest_html.php?sort=good_desc,total_desc&amp;th=100&amp;lines=2500 50,000+ unrelated wikis] that run on [[:w:en:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software have chosen to incorporate this blacklist in their own spam filtering. Each wiki has a local &quot;whitelist&quot; which overrides the global blacklist for that project only. Some of the non-Wikimedia sites may be interested in your links; by all means feel free to request local whitelisting on those.

There have been rumours in various [[:w:en:black hat|black hat]] [[:w:en:search engine optimization|search engine optimization]] forums that Google and other big search engines may be referring to our global blacklist when compiling their own black lists of [[:w:en:Spamdexing|search engine spam]] domains. Since these companies decisions are beyond our control and are made independently of us, we assume no responsibility for them and you would need to communicate with the appropriate search engine. Should you find yourself penalized in any search engine rankings and you believe that to be a result of blacklisting here, you should deal directly with the search engine's staff. We do not have any arrangements with any of the search engine companies; if they're using our blacklist it's purely on their own initiative. 

We've already blacklisted domains known to have been spammed. If you continue, we'll have no choice but to pre-emptively blacklist every additional domain we can find. So far we're up to 350+: [[:meta:User talk:COIBot/XWiki/4solarpanels.com]]. --[[User:A. B.|A. B.]] ([[User talk:A. B.|talk]]) 16:11, 19 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter 3 continues the messages to the seven churches. Chapters 2 and 3 are the &quot;things that are&quot; division of Revelation. God sees and addresses the conditions that existed within the seven churches at that time. However, there is also an element of future application: Modern churches should be able to see the same conditions within themselves and correct any deficiencies.

==The Message to the Church at Sardis==

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things says He that has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and yet you are dead.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' [[w:Sardis|Sardis]] was about fifty miles to the northeast of Ephesus. There is still a town on the site, but over the years it has come to be known as ''Sart''. It was the provincial capital of the region of Lydia, which five hundred years before Christ had controlled most of the coast of Asia Minor and its offshore islands. Sardis was famous for its arts and crafts. It was also the first place to mint gold and silver coins. In the past, the Lydian kings had been so wealthy that King Croesus, who ruled in the middle of the sixth century B.C., had become a legend for his riches, and it was said that the sands of the River Pactolus, which ran through Lydia, were golden. Croesus overstepped himself in 549 B.C., however. He attacked the mighty Persian Empire, who defeated him soundly and colonized Lydia. Sardis then became the seat of Persia’s regional governor. 

Three hundred years after the defeat by Persia, Lydia was conquered again, this time by the Romans. It was still under their control at the end of the first century A.D. when Revelation was written. Despite huge relief efforts by Rome, Sardis never recovered its former glory after it was devastated by a great earthquake in 17 A.D. The town, though humbled, did continue to exist however, and the passage in Revelation is evidence that there was a Christian community there in the late first century. Jesus alludes to the city's diminished glory when he says to the church, “I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, and yet you are dead” (3:1).

Sardis was the capital of the rich and powerful kingdom of Lydia. This church had lost its zeal, and was now just &quot;there&quot;, not doing any worthy deeds, and having no spirit left. Sardis represents a &quot;dead orthodoxy&quot;, a church that follows the form of religion without making any real contribution.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works perfect before God.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' There was a remnant of fervent believers at Sardis. Jesus exhorts them to stir up the coals of faith in the others and encourage them to return to the church's primary role of spreading the gospel and gaining converts. &lt;font color=red&gt;'' Either make the tree good and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit&quot; &lt;/font&gt;(Matthew 13:33). 

While the dwindling faith of the followers is important, the passage indicates that the more important issue is that they have not finished what they are supposed to do. Their works are not perfect; therefore they must purify themselves in order to please God. The phrase &quot;Be watchful&quot; reflects unreadiness or a lack of diligence in the followers of Sardis. The next verse continues this theme of unreadiness by stating that Jesus will come unexpectedly, like a thief. Since they do not know the time of his arrival, the only thing they can do is perfect themselves.

According to D.E. Aunde, the verse could also be translated as &quot;strengthen those who remain but are at the point of death&quot; (''Revelation 1-5'', (1997), p. 219). This carries with it the connotation of  Christians being martyred for their faith.

Revelation verse 2 begins the five step plan that Jesus put into place to help fix the problems. The first step, be watchful, states that there needs to be aware and prepareed instead of being relaxed and unprepared. The second step, strengthen, is set into place to show the followers need to establish the important aspects of the church and strengthen their values within the church.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Jesus' words allude to the way in which the Persians had overcome the supposedly invincible citadel at Sardis with a surprise attack. The church is admonished to remember how the apostles delivered the gospel to them, hold fast to that good teaching, and repent of their deadness. If they do not, then they will be caught by surprise just like the unbelievers when the Day of Judgment arrives. Interestingly, a similar statement made by Jesus is also recorded in the book of Luke: &quot;Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man&quot; (21:36, KJV). Jesus's repetition of this statement places significant weight on &quot;watching&quot; and being prepared for the Lord's coming, in the hopes that people will grasp this message and heed the warning. It is also important to note that the verse in Revelation talks of Jesus coming as a &quot;thief&quot;, which shows that the Church better turn things around because Jesus could show up unexpectedly.

Verse 3 continues the five step plan for Sardis that began in verse 2. The third step, remember, tells Sardis that it needs to look back to the beginning and remember when they first revieced the Gospel. The fourth step, hold fast, states that Sardis needs to return to the Scripture. The final step that Jesus suggested was repent.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Jesus' words here allude to Sardis' famous garment industry (hence our word ''sartorial''). White garments are symbolic of purity and holiness.If a person had a soiled garment, they were not allowed to worship. The believers who have held fast to their faith are still clean because they have tried and will continue trying to correct the problems. Such are promised their reward in heaven, even if their efforts fail.  This verse makes reference to a small group of Christians that Jesus feels are following him in the correct way.  He then calls for them to show others the way that the Church should worship him.
The same Greek word that means &quot;watch&quot; can also mean &quot;wake up.&quot; Thus, this could mean that the people of Sardis, or all people, need to wake up and follow the word of God and embrace purity.

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that overcomes, the same will be clothed in white, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Those that conquer the devil will be robed in white by a means of grace. This &quot;gift&quot; is given without anything in return. It is by God's grace and through Jesus' death on the cross that sinners are able to be clothed in white. Those who wear this color will be noticed in the eyes of all. By having one's name in the book of life, he/she can be ensured that they are remembered in the Kingdom. By him confessing the name of the one who has overcome evil in front of God and his angels, this is showing that he will receive the highest praise for his duties to the Lord.

Additionally, this verse raises issues concerning free will and predetermination.  On the one hand, John mentions the book of life in such a way that indicates that it already contains a list of names of those who will be a part of the Kingdom of God.  However, John refers to blotting names out of the book, which would seem to indicate that the contents of the book of life are mutable, dependent upon the actions or free will of each individual.

The image also opens up the possibility that one could be removed from the book. In the O.T. the &quot;book of life&quot; refers to early life while in contrast the &quot;book of life&quot; refers to eternal life. Therefore, if we go along with what the image implies it is possible to have the promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ work on the cross removed. 


===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' The churches are again admonished to understand and obey the teaching of these messages. He is saying that not only those who hear the word of God have to obey the word, but everyone must do what is right and follow what is said. Everyone is capable of following, because everyone has an ear to hear the word of God.

==The Message to the Church at Philadelphia==

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Philadelphia, which today is the Turkish town of [[w:Alaşehir|Alaşehir]], was about seventy miles inland from Ephesus. The name means “brotherly love.” The city derived its name, not from a reputation for brotherly love among its inhabitants, but from its founder, King Attalus II Philadelphus, who ruled the region from 159 to 138 B.C. He was so named because of his devotion to his brother. Philadelphia was a very Hellenistic culture; it could be considered a “Little Athens”.  In addition to being an agricultural center, Philadelphia was a producer of leather goods and textiles. It also served as a commercial link between other cities. Like Sardis, Philadelphia was devastated by the earthquake of 17 A.D. Located right on the fault, it is said to have suffered after-shocks for twenty years. This final recording of the city keeps to a theme in the book of Revelation of sevens.  Seven is a symbol of completion.  

Philadelphia’s church had been faithful in spite of persecution, hence Christ’s words: “...he who is true.” Christ continues his description of himself with a quote from Isaiah: “…he who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens” (3:7). If this message follows the pattern of the others, these words had a special meaning for Philadelphia in some way, but it is no longer clear how.

As the greeting is positive, so is the message. The church at Philadelphia was doing the best job of the seven. In application, it represents the faithful churches of all ages, and the message is for them. The key of David is a messianic title from Isaiah 22:22. &quot;He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens&quot; means that whatever the Lord ordains cannot be negated by the actions of man.  This passage is offering the followers of Christ a place of honor and security in the presence of God as well as showing the sovereignty and power of God in his ability to open doors and close doors that man are unable to do for themselves.  

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it, for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Jesus is commending the church for their works. They have kept their doctrine pure and have not failed to spread the gospel. &quot;A little strength&quot; is all the Lord asks of mortal man. He knows we have not the power to change the world, He is satisfied if we only give love and good testimony to our neighbor. Because the church has done well, Jesus promises that He will empower them. He is saying that their efforts will be fruitful, and their witness will not be in vain.

This metaphor of a door is a recurring theme throughout The Bible.  See 1 Cor 16.9 and 2 Cor 2.12.  For more extensive commentary on the metaphor, see Rev 3.20.

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews and are not, but lie, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' At some level, John is drawing a connection between Satan the Jewish community Smyrna. It is, however, difficult to assess how literally this is to be read. It has been asserted that Satan worship may have taken place in the synagogue, though it seems more likely that the actions the author is referring to are &quot;of Satan,&quot; considering his previous use of such syntax.  Additionally, if John is not directly referencing Romans 9.6, then the spirit of it seems to be present when he refers to Jews that are inauthentic. The passage in Romans indicates that not all of Abraham's descendants are true Jews.  This verse is also looking to illustrate that Jews will soon be sorry and will in the end understand that the Christians were the ones that were truly faithful.  However, many Christians at this time considered themselves Jews still since organized Christianity was widely persecuted in this time period.  Therefore, they are being accused of falsely being under the title of a Jew and hiding their true faith from the public.  This was an action to be reprimanded by New Testament standards since it would appear that they were ashamed of their faith.

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which will come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' This verse is cited by believers in the ''Rapture'' as evidence for their belief. The &quot;hour of temptation&quot; indicates far more than a mere sixty minute time span. It is an extended period of worldwide tribulation (Greek peirasmos) which has not yet occurred (Daniel 12:1, Matthew 24:21, 29). The word &quot;from&quot; is the Greek ''ek'', meaning &quot;out of&quot;. Thus, the verse is promising that true believers, that is those who adhere to the Word, will be removed (raptured) from the world before the Tribulation Period begins. Not all Christian sects believe this, and other interpretations are possible. One of these interpretations could be such that God is coming down to &quot;protect&quot; his followers, rather than coming to take them off to Heaven.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Behold, I come quickly. Hold fast what you have, so that no one take your crown.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Assuming Verse 10 does refer to a Rapture event, the promise in Verse 11 must refer to that event and not the final return to establish the Millennial Kingdom. Terms like &quot;shortly&quot; and &quot;quickly&quot; are not to be understood as &quot;tomorrow&quot;. God's time frame is not that of man.

This reference to a Rapture event coincides with the belief that after the second-coming of Christ, a period of great turmoil will ensue. The writer is urging the reader (in this case, the church) to stay true to God even in that time of great distress so that no one (not even the &quot;anti-Christ&quot;) will be able to take away God's plan of salvation for His believers.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Him that overcomes will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out no more, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is the new Jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' The church in Philadelphia has indeed been a &quot;pillar,&quot; surviving to the present day in spite of the advance of Islam. The believer is promised a place of service and honor before God. The threefold reference to the Name constitutes a guarantee of eternal security and citizenship in the Kingdom of God.

''&quot;I will write upon him the name of my God..., and I will write upon him my new name&quot;:'' Compare 2:17  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_2#Verse_17]. Later in Revelation, John describes a vision of Jesus and says, “He had a name written that no one knew except himself... and his name is called the Word of God” (Rev 19:12-13) [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_19#Verses_12-13]. The &quot;name&quot; and the &quot;Word&quot; are therefore one. The Word is not a written or spoken word, nor ''can'' it be written or spoken. &quot;Word&quot; and &quot;name&quot; are simply terms which are used to denote a spiritual reality, in the same way that the word &quot;cup&quot; represents an object, but the word &quot;cup&quot; itself is not the object. It is simply what we call it. So it is with the &quot;Word&quot; and the &quot;name&quot; of God. In John 1:1, we read that the Word (and therefore the &quot;name&quot; of God) is both ''with'' God, and ''is'' God. The Gospel of John says that &quot;the Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (Jn 1:14). The terms &quot;name&quot; and &quot;Word,&quot; then, both refer to the spirit of God which was embodied in Jesus. This spiritual name of God will eventually be revealed, however, for as this verse says, &quot;I will write upon him the name of my God.&quot; Similarly, in chapter 22, John says that &quot;[God's] name will be on their foreheads” (Rev 22:4) [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_22#Verses_3-4]. 

These passages, when taken together, indicate that God's people will be given the ability to experience his presence directly, and spiritually, within themselves. They will be connected to him externally through the Incarnation, but will also be connected to him internally through the knowledge of his true name, the revealed Spirit of God. Jesus said, “The kingdom of God does not come with observation, nor will they say, ‘Look here!’ or ‘Look there!’ for, indeed, the kingdom of God is within you” (Lk 17:20-21). The opening of a pathway to a direct experience of the Spirit within us is also what is meant by the promise to the church at Pergamos that God's people will &quot;eat of the hidden manna,&quot; and God will reveal to them a name &quot;which no one knows except he who receives it&quot; (2:17) [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_2#Verse_17]. Since the name is a spiritual experience and cannot be written or spoken, only the one who receives it can know it. The phrase used here, &quot;I will write upon him the name of my God,&quot; is therefore a figure of speech which is used to denote a spiritual experience which will be imparted by the Lord to his disciples. He will, in fact, reveal himself to them -- not his physical self, but his spiritual self which cannot be seen with physical eyes. Those who receive his &quot;name&quot; will have the ability to remain in constant spiritual communion with him. 

Jesus' spiritual form, then, is referred to as the Name (or the Word) of God, and this and other passages indicate that it will be revealed to those who sincerely seek him. The moment of initiation, when the Name is revealed to the seeker, may be the ''sealing'' of believers referred to in Rev 7:1-3 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_7#Verses_1-3] and 9:4 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_9#Verses_3-6]. It also may be equivalent to the baptism of the Holy Spirit of apostolic times (cf. Mk 1:8; Acts 8:17; etc.), though it probably does not equate to the usage of that phrase in church circles today, which more often denotes the working of grace in a believer's life, or an isolated experience of the &quot;infilling&quot; of the Spirit, rather than an open door into the experience of the Holy Spirit within the believer.

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' As before, this phrase means the reader is to understand and obey these prophecies.

==The Message to the Church at Laodicea==

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' The last of the seven churches which Jesus addresses in Revelation is [[w:Laodicea|Laodicea]]. Laodicea was situated about a hundred miles inland from Ephesus in the Lycus River valley near Hierapolis and Colossae. Its ruins can be found near the modern Turkish town of Eskihisar. Colossae and Hierapolis were neighbors of Laodicea, and there was much communication between the churches in these cities. Paul writes in his epistle to the Colossians, “Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea” (Col. 4:16). Unfortunately, the epistle to Laodicea which Paul mentions has not been preserved for us. It probably disappeared along with the church to which it was addressed.

Laodicea was founded by the Seleucid king, Antiochus II, who controlled the area between 261 and 246 B.C. He named the city for his wife, Laodice, who ironically was later responsible for his death, after he divorced her and married another woman for political reasons. The city was situated on a busy trade route which was largely responsible for its considerable prosperity. This prosperity was such that after suffering extensive damage in the earthquake of 60 A.D., the city refused an offer of assistance from Rome and rebuilt the city using money from its own coffers. It was a major banking center, and Cicero himself is said to have cashed drafts there en route to Cilicia in 51 B.C. Jaodicea was also famous for it's medical schooling. 

The special use of &quot;Amen&quot; here means &quot;He who is&quot;, and is comparable to the Hebrew Yahweh meaning &quot;I Am&quot;.

===Verses 15-16===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would you were cold or hot.&lt;/font&gt; ''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;So then because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Hierapolis had hot mineral water believed to be medicinal, while Colossae was famed for its cold, pure water. Laodicea's water had to be delivered by aqueduct, and therefore arrived lukewarm, so Jesus' words, again, have special meaning for the church in question, which had the show of faith, but no genuine belief. Because the church was paying no more than lip service to God, attempting to justify their lack of spirituality and depending upon their self-righteousness, Christ says He has no prerogative, but to &quot;spew them out&quot;, or eject them from His presence. This oft-cited verse has been interpreted in many contemporary circles that God disapproves of half-done attempts, asserting that God would prefer no action (cold water) than a listless attempt (lukewarm water). While this could be the case, the historical context seems to allude to a sense of functionality. Considering the hot mineral water in Hierapolis and pure water of Colossae, lukewarm water would serve no useful function in the hot, arid climate of Asia Minor. In his 2003 commentary ''Revelation'', Ben Witherington III writes, &quot;Just across from Laodicea the hot springs went over limestone cliffs and became lukewarm and brackish. Anyone drinking it would spit it out. The imagery seems to be pointedly directed toward the audience's life situation...The Laodiceans are faulted for being neither hot nor cold.&quot;

===Verses 17-18===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Because you say, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,” and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked,&lt;/font&gt; ''''' &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments, so that you may be clothed and the shame of your nakedness not appear. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Jesus alludes to several things for which the city was famous: its wealth, its medical center and school (it was particularly famous for its eye salve), and its textile industry (famous for its black wool, from which were made clothes and carpets). He counsels the church there to buy &quot;gold tried in the fire&quot; and &quot;white garments,&quot; and &quot;anoint their eyes with eye salve&quot; in order to see their true condition. 

The church members thought that, because they were well off and had no physical problems, they were well with God too. Jesus tells them that their wealth is nothing to Him, and that their faithless church is unacceptable. &quot;Gold tried in the fire&quot; means true belief and faith, which gains acceptance in heaven.  This claim that Laodicea is rich and has no needs, physically and offers that Laodicea is poor and naked spiritually.  But through relationship in Christ Jesus one is cleaned, made new, and dressed in white clothes (cross-reference to Revelation 3:4).

The phrase &quot;buy from me gold tried in the fire&quot; in verse 18 is likely an idiom for removing sins from one's life.   See Proverbs 27.21.  The metaphor of a commercial transaction is strong because the city was known for its manufacturing abilities.

===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:''It is in this verse that the readers understand why Jesus deals firmly with the Laodicean church. He is jarring the church in order to get their attention. His strong statements in the previous verses were not words of constant condemnation, but a loving rebuke. Jesus sheds light on their true heart conditions. Even though the church as a whole was unacceptable, Jesus still holds out His hand. He loves those who would follow Him, and tells them what they need to do in order to regain His favor.  This illustrates that a Christian who has stumbled need never feel hopeless.

===Verse 20===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' This evangelistic invitation is one of the most quoted verses in the Bible. Jesus offers salvation and eternal life to everyone, regardless of their station in life. To dine together is to be accepted into His Kingdom; not simply as someone &quot;allowed&quot; in, but as someone who enjoys the full blessings of belonging to His &quot;family&quot;, as it were.  This is an invitation into a personal fellowship with Jesus Christ.  But, in order to follow Jesus Christ one must invite him in.  Unlike in verse 7, man has control of opening and shutting the door as salvation never occurs against one’s own will. However, many may argue that using this scripture to merely preach a salvation message would be taking it out of context. It is important to also note that in this verse Jesus is addressing a lukewarm church. The reader is provided with a pictorial representation of Jesus standing outside the Laodicean church and knocking. God exhorts the lukewarm church community to renew their covenant with Him, to restore the great intimacy that was once there, and to become zealous for Him, again.  He should have never been &quot;kicked out&quot; of the &quot;church,&quot; (ekklesia (Greek): “an assembly”-- The root meaning of “church” is not a structural building, but a representation of the people), a place where His presence belongs and should be welcomed.

===Verse 21===
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;  '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me on my throne, even as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne.&lt;/font&gt; '''''  

''Commentary:'' Again we have a clear statement that Jesus Christ is the speaker, and that He wields the full authority of the Godhead. Jesus overcame death and hell when He shed His blood to redeem mankind from sin. Now He holds His rightful position, and promises that those who have saving faith will share it with Him.

Possibly another reference to a Rapture event. Those that have faith and overcome what his happen after the second-coming of Christ, will be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.

===Verse 22===
:&lt;sup&gt;22 &lt;/sup&gt; '''''&lt;font color=red&gt;He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&lt;/font&gt; '''''

''Commentary:'' This concludes the letters to the seven churches. The reader is advised to understand and obey what has been written. Take note that these letters continue the trend of the number seven used throughout the book of Revelation.

These seven letters have given the reader a glimpse into the situations of first century churches.  They faced problems both within and outside of their walls: false prophets, eating meat in the presence of idols, relationships with the Jewish communities, and emperor worship.  Also the composition of the congregations varied widely, from the very poor to the upper classes of society.  In the absence of great leaders like John and Paul, many were stumbling. These letters also provide glimpses into church life today.  There are internal and external issues as we struggle to get along with each other and the secular world at our doorsteps.  These letters still hold wisdom, guidance, and warnings for the church of the here and now.

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Indicate the identifiers, keywords, and special constants in the following piece of code. What is the value of the second &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;
  val a = 5
  val b = 9
  val a = 2*a+b;
The identifiers are &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;. The keywords are &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. The special constants are &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. The value of the second &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is 19.

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Construct a tuple with 4 positions and 3 components.&lt;/i&gt;
  (1,1,2,3)
is a simple one but this one is also valid
  (1,false,(3,2),1)

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;What is the type of t?&lt;/i&gt;
  fun f (a:int) = 2
  val t = (true,f,f 1);
Well the answer is
  bool * (int -&gt; int) * int

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Write a function that returns the value 2 for the arguments 0, 1 and 2 and returns 3 for all other arguments.&lt;/i&gt;
 fun example(0) = 2
   | example(1) = 2
   | example(2) = 2
   | example(_) = 3;
or 
 fun example(x:int) = if (x&gt;2) then 3 else if (x&lt;0) then 3 else 2;

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Write a function that returns -1 for all negative and +1 for all positive arguments and 0 for the argument 0.
 fun example(x:int) = if (x=0) then 0 else if (x&lt;0) then ~1 else 1;&lt;/i&gt;
One might try to use pattern matching like in the example above but &quot;~&quot; is an operator and thus can not be used in an argument pattern.

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Create a function min(a:int,b:int) that returns the smaller one of its 2 arguments. Do the separation of the argument values in 3 different ways. Using a cartesian argument-pattern, using a projection and using a local declaration.&lt;/i&gt;

Using a cartesian arument-pattern
 fun min(a,b) = if (a&lt;b) then a else b;

Using a projection. Here we have to note the argument type as a 2-tuple of int*int. The value t will hold the whole  tuple and thus for comparation it must be split up again.
 fun min(t:int*int) = if (#1t &lt; #2t) then #1t else #2t;

Using a local declaration. 
 fun min(t:int*int) = let val (a,b)=t in if (a&lt;b) then a else b end;

=Recursion=
&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Create a function power9(x) that calculates the 9th power of x. Preferably using as few multiplications as possible.&lt;/i&gt;

The straight forward way to do this is could be:
 fun power9(x) = x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x;
But thats no clever way and it also uses lots of multiplication. We could use local declarations inside the function to shorten the code and make it more readable.
  fun power9(x) = 
  let
    val a=x*x 
    val b=a*a 
  in 
    b*b*x 
  end;
or we could use helper-functions to calculate the partial products.
 fun power2(x) = x*x;
 fun power4(x) = power2(x)*power2(x);
 fun power9(x) = power4(x)*power4(x)*x;
But that still isnt really smart. We would have to write lots of code for a function like power66(). The following code uses recursive function calls to calculate the n-th power of x.
 fun power(x,n) = if (n=0) then 1 else power(x,n-1)*x;
which could be rewritten as
 fun power(x,0) = 1
   | power(x,n) = power(x,n-1)*x;

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Calculate the greatest common denominator from 2 positive integer arguments.&lt;/i&gt;

Using [[:w:Euclids_algorithm|euclids algorithm]] we construct the recursive function
 fun gcd(a,0) = a
   | gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a-b*(a div b));

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Calculate mul(n,z)=n*z without using the * operator for &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

 fun mul(n:int, z:int) = if (n=1) then z else z + mul(n-1,z);

 fun h(a:int, n:int, z:int) = if (n=1) then z + a else h(a+z,n-1,z);
 fun mul(n:int, z:int) = h(0,n,z);

&lt;u&gt;'''Problem:'''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Calculate power2(n) by only using addition and resursion. (hint: it is possible to rewrite the square function as a summation of natural numbers.)&lt;/i&gt;

The sum to be calculated is &lt;math&gt; power2(n) = \sum_{k=n}^{1}2*n-1&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum on the n first odd Elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Or on other words &lt;math&gt;power2(n) = 1 + 3 + \dots + 2*n-1&lt;/math&gt;.

 fun power2(1) = 1
   | power2(n) = n+n-1 + power2(n-1);

The articles linked to on the main page of Hindi wikibooks are unorganized, broken and non-standard in various ways (transliteration for example). So I'd be working on a totally separate version (of course using already available matter after some organizing). The transliteration to be used would be strictly ISO 15919. The book itself will be first produced as online and once first draft is ready it could be compiled into pdf. I plan on using the current pdf revision of German wikibook. Currently the table of contents is supposed to be like this. If you want to lend a hand please edit.

== Hindi ==

On my en.wikipedia talk page you wrote
:I've been doing some work on the Hindi wikibooks and I came across an article by you which uses and advocates iTrans transliteration scheme while IAST/ISO 15919 is becoming the de facto standard and is accepted by over 158 institutions. For somebody starting out it might be harder to read than iTrans, but it provides accurate pronunciation while there's no guarantee of the same in iTrans. Oh btw I was hoping I could get some help from you arranging the articles over there :)
I don't recall writing that specifically, but iTrans is very simple for beginners and doesn't require any special fonts. I also can't think of a situation where iTrans is phonetically inaccurate, but I'm no expert on the transcription systems. All I know is different books use different systems unfortunately, and some even invent their own. In any case the most important thing for Wikibooks is to be consistent. I do need to help out more over here, I haven't been that active in my Hindi learning lately, but I have quite a large number of resources. Some of them I downloaded for free and I can point you to. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 13:38, 17 April 2010 (UTC)
It's fine if you'd like to reply here on Wikibooks I'll keep track of this. For resources, archive.org has a lot of scanned books on hindi grammar and such and google books has a few more that I didn't see in there. Search each for Hindi or Hindi grammar and you'll find quite a few. I've also had very good luck getting books from interlibrary loan, and have gotten some good Hindi grammar and Hindi teaching books that way. [http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/LANGUAGELEARNING/LanguageLearning.htm Here] is a link to a list of some really good articles on language learning in general which can help in writing a really good Hindi Wikibook. Of the articles linked from there [http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/LANGUAGELEARNING/EssaysOnFieldLanguageLearning/KickStrtngYrLnggLrnng/contents.htm this one] is very good. And yes most of the material here is very amateur or poorly organized. I imported some of the material from another source that gave permission and he admitted to not having polished it up much. It may be better to start from scratch as you have been doing, and only take ideas from the other materials. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] ([[User talk:Taxman|talk]]) 17:03, 17 April 2010 (UTC)

I'm currently working on some grammar article, Verbs to be more specific. Once it is finished I'd look up the stuff you've linked me to. And I thought starting from scratch would be cumbersome but once looked through all the articles here I saw no other alternative option for a quality wikibook. Btw the first draft of some of my articles are ready so it'd be really nice of you if you can review them and give any suggestions. They of course, are just draft version, and will undergo editing for formatting and the text itself. But let me know what'd you think of them as a starting base.

==Professional Development in Computer Security==

===Introduction===

The administrators and users of a computer network represent the greatest vulnerability to the system (Lehtinen, Russell &amp; Gangemi, 2006).&lt;ref name = &quot;lehtinen&quot;&gt; Lehtinen, R., Russell, D., and Gangemi, G.T. (2006). Computer security basics. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the strongest defenses against compromised security is to train and inform the staff of an institution. This chapter will focus on why users pose a large threat; it will also expand on many topics that can be the focus of professional development. These topics include but are not limited to explaining an institution's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in plain English, explaining proper system access etiquette and the description of a phishing scam.

===The Weakest Link===

[[File:Chain_1.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Figure 1]]

The ''human factor'' in information security is known as the weakest link in computer security (Schneier, 2000) &lt;ref name = &quot;schneier&quot;&gt; Schneier, B. (2000). Secrets and lies. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Many security breaches occur as a social engineering attack. “In this type of attack, an attacker uses human interaction (social skills) to obtain or compromise information about an organization or its computer systems”(Schneier, 2000. pg. 266)&lt;ref name = &quot;schneier&quot;/&gt;. An example of using social skills to attack a network might be for an attacker to send an e-mail to the employees of an institution telling them to &lt;u&gt;clickhere.exe&lt;/u&gt; and receive a $10 coupon to a local coffee shop. The user will open the e-mail and download the attachment. At this time, a virus or a worm may be infecting their computer and since the user's computer is networked, the entire network may be infected in a matter of minutes. The link that was downloaded and caused an entire network to go down for hours or days may have been saved if the user was educated on how a virus comes to them from an external source. 

Like Figure 1, security is a chain, but if any of the links in that chain are broken, the entire system may be vulnerable (Schneier, 2000)&lt;ref name = &quot;schneier&quot;/&gt; experts in the field believe that social engineering will always work because humans inherently want to trust. Humans will trust if they believe that the ‘attack’ is coming from one of their contacts or friends. A good example of this was the “ILOVEYOU worm of the 1990s cloaking itself in an e-mail from people the recipient knew” (Schneier, 2000, pg. 268)&lt;ref name = &quot;schneier&quot;/&gt;. Future attackers will come up with new and creative ways of hiding viruses and worms. Scam artists will develop new ways of receiving personal information from people in the digital world. The key to protecting a system is to continually educate the users giving them up-to-date information.

==Training Topics==

==='''Acceptable Use Policies ''In Plain English'''''===


Before a staff member is asked to read and sign an institution's AUP, it is a good idea to share real-world examples with them. Professional development opportunities during the school year provide time for administrators or presenters to share incidents that may have occurred at neighboring educational institutions. This technique may allow staff members to understand where many of the policies originate from when creating the district's AUP.

Some Acceptable Use Policies use vocabulary terms that can be confusing to users. The following section defines some confusing terms.

====Vocabulary====
1. '''Executable Files'''

An executable file is any file that ends with the extension of '.exe'.  When a user clicks on an 'exe' file, a built-in routine automatically executes code that can set several functions into motion. Exe files are used to install and run programs and routines (Kayne, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Kayne, R. (2010). What is an EXE file?. ''WiseGeeks.'' Retrieved from http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-exe-file.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Executable files are particularly dangerous because a virus or a worm can infect your computer through this application.


2. '''Virus'''

A Computer Virus is a program that can copy itself and infect a computer without the permission or knowledge of the user. A Computer Virus has two major characteristics: the ability to replicate itself, and the ability to attach itself to another computer file. Every file or program that becomes infected can also act as a Virus itself, allowing it to spread to other files and computers (Antivirus Ware, 2010). &lt;ref name = &quot;virus&quot;&gt; Antivirus Ware. (2010). What is a computer virus? ''Antivirus Ware''. Retrieved from http://www.antivirusware.com/articles/computer-virus.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;. Viruses behave in different ways. Some viruses stay active only when the application it is part of is running. Turn the computer off and the virus is inactive. Other viruses will operate every time you turn on your computer after infecting a system file or network. 

'''The following ways are suggestions to limit how viruses infect a computer''' (Myron, n.d.)  &lt;ref name = &quot;virus_1&quot;&gt; Myron, H. (n.d.) What is a computer virus? ''Newton''. Retrieved from http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/teachers/compvir.htm &lt;/ref&gt;''':'''

-Load only software from original disks or CD's. Pirated or copied software is always a risk for a virus. (This is why your school district's network administrator might not allow you to load your own software).
 
-Execute only programs of which you are familiar as to their origin. (Programs sent by email should always be suspicious).
 
-Computer uploads and &quot;system configuration&quot; changes should always be performed by the person who is responsible for the computer. Password protection should be employed. (This is usually done by district professionals).
 
-Check all shareware and free programs downloaded from on-line services with a virus checking program.
 
-Purchase a virus program that runs as you boot or work your computer. Up-date it frequently. (Your school district takes care of this already).


3. '''Other Types of Malware'''

Examples: Worms, spyware and trojan horses.

-A '''worm''' is an independent program that reproduces by copying itself from one computer to another, usually over a network (large concern for a school district). Like a virus, a worm worstens the damage it does by spreading quickly from one site to another. Unlike a virus, which attaches itself to a host program, a worm keeps its independence; it usually does not modify other programs (Lehtinen et al., 2006). &lt;ref name = &quot;lehtinen&quot;/&gt;. 

-'''Spyware''' can detect and report a user's activity of a computer and/or the internet (Lehtinen et al., 2006). &lt;ref name = &quot;lehtinen&quot;/&gt;. Your school dsitrct most likely employs these programs to monitor the use of district equipment and the use of the internet. A specific type of spyware, called a keylogger can actually record the strokes of the keyboard that the user inputs. When in the wrong hands, a keylogger can capture sensitive information, including passwords.

-'''Trojan horses''' are named due to its method of getting past computer defenses by pretending to be something useful (Lehtinen et al., 2006). &lt;ref name = &quot;lehtinen&quot;/&gt;. When the computer lets the program in, it unleashes its malicious code.

For more information, please refer to another chapter in this Wikibook, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Malicious_Software Malicious software]

===System Access Etiquette===

Have you ever logged onto your district's computer and then walked away to do other things? If you answered yes, you may be putting your information and/or the network at risk. Once a computer is logged on, an unauthorized user does not have to go through the process of trying to guess a password. An unauthorized user may change a grade, write an e-mail posing as the authorized user, upload a malicious program, install spyware type software, or the unauthorized user may delete important information from the authorized user's account.

Lehtinen et al. (2006). &lt;ref name = &quot;lehtinen&quot;/&gt;. has some suggestions on how users can be the first defense to the network:

-Protect your password and do not display it.

-Create a healthy length for a password. (For more on this, please refer to another chapter of this Wikibook, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Authentication Safeguarding passwords for today's technology]. 

-Refrain from using a district account for personal use (social networking- Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, online shopping, personal communication, etc...)

-Do not allow a user to use a computer you have already logged into.

-Log out of applications when finished using them.

-Log out of computer while not in the classroom.

-Refrain from logging into more than one station.

-Do not open any attachment with the file extension (.exe) because it is an executable file and may harm your computer or the entire network. Recall the definition of an executable file in the vocabulary section of this chapter.

[[File:phishing.JPG|right|thumb|300px]]

-Do not respond to any e-mails asking for sensitive information such as your password, phone number and/or address. For more on this, please refer to the phishing section in this chapter.

-Report any suspicious e-mails, unauthorized changes of protected information, and monitor student use of system.

===Phishing===

A specific type of social engineering attack can occur digitally by the use of phishing. “Phishing attacks use email or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization” (McDowell, 2004, para. 2) &lt;ref name = &quot;phishing&quot;&gt; McDowell, M. (2004). National Cyber Alert System. Retrieved from http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html &lt;/ref&gt;. Some trustworthy organizations can include charity foundations, educational institutions, and/or health-related establishments. Users of a district's network need to be particularly aware of phishing scams. A phishing scam will most likely come to the user through e-mail. A sender might ask for sensitive information such as the recipient's username, password, phone number, address, etc. Users should NEVER give out this sensitive information. All phishing type e-mails need to be reported to your network administrator immediately because you may avoid the scam, but your colleagues may not.

**For T1N0 worse outcome (ACR 2007): 5-year local control ~70% (vs 80-90% with RT), 5-year OS ~50% (vs 90-100% with RT)
**For T1N0 well-differentiated, anal margin (NCCN v1.2010): May be considered
*APR
**5-year OS ~50%
**Toxicity: permanent colostomy
*Surgery vs chemo-RT
**No randomized trials
**Swedish cohort data support better outcomes with chemo-RT

==Non-surgical approaches==
*RT alone
**Control rate depends on size of primary
**Tumors &lt;4 cm and cN0 have excellent 10-year local control (85-90%) and overall survival (~80%)
**Larger tumors have only ~60% local control rate and ~50% overall survival
*Chemo-RT vs RT alone
**2 trials (UKCCCR, EORTC), mostly in T3-T4 or N+ patients
**No difference in overall survival; UKCCCR improved cancer-specific survival. 5-year OS ~55%
**Local control benefit: 40-50% to 65%
**Colostomy-free benefit: 40% to 70%
*Chemo-RT: chemo options
**RTOG 8704 (Flam) +/- Mitomycin
***Worse colostomy without MMC: 4-year MMC- 22% vs MMC+ 9% (SS)
***Worse DFS without MMC: 4-year 51% vs 73% (SS); no difference in OS
**RTOG 9811 (Ajani, update Gunderson) Induction/concurrent 5-FU + cisplatin vs concurrent 5-FU + Mitomycin
***Worse local control: cisplatin 67% vs Mitomycin 75%; colostomy rate 19% vs 10% (SS)
***No impact on survial on initial analysis: 5-year OS 70-75%
***However on update (Gunderson): DFS and OS were statistically better for RT + FU/MMC versus RT + FU/CDDP (5-year DFS, 67.8% v 57.8%; P = .006; 5-year OS, 78.3% v 70.7%; P = .026). There was a trend toward statistical significance for CFS (P = .05), LRF (P = .087), and CF (P = .074).
***Uncreal whether worse outcomes due to induction or due to cisplatin
*Chemo-RT: RT options
**RTOG 92-08 (Konski) split course to 59.6 Gy
***Worse colostomy-free survival and DFS
**RTOG 0529 (Kachnic) IMRT with concurrent 5-FU/mitomycin-C:
***77% experienced grade 2+ gastrointestinal/genitourinary acute AEs (9811 77%). There was, however, a significant reduction in acute grade 2+ hematologic, 73% (9811 85%, P=.032), grade 3+ gastrointestinal, 21% (9811 36%, P=.0082), and grade 3+ dermatologic AEs 23% (9811 49%, P&lt;.0001) with DP-IMRT. On initial pretreatment review, 81% required DP-IMRT replanning, and final review revealed only 3 cases with normal tissue major deviations.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Anal Cancer Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt; (in process of being cross-linked)


==Primary RT vs. Chemo-RT==
*'''EORTC''' (1987-1994) -- RT vs chemo-RT
**Randomized. 110 patients, epidermoid ca of the anal canal or anal margin. T3-4N0-3 or T1-2N1-3. Treated with Arm 1) RT 45/25, if CR/PR then RT boost 15-20 Gy after 6 weeks or 2) RT 45/25 + CI 5-FU 750 mg/m2 + Mitomycin 15 mg/m2 single bolus
**'''1997''' PMID 9164216 -- &quot;Concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locally advanced anal cancer: results of a phase III randomized trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Radiotherapy and Gastrointestinal Cooperative Groups.&quot; (Bartelink H, J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):2040-9.)
***Outcome: Local control RT 50% vs. CRT 68% (SS); colostomy-free survival RT 40% vs. CRT 72% (SS); 5-year OS: 56% (NS)
***Toxicity: no difference in severe side effects, but anal ulcers more frequent in CRT
***Conclusion: Chemo-RT improves local control and colostomy-free survivial, no impact on overall survival, with comparable toxicity

*'''UKCCCR''' (1987-1994) -- RT vs chemo-RT
**Randomized. 585 patients. 40% with large T3 or T4, 20% N+. Treated with 1)RT 45/20 or 45/25 depending on institutional preference or 2) same RT + CI 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 + Mitomycin 12 mg bolus. Clinical response at 6 weeks, responders RT 15 Gy boost or 25 Gy boost via Ir-192 BT, non-responders salvage surgery. Primary endpoint local failure
**'''1996''' PMID 8874455 -- &quot;Epidermoid anal cancer: results from the UKCCCR randomized trial of radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, and mitomycin. UKCCCR Anal Cancer Trial Working Party. UK Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research.&quot; (No Authors, Lancet. 1996 Oct 19;348(9034):1049-54.) Median F/U 3.5 years
***Outcome: Local control RT alone 41% vs. chemo-RT 64% (SS) for 46% risk reduction. 3-year CSS 72% vs 61% (SS); 3-year OS 58% vs 65% (NS). 65% died with locoregional disease, 40% with mets
***Toxicity: Acute worse with chemo-RT, but late similar
***Conclusion: Combined chemo-RT should be standard treatment
**'''2010''' PMID 20354531 -- &quot;Chemoradiation for the treatment of epidermoid anal cancer: 13-year follow-up of the first randomised UKCCCR Anal Cancer Trial (ACT I).&quot; (Northover J, British Journal of Cancer. 2010  Mar 30;102(7):1123-8. Epub 2010 Mar 16.)
***Outcome: Absolute reduction of 25% in LRR (SS). Anal cancer death was reduced by 12.5% (SS). 9.1% increase in non-anal cancer deaths in the first 5 years of chemoradiation, which disappeared by 10 years.
***Conclusion: The clear benefit of chemoradiation outweighs an early excess risk of non-anal cancer deaths, and can still be seen 12 years after treatment.

==Primary Chemo-RT: Chemo comparisons==
*'''UK ACT II''' (2001-2008) -- 2x2: RT + 5-FU + mitomycin vs cisplatin; observation vs maintenance cisplatin + 5-FU
**Randomized, 2x2. 940 patients, 15% anal margin, LN+ 30%. Arm 1) RT 50.4/28 + 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 D1-4 and D29-32 + cisplatin 60 mg/m2 D1 and D29 vs Arm 2) Same RT and 5-FU + Mitomycin 12 mg/m2 D1. Then randomized for maintenance chemo Arm 1) cisplatin + 5-FU x2 cycles vs Arm 2) observation
**'''2009''' [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=65&amp;abstractID=30894 ASCO Abstract] -- &quot;A randomized trial of chemoradiation using mitomycin or cisplatin, with or without maintenance cisplatin/5FU in squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (ACT II).&quot; (James R, J Clin Oncol 27:18s, 2009 (suppl; abstr LBA4009)) Median F/U 3 years
***Outcome: Mitomycin vs cisplatin randomization: No difference in colostomy rate. Maintenance randomization: No difference in RFS (3-years 75%) or OS
***Toxicity: Acute Grade 3-4 hematologic MMC 25% vs cisplatin 13% (SS); non-hematologic no difference
***Conclusion: No difference. 5-FU and MMC with RT remains the standard of care

*'''RTOG 98-11 / Intergroup''' (1998-2005) -- Concurrent 5-FU/Mitomycin C vs. Induction/concurrent cisplatin/5-FU
**Randomized. 644 patients. Anal canal (squamous, basaloid, or cloacogenic), T2-T4, any N (by clinical, imaging, or biopsy). AIDS patients excluded. Arm 1) Concurrent 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 + Mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 + RT vs. Arm 2) Induction cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + 5-FU C.I. 1000 mg/m2 x2 cycles followed by concurrent cisplatin/5-FU (same doses) + RT
**RT: large pelvic field (top border at L5/S1) to 30.6 Gy, with field reduction to bottom of SI joints for additional 14.4 Gy (to 45 Gy). Boost tumor + LN for T3, T4, or N+, or residual after 45 Gy for additional 10-14 Gy (2 Gy/fx) for total of 55-59 Gy. Use 2-2.5 cm margin for boost. Inferior field includes anus and tumor with margin of 2.5 cm. AP/PA or 4 field box. AP field includes inguinals. PA field extends laterally to 2cm beyond sciatic notch. Inguinal field: electrons to divergence of PA field; 36 Gy if N0, or 45 Gy if N+; depth measured by CT but at least 3cm depth. Inguinal boost with electrons. May have 10 day break as needed. [http://www.rtog.org/ClinicalTrials/ProtocolTable/StudyDetails.aspx?action=openFile&amp;FileID=4700 98-11 Protocol (PDF)]
**'''5-years; 2008:''' PMID 18430910 &amp;mdash; &quot;Fluorouracil, Mitomycin, and Radiotherapy vs Fluorouracil, Cisplatin, and Radiotherapy for Carcinoma of the Anal Canal.&quot; (Ajani JA et al, JAMA. 2008 Apr 23;299(16):1914-1921.) Median F/U 2.5 years
***Outcome: 5-year DFS MMC 60% vs cisplatin 54% (NS); 5-year OS 75% vs 70% (p=0.10); LRR 25% vs 33%, DM 15% vs 19%. Worse colostomy rate: MMC 10% vs cisplatin 19% (SS). 
***Toxicity: Severe long-term toxicity similar (11% vs. 10%), higher severe hematologic toxicity with MMC.
***Conclusion: Trial findings do not support use of cisplatin instead of mitomycin

*'''RTOG 87-04''' (1988-1991) -- RT + 5-FU +/- Mitomycin
**Randomized. 291/310 patients. Treated with 1) RT 45-50.4 Gy + 5-FU + Mitomycin or 2) RT + 5-FU. Residual tumor on post-treatment bx salvaged with pelvic RT 9 Gy + 5-FU + cisplatin
**'''1996''' PMID 8823332 -- &quot;Role of mitomycin in combination with fluorouracil and radiotherapy, and of salvage chemoradiation in the definitive nonsurgical treatment of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal: results of a phase III randomized intergroup study.&quot; (Flam M, J Clin Oncol. 1996 Sep;14(9):2527-39.)
***Local control: post-treatment bx RT/5-FU 15% vs. RT/5-FU/MMC 8% (NS), 4-year colostomy rate 22% vs. 9% (SS), DFS 51% vs. 73% (SS)
***Toxicity: MMC arm 23% vs. 7% (SS)
***Conclusion: Despite greater toxicity, use of Mitomycin is justified</text>

==Essay on Sources==

Since this book is amply footnoted by chapter, this essay discusses only the collection of official and private documents and the major printed sources of information on the Department of the Navy to any researcher of Navy and Marine Corps history.

===Primary Sources===
====Organizational Records====
The basic collection of Marine Corps documents is the Records of the United States Marine Corps, Record Group (RG) 127, National Archive and Records Administration (NARA) of the United States, which covers the history of the Corps from its creation in 1798 through World War II (WWII). Physically, the records are at the National Archives building in downtown Washington, D.C., and the federal records center at Suitland, Maryland. Some of the WWII organizational records and the documents of Headquarters (HQ) staff sections, posts and stations, detachments and units of the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) since WWII remain in the hands of the Operational Archives Branch of the Marine Corps History and Museum Division at the Marine Corps Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard, the staff divisions of Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), and the HQ of Marine Corps posts and stations.

Within the RG 127, the most significant group of documents is the correspondence, issuance, and other records of the Office of the Commandant, 1798–1939, which also includes important collections of recruiting, operations, training, intelligence, and Marine Corps history. In the last-named category, one finds critical documents on Marine activities in the Philippines and China [1899–1901] and Marine Corps history between 1899 and the outbreak of WWII. For the internal management of the Corps during the 1798–1949 period, one should also consult the correspondence of the Adjutant and Inspector’s Department, which handled personnel matters for the Commandant and supervised the compliance with official orders. Also part of RG 127 are the records of the Paymaster’s Department [1808–1939] and the Quartermaster’s Department [1811–1942]. The same RG includes scattered records from Marine ships detachments and field organizations to WWII. The most important collections for Marine overseas organizations are the records of the Marine legation guard in Peking, the Marine units deployed to Cuba [1898–1912], the Marine brigade in Nicaragua and the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua [1927–1932]; the records of selected Marine detachments, organizations, and squadrons, during the interwar period; and the records of Marine defense battalions during WWII. All these records are described in Maizie Johnson, comp., ''Records of the United States Marine Corps'' (Washington, D.C.: The National Archives, 1970), supplemented by the announcements of accessions by the NARA.

The NARA also holds collections of Marine Corps maps and photographs. Both are identified as RG 127 in their respective National Archives divisions. The cartographic records are divided into three basic sub-collections: maps of Marine Corps bases, maps of geographic areas that interested Marine Corps planners up to WWII, and maps of Marine Corps operations in France in WWI. The photographic records are still photographs accessioned from the Marine Corps that portray Marine subjects through WWII. The History and Museum Division, however, still retains custody of many still photographs and the basic archives of Marine Corps motion pictures, as well as its own map collection.

RG 127 does not exhaust the relevant Marine collections in the NARA. Although there is some duplication in the records, one should consult the correspondence of the Secretary of the Navy with the Commandant of the Marine Corps and other Marine officers [1804–1886] in the General Records of the Department of the Navy, RG 80. In the same RG are additional Marine materials in the General File, Office of the Secretary of the Navy (SecNav) and Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) [1917–1919]; and the Confidential Correspondence, Chief of Naval Operations Planning Division to the Secretary of the Navy [1919–1926]. In addition, one should consult the Records of the Office of the CNO (RG 38) for the records of the Military Government of Santo Domingo [1916–1924]. Of special importance are the collected documents of the Naval Records Collection of the Office of Naval Records and Library (RG 45), which covers a variety of naval subjects up to WWII. In this collection, one finds the correspondence of the Board of Navy Commissioners to the SecNav, 1815–1842, and a variety of special subject files that deal with Marine activities. Among the latter are files “VR” (governmental relations: USMC), “OJ” (joint military and naval operations), “OH” (shore operations and landing parties), “VA” (Dept. of the Navy organization and administration), “NL” (naval personnel), “WA7” and “ZWA7” (Haiti and Santo Domingo), “ZK” (Marines in China). In creating RG 45, naval historians organized a special collection  of unpublished  histories, labeled the “Z” File, which includes material on Navy–Marine Corps activities, many written by participants. The holdings of the “Z” File are described in Operational Archives Branch, Naval Historical Division, Checklist: ''Unpublished Naval Histories in the “Z” File, Record Group 45, 1911–1927'' (Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Division, 1971).

Naval records outside the the custody of the NARA also yield substantial information on the history of the Marine Corps. The Operational Archives Branch of the Naval Historical Division, Washington Navy Yard, consults records of the General Board [1900–1947], selected documents from the Command File for the post-WWII period, the diaries of SecNav and Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, the papers of the CNO Forrest Sherman, the records of the Immediate Office of the CNO [1942–1950], the office files of the Deputy CNO (Air) [1942–1950]; and the Central Security-Classified Records of the Office of the CNO [1942–1947]. The Naval Historical Division also retains custody of a large collection of unpublished histories related to WWII that are described in Naval Historical Division, ''Guide to the United States Naval Administrative Histories of World War II'' (Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Division, 1976) and ''World War II Histories and Historical Reports in the U.S. Naval History Division'' (Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Division, 1972). Another significant source of documents are the copies of correspondence, reports, memoranda, newspaper clippings, photographs, and studies collected in the subject and biographical files of the Reference Section, History Branch, History and Museums Division of the Marine Corps, also located at the Marine Corps Historical Center.</text>

==Prologue==
[[File:Trireme.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=sketch of an ancient Greek sailing trireme with the sail extended|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[trireme]]]]
In the earliest days of [[naval warfare]], there was little distinction between [[sailor]]s and [[soldier]]s on a warship.

The [[Watercraft rowing|oarsmen]] of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ships had to be capable of fighting the rowers of opposing ships hand-to-hand&lt;ref&gt;[[Themistocles]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' XIV&lt;/ref&gt;. Though [[hoplite]]s began appearing on Greek ships specifically for the boarding of enemy ships.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Casson|first=Lionel|year=1991|title=The Ancient Mariners|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Princeton University]] Press|isbn=0-691-01477-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Navy]]'s two [[Roman legion|legions]], [[legio I Adiutrix|I ''Adiutrix'']] and [[legio II Adiutrix|II ''Adiutrix'']], were among the first distinct naval infantry units&lt;ref name=&quot;I Adiutrix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/i_adiutrix.html|title=Legio I Adiutrix| last=Lendering| first=Jona| authorlink=Jona Lendering| publisher=Livius.org| accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;II Adiutrix&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/ii_adiutrix.html| title=Legio II Adiutrix | last=Lendering |first=Jona| publisher=Livius.org| accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the origin of seafaring soldiers was lost throughout the archaic history of the world, being revived when the [[cannon]] became practical for use on naval vessels.

===Lord High Admiral's Regiment===
Perhaps the earliest lineal predecessor of the modern Marine Corps was the creation and evolution of [[w:Marine (military)|marines]] dating back the European naval wars during the [[w:16th century|16th]] and [[w:17th century|17th centuries]]. The monarchies of [[w:Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[w:France|France]], [[w:Spain|Spain]], and [[w:England|England]] all contended with each other in control over territorial water, which would increase naval organization and stability.&lt;ref name=Millet&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first organized corps of marines was created when [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] first assigned the naval infantry of the ''[[Spanish Navy Marines|Compañías Viejas del Mar de Nápoles]]'' ([[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] Sea Old Companies) to the Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterráneo ([[Mediterranean  Sea|Mediterranean]] [[Galley]] Squadrons) in 1537, progenitors of the current [[Spanish Navy Marines|Infantería de Marina]] corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistanaval.com/infanteriademarina/historia.htm|title=Historia  de La Infanteria de Marina|publisher=[[Spanish Navy Marines]]|language=[[Spanish language]]|accessdate=7  February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:James II of England|James II of England]], the brother of King [[w:Charles II|Charles II]], was confirmed as [[w:Lord High Admiral|Lord High Admiral]], an office that has authoritative responsibility over the British Crown's Navy.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The position at this time was exercised by a single person, usually an Admiral to oversee the structure and institution of naval affairs. As France and the Netherlands were opting to train seamen for infantry combat, England instead in 1664 formed a special regiment, the [[w:James II of England#Military and political offices|Duke of York and Albany's]] [[w:History of the Royal Marines|Maritime Regiment of Foot]], or also known as the &quot;Lord High Admiral's Regiment&quot;&lt;ref name=Field&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Lord High Admiral's Regiment saw action in the [[w:Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665–67), [[w:Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), and the [[w:Third Anglo-Dutch Waw|Anglo-Dutch War]] (1672–74). However, due to the [[w:Glorious Revolution|Glorious Revolution]] of 1688&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;, King James II was overthrown by [[w:Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], leading to the disbandment of the regiment.

Two years later, two new regiments were formed, the 1st and 2nd Regiment of Marines, their functions assumed the same roles as the subsequent marine regiments in the past; however the ensuing wars of the [[w:Second Hundred Years' War|Second Hundred Years' War]] (1689–1815), like the Royal Navy, the marine regiment would quickly dissolve only to be reassembled during the events of war.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;  The general military service type of &quot;marines&quot; first appeared throughout the Dutch and French wars, but the majority of the marine infantry regiments were perpetually drawn from the British Army; all the regiments had little permanence.

By 1702, during the [[w:War of the Spanish Succession|War of the Spanish Succession]] (1702–1714), the British government assembled six maritime regiments of foot for combative [[w:Naval Service|naval service]] with the fleet against Spain. But unlike the earlier campaigns from previous regiments of the past which British marines had fought as detachments aboard ships. In 1704, these marines found themselves fighting ashore the beaches of [[w:Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] and Spain as part of an amphibious assault [[w:Landing operation|landing force]], with the help of Dutch forces under the command of [[w:Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt|Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]]. By the time the war ended, once again the marine regiments were disbanded, or returned to fill the ranks of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-five years later in 1731, an incident involving master mariner [[w:Robert Jenkins|Robert Jenkins]],
an English captain of a British merchant ship, allegedly had his ear severed by Spanish [[w:coast guard|coast guardsmen]] off the coast of [[w:New Granada|New Granada]] (modern countries of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama), initiating the [[w:War of Jenkins' Ear|War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739–1742). This affair and a number of similar incidents sparked a war against the Spanish Empire.

Two companies of Marine Boatmen drawn from the [[w:Georgia Militia|Georgia Militia]], commanded by Captains [[w:Mark Carr|Mike Carr]] and [[w:Noble Jones|Noble Jones]] under General [[w:James Oglethorpe|James Oglethorpe]], helped in defeating an amphibious landing attempted by the [[w:Spain|Spanish]] on [[w:St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons Island]] in the [[w:Battle of Gully Hole Creek|Battle of Gully Hole Creek]] and the [[w:Battle of Bloody Marsh|Battle of Bloody Marsh]].



===Gooch's Marines===
The British government formed ten regiments of marines for a naval campaign against the Spanish colonies in the [[w:Caribbean|West Indies]] and north coast of [[w:South America|South America]]. [[w:Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[w:Edward Vernon|Edward Vernon]], a British naval officer, was given command of a squadron of five vessels. And again, most of the marines were drafted from the British Army. The British Admiralty requested that its [[w:Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] form a regiment of three thousand men for naval service aboard Admiral Edward Vernon's fleet. Edward Vernon can be considered by many military history enthusiasts the ''first'' naval fleet commander over American marines.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; The American colonial marines were raised in the [[w:colony of Virginia|colony of Virginia]] and from other [[w:Middle Colonies|Middle Colonies]], under the command of [[w:List of colonial governors of Virginia|Governor]] [[w:Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]].&lt;ref&gt;

Although it may had been composed of men from surrounding colonies intent for a Crown commission, it was also used as a dumping ground for its debtors, criminals, scoundrels, and vagrants. This &quot;four-battalion&quot; regiment, the [[w:43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd Regiment of Foot]], better known as &quot;Gooch's Marines&quot;, has a lineage that can be traced to the origin of the United States Marine Corps.&lt;ref&gt;

On 21 November 1739, Admiral Vernon, along with Sir Gooch and his marines, headed toward the West Indies and successfully captured the Spanish colonial possession of [[w:Portobelo, Colón|Portobelo]] (present-day [[w:Panama|Panama]]). However, because of the conditions of its service—thinned by diseases, bad weather, and a near-mutinous crew— the regiment had only three hundred of its most trustworthy men serve ashore in Vernon's unsuccessful deadly amphibious assault against the strategic defenses on the colonial seaport of Cartagena, forcing a retreat to [[w:Jamaica|Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=Cartegena&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
As a successful method in social purification, the only remaining 10-percent survived the [[w:Battle of Cartagena de Indias|Cartegena expedition]].&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; Thereafter, Vernon's fleet returned to the United Kingdom of England toward the end of 1742. Like their British components, the colonial marines disbanded as a regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

===British Corps of Royal Marines===
Time again, the recall of reforming maritime regiments was in need when the War of Jenkins' Ear had escalated into the [[w:War of the Austrian Succession|War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748), which brought another set of ten British marine regiments into naval service. The remaining independent companies within the British marine regiments merged with another regiment in 1746; by the end of the war it too was dissolved, their officers placed on half pay.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

In 1755, British Parliament allowed the marines to be institutionalized on some grounds of permanence as they were insistent in building their own military force, particularly its naval fleet under the Admiralty. Thus, the Corps of Royal Marines was born; over five thousand marines were recruited and were assembled into fifty independent companies, assigned as &quot;divisions&quot; to three large English naval bases.

During the [[w:Seven Years' War|Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), also known as the [[w:French and Indian War|French and Indian War]] in the colonies, the marines were then appropriately dispersed amongst the Royal navy warships, the Royal Marines played an integral part in successful naval expeditions. These ship detachments soon formed expeditionary battalions that fought ashore [[w:Canada|Canada]], [[w:Cuba|Cuba]], and the [[w:Philippines|Philippines]]. Now being strictly under the control of the Admiralty, the marines were used exclusively for expeditions and raids, becoming so essential to the maritime strategy of Prime Minister [[w:William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. Their primary mission in ship-to-ship combat and ship seizures were to pick off officers with expert  
[[w:musket|musketry]], to repel boarders with skilled [[w:bayonet|bayonetry]], and to augment as gun crew members when necessary. Also, they played a major part of a ships landing party for operations ashore, raiding naval bases, stores, etc, etc. But during cruising conditions, the marines policed and enforced ship regulations about fires, thievery, and unlawful conduct by sailors, to include prevention and deterrence against a mutinous crew. By the end of the war, the Corps of Royal Marines remained an important force within the Royal Navy. On the eve of the American War of Independence, roughly 4,500 marine officers and enlistees were still in existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Field&quot;&gt;

It was the same quantum of traditions by the British marines that influenced the likelihood from the rebelled American colonies in establishing its own legion of [Continental] marines, adopting the same ethics and traditions alike.</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;''&quot;No Taxation without Representation&quot;''&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ever since the end of the [[w:French and Indian War|French and Indian War]] [[w:Seven Years' War|[Seven Years' War]]] (1754–1763), the relationship between the loyal citizens of [[w:British America|British America]] and the [[w:Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament of Great Britain]] began to slowly but steadily worsen. The war had plunged [[w:Great Britain|Great Britain]] so deep into debt that it convinced the British Parliament to enact subsequent actions by increasing the tax revenues from the American colonies; they greatly felt assured these astringent of [[w:Revenue Act|revenue acts]] justified their reasons that the colonies should contribute in maintaining the financial stability of the [[w:British Empire|British Empire]]. However, many American colonies held a huge margin of discontent, arguing that they were not directly and legitimately represented in Parliament, which an elected official should be representing the colonies in their stead; the [[w:British Constitution|British Constitution]] prescribed: &quot;a British subject's property in the form of taxes could not be taken from him &quot;without his consent&quot; in the form of representation in government.&quot; They concluded that the British government had no right to levy taxes upon them, declaring it [[w:unconstitutional|unconstitutional]]. The inquiry stood on controversial grounds if whether the extent of [[w:parliamentary sovereignty|Parliament's sovereignty]] in the colonies had any legitimate jurisdiction whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789 |last=Middlekauff |first= Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0195162479 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albeit, Parliament firmly certain their position in possessing the power to legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot;, as cited in the [[w:Declaratory Act|Declaratory Act]] of 1766. The laws of Great Britain naturally caused unsettling discern from the American colonies, just as the strict enforcement over the imposing laws, which altogether eventually lead to the proliferation of the [[American Revolution]].

One of the earliest revenue acts, the [[w:Molasses Act|Molasses Act]] (1733), effected the fulcrum of the mercantile trade in the American colonies, in which it imposed and enforced excises on the molasses trade from non-British colonies of the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;citation 6 Geo II. c. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, raising revenue was not its sole purpose, but rather to monitor and regulate the molasses trade by making sugar, rum and molasses more cheaper than those from the occidental islands in the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]] possessed by the [[w:French West Indies|French]], [[w:Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands]], [[w:Spanish West Indies|Spanish]], [[w:Barbados|Portuguese]], nor [[w:Danish West Indies|Danish]]. This act was to remain in force for thirty years and was apparently provoked by persisting plantation owners of the [[w:British West Indies|British West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Draper, pg. 95-96 | Middlekauff, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; However, the laws passed by the French government encouraged the sugar and molasses enterprises—trade and shipment—but it forbade the French colonies (such as [[w:Haiti|Haïti]], [[w:Saint-Domingue|Saint-Domingue]], [[w:Martinique|Martinique]], the [[w:Grenadines|Grenadines]]) from producing cheap rum, which would be sold throughout France and undermine the prices of brandy, an important commodity to the French trade. Also, other foreign colonies in the Caribbean were primarily the source of [[w:hard currency|specie]] for the American colonies.

To enforce the imposition of the new customs laws in the American colonies, the British Parliament appointed government officials as Commissioners of Customs to collect the revenues. The American colonists however potentially bypassed the customs officials and found other avenues of approach in importing and exporting taxed trade goods and merchandise—in the feat of smuggling. The colonists would regularly coaxed British revenue officials with bribes, or just simply outsmart them. The [[w:Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]'s main industry was producing rum from molasses—[[w:Newport|Newport]] distilleries consumed 12,000 hogsheads of molasses (the equivalent of about 54 gallons), only 2,500 of which had arrived legitimately from the islands of [[w:British West Indies|British West India]]—the [[w:Narragansett Bay|Narragansett Bay]], of the colony of Rhode Island, was ideally perfect for smuggling. To put a stop to smuggling, the British Parliament authorized the British Royal Navy to execute its vessels in Narragansett Bay as a [[w:Show of force|&quot;show-of-force&quot;]]; and subsequently along the coast of North America, from [[w:Casco Bay|Casco Bay]], in the [[w:Province of Massachusetts Bay|Province of Massachusetts Bay]], to [[W:Cape Henlopen|Cape Henlopen]], in the [[w:Delaware Colony|Delaware Colony]] of the [[w:Province of Pennsylvania|Province of Pennsylvania]].

Such British presence however, was not taken lightly. In January of 1764, John Temple, the customs official responsible for enforcing the customs laws, traveled from his headquarters in [[w:Boston|Boston]], to the Colony of Rhode Island, with intention to enforce the newer, indirect [[w:Sugar Act|Sugar Act]] (1764); by which two months earlier he had implied he would &quot;turn the usual blind eye.&quot; The British schooner [[w:HMS St. John (1764)|HMS ''St. John'']] that was assigned to Narragansett Bay, seized the sloop ''Rhoda'' carrying a cargo of molasses, which sailed inbound to Newport, from [[w:Surinam|Surinam]] in [[w:South America|South America]]. Under orders of local officials in Newport, a group of Rhode Islanders took control of Fort George on [[w:Goat Island (Rhode Island)|Goat Island]], in the Newport harbor, and several rounds were fired upon HMS ''St. John''. The British schooner averted the unexpected hasty response and successfully fled the harbor as the 20-gun warship [[w:HMS Squirrel (1755)|HMS ''Squirrel'']] arrived in the bay. The shots became one of the first direct acts of rebellion against the British government in the Americas. Two days later, after sundown, the sloop ''Rhoda'' &quot;got under Sail and carried off by Persons unknown.&quot; A reward was posted for the capture of the offenders, but no one made an effort to take the bounty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golway |first=Terry |authorlink=David Mumford |title=Washington's General: Nathanael Greene and the Triumph of the American Revolution |publisher=John MacRae Books, Macmillan |year=2005 |page=25 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_dqueoEH_S8C&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |doi=10.1007/b62130 |isbn=354063293X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year the British naval ship, the [[w:HMS Maidstone (1758)|HMS ''Maidstone'']], sailed to Rhode Island for the purpose of forcibly [[w:/Impressment|impressing]] [naval [[w:Conscript|conscript]], draft] seamen into the British [[w:Royal Navy|Royal Navy]], which caused an uprising amongst the colonists. A similar incidence occurred when a British brigantine sailed into the Newport harbor and pressed men into naval service. The following evening, a mob of about five hundred men seized one of the HMS ''Maidstone's'' boats. They paraded it through Newport before setting the boat on fire in front of the court house. In 1769, the British sloop [[w:HMS Liberty (1768)|HMS ''Liberty'']] was also seized and burned after it made attempts to suppress smuggling.[[File:Gaspee_Affair.jpg|thumb|left|The burning of the HMS ''Gaspée'']]
The British revenue schooner HMS ''Gaspée'', stationed in Narragansett Bay, was on similar duty in aiding the enforcement of customs collections, checking and inspecting the cargo of each vessel that went in, and out, of the bay. It got to the point that the arrogant behavior of her commander, who in many cases exceeded his authority, greatly disturbed the colonists. On 9 June 1772, HMS ''Gaspée'' chased the [[w:packet ship|packet boat]] ''Hannah'', and ran it aground. By nightfall, a party of men of the secret vigilante organization &quot;[[w:Sons of Liberty|Sons of Liberty]]&quot;, from the Colony of the [[w:Providence, Rhode Island|Providence Plantation]], descended down the river in boats  and confronted the ship's crew before they were able to free ''Hannah''; the crew and the ship's commander was captured in the process, and the ship was set on fire, momentarily blowing up. &lt;ref&gt;

On 10 May 1773, when the [[w:Tea Act|Tea Act]] (1773) was enacted by the British Parliament, immediate upheaval of events unfolded in British America, forming many resistance movements throughout the colonies. The Tea Act was objected for a variety of reasons, especially because the colonists believed that this act, as well, violated their given [[w:Rights of Englishmen|rights as English citizens]] to be taxed only by their own elected officials that represent the colonies. Momentarily, many American began to protest, developing an embargo against imports any territory of Kingdom of Great Britain. In every British American colony except the [[w:Province of Massachusetts Bay|Province of Massachusetts Bay]], protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign, or to return the tea to England. Most of the heat was concentrated on the monopolized [[w:East India Company|East India Company]] that was British government-protected.

On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair are throwing crates overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, is standing on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|This iconic 1846 lithograph by [[w:Nathaniel Currier|Nathaniel Currier]] was entitled &quot;The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor&quot;; the phrase &quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Shoemaker'', 183–85.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In late November, the tea ships sailed into the [[w:Boston Harbor|Boston Harbor]] by which the leaders of the protesters imbued a resolution to the captain of ''Dartmouth'', along with the other merchant ships–the ''Eleanor'' and ''Beaver'', to return back to whence they came without paying the import duties. However, by the beset of Royal Governor [[w:Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], he refused to grant permission for the merchant ships to leave without paying the dues; the British law required tea shipments to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo—a law that Hutchinson was committed to enforce.  On 16 December, in an act of a [[w:direct action|direct action]] protest, a group of 30 to 130 men—poorly disguised as Mohawk Indians—boarded the three vessels and dumped all tea into the water, marking the iconic event known as the [[w:Boston Tea Party|Boston Tea Party]], a key event in the growth of the [[w:American Revolution|American Revolution]].

In response to the 'Boston Tea Party', the British government responded with the [[w:Intolerable Acts|Intolerable Acts]] [Coercive Acts] (1774), and the [[w:Boston Port Act|Boston Port Act]], which ultimately closed all the commercial trading in Boston: not until the East India Company had been repaid in full for the tea destroyed. Also, other acts created privileges by increasing the boundaries of what was then the [[w:Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] (present day [[w:Province of Quebec|Quebec]] and [[w:Province of Ontario|Ontario]]), granting its citizens free practice of the Roman Catholic faith (which was a relative issue that the majority of colonists in Massachusetts had been declined in the past by Parliament). It was hoped by Parliament that these punitive measures would make an example of the Bostonians, and the rest of the Province of Massachusetts, in an effort to dissipate the trend of Colonial resistance.

The [[w:First Continental Congress|First Continental Congress]] met in [[w:Carpenter's Hall|Carpenter's Hall]] in [[w:Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], from September 5, to October 26, 1774. Of all the 56 delegates elected by the people from the colonies, only the newest province, the [[w:Province of Georgia|Province of Georgia]] did not send delegates due to seeking aid from England in pacifying the area of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Leap in the Dark |author=Ferling, John. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonies that were representing illustrated determination to show the combined unity of authority to Great Britain. Convening the Continental Congress in 1774, its representatives members [[w:Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the British monarch]] for repeal of the acts. Although the colonies sought different intentions, they all agreed that the King and Parliament must understand the grievances of the colonies and that the government was supposed to be established for the good welfare of its citizens, not for mere empowerment and gentry; to give unrelenting support of legal rights to its British citizens, not just in the American colonies but other territories around the world as well.  The series of affairs in British America caused great concern to [[w:George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] and the British Parliament for a considerable amount of time before the initial outbreak of the Colonial rebellion.

==19 April 1775: The American Revolution==
[[Image:SiegeBoston.jpg|thumb||left|400px|The ''&quot;Siege of Boston&quot;''. This portrait depicts British troops evacuating the city of Boston.]]
On 19 April 1775, about a force of 700 British Army regulars and a small force of Royal Marines were sent to destroy a cache of weapons and supplies in the town of [[w:Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Boston Campaign |last=Brooks |first=Victor |publisher=Combined Publishing |year=1999 |ref=Brooks |isbn=9780585234533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The militiamen of local towns, and bands of [[w:Minutemen|Minutemen]] confronted the British forces and shots were exchanged in the small town of Lexington. The [[w:battles of Lexington and Concord|battles of Lexington and Concord]] sparked the beginning of the [[w:American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]]. The American rebels began blockading the narrow land access to [[w:Charlestown|Charlestown]] and Boston, starting the [[w:siege of Boston|siege of Boston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frothingham100&quot;&gt;

Nonetheless, searching for expert seamen with the skills to serve duties aboard a ship was quite easy during the eighteenth century since British American were notably a [[w:maritime|maritime]] class of people. Insomuch, the Colonists' economy greatly depended on the sea, especially in the more industrial colonies of [[w:New England|New England]]. Before the development of America's infrastructure and roads, the most frequent and common mode of transportation for commerce and trade altogether was by water; the whole [[w:littoral|littoral]] length of the American eastern seaboard extends more than a thousand miles. During all seasons of the year, whaling and fishermen expertly navigated the northern Atlantic seas, especially from the banks of [[w:Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. This extensive trade likewise had furnished mariners in mastery of seamanship, but it is not certain whether, or not, if any percentage of seamen actually practice maritime warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Weeden's Economic and Social History of New England, chs. v, ix, xiv, xvi&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second Hundred Year War, however, [[w:letters of marque|letters-of-marque]] (informal: ''&quot;legal pirates&quot;'') and [[w:privateer|privateering]] had provided a profitable enterprise for the Americans and it gave many of its seamen the experience which would be valuable to the cause of the American Revolution. Many of the privateers and letters-of-marque would rummage the ocean in search of French or Spanish ships to take as [[w:ship prize|prizes]]. And illegal piracy became such a huge issue that nearly every merchantman at sea would encourage his crew to sail with vigilance. The &quot;letters-of-marque&quot; issued to merchants allowed his crew to take possession of their defeated foe under legal protection. But it is well aware that there had been those there weren't so fortunate, falling victim to their aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;Atlantic Monthly, September and October, 1861, for journal of Captain Norton of Newport, 1741.&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect on all of this, it would apparent that American seamen at the opening of the American Revolution had the training and experience which made them ideally a naval entity. Whatever it shall be, the patriotic cause was the driving force in aiding the resistance against the formidable British forces.

To test the skills of seamanship under the events of war, the ''first'' naval engagement of the American Revolutionary War
took place in and around the seaport of [[w:Machias, Maine|Machias]], in the northern Province of Massachusetts Bay (eastern [[w:Maine|Maine]]), on 11–12 June 1775. Two merchant ships arrived in Machias on June 2, accompanied by the British HMS ''Margaretta'', commanded by James Moore. Townspeople ultimately decided to capture Moore and his ship. He was able to escape out of the harbor, but the townspeople seized one of the merchant ships, armed it, and sailed out to meet him. In a short confrontation, they captured his vessel and crew, fatally wounding him in the process. The people of Machias captured additional British ships in the process and fought off large [[w:landing force|landing force]] intent on seizing the town.  Privateers and private seamen continued to engage in conflicts in and out of Machias, interfering with the British Royal Navy's operations ensuing the Revolutionary War.

On June 15, 1775, the Second Continental Congress asked the New York provincial government to select two men for service in the army: Major General [[w:Philip Schuyler|Philip Schuyler]], and Brigadier General [[w:Richard Montgomery|Richard Montgomery]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Units of the [[w:Continental Army|Continental Army]] and groups of militia were sometimes pressed to serve as sailors and naval infantry on ships, purposely serving as marines.

The ''colonial'' marines—Washington's naval fleet, Benedict Arnold's Lake Champlain flotilla, provincial maritime militias, and privateers—made no distinction of their duties as their activities were no different from English customs: marines were basically soldiers detailed for naval service whose primary duties were to fight aboard but not sail their ships. Washington's navy expeditions throughout the remaining months of 1775 suggested that his ship crews of mariner-militiamen were not divided distinctly between sailors and marines; the Marblehead Regiment performed a plethora of duties aboard the warships.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; However, the Pennsylvania Committee of Public Safety made a dividing line between the sailors and marines when it decided to form a state navy to protect the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]] and its littoral areas.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pennsylvania Navy, 1775–1781 |last=Jackson |first=John W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=[[w:New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick, New Jersey]] |isbn= |page= |pages=26–28  |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==26 Aug 1775: Resolution of Naval Affairs==
[[Image:adamstrumbull.jpg|thumb|left|[[w:John Adams|John Adams]] took an active role in the formation of the navy and the drafting of suitable operational regulations.  Painting by [[w:John Trumbull|John Trumbull]], c. 1792-93.]]
By autumn the British navy concentrated its main armada off the New England coast to blockade any American ships from entering or exiting the territorial waters; delegates from the [[w:Rhode Island Assembly|Rhode Island Assembly]] pressured [Second] Continental Congress for naval assistance to clear the British navy raiders that had been harassing the Rhode Islanders. Although Congress was aware of British's naval strength and its own financial limitations, it addressed itself reluctantly to the problem of creating a formidable [[w:continental navy|continental navy]]. They were hesitant to form a national naval force, only positing that they were only able to form such a capable force from Washington's and Arnold's fleets. On 26 August, the Rhode Island Assembly laid before Congress a bold resolution for &quot;the building and equipping of an American fleet, as soon as possible&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., IV, iii, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;

The &quot;Resolution of 26 August 1775&quot; declared:
:''&quot;…the building and equipping an American fleet, as soon as possible, would greatly and essentially conduce to the preservation of the lives, liberty and property of the good people of these colonies… …to use their whole influence at the ensuing congress for building at the Continental expence a fleet of sufficient force for the protection of these colonies.&quot;''

However, the Continental Congress strongly opposed it, [[w:Samuel Chase|Samuel Chase]], a delegate of the Provincial Congress of [[w:Province of Maryland|Maryland]], exclaimed:
:''&quot;…the maddest Idea in the World!&quot;''—emphasis added.&lt;br&gt;
Even those who were apologetic to the idea found that the proposal was all too perplexing. No would could fathom the slightest idea on how much it would cost to fund an American fleet to be used at the Continental expense.
:John Adams later recalled:
::''&quot;The opposition…was very loud and vehement. It was… represented as the most wild, visionary, mad project that had ever been imagined. It was an infant taking a mad bull by his horns.&quot;''

To proffer the assailed British forces in surrendering the city of Boston to the Americans, [[w:Josiah Quincy II|Josiah Quincy]] proposed in a letter to John Adams, dated 22 September 1775, to build five forts, three of them on Long Island, including along the [[w:Nantasket Roads|Nantasket Roads]]—the estuaries of the [[w:Boston harbor|Boston harbor]] and the narrow inlets—that were defended by British men-of-war. To include, Quincy also thought that:
:''&quot;…Row Gallies must be our first mode of Defence by Sea.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams MSS&quot;&gt;Private Collections. Papers of John Adams, deposited in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society,  examined through the courtesy of Charles Francis Adams, Esq.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such defense would be used to fire upon the British ships to force them out of the area, enabling them to submerge obstacles to barricade the narrows passage ways without haste. Quincy emphasized his proposal when he strongly implied that no British vessels shall have any access, in or out, of the bay area:
:''&quot;…both Seamen and Soldiers, if they don't escape by a timely Flight, must become Prisoners at Discretion.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams MSS&quot;/&gt;

==5 Oct 1775: The Naval Committee==

Intelligence had been received of two brigs sailing from England laden with military supplies bound to Quebec. The Rhode Island delegates presented their information and instructions to Philadelphia on 3rd of October bringing the matter fairly before the body of Congress. The practicability of intercepting these vessels was considered by Congress two day later on October 5, 1775. However, discussion of these instructions were postponed from time to time, and it was several weeks before definite action was taken on them. Strong opposition was developed on the part of a vociferous minority to any participation of the Continental government in maritime warfare; to them it appeared sheer madness to send ships out upon the sea to meet the overwhelming naval force of England. After a lively debate the matter was referred to a committee consisting of John Adams, John Langdon, and Silas Deane. Upon the recommendation of this committee it was decided to instruct Washington at once to procure two Massachusetts cruisers for that service and to request the cooperation of the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of Continental Congress, October 3, 5, 1775; Am. Arch., IV, iii, 950, 1038, 1888-1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhode Island delegates presented their instructions to Congress October 3 and this brought the matter fairly before that body. Discussion of these instructions was postponed from time to time and it was several weeks before definite action was taken on them. Meanwhile intelligence had been received of the sailing from England of two brigs laden with military supplies bound to Quebec. The practicability of intercepting these vessels was considered in Congress October 5.

A resolution on 5 October 1775, has followed, instructing its delegates from that province in the Continental Congress to introduce legislation calling: ''&quot;…to use their whole influence at the ensuing congress for building at the Continental expence a fleet of sufficient force, for the protection of these colonies, and for employing them in such a manner and places as will most effectively annoy our enemies…&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Am. Arch., IV, iii, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intent was to intercept the supply of arms and provisions to British soldiers, who had placed [[Boston]] under [[martial law]]. [[George Washington]] had already informed Congress that he had assumed command of several ships for this purpose, and individual governments of various colonies had outfitted their own warships.

On the advice of the committee appointed October 5, Congress voted on the 13th to fit out two vessels, one of  them to carry ten guns, to cruise three months to the eastward  in the hope of intercepting British transports. Another committee  of three was appointed to inquire into the expense.

If Congress was yet unwilling to embrace the idea of establishing a navy as a permanent measure, it could be tempted by short-term opportunities. Fortuitously, on 5 October, Congress received intelligence of two English brigs, unarmed and without convoy, laden with munitions, leaving England bound for Quebec. Congress immediately appointed a committee to consider how to take advantage of this opportunity. Its members were all New Englanders and all ardent supporters of a navy. They recommended first that the governments of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut be asked to dispatch armed vessels to lay in wait to intercept the munitions ships; next they outlined a plan for the equipping by Congress of two armed vessels to cruise to the eastward to intercept any ships bearing supplies to the British army.

This committee was the  first executive body for the management of naval affairs. It  was known as the Naval Committee and the members were John Langdon  of New Hampshire, John Adams of Massachusetts, Stephen Hopkins  of Rhode Island, Silas Deane of Connecticut, Richard Henry Lee  of Virginia, Joseph Hewes of North Carolina, and Christopher  Gadsden of South Carolina.

Strong opposition was developed on the part of a vociferous minority to any participation of the Continental government in  maritime warfare; to them it appeared sheer madness to send ships out upon the sea to meet the overwhelming naval force of England. After a lively debate the matter was referred to a committee consisting of John Adams, John Langdon, and Silas Deane. Upon the recommendation of this committee it was decided to instruct Washington at once to procure two Massachusetts cruisers for that service and to request the cooperation of the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of Continental Congress, October 3, 5, 1775; Am. Arch., IV, iii, 950, 1038, 1888-1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbridge Gerry wrote from Watertown, October  9, 1775, to Samuel Adams, then a member of the Continental Congress  at Philadelphia, saying: &quot;If the Continent should fit out  a heavy ship or two and increase them as circumstances shall  admit, the Colonies large privateers, and individuals small ones,  surely we may soon expect to see the coast clear of cutters.&quot;  (Am. Arch., IV, iii, 993.)

316. Samuel Ward, Diary.1

[October 5, 1775.]

5th. Congress according to the order of the day went into a Committee of the whole, etc After some debate a member produced a number of letters from England, which were read, and Captain Read,2 just arrived, and the gentleman to whom the letters were written, desired to attend the Congress. Expresses sent to General Washington, Governor Cooke and Governor Trumbull, to send out several vessels to intercept two transports with powder, etc Encouragement given to the men, etc The vessels to go on the service to be at the risk of the Continent.8

[316] l Mag. of Am. Hist., I. 551.

2 Probably Capt. Thomas Read of the ship Montgomery, in the service of Pennsylvania. See Pa. Arch., first ser., IV. 745-753, passim, and 769. In June, 1776, he was made captain of the Continental frigate Washington. See the Journals, June 6, Aug. 13, 1776, etc The letters from London concerning the two vessels have not been found, but cf. Force, Am. Arch., fourth ser., III. 148, 255-257.

3 See the Journals, Oct. 5, 6, 13, 17, 30, and Adams's Notes of Debates, Oct . 30, in the Journals, III. 504; also Hancock s letters to Washington and to the Massachusetts council, Force, Am. Arch., fourth ser., III. 950, 951, and Washington to Congress, Oct. 12, read in Congress Oct. 21, ibid., III. 1037 and Writings (ed. Ford), IV. 172, (ed. Sparks), III. 122. Cf. Gerry to Samuel Adams, Oct. 9, Force, Am. Arch., fourth ser., III. 993. See also Gov. Cooke of Rhode Island to Washington, Oct. 10, ibid., III. 1007, and to the Rhode Island delegates, the same day, Staples, R. I. in Cont. Cong., p. 41. See further, the Journals, Nov. 2, 8, 23, 24, 25, 28, 30, Dec 2, 5, 9, 19, 22, 1775; Jan. 7, 16, 25, 30, Feb. 7, 1776. Cf. nos. 329, 336, 354, 390, 395, 396, post. Many years later John Adams wrote in his Autobiography concerning these proceedings:

&quot; On Thursday, October 5th, 1775, sundry letters from London were laid before Congress and read, and a motion was made, that it be

' Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to prepare a plan for intercepting two vessels which are on their way to Canada, laden with arms and powder, and that the committee proceed on this business immediately.'

&quot; The secretary has omitted to insert the names of this committee on the journals, but as my memory has recorded them, they were Mr. Deane, Mr. Langdon, and myself, three members who had expressed much zeal in favor of the motion. As a considerable part of my time, in the course of my profession, had been spent upon the sea-coast of Massachusetts, in attending the courts and lawsuits at Plymouth, Barnstable, Martha's Vineyard, to the southward, and in the counties of Essex, York, and Cumberland to the eastward, I had conversed much with the gentlemen who conducted our cod and whale fisheries, as well as the other navigation of the country, and had heard much of the activity, enterprise, patience, perseverance, and daring intrepidity of our seamen. I had formed a confident opinion that, if they were once let loose upon the ocean, they would contribute greatly to the relief of our wants, as well as to the distress of the enemy. I became therefore at once an ardent advocate for this motion, which we carried, not without great difficulty. The opposition to it was very loud and vehement. Some of my own colleagues appeared greatly alarmed at it, and Mr. Edward Rutledge never displayed so much eloquence as against it. He never appeared to me to discover so much information and sagacity, which convinced me that he had been instructed out-of-doors by some of the most knowing merchants and statesmen in Philadelphia. It would require too much time and space to give this debate at large, if any memory could attempt it. Mine cannot. It was, however, represented as the most wild, visionary, mad project that ever had been imagined. It was an infant, taking a mad bull by his horns; and what was more profound and remote, it was said it would ruin the character, and corrupt the morals of all our seamen. It would make them selfish, piratical, mercenary, bent wholly upon plunder, etc These formidable arguments and this terrible rhetoric were answered by us by the best reasons we could allege, and the great advantages of distressing the enemy, supplying ourselves, and beginning a system of maritime and naval operations, were represented in colors as glowing and animating. The vote was carried, the committee went out, returned very soon, and brought in the report in these words:

&quot; This committee immediately procured a room in a public house in the city, and agreed to meet every evening at six o clock, in order to despatch this business with all possible celerity.&quot; Works, III. 6. See also the extract of a letter to John Langdon, Jan. 24, 1813, in the Journals (ed. Ford), III. 277 n.

Whether Adams was a member of the committee of Oct. 5 is uncertain, for the Journals do not record the composition of the committee. At all events, when a new committee had been appointed, Oct. 13, to carry out the plan which the committee of Oct. 5 had reported, Oct. 6 (the committee had made a first report on the same day on which it was appointed), the first committee ceased to exist. Nor was Adams a member of the second committee. When however the functions of the committee of Oct. 13 were enlarged, Oct. 30, and its membership increased from three to seven Adams was one of the four new appointees. It was this committee of seven which presently came to be called the naval committee, although for a time it is designated in the Journals by such phrases as &quot; the committee for fitting out armed vessels &quot;. See the Journals, Nov. 2, 23, 30, Dec 2, 5, 9, 13, 22, 1775; Jan. 6, 9, 16, 25, 30, Feb. 7, 1776. Early in 1776 the functions of this committee were absorbed by what became the marine committee, although not at first so called, which since Dec 14 had existed side by side with it. See especially the memorandum of Charles Thomson quoted in the Journals (ed. Ford), under Jan. 25, 1776 (p. 90 n) ; also the Journals, Sept. 19, 1776.

Of the origin of the marine committee it is necessary to take note briefly. Before the arrival of the budget of news from London which precipitated the action of Congress Oct. 5 a more deliberate step had been taken to induce Congress to create a navy. On Oct. 3 the Rhode Island delegates presented to Congress an instruction from their assembly, given Aug. 25, especially urging &quot; the building and equipping an American fleet&quot;. See the Journals, Oct. 3, 6, 7, Nov. 16, Dec 9, and nos. 343, 304, note 2, post; also Staples, R. J. in Cont. Cong., p. 40. It was the Rhode Island instruction that formed the basis of the discussion recorded by John Adams in his Notes of Debates, Oct. 7 (Journals, III. 485; Works, II. 463). This instruction was taken into consideration Dec 11, and a committee of one from each colony appointed to devise ways and means for furnishing a naval armament. This committee made a report Dec 13, and a new committee, also one from each colony, was appointed, Dec 14, to carry the plan into execution. It is evident that the committee of Dec 14 was from the firs^ regarded as a standing committee on naval affairs, whereas the so called naval committee was appointed for a specific purpose with a limited scope. See no. 395, post. For other comment by John Adams concerning the origin of the navy and his part therein see no. 390, note 2, post. Adams was not a member of the marine committee at any time. For a history of these committees see C. O. Paullin, The Navy of the American Revolution, pp. 35 et seq., 79 et seq.

Congress let this plan lie on the table until 13 October, when another fortuitous event occurred in favor of the naval movement. A letter from General Washington was read in Congress in which he reported that he had taken under his command, at Continental expense, three schooners to cruise off Massachusetts to intercept enemy supply ships. The commander in chief had preempted members of Congress reluctant to take the first step of fitting out warships under Continental authority. Since they already had armed vessels cruising in their name, it was not such a big step to approve two more. The committee's proposal, now appearing eminently reasonable to the reluctant members, was adopted.

The Continental Navy grew into an important force. Within a few days, Congress established a Naval Committee charged with equipping a fleet. This committee directed the purchasing, outfitting, manning, and operations of the first ships of the new navy, drafted subsequent naval legislation, and prepared rules and regulations to govern the Continental Navy's conduct and internal administration.

Early October, Congress members, such as [[w:John Adams|John Adams]], and colonial governments pushed Congress in creating a navy, however small. To examined the possible of establishment of a national navy, a naval affairs committee was appointed on 5 October, called the [[w:Naval Committee|Naval Committee]] (predecessor to the [[w:Committee on Naval Affairs|Committee on Naval Affairs]] of House and Senate).&lt;ref name=McClellan,AmerNavyMarine&gt;

On 13 October 1775, Second Continental Congress authorized expenditure of $100,000 to the Naval Committee the fitting of four converted Philadelphia [[w:cargo ship|merchantmen]] as warships for the new proposed Continental fleet: [[w:USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']], [[w:USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']], [[w:USS Cabot (1775)|USS ''Cabot'']], and [[w:USS Columbus (1775)|USS ''Columbus'']]. By end of the year in December, the Continental fleet included the addition of two smaller vessels, the [[w:USS Hornet (1775)|USS ''Hornet'']] and [[w:USS Wasp (1775)|USS ''Wasp'']]. In January 1776, two new ships were fitted and commissioned, the [[w:USS Providence (1775)|USS ''Providence'']] and [[w:USS Fly (1776)|USS ''Fly'']]; making it eight ships for sea service. Despite the drawbacks of lack of funding in financing, the [[w:Continental Navy|Continental Navy]] was formed.&lt;ref name=Abbot&gt;

On the advice of the committee appointed October 5, Congress voted on the 13th to fit out two vessels, one of them to carry ten guns, to cruise three months to the eastward in the hope of intercepting British transports. Another committee of three was appointed to inquire into the expense. October 30, 1775, is an important date in naval legislation. Congress resolved to arm the second of the vessels already provided for with fourteen guns and also authorized two additional vessels which might carry as many as twenty and thirty-six guns respectively, &quot;for the protection and defence of the United Colonies.&quot; By this vote Congress was fully committed to the policy of maintaining a naval armament. On the same day a committee of seven was formed by adding four members to those already appointed (Jour. Cont. Congr., October 6, 7, 13,17, 30, 1775.) This committee was the first executive body for the management of naval affairs. It was known as the Naval Committee and the members were John Langdon of New Hampshire, John Adams of Massachusetts, Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, Silas Deane of Connecticut, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, Joseph Hewes of North Carolina, and Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina

In 1775, the Royal Navy numbered 268 warships, and by the end of the year it grew to a fleet force of 468 ships; its naval personnel increased during the war from 18,000 to 10,000. By contrast, the Continental Navy—including the state navies—had managed to maintain as much as over 50 commissioned warships by winter of 1776–1777, which it fell in numbers thereafter; its manpower most likely achieved no greater than 3,000 sailors and marines.&lt;ref name=Paullin,NavyAmerRevolt/&gt;
--------------------
In November the Naval Committee purchased four merchant vessels under the provisions of October 13 and 30, to be converted into men-of-war. These vessels, as named by the committee, were the ships Alfred and Columbus and the brigs Cabot and Andrew Doria. The first was named in honor of the supposed founder of the English navy, the second and third for famous discoverers, and the fourth for the great Genoese admiral. Other vessels were authorized and purchased from time to time, the first of which was a sloop called the Providence (Adams, iii, 12; Am. Arch., IV, iii, 1938; .Jour. Cont. Congr., December 2, 1775.)

The bombardment of [[w:Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Virginia]] by British raiders pressured the congressmen of the southern colonies (whose votes were essential to the Continental navy's creation&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;) for assistance from Congress. Previous autumn, British and [[w:Tory|Tory]] ships organized by [[w:John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|John Murray]], the British Governor of Virginia, had been ravaging the shores of the [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay]] and the approaches near [[w:Hampton Roads|Hampton Roads]]. The Second Continental Congress issued its first commission of naval officers; Congressman Stephen Hopkins, the co-chairman of Naval Affairs and the Marine Committee, requested to the other Congress members in appointing his brother&lt;ref&gt;Rear-Admiral R.Clark, USN [Ret.] (1910), ''A Short History of the United States Navy''; [http://www.schoonerman.com/navalhistory/index.html The First American Fleet]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[w:Esek Hopkins|Esek Hopkins]], who was a veteran master merchantmen and a Commodore of the [[w:Rhode Island Navy|Rhode Island Navy]], as the &quot;[[w:Admiral of the Fleet|Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet of the United Colonies]]&quot;. As a result, on 22 December 1775, the Marine Committee commissioned Esek Hopkins as [[w:Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] in the Continental navy.&lt;ref&gt;

He was immediately given command of a flotilla of five ships: [[w:USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']], [[w:USS Andrew Doria (1775)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']], [[w:USS Cabot (1775)|USS ''Cabot'']], and [[w:USS Columbus (1774)|USS ''Columbus'']], and [[w:USS Providence (1775)|USS ''Providence'']], comprising the entirety of the navy, as of date 9 January 1776&lt;ref&gt;Rear-Admiral R.Clark, USN [Ret.] (1910), ''A Short History of the United States Navy''; [http://www.schoonerman.com/navalhistory/index.html The First American Fleet]&lt;/ref&gt;; the ''first'' squadron in the Continental fleet.

--------------------------
Meanwhile, November 2, 1775, the Naval Committee had been given power by Congress to &quot;agree with such officers and seamen as are proper to man and command &quot; the vessels they had purchased and were fitting out. On the 5th the committee selected Esek Hopkins, an old sea captain of Providence and brother of Stephen Hopkins, for the command of this little fleet (Field's Life of Hopkins, 78.) December 7 John Paul Jones &quot;was appointed Senior Lieut. of the Navy.&quot; (Jones MSS., October 10, 1776; Sands's Life of Jones, 33.) On the 22d the Naval Committee &quot;laid before Congress a list of the officers by them appointed, agreeable to the resolutions of Congress, viz: Ezek Hopkins, Esqr., commander-in-chief of the fleet. Captains, Dudley Saltonstall, Esqr., of the Alfred, Abraham Whipple, Esqr., of the Columbus, Nicholas Biddle, Esqr., of the Andrew Doria, John Burrows Hopkins, Esqr., of the Cabot. 1st lieutenants, John Paul Jones [etc.] . . . Resolved, That the pay of the commander-in-chief of the Fleet be 125 dollars per calendar month. Resolved, That commissions be granted to the above officers agreeable to their rank in the above appointment.&quot; In addition to those named above there were in the list four other first lieutenants, five second lieutenants, and three third lieutenants (Jour. Cont. Congr., November 2, December 22, 1775.) This is the beginning of a list of officers for the Continental navy which, in the course of the war and including marine officers and those commissioned in France, contained nearly three hundred and thirty names (See Appendix VI.) There were in addition medical officers, pursers, midshipmen, and warrant officers of whom no lists have been preserved. The largest number of petty officers, seamen, and marines in the navy at any one time may have been about three thousand.

When it came to selecting commanders for ships, Congress tended to be split evenly between merit and patronage.  Among those who were selected for political reasons were [[Esek Hopkins]], [[Dudley Saltonstall]], and Esek Hopkins' son, [[John Burroughs Hopkins]]. However, [[Abraham Whipple]], [[Nicholas Biddle (naval officer)|Nicholas Biddle]], and [[John Paul Jones]] managed to be appointed with backgrounds in marine warfare.

It has generally been supposed that the intention of Congress in making Hopkins commander-in-chief was to give him the same rank that Washington held in the army. It seems more likely, however, that Congress merely meant to give him command of this particular fleet. The wording of his appointment by the Naval Committee and of the resolutions quoted above, together with the fact that each of the captains was assigned, also by resolution of Congress, to a specified vessel, would indicate this. Stephen Hopkins, writing to Esek November 6, 1775, says: &quot;You will perceive by a letter from the Committee, dated yesterday, that they have pitched upon you to take the Command of a Small Fleet, which they and I hope will be but the beginning of one much larger.&quot; (Hopkins, 78.) A resolution of Congress dated January 2, 1778, states that Hopkins &quot;was appointed commander in chief of the fleet fitted out by the Naval Committee.&quot; (Jour. Cont. Congr., January 2, 1778.) He does not appear to have been mentioned officially and authoritatively, that is to say by the Naval or Marine Committee, though he was once by a special committee (Sands, 310.), as the commander-in-chief of the navy. In addition to his own fleet, several other Continental vessels cruised in 1776, which do not seem to have been under his orders (see ch. V) Hopkins was an elderly man at this time, having been born in 1718. He had spent much of his life at sea and was a privateersman in the French and Indian War (Hopkins, ch. i.)

Having launched land expeditions  toward the [[w:St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] months earlier, Congress was convinced that sending marines to fight at sea and engage military operations ashore were paramount in destroying an important British naval base, and to procure enemy provisions and supplies, if possible.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Continental Congress (9–10   Nov 1775), ''Committee on Nova Scotia: Proposals''; Naval Documents of the American Revolution, II: 972, 957–958.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1775, the Naval Committee was directed by Congress to raise two marine battalions at the Continental expense. Also, Congress decided the marines will not only be used for the Nova Scotia expedition but for subsequent service thereafter. Henceforth, the Naval Committee established a network of appointments for offices; paymaster, commissions, equipment, etc., for establishing a future national corps of marines.

The two ''battalions'' of Continental Marines, however, never officially became resolved. Congress was greatly depending on Washington's cooperation for the Nova Scotia expedition and were planning to draw them from Washington's army, but Washington was unenthusiastic about the plan as he did not want to lose any men from his own ranks, suggested instead to Congress to recruit unemployed seamen for the proposed marine battalions to garrison at the [[w:Brooklyn Navy Yard|Brooklyn]] and [[w:Philadelphia Navy Yard|Philadelphia Navy Yard]] (which at the time was the Nation's ''first'' capital city [before moving to the [[w:District of Columbia|District of Columbia]]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Letter from George Washington to John Hancock'' (19 and 28 November 1775), Naval Documents of the American Revolution, II: 1701, 1168–1169, 1206–1207&lt;/ref&gt; Congress agreed on the decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Letter from John Hancock to George Washington'' (8 December 1775), and ''Letter  from George Washington to John Hancock'' (14 December 1775), Naval Documents of the American Revolution, III: 11, 94&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1775, Congress issued its first commissions to [[w:Samuel Nicholas|Samuel Nicholas]], as senior [[w:Captain (United States)|Captain]] becoming the ''first'' [[w:Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the United States Marine Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussnicholas.org/first_officer.html &quot;First Officer&quot; of U.S. Marines [USS Nicholas.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;, and to Lieutenant [[w:Isaac Craig|Isaac Craig]]. In a letter form of officer commissioning, Congress has written to each: &quot;...to raise a company of marines&quot;, informing that he and his junior officers are responsible in recruiting willing men to serve as marines aboard the pending Continental fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''First Commission in the Continental Marine Corps'' (28 November 1775), ''Naval Documents of the American Revolution'', II: 1183&lt;/ref&gt; It was common visage for navy and marine captains to recruit sailors and marines before being issued their ship for duty aboard. Nicholas' family were [[w:tavern|tavernkeepers]], his prominence came not from his work but from his leadership in two local clubs for fox-hunters and sport fishermen. Historian Edwin Simmons surmises that it is most likely Nicholas was using his family tavern, the ''&quot;Conestoga Waggon&quot;''&lt;sup&gt;[sic]&lt;/sup&gt;, as a recruiting post&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot;&gt;

An advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette (a newspaper later owned by Ben Franklin), on July 11, 1734 ran an ad for the &quot;Sign of the Conestoga Wagon&quot;, a tavern in Philadelphia.  In those days not many people could read so taverns usually had signs that had a shape that people would recognize.  They may have had words on the sign but the important part was that people who couldn't read would recognized the shape, know it was a Conestoga Wagon and realize this was the tavern known as the Sign of the Conestoga Wagon.   This suggests that the Conestoga was a familiar shape that lots of people would recognize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pacahs/wagon.htm The Conestoga Area Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the book, The Marine Corps Story, by J. Robert Moskin, 1992, Little, Brown and Company &quot;...The two battalions were never raised; but on November 28, the Congress commissioned thirty-two year old Capt. Samuel Nicholas, a Philadelphia Quaker, and innkeeper and a blacksmith's son, as the first Marine officer. A hundred volunteers, recruited in Rhode Island, arrived at Philadelphia by December 5...probably signed up in Robert Mullan's Tun Tavern.&quot;

And, from the book, The United States Marines A History, by Edwin Howard Simmons. 1998, Naval Institute Press:&quot;...According to legend, the recruiting rendezvous was Tun Tavern, but it is more likely that it was the ''&quot;Conestoga Wagon&quot;'', a tavern owned by the Nicholas family on Market Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets.&quot;

And, from the book, Marine Corps Book Of Lists, Albert A. Nofi, 1999, Combined Publishing:&quot;...Eight Hoary Old Marine Corps Legends That Are Not True.&quot;

The first Marine recruiting station was established in Tun Tavern, in Philadelphia, the proprietor of which was so adept at securing recruits, by liberally plying them with drink, that he was made a captain in the Corps. Alas for &quot;romance,&quot; the story is untrue. It probably got its start from the fact that Samuel Nicholas, effectively the first Marine Commandant, actually did own a  tavern in Philadelphia, the ''&quot;Conestoga Waggon&quot;'', which apparently served as his headquarters for a time. However the owner of the Tun Tavern did become a Marine officer, about a year after the creation of the Corps, which probably gave rise to the legend. Although the standing legend in the United States Marine Corps today places its first recruiting post at [[w:Tun Tavern|Tun Tavern]].

As Congress struggled for affordable and charitable vessels for the marines, Captain Nicholas searched Philadelphia for willing men to fill his ranks. However, the sailors and marines were expected to pay for themselves with the income produced from captured British [[w:Prize money|prize]] ships, as Congress lacked the ability to fund the naval organization; making it very portentous for the future of the Continental Navy and Marine Corps. The length of service was one year, which was the same for the Continental army. The pay was the same as for the common sailors; the pay for a marine private in 1775 was $6.66 a month; the officers and non-commissioned officers were also same as those of the army and navy. The Continental service greatly depended the financial stability of Congress, whose paper currency was so valueless that it almost cease to circulate by 1779. Moreover, both state and Continental sailors and marines found in contrast that service aboard a [[w:Privateer|privateer]] gained much more charm; which consisted of lesser duties and discipline than of the regular naval services. Plus, a privateer captain may split the entire value of his prizes between the owner of the ships (if borrowed) and the crew. However, both Continental and state navies had to divide no more than half their prize money, and the remainder when into the treasures of the associated states', or of Continental Congress. To the hundreds of small privateers that sailed the North Atlantic, the American naval forces found it increasingly difficult to take prizes, let alone influence the outcome of the war.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

Ten additional Marine officers were appointed by Captain Nicholas, the majority of officers and enlistees were Philadelphian small merchants and businessmen, skilled tradesmen and workers, and unskilled laborers. Even there were some that were acquainted to those in Congress or in the [[w:Pennsylvania Committee of Safety|Pennsylvania Committee of Safety]]. The primary duties of the officers were recruiting and persuading men to enlist, most officers were commissioned due to the fact that their most important qualification was knowledge of working the local taverns and other hot-spots of the working class. The officers would sweep through the city for potential recruits, accompanied by drummers borrowed from the [[w:Philadelphia Associators|Philadelphia Associators]], a city militia. Nicholas and his officers might had some maritime experience, but it is unlikely that they were skilled mariners.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Continental Congress (28 Nov 1775), &quot;First Commission in the Continental Marine Corps,''; NDAR, II: 1183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==28 Nov 1775: Navy Rules and Regulations==
Borrowing from the Royal Marines of Great Britain, the practices and printed instructions were outlined in the &quot;Rules for the Regulations of the Navy of the [[w:Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]].&quot; It was intended that the American marines would provide the same services as [[w:Royal Marines|British]] and [[w:Netherlands Marine Corps|Netherlands Royal Marines]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rules for the Regulations of the Navy of the United Colonies'' (28 November 1775), Journal of the Continental Congress, ''Naval Documents of the American Revolution'', II: 1174–1182&lt;/ref&gt;

established. On the 25th captures of British ships of war, transports, and supply vessels were authorized and the several colonies were advised to set up prize courts. The apportionment of the shares in prizes was prescribed. In the case of privateers all the proceeds went to the owners and captors; in the case of Continental or colony cruisers two thirds of the value of a prize when a transport or supply vessel, one half when a vessel of war, went to the government, while the captors took the rest. November 28, &quot;Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies&quot; (See Appendix II) were adopted. These early navy regulations were brief, relating chiefly to discipline and prescribing the ration and pay. The rules provided for courts martial, but not for courts of inquiry; there was much subsequent legislation on the subject of naval courts. Pensions for permanent disability and bounties, to be awarded in certain cases, were provided for, the necessary funds for which were to be set apart from the proceeds of prizes. The rules of November 28 were framed by John Adams and were based on British regulations. Adams was a leader in all this early legislation and the part he took in the founding of the Revolutionary navy was important and influential (Jour. Cont. Congr., November 10, 17, 23, 24, 25, 28, 1775; Adams's Works, iii, 7-11; Am. Arch., IV, v, 1111.)

==14 Dec 1775: The Marine Committee==
While recruiting was one issue, armaments and supplies was the most important issue in procuring for the Continental sailors and marines. They competed for scarce weapons with the Pennsylvania navy and the Philadelphia Associators. On 14 December 1775, the Continental Congress established a permanent [[w:Marine Committee|Marine Committee]] to aid in drafting plans in expanding the Continental Navy and to supervise the construction of vessels and procurement of naval equipment. The Marine Committee is the forerunner of the [[w:United States Department of the Navy|United States Department of the Navy]] of today. It would supersede the duties of the Naval Committee; which the majority of the personnel were also appointed in the same office of Congress's new Committee of Naval Affairs. The Marine Committee contained thirteen members, one for each colony, included important figures, such as [[w:John Hancock|John Hancock]] ([[w:Colony of Massachusetts|MA]]) as chairman, [[w:Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] ([[w:Colony of Rhode Island|RI]]) as co-chairman, [[w:Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] ([[w:Colony of Pennsylvania|PA]]), and [[w:Samuel Chase|Samuel Chase]] ([[w:Colony of Maryland|MD]]).&lt;ref name=Abbot&gt;

Committee of Naval Affairs would oversee the Marine Committee on matters concerning [[w:expeditionary warfare|naval expeditions]] and projections. It exercised [[w:legislative|legislative]], [[w:judicial|judicial]], and [[w:executive|executive powers]]. However, the lack of an administrative head and of actual authority over the states, impeded the Marine Committee as they did Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Rear-Admiral R.Clark, USN [Ret.] (1910), ''A Short History of the United States Navy''; [http://www.schoonerman.com/navalhistory/marine_committee.htm The Marine Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

The events already related took place under the stress of circumstances, most of them unauthorized by Continental or Provincial Congress. It is now necessary to interrupt the narrative of naval operations in order to sketch briefly the various sources of authority and the administrative systems under which acted the different classes of vessels throughout the course of the war. These classes were: First, Continental vessels; second, the state navies; third, the privateers, commissioned either by the Continental government or by the various states, and in some cases by both (In the preparation of so much of this chapter as relates to the administration and organization of the American naval forms, Paullin's Navy of the American Revolution has been closely followed. See also Am. Arch., IV, iii, 1888-1904, 1917-1957; Works of John Adams, ii, 462-464, 469, 470, 479-484, iii, 6-12.)

Public vessels cruising under Continental authority comprised not only the Continental navy, strictly speaking, including vessels fitted out in France, but also the fleets organized by Washington in Massachusetts Bay in 1775 and later in New York; by Arnold on Lake Champlain in 1776 and by Pollock in 1778 on the Mississippi River.

===17 Dec 1775: The Thirteen Frigates===
[[Image:Hancock Boston Fox.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Continental frigates ''Hancock'' and ''Boston'' capturing British frigate ''Fox'', 7 June 1777]]

Three days later, the Marine Committee requested Continental Congress to authorize the construction of thirteen [[w:frigates|frigates]]; outfitted with five ships of 32-guns, five of 18-guns, three of 24-guns. It would supplement the warships already in service. Although Congress saw the purpose of using a national naval force to protect colonial merchant trade and commerce from the British blockaders, since it was played a big part in funding the American Revolutionary War. Congress and the state assemblies believed that the Continental navy should only be used for special missions, or other urgency and importance; state navies and privateers would malignity fight the naval battles of the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref name=Mevers&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Congress accepted the program on the recommendation that the construction of the frigates be decentralized and apportioned accordingly: [[w:Province of New Hampshire|Province of New Hampshire]] (one), [[w:Province of Massachusetts Bay|Province of Massachusetts Bay]] (two), [[w:Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] (two), [[w:Connecticut Colony|Connecticut Colony]] (one), [[w:Province of New York|Province of New York]] (two), [[w:Province of Maryland|Province of Maryland]] (one), and [[w:Province of Pennsylvania|Province of Pennsylvania]] (four).&lt;ref name=NDAR-III:90&gt;''Journals of the Continental Congress'' (13 December 1775); Naval Documents of the American Revolution, III: 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine Committee planned the first of the frigates to be fitted for the sea service by March 1776. However the difficulty of recruiting seamen (sailors and marines), getting funding for ship construction, and the getting past the British blockade. None of the thirteen Continental frigates sailed to sea in 1776. And all were either captured, or destroyed, between 1777–1781.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; While the marines were finally armed, they were not equipped with standardized uniforms.

By 17 December 1775 Congress had authorized the construction of 13 new [[w:frigate|frigate]]s, rather than refitting merchantmen to increase the fleet.  Five ships ([[w:USS Hancock (1776)|USS ''Hancock'']], [[USS Raleigh (1776)|USS ''Raleigh'']],  [[w:USS Randolph (1776)|USS ''Randolph'']], [[USS Warren (1776)|USS ''Warren'']], and USS ''Washington'') were to be rated 32 guns, five (USS ''Effingham'', USS ''Montgomery'', USS ''Providence'', [[USS Trumbull (1776)|USS ''Trumbull'']], and USS ''Virginia'') 28 guns, and three ([[USS Boston (1777)|USS ''Boston'']], USS ''Congress'', and USS ''Delaware'') 24 guns. Of the eight frigates that made it to sea, all were captured or sunk.

USS ''Washington'', USS ''Effingham'', USS ''Congress'', and USS ''Montgomery'' were scuttled or burned in October and November 1777 before going to sea to prevent their capture by the British. [[w:USS Virginia (1776)|USS ''Virginia'']], commanded by Captain [[w:James Nicholson|James Nicholson]], made a number of unsuccessful attempts to break through the blockade of [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay]].  On 31 March 1778, in another attempt, she ran aground near [[w:Hampton Roads|Hampton Roads]], where her captain went ashore.  Shortly after, [[w:HMS Emerald 1762)|HMS ''Emerald'']] and [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] appeared on the scene to accept her surrender.

---------------------------
Guarding American commerce and raiding British commerce and supply were the principal duties of the Continental Navy.  Much of its accomplishments is recorded as prizes taken in [[commerce raiding]], which, as was the practice of the time, brought personal gain to officers and crew.  

Most of the eight frigates that went to sea took multiple prizes and had semi-successful cruises before their captures, however there were exceptions.  On 27 September 1777, [[w:USS Delaware (1776)|USS ''Delaware'']] participated in a delaying action on the Delaware River against the British army pursuing George Washington's forces.  The ebb tide arrived and left the ''Delaware'' stranded, leading to her capture.

USS ''Warren'' was blockaded in [[w:Providence, Rhode Island|Providence, Rhode Island]], shortly after her completion, and did not break out of the blockade until 8 March 1778. After a successful cruise under Captain [[w:John Burroughs Hopkins|John Burroughs Hopkins]], she was assigned to the ill-fated [[w:Penobscot Expedition|Penobscot Expedition]] under Captain [[w:Dudley Saltonstall|Dudley Saltonstall]], where she was trapped by the British and burned on 15 August 1779 to prevent her capture.

USS ''Hancock'', captained by [[w:John Manley (naval officer)| John Manley]], managed to capture two merchantmen as well as the Royal Navy vessel [[HMS Fox (1773)|HMS ''Fox'']].  Later on 8 July 1777, however, the ''Hancock'' was captured by HMS ''Rainbow'' of a pursuing squadron, and became the British man of war ''Iris''.

USS ''Randolph'' took five prizes in her early cruises.  In 7 March 1778, she was escorting a convoy of merchantmen when the British 64-gun ship [[w:HMS Yarmouth (1748)|HMS ''Yarmouth'']] bore down on the convoy.  ''Randolph'', under the command of Captain [[w:Nicholas Biddle (naval officer)|Nicholas Biddle]] came to the defense of the merchantmen and engaged the heavily superior foe.  In the ensuing engagement, the two ships were both severely manhandled but in the course of the action, the magazine of the ''Randolph'' exploded causing the destruction of the entire vessel and all but four of her crew. The falling debris from the explosion severely damaged the ''Yarmouth'' enough that she could no longer pursue the American ships.

[[Image:Naval Jack of the United States.svg|thumb|Continental Navy Jack]]
[[USS Raleigh (1776)|USS ''Raleigh'']], under the command of Captain [[w:John Barry (naval officer)| John Barry]], captured three prizes before being run aground in action on 27 September 1778.  Her crew scuttled her, but she was raised by the British who refloated her for further use in the name of the Crown.

USS ''Boston'', under the command of Captains [[w:Hector McNeill|Hector McNeill]] and [[w:Samuel Tucker|Samuel Tucker]], had captured 17 prizes in earlier cruises, and had carried John Adams to France in February and March 1778.  She was captured (along with the frigate USS ''Providence'' who had taken 14 prizes in her own service under Captain [[w:Abraham Whipple|Abraham Whipple]]) in the fall of [[w:Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, South Carolina]] on 12 May 1780.

The final frigate to meet her end of Continental service was the USS ''Trumbull'', which had not gone to sea until September 1779 under [[James Nicholson (naval officer)| James Nicholson]], had gained acclaim in bloody action against the Letter of Marque HMS ''Watt''.  On 28 August 1781, she met HMS ''Iris'' and ''General Monk'' and engaged.  In the action, USS ''Trumbull'' was forced to surrender to the former American naval vessels (the ''General Monk'' was the captured Rhode Island privateer USS ''General Washington'', itself recaptured in April 1782 and placed in service with the Continental Navy).

---------------------------
Of the members of the committee of thirteen chosen December 14, 1775, &quot;for carrying into execution the resolutions of Congress for fitting out armed vessels,&quot; ten had served on the committee of twelve which had recommended building the frigates and five had been members of the original Naval Committee. This new committee, consisting of one representative from each colony, became the second executive body for the administration of naval affairs. It was called the Marine Committee and was at first constituted as follows: Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire, John Hancock of Massachusetts, Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, Silas Deane of Connecticut, Francis Lewis of New York, Stephen Crane of New Jersey, Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, George Read of Delaware, Samuel Chase of Maryland, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia, Joseph Hewes of North Carolina, Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina, and John Houston of Georgia. The membership changed from time to time. The Naval Committee continued in the meantime to occupy itself in fitting out the small fleet of vessels purchased for the service and placed under the command of Commodore Hopkins, and to prepare for an expedition which was being planned. January 25,1776, although the Marine Committee had already taken charge of general naval affairs, Congress voted to leave the direction of this fleet to the Naval Committee, which soon afterwards, this duty being accomplished, ceased to exist (Jour. Cont. Congr., January 25,1776.) The Marine Committee employed agents to supervise the construction of the frigates in the distant colonies, taking charge itself of those at Philadelphia. Before the end of the year 1775 the organization of a Continental navy was achieved.

In the course of time the mass of details connected with naval administration became too much for the Marine Committee easily to handle. Prize agents in the various seacoast towns were appointed to superintend the trial and condemnation of the prizes taken by Continental cruisers. Most of the prize agents were also Continental agents, in which capacity they performed various other duties of a naval sort. John Bradford at Boston had the most important of these agencies (Am. Arch., V, ii, 1113, 1114.) For the further relief of the Marine Committee and at their suggestion, Congress appointed three persons, November 6, 1776, &quot;to execute the business of the navy, under the direction&quot; of the committee. This body of three was known as the Navy Board and the men appointed to serve on it were John Nixon and John Wharton of Pennsylvania and Francis Hopkinson of New Jersey. The lack of maritime knowledge and experience among members of Congress was keenly felt at this time. William Ellery of Rhode Island, who had recently become a member of the Marine Committee, wrote home to his friend William Vernon, November 7, 1776, &quot;The Conduct of the Affairs of a Navy as well as those of an Army We are yet to learn. We are still unacquainted with the systematical Management of them.&quot; (Publications of R.I. Hist. Soc., viii (January, 1901), 201.) April 19, 1777, another committee of three was authorized, to take charge of naval affairs in New England; the men selected for this board were William Vernon of Rhode Island, James Warren of Massachusetts, and John Deshon of Connecticut. The first of these boards was then called the Navy Board of the Middle Department or District, the second the Navy Board of the Eastern Department, or they were called the boards at Philadelphia and at Boston respectively (Jour. Cont. Congr., April 23, November 6,1776, April 19,1777.)

With further experience it became apparent that the Marine Committee was too large and its members too deficient in special knowledge of naval science to admit of prompt, capable, and expert handling of the affairs entrusted to them. In October, 1776, John Paul Jones wrote to Robert Morris (Am. Arch., V, ii, 1106; Sands, 55) that efficiency in naval administration could only be obtained by the appointment of a competent board of admiralty. William Ellery wrote to William Vernon, February 26, 1777: &quot;The Congress are fully sensible of the Importance of having a respectable Navy and have endeavoured to form and equip One, but through Ignorance and Neglect they have not been able to accomplish their Purpose yet. I hope however to see One afloat before long. A proper Board of Admiralty is very much wanted. The Members of Congress are unacquainted with this Department. As One of the Marine Committee I sensibly feel my Ignorance in this Respect.&quot; (Publ. R. I. Hist. Soc., viii, 204.) For three years, however, little was done in the way of improving administration except the appointment of the navy boards and agents. Finally, October 28, 1779, upon the recommendation of the Marine Committee a Board of Admiralty was established by Congress. This was a body of five members, two of whom were to be members of Congress, while the other three, called commissioners, were to be men possessing a knowledge of naval matters. A quorum of three was necessary for the transaction of business. The Marine Committee then came to an end, but the navy boards at Philadelphia and Boston and the navy agents were retained under this reorganization (Jour. Cont. Congr., June 9, October 28, 1779.)

==1776–1777==
Commodore Esek Hopkins's fleet—along with marine detachments of 230 men—departed Philadelphia on 4 January 1776. Samuel Nicholas's Continental marines embarked onto five vessels for their maiden voyage, this was the first [[w:expeditionary warfare|naval expedition]] for the Continental Navy-Marine Corps. The Marine Committee given them the task to patrol the southern American coastline to intercept and clear any presence of British troops along the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]], and [[w:Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake Bay]], then return north to New England and perform similar services.&lt;ref&gt;Letter:  Naval Committee to Commodore Esek Hopkins (5 January 1776); NDAR, III: 637–638.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for reasons that remain a controversy, Hopkins disregarded his orders and sailed for the Caribbean Islands instead. During this expedition, Hopkins ordered Nicholas's marines ashore epitomizing the first [[w:amphibious warfare (United States|amphibious landing]], also for the first time, the infamous command: &quot;Land the landing force!&quot;, has been used in America's history. Their efforts allowed Washington's Continental army to be supplied with [[w:matériel|matériel]], gunpowder, and arms. Naval stores were greatly needed at all times and the Marine Committee took measures to obtain them in the West Indies, the depot for European goods of that kind. Ships of war were largely employed for their transportation.

Heavily laden with the valuable supplies, Hopkins's fleet departed New Providence on 17 March 1776. By summer of 1776, Hopkins's squadron returned to Philadelphia. Most of the sailors and Marines were riddled by diseases, desertion, and resignation of officers.  The Continental Congress struggled to find more crews to man the Navy's ships; throughout the autumn and winter of 1776, the Marine detachments were moved from vessel to vessel and were temporarily reinforced by the Continental Army and militia.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;&gt;

While Hopkins and Nicholas were sailing the Atlantic and Caribbean, Congress authorized the Marine Committee to purchase two more brigantines for the Continental Navy. The Marine Committee purchased brigantine ''Wild  Duck'', from the [[w:Maryland Committee of Safety|Maryland Committee of Safety]] and renamed her [[w:USS Lexington (1776)|USS ''Lexington'']], commemorating the [[w:battle of Lexington|battle in Lexington]] which took place earlier on 19 April 1775. The brigantine ''Lexington'' was turned over to &quot;Wharton and Humphrey's Shipyard&quot; in Philadelphia for fitting for Continental service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l/lexington.htm  History of ''USS Lexington'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:John Barry|John Barry]] was commissioned as a Captain in the Continental Navy, dated March 14, 1776; along with this commission went command of the brig USS ''Lexington'', his first warship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/people/commodorebarry.htm Biography of  Commodore John Barry]&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine Committee of the Continental Congress purchased [[w:merchantman|merchantman]] ''Molly'' on 28 March 1776; renamed her [[w:USS Reprisal (1776)|USS ''Reprisal'']] and placed under the command of Captain [[w:Lambert Wickes|Lambert Wickes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r/reprisal.htm History  of ''USS Reprisal'']&lt;/ref&gt; These two vessels were to be used to supplement the efforts of the [[w:Pennsylvania Navy|Pennsylvania Navy]], and the Continental vessels, in clearing the lower approaches of the [[w:Delaware River|Delaware River]] from British raiders. Congress approved the Marine Committee's request for new officers; fourteen new officer were commissioned in the Continental Marine Corps; also as a result, they appointed a ship captain and four new additional Marine officers for each vessel, all of whom by March 1776 had recruited enough enlisted marines to serve aboard the ships.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt;

When Commodore Hopkins and Nicholas's Continental marines reached [[w:New London, Connecticut|New London, Connecticut]], on 8 April, from the New Providence expedition, the Americans were at first welcomed as heroes. However, many of the officers of the American squadron voiced dissatisfaction with Hopkins. The officers of both the navy and marines that had to serve with Hopkins had difficult times dealing with his aggressive ego. Samuel Nicholas was promoted to [[w:Major (United States)|Major]] on 25 June. With notification of his promotion he was ordered to report to the Marine Committee. The Committee detached him from USS ''Alfred'' and ordered him to remain in the city, &quot;to discipline four companies of Marines and prepare them for service as Marine guards for the frigates on the stocks.&quot; Having recruited and thoroughly organized for companies, he requested arms and equipment for them. Elsewhere, USS ''Alfred'', under command by John Paul Jones, continued to raid British commerce while the rest of Hopkins's squadron awaited repairs or more crewmen. Congress however, was utterly disappointed in Commodore Esek Hopkins's disobeying of orders.&lt;ref name=Millet/&gt; Dissatisfaction with the achievements of the fleet, and its subsequent inactivity in Rhode Island, led to an investigation by Congress. Censured for disobedience of orders, Hopkins returned to the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins (Britannica)&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/271525/Esek-Hopkins A Biography of Commodore E.

On 16 November 1776, the brigantine USS ''Andrew Doria'', commandeered by Captain [[w:Isaiah Robinson|Isaiah Robinson]], sailed to the Dutch island of [[w:Sint Eustatius|Sint Eustatius]], in the [[w:Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands Antilles]] of the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]]. Upon arrival, Captain Robinson issued a &quot;[[w:11-guns salute|11-guns salute]]&quot;, Governor [[w:Johannes de Graaff|Johannes de Graaff]] of Sint Eustatius responded by firing the cannons from Fort Oranje. The gun salute gained such great publicity because the it was the ''first'' international recognition of the independence of the [[w:United Colonies|United Colonies]] (the [[w:United States of America|United States]]). This historical event inspired the title for [[w:Barbara Tuchman|Barbara Tuchman]]'s 1998 book, ''&quot;The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution&quot;''.

Captain Isaac Craig accepted a commission as a captain in Colonel Thomas Proctor’s Pennsylvania Regiment of Artillery (later becoming the 4th Continental Artillery under General Washington). While with the Army, he was in the [[w:Battle of Brandywine|Battle of Brandywine]], on September 11th, 1777, and the [[w:Battle of Germantown|Battle of Germantown]]. On October 4th, 1777. He continued to serve throughout the war with the army under General Washington. Captain Robert Mullan's company returned to Philadelphia as prisoner guards after they found that there was no ship to man, disbanding in April 1777. Many would also return to Philadelphia in the spring to become part of the detachments of the new Continental galley [[w:USS Washington (1776 row galley)|USS ''Washington'']] [the third ship to be named as such] and the frigate [[w:USS Delaware (1776)|USS ''Delaware'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, Hopkins fleet again set out at sea in the Atlantic, on 29 May 1776, the Continental sailors and Marines aboard brigantine USS ''Andrew Doria'' captured two British transports, with each bearing an infantry company.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt; Hereafter, Hopkins's squadron patrolled the coast of New England as far north to Nova Scotia for the rest of the spring of 1776.

----------------------

Towards the end of the year 1776 some of the thirteen frigates authorized by Congress in December, 1775, were nearly ready for service. The Raleigh's keel was laid at Portsmouth March 21 and just two months later she was ready to enter the water. &quot;On Tuesday the 21st inst. the Continental Frigate of thirty-two guns, built at this place under the direction of John Langdon, Esq., was Launched amidst the acclamation of many thousand spectators. She is esteemed by all those who are judges that have seen her, to be one of the compleatest ships ever built in America. The unwearied diligence and care of the three Master-Builders, Messrs. Hacket, Hill and Paul, together with Mr. Thompson under whose inspection she was built, and the good order and industry of the Carpenters deserve particular notice; scarcely a single instance of a person being in liquor, or any difference among the men in the yard during the time of her building, every man with pleasure exerting himself to the utmost; and altho' the greatest care was taken that only the best of timber was used and the work perform'd in a most masterly manner, the whole time from her raising to the day she launched did not exceed sixty working days, and what afforded a most pleasing view (which was manifest in the countenance of the spectators) this noble fabrick was compleatly to her anchors in the main channel in less than six minutes from the time [of] the run, without the least hurt; and what is truly remarkable, not a single person met with the least accident in launching, tho' near five hundred men were employed in and about her when ran off.&quot; (New Hampshire Gazette, May 25, 1776, quoted in N. H. General Rec., January, 1907.)

On September 21 the Marine Committee directed that the frigates Boston, Captain Hector McNeill, and Raleigh, Captain Thomas Thompson, should be fitted out as expeditiously as possible, and these vessels were ordered to cruise in Massachusetts Bay and to the eastward, in search of the British frigate Milford. October 23 these orders were modified by joining with these two vessels the frigate Hancock, and instructions were issued for Captains Manley, McNeill, and Thompson: &quot;You are hereby directed to act in concert and Cruize together for the following purposes and on the following stations. Your first object must be to inform yourselves in the best manner possible, if any of the British men of war are Cruizing in the bay of Boston or off the Coast of Massachusetts, and all such you are to endeavour with your utmost force to take, sink, or destroy. Having effected this service you are to proceed together towards Rhode Island and there make prize of or destroy any of the enemies Ships of war that may be found Cruizing off the Harbour or Coast of Rhode Island. The Prizes you make are to be sent into the nearest Port. When you arrive at Rhode Island, if Commodore Hopkins should not be already sailed on his Southern expedition and the two frigates built in that State should not be ready for the Sea, in that case you are to join Commodore Hopkins and proceed with him on the said expedition, producing those orders to him to justify the measure. But if the Rhode Island frigates should be ready for the sea, there will be no Occasion for you or either of you to go Southward. And you will then proceed, taking with you any Continental Vessel that may be at Rhode Island and ready, if Commodore Hopkins should be sailed before you come there, and proceed to Cruize against the enemies Ships &amp; Vessels that may be found off the Coast between the Harbour of Newport and the Banks of Newfoundland. We have no doubt from your zeal and attachment to the cause of America that you will execute this service with all possible dispatch and vigor, and so bid you heartily farewell.&quot; (Mar. Com. Letter Book, 39.) The frigate Randolph, built at Philadelphia, was put under the command of Captain Biddle and was expected to sail before the end of the year. For one reason or another, however, chiefly, no doubt, the difficulty of manning the ships and the British blockade, no Continental frigate got to sea in 1776 (Am. Arch., V, ii, 428, 1200, iii, 826, 827, 1198, 1254, 1332, 1484; Mar. Com. Letter Book, 21, 22, 23, 24 (September 21, 1776.)

In October the Reprisal was placed at the disposal of the Committee of Secret Correspondence of Congress and the Lexington, Andrew Doria, and Sachem were put under the orders of the Secret Committee; these were two distinct committees. These vessels, in addition to other duties, carried important dispatches. The Reprisal was ordered to take Franklin, who had been appointed a commissioner to France, to his post; and afterwards to cruise in the English Channel. She sailed about the 1st of November and anchored in Quiberon Bay a month later; two small prizes were taken during the voyage. Franklin went ashore at Auray, and made the best of his way to Paris, where he arrived December 22 (Mar. Com. Letter Book, 34, 35 (October 17, 18, 1776); Pap. Cont. Congr., 37, 75, 83, 95 (October 24, 1776) ; Am. Arch., V, ii, 1092, 1115, 1197-1199, 1211-1213, 1215, iii, 1197.)

The Lexington, Captain William Hallock, went to the West Indies in the service of the Secret Committee of Congress and on her way back from Cape Francois, in December, was captured off the Delaware capes by the British frigate Pearl. About this time there were six British ships in this vicinity or stationed in the bay, which at the end of the year was closely blockaded. A lieutenant and a small prize crew were put on the Lexington and seventy of her own crew were left on board. The same evening these prisoners recaptured the ship and, though without officers to direct them, took her safe into port (Am. Arch., V, iii, 1484, 1486; Mag. Amer. Hist., March, 1878, narrative of Lieutenant Matthewman; Port Folio, June, 1814, memoir of Commodore Dale.)

Under orders dated October 17, 1776, the Andrew Doria, Captain Isaiah Robinson, sailed for the Dutch island of St. Eustatius for a cargo of military supplies. Upon arriving at that place and anchoring in the roads, November 16, the Andrew Doria fired a salute of eleven guns, which was returned by the fort with two guns less, as for a merchantman. This has been called the first salute given the American flag in a foreign port, but about three weeks before this an American schooner had had her colors saluted at the Danish island of St. Croix. In response to a British complaint the salute to the Andrew Doria was disavowed by the Dutch government and the governor of St. Eustatius was recalled. The Andrew Doria, having taken on the stores for which she was sent, sailed for Philadelphia. On the return voyage, near Porto Rico, she captured the British twelve-gun sloop of war Racehorse after an engagement of two hours. A few days later another prize was taken, but was recaptured. The Andrew Doria and Racehorse arrived safely in port (Barney, 47-51; Amer. Hist. Rev., viii (July, 1903), 691-695; N. E. Mag., July, 1893; Mar. Com. Letter Book, 34; Pap. Cont. Congr., 28, 173 (March 28,177

==1777–1778==
==1778–1779==

Before the Franco-American Alliance, the royalist French government attempted to maintain a state of respectful neutrality during the Revolutionary War.  That being said, the nation maintained neutrality at face value, often openly harboring Continental vessels and supplying to their needs.  

With the presence of American diplomats [[w:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] and Silas Deane, the Continental Navy gained a permanent link to French affairs.  Through Franklin and likeminded agents, Continental officers were afforded the ability to receive commissions, survey, and purchase prospective ships for military use.  

Early in the conflict, Captains [[w:Lambert Wickes|Lambert Wickes]] and [[w:Gustavus Conyngham|Gustavus Conyngham]] operated out of various French ports for the purpose of commerce raiding.  The French did attempt to enforce her neutrality by seizing [[USS Dolphin (1777)|USS ''Dolphin'']] and [[USS Surprise (1777)|USS ''Surprise'']]. However, with the commencement of the official alliance in 1778, ports were officially open to Continental ships.

The most prominent Continental officer to operate out of France was Captain John Paul Jones. Jones had been preying upon British commerce aboard the [[USS Ranger (1777)|USS ''Ranger'']] but only now saw the opportunity for higher command. The French loaned Jones the merchantman, ''Duc de Duras'', which Jones refitted and renamed [[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|USS ''Bonhomme Richard'']] as a more powerful replacement for the USS ''Ranger''. In August 1779, Jones was given command of a squadron of vessels of both American and French ownership. The goal was not only to harass British commerce but also to prospectively land 1500 French regulars in the lightly guarded western regions of Britain.  Unfortunately for the ambitious Jones, the French pulled out of the agreement pertaining to an invasion force, but the French did manage to uphold the plan regarding his command of the naval squadron. Sailing in a clockwise fashion around Ireland and down the east coast of Britain, the squadron captured a number of merchantmen.  The French commander Landais decided early on in the expedition to retain control of the French ships, thereby often leaving and rejoining the effort when he felt it was fortuitous.  

[[Image:Serapis and Bonhomme Richard.jpg|thumb|right|The Franco-American squadron closely engages the pair of British frigates on 23 September 1779.]]

On 23 September 1779, Jones' squadron was off [[w:Flamborough Head|Flamborough Head]] when the British men-of-war HMS ''Countess of Scarborough'' and [[HMS Serapis (1779)|HMS ''Serapis'']] bore down on the Franco-American force.  The lone Continental frigate, USS ''Bonhomme Richard'' engaged the HMS ''Serapis''.  In a  particularly bloody, destructive fight, the English captain called out  to inquire if the USS ''Bonhomme Richard'' had struck her colors.  Jones cried out, &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot;  Upon raking the HMS ''Serapis'', the crew of the USS ''Bonhomme Richard'' led by Jones boarded the English ship and captured her. Likewise, the French frigate ''D'Pallas'' captured her prize the HMS ''Countess of Scarborough''. Two days later, the USS ''Bonhomme Richard'' sank from the overwhelming amount of shock she took from the struggle.

The action stuck out as an embarrassing defeat for the Royal Navy, who suffered the capture of two of her vessels in her own home waters.

In a like fashion, the French loaned the Continental Navy the use of the corvette [[USS Ariel (1777)|USS ''Ariel'']].  The one [[w:ship of the line|ship-of-the-line]] built for service in the Continental Navy, the 74-gun [[USS America (1782)|USS ''America'']] , was instead offered as a gift to France on 3 September 1782 in compensation for the loss of [[w:Le Magnifique (ship-of-the-line)|''Le Magnifique'']] in service to the American Revolution.

==1782–1783==
At the end of the Revolution in 1783, both the Continental Navy and Marines were disbanded in April. Although individual Marines stayed on for  the few American naval vessels left, the last Continental Marine was discharged in September. In all, there were 131 Colonial Marine officers and probably no more than 2,000 enlisted Colonial Marines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RevMarines&quot;/&gt;
Though individual Marines were enlisted for the few American naval vessels, the organization would not be re-created until 1798.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Syntax Revision==
I added a few sentences to the Syntax section and left the existing text.  I don't think the other text is really necessary but I didn't want to eliminate all of it outright.  The syntax section should be short and sweet.  Define/describe syntax, note its importance, and maybe give different examples (from different languages).  I almost started explaining the finer points of parsing such as tokenizing and tree building but it's not necessary to know those things in order to write a program. --[[User:TastyWheat|TastyWheat]] ([[User talk:TastyWheat|talk]]) 19:08, 14 April 2010 (UTC)

== Forked document? ==

I came across this wikibook after searching for [http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/programming/intro/ a programming tutorial I had found earlier]. It looks like this document has been forked at some point, as it has more chapters (and *is* divided) there, yet there are also edits here. I believe Lawrence is the original author, considering [http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/introduction_to_programming.html the backstory]. Perhaps a consolidation is in order? On second thought, Lkesteloot who posted it here almost certainly is Lawrence Kesteloot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is so inaccurate, it's more of a joke than anything with useful information. I don't know enough about the format to be able to fix it myself, but this article would be better of just being deleted entirely unless someone knowledgeable is willing to rework the whole thing.

tl:dr - Delete this article. It's for the best.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;First Nations&quot; is the name given to the peoples descended from those who inhabited Canada at the time of its discovery by European explorers.  The First Nations are organised into a number of different tribes, each with its own unique social structure and beliefs.  It is believed that they arrived in North America via an ice bridge between Alaska and eastern Russia during the last ice age.  Differences in geography have divided the First Nations into five major groups, each of them having different resources, technologies, and spiritual stories.  Within those major groups, there are multiple tribes. The five major groups are as follows:

== Inuit ==

The Inuit people live the farthest north of all the First Nations.  Inuit ancestry goes back hundreds of thousands of years in the Canadian Arctic. Staying alive while living in the Arctic was difficult, and people lived on every last resource they could find.  

== Northwest Coast ==
The People of the Northwest Coast were very &quot;spoiled&quot; as far as natural resources go. They had plenty of food that could easily be stored and preserved.  This allowed them to develop a complex social structure and gave them the ability to live in either their winter or summer houses.

== Plains ==
The people of the plains moved from place to place following buffalo, their main source of food and tools.  Obviously, they lived on the great plains of Canada and the United States.

== Plateau ==
The people of the plateau lived in western Canada, but not as far west as the Pacific Ocean. They had winter pit houses and relied on hunting, gathering and fishing for food.

== Iroquois ==
The Iroquois were located in present day southern Ontario and around the Great Lakes.  They used agriculture as a primary source of food and lived in large towns sometimes containing as many as 1000 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter 4 begins the &quot;things to come&quot; section of Revelation. From here to the conclusion, Revelation takes a prophetic form. Some of the prophecies may have already been fulfilled, some are clearly in the future, and some are double: They have been fulfilled in one sense and will be fulfilled again later. Chapters 4 and 5 also serve to establish Christ's right and authority to act as judge of the earth and its inhabitants. 

==John's Vision of the Throne of God==
===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, “Come up hither, and I will show you things which must be hereafter.”'''''

''Commentary:''  Chapter four begins with the phrase, &quot;After this,&quot; points to a transition in literary styles as well as a shift in John's vision.  In Chapters two and three, John individually addresses seven churches in Asia; however, Chapter four does not seem to have a specific audience like the two previous chapters.  The door and &quot;come up hither&quot; symbolize the change in scene for John.  John was now able to see some of the mysteries of God and able to report them back to us. John also did not open the door himself, God opened this door for him which reveals how one enters Heaven. It is by God's will not our own.  However, it is interesting to note that John is clearly separating these sections of the book, but he is employing  the same image of the door that he employed while addressing the churches.  John further signal to the reader that he is shifting back into a description of his heavenly vision by referring back to, &quot;The first voice which I heard,&quot; which he recognizes as Jesus.  Additionally, John once again shifts into description through simile, which he then employs throughout the rest of Chapter four.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And immediately I was in the spirit and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.'''''

''Commentary:'' The immediacy of the transport is to be noted. John's statement is harmonious with Paul's in I Cor. 15:51-52: &quot;Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed&quot; (KJV). 

&quot;In the spirit&quot; means totally immersed in a vision. John was not physically there, that is in body, but his spirit experienced that which believers currently await: the rapture. John sees a throne, and the following verses show that the figure sitting on the throne is God the Father.

The throne is a central symbol of this work.  This was an image familiar in the minds of the initial readers representing power, justice, and the established authority structure.  In this and following chapters, John will offer an alternative authority structure in which God’s majesty and justice will prevail.  This would have been immensely comforting to Christians who were being treated unjustly by their government.  Today it might serve as a warning to modern Western Christians who often benefit from the current authority structures.  Believers still ought to hold the model given in this chapter as the standard against which to measure their own governments&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge Univeristy Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardius stone, and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like an emerald.'''''

''Commentary:'' The gems and rainbow ( a reminder of God's faithfulness and promise to  Noah after the great flood in Genesis 9:13) are John's way of describing intense glory, a beautiful sight.

These stones are also mentioned, along with other stones, in Exodus 28:17-20. In Exodus, the stones are found with 7 others on the breastplate of a high priest. Sardius is a blood-red stone that symbolizes the sacrifice of blood (the first-coming of Christ and his death on the cross). Jasper is a white stone that symbolizes total power. In the verses in Exodus, the first stone is Sardius and symbolizes the first-coming of Christ and Jasper is the last stone, symbolizing the second-coming of Christ. Since the order is reversed in this passage from Revelation, we can interpret the meaning in a reflective way: John, receiving a vision of the world after the second-coming sees the Jasper most recently and the Sardius (the crucifixion) further back in time.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And round about the throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and they had on their heads crowns of gold.'''''

''Commentary:'' The number four-and-twenty could go back to King David's division of the Levitical priesthood into 24 sections (I Chronicles 24:7-19) or it could refer to twelve plus twelve, symbolizing the tribes of Israel plus the disciples.  Other suggestions for the meaning of the twenty four elders include that they are angelic figures on a heavenly council, they represent saints in heaven, or that they are representatives of the church in heaven. An elder is a person that is chosen by God to represent Him and minister to the saints. The 24 elders, then, represent a much larger number of saints in heaven. They are a representation of all the righteousness in Heaven. They have &quot;seats&quot; of authority and &quot;crowns&quot; of reward. The white garments signify righteousness which has now been judged and purified. Note that the Old Testament saints are not present. They will be resurrected and rewarded after the Tribulation (Daniel 12:1-3).
The white robes symbolize purity. This image is depicting heavenly worship. When the priests later take off their crowns and bow, it is showing their revrence. This verse is also depicting heavenly worship.

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.'''''

''Commentary:'' Throughout the Bible, the divine supremcy and the power of God has been demonstrated by comparisons with lightening, thunder, other powerful natural disasters(Matthew 28:2). This also shows that God is present but not physically visible, parallel to th rest of scripture. The term &quot;before the throne&quot; is John's moving the scene of the vision to before the throne. Before the throne, there are seven lamps or seven spirits. However, it is debated whether or not the seven spirits are the Holy Spirt or angels. An argument that these seven spirits may be angels come from passages such as Luke 9:26 and 1 Timothy 5:21 as angelic beings are placed in the position of glory and honor equal to God the Father and God the Son. In addition, throughout the New Testament the term spirit is used in reference to angels. Revelation also does speak of angels very frequently.  But another argument posed could be that the seven lamps or seven spirits symbolize the completeness of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is said to be the light, but all three parts of the Divine Trinity are present within the lamp, or spirit. There is only one spirit of God, but there are multiple manifestations of Him. Fire and it's burning characteristics have been a symbol of God throughout the Bible to show God's powerful consumption. The flashes and sounds are John's attempt to convey a sense of majesty, holiness, and supernatural activity beyond his understanding.

==The Four Creatures Around the Throne==
===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And before the throne there was a sea of glass like crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four creatures full of eyes in front and behind.'''''

''Commentary:''There has been a  discrepancy among theologians on what exactly the &quot;sea of glass&quot; symbolizes. Some believe it is not merely a body of water or actual clear class, but rather is a representation of mass amount of humanity (whose numbers are expansive like that of a vast sea). The crystal may be interpreted to symbolize the very purity, flawlessness or righteousness of the people. Other scholars and theologians believe the &quot;sea of glass&quot; is the floor, which is likened to a sea because it continues into the distance. If you take it to be a body of water, it could symbolish how you must be clean and purified to get close to God. The &quot;creatures&quot; are the special angels (Ezekiel 10:15-22) who guard the Throne of God. The eyes symbolize wisdom and all-seeing vigilance.
The animals are like a lion and a calf. But, all these different creatures represent humans. Some say that the four creatures zepict the four  signs of the zodiac. This is interesting because many people say that Revelation has a lot of reference to cosmology. Thus, this keeps with the theme of cosmology and mysticism in the book.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the first creature was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.'''''

''Commentary:'' The four living creatures may be heavenly beings representing humankind and all animals.  The lion could represent strength (Psalms 103:20), the calf service (Hebrews 1:14), the face of a man intelligence (Luke 2:52), and the eagle swiftness (Daniel 9:21). The whole vision has a strong allusion to Ezekiel 1:4-14 with possible connections to the imagery used in Isa. 6. Some speculate that the animals may be that of the zodiac. The sign for Aquarius, however, would be replaced by an eagle. And yet others argue that the animals represent the creation of God ceaselessly praising. The eagle would represent the animals of the sky, the cow represents the domestic animals, the lion represents the wild animals, and that with a face like man represents humanity.

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the four creatures each had six wings about them, and they were full of eyes within, and they rested not day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The wings show ability to move quickly. These creatures are perfect guardians, seeing everything, missing nothing, and never resting. No one would be able to approach God's throne without being seen by one of these creatures.The eyes of the creatures were also able to see everything that happened in Heaven and on Earth. The praise they give here and the elders' response is for John's benefit, to establish the authority stated in the next verse. Worshiping the Lord is initiated by these four creatures, as evidenced in the next verse, displaying the order in worship.

This verse has strong allusions to Isaiah 6.  As stated in verses 2-3, &quot;Seraphs were in attendance above him, each had six wings...  And one called to another and said:  &quot;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&quot;

===Verses 9-11===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when those creatures gave glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; the four and twenty elders fell down before him that sat on the throne, and worshiped him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; “You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power, for you have created all things, and by your will they are and were created.”'''''

''Commentary:'' God has the sovereign authority to rule and to judge all things because He is both holy and the ''creator'' of all things. Even Satan is God's creation, and God has also the authority to judge him. Satan and his minions are allowed free reign only until they have completed their divine purpose, after which they cannot escape judgment.
Where the verse says, &quot;cast their crowns before the thrown...&quot; this could be interrupted literately as if they were sacrificing there crowns to God, just as the Wise Men brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to Jesus at his birth.  This can also be seen as a metaphor for the kings and rulers of the Earth (evident by their crowns which normally signify leadership) giving up their rule over mankind to God in a gesture that states that they are not worthy to rule which can be shown by their act of bowing before him.  When they state &quot;you are worthy,&quot; this is also clarifying that they do not believe that they are worthy to have such power since the Bible states that all men are equal in the eyes of God.  Therefore, only he, being a superior and divine being, would have such authority.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Only the Lamb Is Found Worthy to Open the Book of Judgment== 

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book with writing inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.'''''

''Commentary:'' The &quot;book&quot; is actually a scroll with seven messages, each separated by a seal that has to be broken. It is interesting to note that the author took the time to indicate in which hand the scroll was held.  Most readers of the Bible are familiar with Jesus sitting at the right hand of God, indicating Jesus' elevated and honored status.  By extension, the fact that the scroll is described as being held in the right hand of God is a clear indication of the scroll's importance and value.

The next piece of information readers are given about the scroll is that it contains writing on both the front and the back.  If scrolls were used during this time period, the writing was largely found only on the front of the papyrus.  Some scholars, who have studied this image, have suggested that the additional writing apparent on the back merely indicates that the scroll is very full.  While this is possible, given that there are other ancient authors such as Martial who indicate that it was unusual and somewhat unseemly to write on the back of scrolls.  However, alternate translations show that the writing was &quot;written on the inside, and sealed on the back,&quot; indicating that all the writing is inside the scroll.

The seals themselves are also fascinating.  The seven seal on the scroll, open one at a time, and when one is opened, one message is revealed.  When the Book of Revelation was written, the vast majority of sealed documents were official document or wiils, or treaties.  The purpose of the seal was to show that the important message had not been read before it reached the intended receiver.  

Whereas Revelation chapter 4 is about God and his creation, Revelation chapter 5 moves on to talk about God and his role in redemption.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?”'''''

''Commentary:'' The Father ''could'' open the scroll, but will not because that privilege is reserved to the Son. The angel's question is not simply who can open it, but who has the right to judge the world by revealing what is written and executing the judgments? Since only the Son can open it, this passage reflects the specialness of what is contained in the scroll. The seven seals also reflect this in two ways. First, the use of seals shows that what is in the scroll must be kept secret until the right person can open it. Second, the fact that there are seven seals shows to what degree this must be kept secure. The number seven, which is found numerous places in Revelation, indicates wholeness and/or flawlessness. Also, since none are worthy besides the Lamb, it seems that this scroll will hold something more important than any writing or testament that came before it. 

The word worthy (axios) is used seven times in the book of Revelation and it's literal translation is &quot;of sufficient weight.&quot; The &quot;strong angel&quot; also appears later in the book (chapter 10 &amp; 18). Some have considered this angel to be Gabriel, but it is never directly said by John if this is the case. Also, the word &quot;angel&quot; means messenger. So this shows that the Angel is not the one who is meant to open the book, his power is to deliver the message that someone truly all powerful must open the book.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And no one in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, nor to look thereon.'''''

''Commentary:'' No one in all creation in heaven or earth is able to open this book.  To &quot;look thereon&quot; means to read it. (Obviously John is ''looking'' at it).  It is not known whether this ability is either physical or metaphorical. The division between God and man shows that man is truly in need of a Savior as there are things, such as opening this book and reading it that man is not able to do for himself. Man falls short, but Christ Jesus is capable, willing, and worthy to open and read. This is also stated in Isaiah 29 vs 11. 

===Verses 4-5===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the book, nor to look thereon.'''''  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”'''''

''Commentary:'' John momentarily thinks the scroll, which he is now longing to understand, will not be revealed after all. But Christ has now appeared and will open it. The Lion of the tribe of Judah and the Root of David are messianic titles that uniquely apply to Jesus Christ. A lion is represented as king of the animaals and Judah is the strongest tribe. This indicated that Christ rules over all human kind. The root of David refers to the ties that Christ has with the family of David. 

This passage is reminiscent of the words of Paul to the church in Rome: “There is none righteous, no not one.. for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Rom 3:10,23), and those of the epistle to the Hebrews: “We do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin” (Heb 4:15).

Only the lamb could open the seals of the scroll due to his sacrificial death.  What follows is not the language of a treaty or a covenant as some have suggested.  It is clearly that of judgment.  The number seven represents perfection, thus showing the perfection of God’s pronouncements.  It has also been suggested that the scroll may be a last will and testament, especially in the sense that the audience is not only expected to read it, but also to act on it.

In another translation, verse 5 is translated, &quot;Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals'&quot;. The use of the phrase &quot;has conquered&quot; refers to Jesus conquering Rome when he allowed himself to be crucified. He conquered even as the people of Rome thought they were conquering him. This illustrates an important point in the book of Revelation--things are not always what they appear to be.

===Verses 6-7===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I looked, and in the midst of the throne and of the four creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.''''' &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.'''''

''Commentary:'' This odd vision of Christ is to bring together the twofold aspect of His coming: First as Savior, then later as Sovereign. His right to rule, judge, and possess the earth is emphasized by the reminder that He submitted to the torture of the cross in order to bring redemption to mankind.  Christ conquers not through force, but through sacrifice and martyrdom The lamb here could once again be symbolizing Jesus with the fact of it being slain referring back to him being crucified. The sevenfold spirit may reveal the fullness of God's character, perfection, and completeness. Isaiah 11:2 (NIV) shows seven aspects of the spirit or the sevenfold ministry of the Lord:
     &quot; The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—
       the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
       the Spirit of counsel and of power,
       the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.&quot;

The word &quot;arnion&quot; in this verse is universally translated as &quot;lamb.&quot; This is a literal translation (arnion meaning &quot;small lamb&quot;) but the horns lead to imagery of a ram. In the passover sacrifice a lamb, not a ram, would be slaughtered and so despite the horns translators consider the &quot;arnion&quot; a lamb. The animal imagery is noteworthy in this text. One would expect a lion or a majestic animal to step forward, but the reader's expectations are inverted by the presentation of a slaughter lamb.
 Seen by Witherington, the lamb is standing, living, showing the signs of sacrifice, as part of a theme in the book fetishizing and sanctifying martyrs.

==A Multitude Worships Christ in Heaven and on Earth==

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had taken the book, the four creatures and twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.'''''

''Commentary:'' This is the only time in the Revelation in which heavenly courts bow down to the Lamb. This shows that Christ is indeed the lamb, and no less worthy of such honor, praise, and devotion. He is God's sacrifice (John 1:29). When Christ takes the scroll, He signifies that He will begin the execution of the judgments. The prayers of saints have long asked for this, so that all the wrongs done will finally be avenged and the Messianic Kingdom established. The elders are the representatives of the church holding the vials that are the prayers of the saints.
By the Lamb being the only one to hold the ability to open the book, it shows his power. Also, Since it is said that a very powerful angel asks for someone to open the book, it shows that someone even more powerful than the Angel must open the book. Thus, we may conclude that this Lamb is Christ. He has earned the right top open the scroll not only because he is the son of God, but because he was slain for the good of man.

===Verses 9-10===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they sung a new song, saying, “You are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation,''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and have made us kings and priests to our God, and we will reign on the earth.'''''

''Commentary:'' This outburst of praise is in gratitude for the Lamb's gift of salvation and for the fact that the day of fulfillment is finally at hand. It also shows that by everyone coming together to praise the Lamb, that the Lamb truly has authority. Typically new hymns of praise in The Bible mark and celebrate special occasions, and this is no different. The image of heavenly and earthly beings adds to the mysticism of the book of Revelation. It is interesting to note the striking similar adoration of the Lamb and the God.  This suggests that God and the Lamb are, in a sense, equal in majesty.

===Verses 11-12===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the creatures and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,''''' &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing.”'''''

''Commentary:''The &quot;ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands&quot; written in this verse are not to be taken literally. It is simply to exaggerate that the number of angels was overwhelming. Interpreters differ over whether the presence of the great host surrounding God's throne should be understood to include members of the Church who had been &quot;raptured&quot; to Heaven and spared from going through the tribulation period. Aune points out the allusion to Daniel 7:10 (see also 1 Enoch 14:22, which is quoted in Jude 14).&lt;ref&gt;David E. Aune, Revelation 1-5 (Word Biblical Commentary, 52a; Dallas: Word, 1997) 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number is presumably the main point, and no details are given about specific individuals or groups that may or may not be present, apart from the elders previously mentioned.

One can imagine the scene being like a sports stadium, when some exceptional play happens and everyone jumps up and starts yelling. It's a spontaneous outburst of praise and excitement.

===Verses 13-14===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying, “Blessing, honor, glory, and power to him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the four beasts said, “Amen.” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped him that lives for ever and ever.'''''

''Commentary:'' As do all the creatures and souls that are neither angels nor resurrected spirits. This is somewhat cryptic, but may refer to the as yet unrewarded Old Testament saints, or perhaps there are other classes of spirits or beings we haven't been told of. (The four creatures, for example, are clearly different from other angels).  All creatures, heavenly or earthly, believers or nonbelievers, give praise to God and the Lamb.  They are praising God because he is the creater of all living things.  Everyone is giving praise to the Lamb for he has died so that everyone may have eternal life.  This passage is showing that all creatures will give praise to God and the Lamb at some point in the future.

Here we see the fulfillment of Paul's words in Phillipans when he states every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord. According to Revelation 5, this praise is not an option, it is an obligation. At this point all have realized Jesus is their Lord regardless if they are in heaven, earth, or hell. 
 
It is interesting that all things in heaven, earth, and below are praising God.  This opens up the question as to whether this act takes away from the free will of man to basically force them into praising God.  This would mean that atheists, Muslims, Jews, and any other non-believing (of Christ) people would be praising Him out of their own free will since the Bible states that this was the one thing separating Man from beasts.  This could mean that there was some phenomenon on Earth that turned everyone into a believer or the Heavenly spirit overcame every person, creature, and angel making them consciously performing this act without understanding why.

The chapter ends paralleling what appears to be an early coronation ceremony. The lamb is announced, exalted, and enthroned as king. The lamb finished the chapter seated on the throne. What was once twenty-four elders and four animals is now described as myriads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the 1870's, there were many independent companies trading whiskey to the Native peoples of the southwest part of the North-West Territories. This led to widespread alcoholism among the Native peoples, which eventually caused poverty, disease, malnutrition, and death. In 1873, the Canadian government formed the North-West Mounted Police in an effort to reduce the use of alcohol as a trading currency. By 1874, the NWMP accomplished their task of removing the whiskey traders from Canada, forcing them to flee across the border to the United States. 

= The Arrival of the Whiskey Traders = 

Aboriginals of North-West Canada were eager to trade their furs for European tools, food, and weaponry. Trading between Native peoples and the Europeans became a large part of the history of Canada and the exploration and settlement of the country.

In the mid-1800's, American fur traders began to introduce Native peoples to liquor, which had a devastating effect on their way of life. The whiskey traders traded strong, cheap liquor to the Natives, and it benefited the traders greatly, allowing them to make better deals on trade. However, it caused malnutrition, poverty, and disease among the Natives.

Many forts, such as the infamous Fort Whoop-Up, were established around the southern Canadian plains, and the traders began to illegally trade whiskey to Native peoples. The Canadian government formed the North-West Mounted Police in an effort to prevent the use of whiskey in trading with Natives.

= The Formation of the NWMP =

In 1873, the North-West Mounted Police were formed to protect the Native peoples from the whiskey traders. 

On July 8th, 1874, 300 men marched west from Fort Garry, Manitoba. They endured hard times in the western lands of Canada, as they were low on equipment and supplied with incorrect maps. Low on supplies, Commissioner George French and Assistant Commissioner James Macleod reached Fort Benton, and visited the fort to stock up on supplies. While visiting the fort, they were also introduced to Jerry Potts, whom they hired as a guide.

With guidance from Potts, the group reached Fort Whoop-Up, which was searched and found to have no alcohol. After leaving the fort, they traveled further west, and established a permanent fort, Fort Macleod, on the Oldman River.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Opening a minc file for reading ==

&lt;code&gt;
 #include &quot;minc_1_rw.h&quot;
 using namespace minc;
 //...
 try
 {
  minc_1_reader rdr;
  rdr.open(input_minc_file);
 } catch (const minc::generic_error &amp; err) {
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;Got an error at:&quot; &lt;&lt; err.file () &lt;&lt; &quot;:&quot; &lt;&lt; err.line () &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  std::cerr &lt;&lt; err.msg()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

== Opening minc file for writing ==
Minc file is a complex structure, many parameters have to be setup properly to produce meaningful file, the easies way is to copy them from another minc file:

&lt;code&gt;
 minc_1_writer wrt;
 wrt.open(output_minc_file,example_minc_file);
&lt;/code&gt;

Or, if another file is already open:
&lt;code&gt;
 wrt.open(output_minc_file,rdr);
&lt;/code&gt;

Or, if only the dimensions need to be preserved (create a file with voxels of type float, and 2D slices):
&lt;code&gt;
 wrt.open(output_minc_file,rdr.info(),2,NC_FLOAT);
&lt;/code&gt;

== Analyzing MINC file meta information ==
* Determining number of dimensions: &lt;code&gt;rdr.dim_no()&lt;/code&gt;
* calculating the matrix size, resolution : 
&lt;code&gt; 
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Dimensions:&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl
 &lt;&lt; &quot; Vector:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.ndim(0)&lt;&lt;std::endl
 &lt;&lt; &quot; X:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.ndim(1)&lt;&lt;&quot; step:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nspacing(1)&lt;&lt;&quot; start:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nstart(1)&lt;&lt;std::endl
 &lt;&lt; &quot; Y:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.ndim(2)&lt;&lt;&quot; step:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nspacing(2)&lt;&lt;&quot; start:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nstart(2)&lt;&lt;std::endl
 &lt;&lt; &quot; Z:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.ndim(3)&lt;&lt;&quot; step:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nspacing(3)&lt;&lt;&quot; start:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nstart(3)&lt;&lt;std::endl
 &lt;&lt; &quot; Time:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.ndim(4)&lt;&lt;&quot; step:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nspacing(4)&lt;&lt;&quot; start:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.nstart(4)&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
'''Note''' that these are physical parameters, which don't depend on the way how information is stored in a minc file
* Output direction cosine matrix
&lt;code&gt;
 for(int i=0;i&lt;3;i++)
 {
 if(rdr.have_dir_cos(i))
  for(int j=0;j&lt;3;j++)
    std::cout&lt;&lt;rdr.ndir_cos(i,j)&lt;&lt;&quot; &quot;;
  std::cout&lt;&lt;std::endl;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;
* Read a minc file history
&lt;code&gt;
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Minc history:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.history().c_str()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
* Read a string attribute
&lt;code&gt;
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Subject name:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.att_value_string(&quot;patient&quot;,&quot;full_name&quot;).c_str()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
* Read a double attribute
&lt;code&gt;
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Echo time:&quot;&lt;&lt;rdr.att_value_double(&quot;acquisition&quot;,&quot;echo_time&quot;)[0]&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
'''Note:''' reading double attribute returns &lt;nowiki&gt;std::vector&lt;double&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; by value

== Reading Image ==
Imaging data is stored as a multidimensional array of values a given type. Array is organized in slices (could be just one slice for the whole file), values stored inside the minc file may be normalized, see [[MINC/Reference]] for complete details. EZMINC was developed to hide the complexity of the data representation from programmer , but to allow complete control over how data is stored, if it is needed. 
There are several ways to read imaging information from a file using EZMINC library:

* The easiest, the whole volume is copied into a multidimensional array in memory. Usually this is the most convenient method:
** Reading a volume representing real values (interpret them as float)
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple.h&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple_rw.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //....
 simple_volume&lt;float&gt; src;
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr1.open(input_file);
 load_simple_volume&lt;float&gt;(rdr,src);
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Voxel at voxel coordinates (1,2,3) is &quot;&lt;&lt;src.get(1,2,3)&lt;&lt;std::endl;
 //using safe_get to make sure that we don't read beyond the allocated space
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Voxel at world coordinates (1,2,3) is &quot;&lt;&lt;src.safe_get(src.world_to_voxel(IDX&lt;double&gt;(1.0,2.0,3.0)))&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
** Reading a volume with a binary mask (or discrete labels)
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_io_simple_volume.h&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple.h&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple_rw.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //....
 simple_volume&lt;unsigned char&gt; src;
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr1.open(input_file);
 load_simple_volume&lt;unsigned char&gt;(rdr,src);
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Labels at (1,2,3) is &quot;&lt;&lt;(int)src.get(1,2,3)&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;
** Reading a 4D volume
&lt;code&gt;
 simple_4d_volume&lt;float&gt; vol;
 load_4d_volume&lt;float&gt;(rdr,vol);
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Voxel at voxel coordinates (1,2,3) slice 0 is &quot;&lt;&lt;src.get(1,2,3,0)&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;

* reading the whole minc file as a single continuous buffer, organized with vector_dimension the fastest varying (if present), X,Y,Z, and time the slowest varyuing (if present)
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_rw.h&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //...
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr.open(input_file);
 rdr.setup_read_float(); //we have to setup the file to a proper data type
 
 size_t size=1;
 for(i=0;i&lt;rdr.dim_no();i++)
    size*=rdr.dim(i).length;
  
 float* array=new float[size];
 
 load_standard_volume&lt;float&gt;(rdr,array);
&lt;/code&gt; 

* reading the whole minc file voxel-by-voxel, in the order that data is stored inside file. This method is really usefull when working with big number of input files, and storing them all together in memory is problematic
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_rw.h&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_simple.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //...
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr.open(input_file);
 rdr.setup_read_float(); //we have to setup the file to a proper data type
 minc_input_iterator&lt;float&gt; in(rdr);
 
 double avg=0;
 int cnt=0;
 for(in.begin();!in.last();in.next())
 {
    avg+=in.value()
    cnt++;
 }
 std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Average value=&quot;&lt;&lt;avg/cnt&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;

* lowest-level interface, reading the minc file slice-by-slice in the order that data is stored
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_rw.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //...
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr.open(input_file);
 rdr.setup_read_float(); //we have to setup the file to a proper data type

 float* slice_buffer=new float[rdr.slice_len()];

 for(rdr.begin();!rdr.last();rdr.next_slice())//minc_1_reader is actually an iterator!
 {
    rdr.read(slice_buffer);
    //do something usefull with the data
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

== Writing MINC file meta information ==
* copying history '''NOTE:''' if using first for of minc_1_writer::open history will be copied automatically
&lt;code&gt;
 wrt.copy_headers(rdr);
&lt;/code&gt;
* Appending new line into MINC history
&lt;code&gt;
 wrt.append_history(&quot;minc_test was used to produce this file\n&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;
* Write a string attribute
 wrt.insert(&quot;patient&quot;,&quot;full_name&quot;,&quot;John Doe&quot;);
* Writing a double attribute
 wrt.insert(&quot;acquisition&quot;,&quot;echo_time&quot;,0.120); //echo time was 120ms
* Writing an array of double values
 std::vector&lt;double&gt; bvalues(64);
 //...
 wrt.insert(&quot;acquisition&quot;,&quot;bvalues&quot;,bvalues);
* Copying all headers from another minc file
 wrt.copy_headers(rdr);

== Writing Images ==
* Simplest interface, using simple_volume or simple_4d_volume
&lt;code&gt;
 simple_volume&lt;float&gt; output_vol;
 //...
 minc_1_writer wrt;
 wrt.open(output_minc,rdr);
 save_simple_volume&lt;float&gt;(wrt,output_vol); 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
 simple_4d_volume&lt;float&gt; output_vol;
 //...
 minc_1_writer wrt;
 wrt.open(output_minc,rdr);
 save_4d_volume(wrt,vol);
&lt;/code&gt;
* Writing image from a continuous array
&lt;code&gt;
 float *output_vol=new float[size];
 //...
 minc_1_writer wrt;
 wrt.open(output_minc,rdr);
 wrt.setup_write_float(); //have to setup the data type
 save_standard_volume&lt;float&gt;(wrt,output_vol); 
&lt;/code&gt;
* Using output iterator
&lt;code&gt;
    //adding a value c to all voxels
    minc_1_reader rdr;
    rdr.open(input_minc);
    rdr.setup_read_float();
    
    minc_1_writer wrt;
    wrt.open(output_minc,rdr);
    wrt.setup_write_float();
     
    minc_input_iterator&lt;float&gt; in(rdr);
    minc_output_iterator&lt;float&gt; out(wrt);
    for(in.begin(),out.begin();!in.last();in.next(),out.next())
    {
      out.value(in.value()+c);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;
* lowest-level, writing image slice-by-slice
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_1_rw.h&gt;
 using namespace minc;
 //...
 minc_1_reader rdr;
 rdr.open(input_file);
 rdr.setup_read_float(); //we have to setup the file to a proper data type

 minc_1_writer wrt;
 wrt.open(output_minc,rdr);
 wrt.setup_write_float();

 float* slice_buffer=new float[rdr.slice_len()];

 for(rdr.begin(),wrt.begin();!rdr.last();rdr.next_slice(),wrt.next_slice())
 {
    rdr.read(slice_buffer);
    //do something usefull with the data
    wrt.write(slice_buffer);
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Better MINC1/2 support for ITK ==
If you are not satisfied with MINC2 only interface provided by ITK, or need access to MINC file attributes, or want to read/write 4D data use ITK interface provided by EZMINC

== Installing ==
Compile EZMINC with ITK support, see [EZMINC_Installing]
If you are not using ITK plugin (currently plugin is not recommended) add following code to &quot;mincify&quot; your ITK program:
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &quot;itkMincImageIOFactory.h&quot; 
 #include &quot;itkMincImageIO.h&quot;
 //....
 int main(int argc,char **argv)
 {
   //registering the MINC_IO factory
   itk::ObjectFactoryBase::RegisterFactory(itk::MincImageIOFactory::New()); 
   //....

&lt;/code&gt;
== Example of working with DTI data ==
Code from itk_dti.cpp from examples:
&lt;code&gt;    
    typedef itk::VectorImage&lt;float, 3&gt;  DTIImageType;
    typedef std::vector&lt;double&gt; double_vector;

    //registering the MINC_IO factory
    itk::ObjectFactoryBase::RegisterFactory(itk::MincImageIOFactory::New());
    //....
    itk::ImageFileReader&lt;ImageType &gt;::Pointer reader = itk::ImageFileReader&lt;ImageType &gt;::New();
    reader-&gt;SetFileName(input_file);
    reader-&gt;Update();
    ImageType::Pointer img=reader-&gt;GetOutput();
    double_vector bvalues,direction_x,direction_y,direction_z;

    //making sure that all vcrtors contain the same number of parameters (just in case)
    if(!itk::ExposeMetaData&lt;double_vector&gt;( img-&gt;GetMetaDataDictionary() , &quot;acquisition:bvalues&quot;,bvalues) ||
        !itk::ExposeMetaData&lt;double_vector&gt;( img-&gt;GetMetaDataDictionary() , &quot;acquisition:direction_x&quot;,direction_x) ||
        !itk::ExposeMetaData&lt;double_vector&gt;( img-&gt;GetMetaDataDictionary() , &quot;acquisition:direction_y&quot;,direction_y) ||
        !itk::ExposeMetaData&lt;double_vector&gt;( img-&gt;GetMetaDataDictionary() , &quot;acquisition:direction_z&quot;,direction_z))
    {
      std::cerr&lt;&lt;&quot;Image doesn't have information on DTI gradients, can't process!&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
      return 2;
    }
    if(bvalues.size()!=direction_x.size() || 
       bvalues.size()!=direction_y.size() ||
       bvalues.size()!=direction_z.size() )
    {
      std::cerr&lt;&lt;&quot;Different number of components of gradients&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
        return 2;
    }
    std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Found &quot;&lt;&lt;bvalues.size()&lt;&lt;&quot; gradient directions&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
&lt;/code&gt;

== Using minc XFM files ==
* applying transformation
code from itk_resample.cpp
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &quot;itkMincImageIOFactory.h&quot;
 #include &quot;itkMincImageIO.h&quot;
 #include &quot;minc_helpers.h&quot;

 typedef itk::ResampleImageFilter&lt;minc::image3d, minc::image3d&gt; FilterType;
 typedef minc::XfmTransform  TransformType;
 //...
 TransformType::Pointer transform = TransformType::New();
 //reading a minc style xfm file
 transform-&gt;OpenXfm(xfm_f.c_str());
 transform-&gt;Invert();
 filter-&gt;SetTransform( transform );
 //...
 &lt;/code&gt;
* Storing affine transformation in .xfm file
&lt;code&gt;
 #include &lt;minc_helpers.h&gt;
 //...
 itk::AffineTransform&lt;double,3&gt;  m_AffineTransform;
 //...
 minc::write_linear_xfm(output_xfm, m_AffineTransform-&gt;GetMatrix(), m_AffineTransform-&gt;GetOffset());
&lt;/code&gt;
* Reading affine transformation from .xfm file
&lt;code&gt;
 itk::AffineTransform&lt;double,3&gt;  m_AffineTransform;
 //...
 itk::Matrix&lt;double,3,3&gt; rotation;
 itk::Vector&lt;double,3&gt; translation;
 read_linear_xfm(input_xfm,rotation,translation);
 //...
 m_AffineTransform.SetOffset(translation);
 m_AffineTransform.SetMatrix(rotation);
 
&lt;/code&gt;
* reading/writing .tag files
&lt;code&gt;
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; labels;
  std::vector&lt;itk::Point&lt;double&gt;,3&gt; tags;
  read_tags(tags, labels, input_tag);
  //....
  write_tags(tags, labels, ouput_tag);
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Subject pronouns==

French has six different types of subject pronouns: the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person singular and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person plural.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Number
! Person
! French
! English
|-
| rowspan = 3 | singular
| 1st person || '''je''' || I
|-
| 2nd person || '''tu''' || you
|-
| 3rd person || '''il, elle, on''' || he, she, one
|-
| rowspan = 3 | plural
| 1st person || '''nous''' || we
|-
| 2nd person || '''vous''' || you
|-
| 3rd person || '''ils,&lt;br&gt;elles''' || they (masculine)&lt;br&gt;they (feminine)
|}

The pronoun ''it'' does not exist in French. All masculine nouns (even those that are not human) are replaced by ''il''. The same is true with feminine nouns and ''elle''.

While the third person plural &quot;they&quot; has no gender in English, the French equivalents &quot;ils&quot; and &quot;elles&quot; do. However, when pronounced, they normally sound the same as &quot;il&quot; and &quot;elle&quot;, so distinguishing the difference requires understanding of the various conjugations of the verbs following the pronoun. Also, if a group of people consists of '''both''' males and females, the male form is used, even with a majority of females — however, this sensibly yields to overwhelming majority: given a group of only one male to thousands of females, the female form would be used.

Examples:
*'''Jack''' et '''Philipp''' jouent - Jack and Philipp play&lt;br&gt;'''Ils''' jouent - They play (all-male group) 
*'''Jack''' et '''Lucy''' jouent - Jack and Lucy play&lt;br&gt;'''Ils''' jouent - They play (mixed group)
*'''Lucy''' et '''Dina''' jouent - Lucy and Dina play&lt;br&gt;'''Elles''' jouent - They play (all female group)

===''Vous'' vs. ''tu''===
This is an important difference between French and English. English no longer distinguishes between the singular and the plural, formal version of &quot;you&quot;, although &quot;thou&quot; used to be the informal singular version in the days of Shakespeare.

&quot;Vous&quot; is the plural form of &quot;you&quot;. This is somewhat equivalent to &quot;you all&quot;, &quot;you guys&quot;, &quot;all of you&quot;, except that it does not carry any familiarity when used with the plural. You'd use it to address your friends as well as when talking to the whole government at a press conference.

&quot;Vous&quot; is also used to refer to single individuals to show respect, to be polite or to be neutral. It is used when talking to someone who is important, someone who is older than you are, or someone with whom you are unfamiliar. This is known as [[w:Vouvoiement|Vouvoiement]].

Conversely, &quot;tu&quot; is the singular and informal form of &quot;vous&quot; (you) in French.  It is commonly used when referring to a friend or a family member, and is also used between children or when addressing a child. If it is used when speaking to a stranger, it signals disrespect. This is known as [[w:Tutoiement|Tutoiement]]. If uncertain, it is best to begin by using &quot;vous&quot; and wait for the other person to suggest the use of &quot;tu&quot;. The use of &quot;vous&quot; is less common in Quebequois than in French from France.

Grammatically, even the singular form of &quot;vous&quot; behaves as though it were a plural, so even if you are addressing only one person, you would still use verbal grammar consistent with addressing multiple people, similar to English (as in &quot;you are&quot;, &quot;you [all] are&quot;, &quot;they are.&quot;) Nevertheless, related adjectives or past participles need to use singular or plural endings according to the actual number of people present.

Examples, addressing '''one''' person: 
*Tu gagn'''es''' - you win (informal)
*Vous gagn'''ez''' - you win (polite) - (also, to address many persons) 
*Tu '''es''' costaud - You are tough (informal)
*Vous '''êtes''' accrocheu'''r''' - You are determined (polite, male)
*Vous '''êtes''' accrocheu'''se''' - You are determined (polite, female)

Examples, addressing '''many''' people:
*Vous '''êtes''' fort'''s''' - You are strong (informal or polite, male, many persons)
*Vous '''êtes''' fort'''es''' - You are strong (informal or polite, female, many persons)

===The pronoun ''on''===
The French third person &quot;on&quot; has several meanings, but most closely matches the now archaic English &quot;one&quot;. While in English, &quot;One must be very careful in French grammar&quot; sounds old-fashioned, the French equivalent &quot;On doit faire très attention à la grammaire française&quot; is quite acceptable. 

The subject pronoun ''on'' is similar to the English personal pronoun ''one'', except that it is not so formal, and is more common. It has a number of uses:
* It is used in the same ways as the English personal pronoun ''one'': e.g.
** It is used in expressing generalities: « C'est en jouant qu&amp;#39;'''on''' devient joueur. » (&quot;It is by playing that '''one''' becomes a player.&quot;)
** It is the implicit subject for an infinitive that has no other implicit subject: « penser qu&amp;#39;'''on''' a raison » (&quot;to think that '''one''' is right,&quot; i.e. &quot;to think '''oneself''' right&quot;).
* Because of French's limited passive voice, it is often used as an empty subject when the agent is unknown or unimportant: « '''On''' nous l'a prété. » (&quot;''&lt;nowiki&gt;[On]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' loaned him to us&quot; ''or'' &quot;They loaned him to us&quot; ''or'' &quot;He was loaned to us.&quot;)
* It is used as a less formal substitute for the subject pronoun ''nous'' (''we''). In this case, note that even though ''on'' always takes a third-person singular verb, it takes plural adjectives (« On est britanniques », &quot;We're British&quot;). Also, note that the other forms of ''nous'' (direct object, indirect object, and disjunctive) are not replaced by forms of ''on'' unless ''on'' is the subject as well. (Hence, « Ils '''nous''' l'ont donné », &quot;They gave it to us,&quot; but « On se l'est donné », &quot;We gave it to ourselves.&quot;)
* It is ''not'' the number 1, and therefore is ''not'' used to mean &quot;one of them.&quot; In French as in English, numbers can be used as pronouns &amp;mdash; « Deux sont entr&amp;eacute;s et un est ressorti », &quot;Two went in and one came back out&quot; &amp;mdash; but the number 1 is ''un(e)'', not ''on''.

''On'' does not have ordinary direct- and indirect-object pronouns, only the reflexive pronoun ''se''. Similarly, its disjunctive-pronoun form, ''soi'', is only used when ''on'' is the subject and ''soi'' refers to the same entity. The pronoun ''quelqu'un'' (&quot;someone&quot;) can fill some of the roles of ''on'', in the same way that ''one'' and ''someone'' are sometimes interchangeable in English.

In everyday language, “on” is used, instead of “nous”, to express “we”; the verb is always used in the 3rd person singular. For example, to say &quot;We (are) meeting at 7 o'clock&quot;, you could say either ''“On se rencontre au cinéma à sept heures.”'' (colloquial) or ''“Nous nous rencontrons au cinéma à sept heures.”'' (formal) (there are two words &quot;nous&quot;, meaning &quot;we&quot; and &quot;ourselves&quot;). For more, see [[w:French_personal_pronouns#The_pronoun_on|the Wikipedia entry]].

===Use of titles instead of pronouns===
Monsieur, Madame and Mademoiselle are the French equivalents of Mr, Mrs and Miss, but they are used more frequently in formal conversation and where in English we might use a personal pronoun. (see [[../Sentences]] for examples)

==Direct Object Pronouns==

===Direct Objects===
While the subject of a sentence initiates an action (the verb), the direct object is the one that is affected by the action. A direct object pronoun can be used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Pierre voit '''le cambrioleur'''.||Pierre sees '''the burglar'''.
|-
| Pierre '''le''' voit.||Pierre sees '''him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of direct object pronouns:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Number
! Person
! French
! English
|-
| rowspan = 4 | singular
| 1st person || '''me, m'''' || me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2nd person || '''te, t'''' || you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| rowspan=2 | 3rd person 
| '''le, l'''' || him, it
|-
| '''la, l'''' || her, it
|-
| rowspan = 3 | plural
| 1st person || '''nous''' || us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2nd person || '''vous''' || you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 3rd person || '''les''' || them
|}

Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as indirect objects to mean ''to me, to you, to us'', and ''to you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The direct object pronoun for ''nous'' and ''vous'' is the same as the subject.
* When the direct object comes before a verb in a perfect tense, a tense that uses a past participle, the direct object must agree in gender and plurality with the past participle. For example, in the phrase ''Je les ai eus'', or ''I had them'', the past participle would be spelled ''eus'' if the direct object, ''les'', was referring to a masculine object, and ''eues'' if ''les'' is referring to a feminine object.

===''l', le, la'', and ''les''===
The words ''l', le, la'', and ''les'' which are used to mean &quot;the&quot; are also used as direct object pronouns. 

*Il jette ''le ballon''. - He throws ''the ball''.
In the above sentence ''le ballon'' is the direct object. 

You have learned earlier that names and regular nouns can be replaced by the subject pronouns (''je, tu''...). Similarly, direct objects, such as &quot;le ballon&quot;, can be replaced by pronouns. These are a different set of pronouns (accusative). As in English, you would say &quot;She gave him,&quot; and not &quot;Her gave he.&quot; He/she are subjects used in the nominative case, while him/her are direct objects used in the accusative case. 
*''le'' - replaces a masculine singular direct object (&quot;him&quot; or &quot;it&quot;)
*''la'' - replaces a feminine singular direct object (&quot;her&quot; or &quot;it&quot;)
*''l''' - replaces ''le'' and ''la'' if they come before a vowel
*''les'' - replaces plural direct objects, both masculine and feminine

The direct object pronouns come before the verb they are linked to.
*Il ''le'' jette. - He throws it.
*Il ''les'' jettes. - He throws them.

''Le, la'', and ''les'' can replace either people or inanimate objects.

===Direct object replacement===
*Il me supporte. - He supports me.
*Il te supporte. - He supports you.
*Il nous supporte. - He supports us.
*Il vous supporte. - He supports you.

===Place in sentences===
*These pronouns are placed before the verb that they modify
**Je te bat. - I am beating you.
**Je veux te battre. - I want to beat you.
*If a perfect tense is used, these pronouns go before the auxiliary verb.
**Je t'ai battu. - I have beaten you.

==Indirect Objects==
An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with ''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called indirect because it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly by the action: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Il donne du pain '''à Pierre'''.||He gives some bread '''to Pierre'''.
|-
| Il '''lui''' donne du pain.||He gives bread '''to him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of indirect object pronouns:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Number
! Person
! French
! English
|-
| rowspan = 3 | singular
| 1st person || '''me, m'''' || to me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2nd person || '''te, t'''' || to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 3rd person || '''lui'''' || to him, to her
|-
| rowspan = 3 | plural
| 1st person || '''nous''' || to us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 2nd person || '''vous''' || to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| 3rd person || '''leur''' || to them
|}

Notes:
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as direct objects to mean ''me, you, us'', and ''you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The indirect object pronoun for nous and vous is the same as the subject.
* The indirect object pronouns do '''not''' agree with the past participle like the direct object pronouns do. When ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are used in a perfect tense, the writer must decide whether they are used as direct or indirect object pronouns. This is done by looking at the verb and seeing what type of action is being performed.

The bread ''is given'' by the man (direct). Pierre ''gets the given'' bread (indirect).

===''lui'' and ''leur''===
Indirect objects are prepositional phrases with the object of the preposition. An indirect object is a noun that receives the action of a verb.
*Il montre le carton jaune à Jacques. - He shows the yellow card to Jack.
*Il montre le carton jaune à Marie. - He shows the yellow card to Mary.
*Il montre le carton jaune à Jacques et Marie. - He shows the yellow card to Jack and Mary.

''Lui'' and ''leur'' are indirect object pronouns. They replace nouns referring to people and mean ''to him/her'' and ''to them'' respectively. 

*''lui'' - replaces a singular masculine or feminine indirect object referring to a person
*''leur'' - replaces a plural masculine or feminine indirect object referring to a person

An example follows:

*Il lui montre le carton rouge. - He shows the red card to him.
*Il lui montre le carton rouge. - He shows the red card to her.
*Il leur montre le carton rouge. - He shows the red card to them.

Whether ''lui'' means ''to him'' or ''to her'' is given by context.

In English, &quot;He shows ''him'' the red card&quot; is also said, and means the same thing.

When used with the direct object pronouns ''le, la'', and ''les'', ''lui'' and ''leur'' come after those pronouns.

*Il le lui passe. - He passes it to him.

Note that while ''le, la'', and ''les'' are used to replace people or inanimate objects, ''lui'' and ''leur'' are not used to replace inanimate objects and things.

Also note that unlike ''le'' and ''la'', which are shortened to ''l''' when followed by a vowel, ''lui'' is never shortened.

===Indirect Object Replacement===
*Il m'appelle. - He calls to me.
*Il te le donne. - He gives it to you.
*Il nous le donne. - He gives it to us.
*Il vous le donne. - He gives it to you.

===The pronoun ''y''===

====Indirect object pronoun - ''to it, to them''====
The French pronoun ''y'' is used to replace an object of a phrase introduced by a preposition.
*Je crois en la montée. - J'y crois.
*I believe in promotion. - I believe in it.
Note that ''lui'' and ''leur'', and not ''y'', are used when the object refers to a person or persons.

====Replacement of places - ''there''====
The French pronoun ''y'' replaces a prepositional phrase referring to a place that begins with any preposition except ''de'' (for which ''en'' is used).
*Les clubs promus vont en Ligue 1. - Les clubs promus y vont.
*The promoted clubs go to Ligue 1. - The promoted clubs go there.
Note that ''en'', and not ''y'' is used when the object is of the preposition ''de''.

====Idioms====
*Ça y est! - It's done!
*J'y suis! - I get it!
*Vous y êtes? - Are you ready?

===En===

To say 'some of it' without specifying the exact object, the pronoun 'en' can be used. Additionally, 'en' can mean 'of it' when 'it' is not specified. For instance, instead of saying ''J'ai besoin d'argent'', if the idea of money has already been raised, it can be stated as 'J'en ai besoin'. This is because ''en'' replaces ''du'', ''de la'' or ''des'' when there the noun is not specifically mentioned in that sentence.

Like with 'me', 'te' and other pronouns, ''en'' (meaning 'some') comes before the verb. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|Tu joues du piano? Non, je n'en joue pas||Do you play piano? No, I don't play it.
|-
|Vous prenez du poisson? Oui, j'en prends.||Are you having fish? Yes, I'm having some.
|-
|Vous avez commandé de l'eau? Oui, nous en avons commandé. ||Did you order some water? Yes, we ordered some.
|}

====Replacement of a partitive construction====
*The pronoun ''en'' replaces a noun with a partitive article (l'article partitif: du, de la, de, des) at the front. In this case ''En'' goes always with the singular, even if there are many items adressed.
**Je veux du temps de jeu. &amp;rarr; J''''en''' veux. - I want some playing time. &amp;rarr; I want some.

====Replacement of quantified nouns====
If the quantity of the object is specified, &quot;en&quot; is used for the replacement of the noun.

Example: Il a acheté deux billets.  &amp;rarr; Il '''en''' a acheté deux. - He bought two tickets &amp;rarr; He bought two (of them).

Note that no agreement is needed between the past participle (le participe passé) and the object (complément d'objet direct).

====Replacement of phrases with ''de''====
*The pronoun ''en'' replaces prepositional phrases beginning with ''de'' if the object of the preposition is referring to a thing or place.
**Je viens de Paris. - I come from Paris.
**J''''en''' viens. - I come from it.
*Note that stress pronouns, and not ''en'' are used if the object refers to a person or persons.

==Pronoun order==
===Order chart===
If a sentence uses no infinitive, the pronouns are embedded as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Subject &lt;br&gt; Pronoun&lt;br&gt;(or noun)||Neg||Direct or &lt;br&gt; Indirect||Direct Obj &lt;br&gt; Pronouns||Indirect &lt;br&gt; Objects||  ||  ||  ||Neg|| 
|-
| je &lt;br&gt; tu &lt;br&gt; il (elle) &lt;br&gt; nous &lt;br&gt; vous &lt;br&gt; ils (elles)||ne||me &lt;br&gt; te &lt;br&gt; nous &lt;br&gt; vous &lt;br&gt; se (reflexive)||le &lt;br&gt; la &lt;br&gt; l' &lt;br&gt; les||lui &lt;br&gt; leur||y||en||conjugated &lt;br&gt; verb||pas &lt;br&gt; plus &lt;br&gt;etc...||past&lt;br&gt;participle
|}

If a sentence uses an infinitive, the pronouns are embedded as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Subject &lt;br&gt; Pronoun&lt;br&gt;(or noun)||Neg||  ||Neg||  ||Direct or &lt;br&gt; Indirect||Direct Obj &lt;br&gt; Pronouns||Indirect &lt;br&gt; Objects||  ||  ||  
|-
| je &lt;br&gt; tu &lt;br&gt; il (elle) &lt;br&gt; nous &lt;br&gt; vous &lt;br&gt; ils (elles)|| ne|| conjugated &lt;br&gt; verb|| pas &lt;br&gt; plus &lt;br&gt;etc...||past&lt;br&gt;participle||me &lt;br&gt; te &lt;br&gt; nous &lt;br&gt; vous &lt;br&gt; se (reflexive)|| le &lt;br&gt; la &lt;br&gt; l' &lt;br&gt; les|| lui &lt;br&gt; leur|| y|| en||infinitive
|}

===Order rules===
*When a sentence uses the indirect object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' with the direct object pronouns ''le'', ''la'', and ''les'', ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' go first.
** Il me le donne. - He gave it to me.
*When a sentence uses the indirect object pronouns ''lui'' and ''leur'' with the direct object pronouns ''le'', ''la'', and ''l''', ''le'', ''la'', and ''les'' go first.
** Il le lui donne. - He gave it to him/her.
*When ''y'' is used in the same sentence as other pronouns, ''y'' goes after all of them with the exception of ''en''.
**Il m'emmène à  l'entraînement. - He takes me to training.
**Il m'&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt; emmène. - He takes me there.
*''Y'' in conjunction with ''en'' is only used in a few cases.
**Il y en a. - There exist several (of them).
**Est-ce qu'il y a des billets? (Oui,) il y en a. (Non,) il n'y en a (pas/plus). - Are there any tickets (left)? Yes, there are. No, there aren't.
*When there are two pronouns in a sentence, ''en'' always go last.

===L'impératif===
When expressing positive commands, there are several rules one must remember when using object pronouns. Theses are:
*The pronouns are attached to the verb with a hyphen.
**Retrouve-la. - Find it.
*Me and Te become moi and toi.
**Donnez-moi les résultats. - Give me the results.
*''Le'', ''la'', and ''les'' precede all other object pronouns.
**Donnez-le-moi. - Give it to me.
*For the second person singular form, an &quot;s&quot; is added if the object (in the pronoun form) begins with a vowel or &quot;y&quot;.
**Va aux vestiaires. - Go to the changing rooms.  BUT  Vas-y. - Go (there). 
**Vas-y. - Come on.

==Possessive pronouns== 
Possessive pronouns are equivalent to &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot; etc and replace possessive adjective + noun sets. e.g.
*Vous avez vos billets? - You have your tickets?
*Oui, nous avons '''les nôtres'''. - Yes, we have '''ours'''.
Like the possessive adjectives &quot;mon&quot;, &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;mes&quot; etc. the possessive pronouns agree in gender with the noun that is being replaced, as shown in this table. (Note that &quot;le&quot;, &quot;la&quot; and &quot;les&quot; are  essential parts of the possessive pronouns.)

==Reflexive pronouns==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Number
! Person
! French
! English
|-
| rowspan = 3 | singular
| 1st person || '''me, m'''' || myself
|-

À + a stressed pronoun is used when the noun replaced is also the subject of the sentence. This usually occurs in sentences with être.
*Elle est ta voiture? - Is that your car?
*Oui, elle est à moi. - Yes, it is mine.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| 3rd person || '''eux,&lt;br&gt;elles''' || them (masculine)&lt;br&gt;them (feminine)
|}

==Relative Pronouns ''Qui'' and ''Que''==
''Les pronoms relatifs qui et que''
*relative pronouns begin adjective clauses
**the man &lt;u&gt;'''that''' was here&lt;/u&gt;
**the man &lt;u&gt; '''that''' I saw &lt;/u&gt;
*''qui'' is the subject of the clause it introduces
**Je vois l'homme &lt;u&gt;'''qui''' l'a fait.&lt;/u&gt; - I see the man that did it.
**L'homme &lt;u&gt;'''qui''' l'a fait &lt;/u&gt; est ici. - The man that did it is here.
*''que'' is the direct object of the clause it introduces
**Il est l'homme &lt;u&gt;'''que''' j'ai vu&lt;/u&gt;. - He is the man that I have seen.
*remember that in perfect tenses, the past participle agrees with the direct object in gender and plurality if the direct object comes before the verb
**Elles sont les femmes &lt;u&gt;'''que''' j'ai vu'''es'''&lt;/u&gt;. - They are the women that I have seen.
*If ''que'' is followed by a vowel, it is shortened to ''qu'''.
**Il est l'homme &lt;u&gt;'''qu''''il a vu&lt;/u&gt;. - He is the man that he has seen.
*''qui'' is never shortened, even when followed by a vowel
*''qui'' and ''que'' can modify both people and things
**Je vois la voiture &lt;u&gt;'''qui''' est cassé&lt;/u&gt;. - I see the car that is broken.
*''qui'' and ''que'' can modify both masculine and feminine nouns
*''qui'' and ''que'' can modify both singular and plural nouns
*in the phrases ''ce qui'' and ''ce que'', which literally mean ''that which'', but more naturally mean ''what'', ''ce'' is the noun.

      <comment>/* Merge? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Subject C++ page ==
This page being done manually ignores all the benefits that were the whole point of moving to dynamic subject pages.  Additionally, adding a new book such as [[Let Us GCC]] to [[:Category:C++ programming language]] does ''not'' add it here, as someone familiar with the other subject pages might expect.  And each book has a description; that's more than books on the bookshelves got, much less those on other subject pages (why are these special?).  How much of the book duplication seen here is a result of forking or abandoning the quagmire that is [[C++ Programming]]?  Should we convert all the other subject pages into manual listings with descriptions for each book?  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:25, 15 April 2010 (UTC)

:My understanding is that bookshelves have been deprecated. I haven't done any special work there for years now...&lt;br&gt;
:As for the the manual versus dynamic subject pages, I do see a small benefit if people don't create and maintain their subject pages but I must state that personally I don't particularly like the new design. It should be up to the editors to add the relevant info, automation shouldn't be an end it itself, usability should prevail. In any case [[Let Us GCC]] is still an empty stub and examining it even if it evolves the structure will not be fit to stand alone (it will have to be merged to another work), it seems to be a collaborative effort to use Wikibooks to cooperatively update some external book source code (that source code may be useful elsewhere when they are finished).&lt;br&gt;
:Regarding the descriptions of the books they have IIRC been the work of each book editors and they are extremely relevant to demonstrate that there is no collision on each subject matter or presentation in that aspect it probably has been impacted by previous general discussion of the subject but not specific to the [[C++ Programming]] book. To my knowledge only the [[Understanding C++]] stub was a direct result of divergences regarding the [[C++ Programming]] exiting structure, it was created by Darklama.&lt;br&gt;
:Only the last two books would be impossible to merge to the [[C++ Programming]] the scopes are extremely divergent, but I would expect any merging of the other books to receive strong opposition form their communities, for instance [[More C++ Idioms]] covers a very specific subset of the language, it has received several accolades, if IIRC even from the C++ language creator, even if possible the merge would reduce the usefulness of that work, the same can be stated to a lesser degree about [[Optimizing C++]] in this case it could have been created as part of the [[C++ Programming]] but not at speed the editor created this work (amazing solo contribution), it would be impossible if he had to address the problems being created on the [[C++ Programming]], in any case the book is self contained and mostly complete (if that can be stated about a Wikibook), the content is being somewhat duplicated by myself but I'm relating it to the rest of the book and will cover more modern features and out of the standard concepts (like OpenMP). So not really a collision but if and when the [[C++ Programming]] has the still pending issues resolved and evolves into a similar level of completion a merge could be discussed...
:&lt;s&gt;The [[C++ Programming]] book is still waiting for some admin to reverse changes made to the cover page (by Darklama against objection by myself) that reversal was approved [[C++ Programming/Conventions]] (last convention).&lt;/s&gt;--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:49, 15 April 2010 (UTC)

== Merge? ==

I think it would be cool if some of these books could be merged into a single book where it makes sense, such as including the content of [[More C++ Idioms]] into the subsection [[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns]] or wherever it might actually be appropriate. This would make it easier to refer a single source of content instead of fragmenting information and making it harder to share. Also it would pull what's left of the Authors/Communities together and make them stronger instead of reinforcing competition for referral. I'd appreciate the input of anyone else, Thanks [[User:Zenware|Zenware]] ([[User talk:Zenware|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Zenware|contribs]]) 03:59, 17 May 2013 (UTC)

:This probably will occur in the future for now there is still incomplete work pending in both works. [[More C++ Idioms]] is very subject specific and is nearer completion, it would hinder its usefulness to dilute it into the other work that still has much content missing.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:28, 17 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

==History==

The lowlevel.library, introduced in Workbench/Kickstart 3.1, offers timer and keyboard/joystick support functions to game and demo programmers.

The original library was designed by Commodore and had the following issues...

* Input functions are polling based while AmigaOS is event driven.
* Input functions are system wide, not application based. If left is pressed, it is expected only the active applications detects it. With lowlevel, the others also detect it.
* Some features can only be used by one application at a time. Really a bad idea in a multitasking environment.
* Some other timer function only works for 16 hours. Then it returns wrong results.
* Programmers are invited to use software interruption instead of high priority thread. 

lowlevel.library  does  not  maintain a list of interrupt handlers, it maintains only a single interrupt handler, which is added additionally to standard keyboard processing.




==Current==

ReadJoyPort() is patched for USB usage. 

In the original AmigaOS lowlevel.library and keyboard.device are tightly glued together and in fact just two interfaces of one module and can't be separated.
Anyway, two new HIDDs which now manages the keyboard  and mouse drivers. Now it is possible to plug in several lowlevel drivers at once, their input streams will be merged.  See rom/hidd/keyboard and rom/hidd/mouse. 



===Analogue Programming===
ReadJoyPort(unit) to get the usual digital positions
ReadJoyPort(unit + JP_TYPE_ANALOGUE) to get the new analog positions which contains two eight bit counters holding the absolute position of two joystick axis. 

The analogue axis information is an unsigned integer from 0 to 255 and has not necessarily been calibrated to be centered at 128. 

An application can also take control and can explicitly demand JP_TYPE_ANALOGUE data by either adding JP_ANALOGUE_PORT_MAGIC to the portNumber or setting SJA_TYPE to SJA_TYPE_ANALOGUE in SetJoyPortAttrs(). 

* To use the second analog joy, you must assign it like a second joystick (for example left joy as joy in port 0 and the other in port 1 ) and enable the analog hack on this &quot;second&quot; joypad 
* use JP_ANALOGUE_PORT_MAGIC on two lowlevel units. Then you map the second analog stick of your joypad to the axis of lowlevel unit 0 
* Your game can now read the two analog sticks of one single joypad :-)



===Rumble Programming===
SetJoyPortAttrsA() adds three options for force feedback and rumble pack support. These are currently very basic controls of two motors found in the joypad. 
 
* portNumber - the joyport in question (0-3).
* SJA_Type (ULONG) - Sets the current controller type to the mouse, joystick, or game controller. Supply one of SJA_TYPE_GAMECTLR, SJA_TYPE_MOUSE, SJA_TYPE_JOYSTK, or SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE. If SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE is used, SJA_TYPE_ANALOGUE, or SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE.
If SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE is used, ReadJoyPort() will attempt to determine the type of controller plugged into the given port automatically. If one of the other types is used, ReadJoyPort() will forcing a port to deallocate any allocated resources; return the implied type to SJA_TYPE_AUTOSENSE.
* SJA_RumbleSetSlowMotor (UBYTE) - If a rumble pack is available, using this tag will set the speed of the slow motor to the given value (0 - 255).
* SJA_RumbleSetFastMotor (UBYTE) - If a rumble pack is available, using this tag will set the speed of the fast motor to the given value (0 - 255). 
* SJA_RumbleOff (BOOL) - If set, this will turn the rumble pack motors off.

RESULT success - TRUE if everything went according to plan, or FALSE upon failure 

The call to turn rumble on is 

 SetJoyPortAttrsA(joy, SJA_RumbleSetFastMotor, 255, TAG_DONE);

where joy is the appropriate unit

 ReadJoyPort() ignores buttons 8-12 on the gamepad, even though they work fine in Preferences 

Sometimes they are not, as there is no real standard for that. It seems to be the norm but not always...

I saw that a comment of yours about featured books was deleted recently, and I guess that was because it did not have all the required information. You were interested in classical islamic history, and Wikibooks has two books in that area. [[History of Islam]] and [[History of Islamic Civilization]] but I don't think these are complete enough yet to be featured as good books according to our rules (see [[Wikibooks:Good books]].

== '''Footnotes and End Notes''' ==


Footnotes and end notes are another way to reference information, however it is not recommended use by the MLA or APA guidelines. This type of referencing can be distracting to readers and therefore not encouraged to use. The MLA style does encourage the use of end notes or footnotes for bibliographic notes, which is a way to refer publications of others for your reader to consult.

Here are some examples provided from The Purdue Online Writing Lab

*1. See Blackmur, especially chapters three and four, for an insightful analysis of this trend.

*2. On the problems related to repressed memory recovery, see Wollens 120-35; for a contrasting view, see Pyle 43; Johnson, Hull, Snyder 21-35; Krieg 78-91.

*3. Several other studies point to this same conclusion. See Johnson and Hull 45-79, Kather 23-31, Krieg 50-57.

You may also use footnotes or end notes for explanatory notes, which refers to a brief additional piece of information that might not fight well into the main text.

*4. In a 1998 interview, she reiterated this point even more strongly: &quot;I am an artist, not a politician!&quot; (Weller 124).

==Numbering Footnotes and End Notes in the Document Body==

Footnotes and end notes in the MLA style are shown with an in text superscript number. This number is found at the end of the piece of information being used.

Here is an example:

Some have argued that crimes in the U.S. have been out of control.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

When using footnotes or end notes do not use asterisks (*), angle brackets (&lt;), or other symbols for note reference. The list of footnotes and end notes should correspond to the note reference in the text. When using Microsoft word you can insert footnote and it will automatically insert superscript number and ask to list the reference at the bottom of the page.

==Formatting Footnotes and End Notes==
===End Notes Page===

When formatting end notes MLA recommends that all the notes be listed on a separate page titled Notes or End Notes. The Notes page should come before a works cited page. The notes themselves should be listed in order and correspond to the number used in the text. 

===Footnotes===
The footnotes can be found at the bottom of the page there are used on. So if there are four footnotes listed in the text there should be four notes at the very bottom of the page.

Many people use tables and figures in their papers to help explain certain points they are trying to make. The purpose of this illustrations is to help the audience understand visually what the writer is trying to convey. There are many ways to do this in a paper with the use of basic word processing software.

General Guidelines

*Collect sources, gather the necessary source information required for MLA style formatting.
*Determine what illustrations best suit your purpose, figure out how the table or figure will contribute to your paper.
*Use tables and figures of the best quality, avoid poor pictures or images.
*Use figures sparingly, make sure the images are used meaningfully.
*Do not use images to boost page length, professors usually don't count space taken up by illustrations.


'''Labels, Captions, and Source Information'''

When using tables and figures they will be embedded in the document somewhere, therefore, these illustrations need to be labeled with a number and a caption. They must also be cited at the end of the paper.

'''Label'''
The figure or table should have a label and number that will appear always in two places: the documents main text (ex. see table 2) and near the actual figure or table itself.
   
'''Captions'''
Captions provide the title of the object and a brief statement explaining what the figure is about.  

'''Source Information'''
Source information documentation will depend upon the degree of the source illustration. You can provide the source information with all of the figures or tables and then won't need to be included on the works cites page.


'''Tables'''

The following are some guidelines for using tables

*Make sure to refer to the table and its corresponding numeral in text. (ex. see table 4)
*Insert the table near the text it relates to.
*Align the table so it is set up to the left margin.
*Label the table and provide the corresponding number.
*Provide a caption for the table, most often this is the title of the table and what it relates to.    
*Underneath the title should be the source information with a descriptor source, followed by a colon, then provide the MLA bibliographic information for the source.
*If there is additional information or explanatory notes list this below the caption information or the table.    


'''Figures'''

The following are some guidelines for using figures

*All images that are not tables or musical score examples are labeled as Figure or Fig.
*When you refer to the figure in the text make sure the figure corresponds to the reference.
*MLA style does not specify alignment of figures, therefore, they can be centered anywhere on the page.
*At the bottom of the figure, provide a label name and number. (ex. Fig. 2)
*Be sure to label with a title or caption as well as source information.

Inductors are bulky, heavy and expensive; they cannot be miniaturized. So, it would be extremely useful if we manage to replace them by capacitors. The problem is to convert a capacitor into an inductor.

      <comment>/* The Fifth Seal */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The seal judgments are the beginning of the ''Tribulation'' (sometimes called the ''Great Tribulation''), a time of great suffering which will come upon the earth at the end of this age when, for a brief time, the forces of evil will have power over the entire globe. It is often seen both as a time of punishment and a final opportunity for people to come to God. However, those who submit themselves to God at this time will likely do so in the face of persecution.

In this chapter, we are dealing with the execution of divine judgment.  By opening the seals, the Lamb demonstrates his authority to carry out this judgment.  It is necessary to take a moment to describe the characteristics of this divine judgment.  First, it is not personal vengeance.  God is merciful and does not hold grudges; however, God must also be just in order to uphold his promises.  This divine justice is also different from the impersonal nature of karma in some Eastern religions.  God will personally judge specific sins and the people who committed them.  All will be held accountable for their behavior.  Finally, these initial judgments are not the end.  They function primarily as a call to repentance.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chapter begins the first of three sets of seven judgment.  Interspersed between the numbered judgments are unnumbered judgments.  These are likely closer examination of the larger judgement taking place.  Almost all of the imagery used in the judgments can also be found in other Jewish apocalyptic texts, but the way unnumbered judgments judgments are where the author's own Christian thought and theology can be most clearly seen.

==The First Seal== 

===Verses 1-2 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder -- one of the four beasts saying, “Come and see.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.'''''

''Commentary:This rider does not wear a crown, but rather &quot;a crown was given to him.&quot; As one reads further on in this book Jesus already has and wears many crowns on his head ( Rev 19:12). Later on, in Chapter 19, Christ is depicted riding a white horse. For this reason, some have suggested that the rider in this passage represents Christ. However, this rider does not ride alone, but is merely one of four of different colors. Also, the timing of this rider’s appearance does not coincide with our understanding from other passages in the Bible of Christ’s appearance. There may, therefore, be no connection between the two. Another suggestion, quite contrary to the first, is that the rider is the Antichrist, who comes in imitation of Christ, and the horse represents his kingdom. This is a possibility. But beyond what is clear from the passage, that he is a ruler and a conqueror, we cannot say for sure who this person is.
Ben Witherington III's commentary suggests that the first horseman generally symbolizes conquest but that the image used is a reference to Parthian archers. White was the sacred color of the Parthians and always had a few sacred white horses in battle, the Parthians were most feared by the Romans, and Jewish writers believed that the Parthian army would play a role in the eschatological fall of Rome.  It is important to note that while John's use of white, the bow and arrow, and the mounted warrior may indeed point to the Parthians, this reference may not literally mean that the Parthians would have a role in the end of the world.  If one considers that John sent the Book of Revelation to the seven churches in Asia in order to call them to repent, his symbolic references to the Parthians may be John's attempt to draw of common knowledge of the Parthians' historical prowess in conquest, in order to make the imagery more vivid and relevant to the readers.

==The Second Seal== 

===Verses 3-4===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, “Come and see.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people would slaughter one another; and he was given a great sword.'''''

''Commentary:'' This seal gives off a terrible depiction for it is in this seal that war is represented.  Man no longer feels the need to hold back from war resulting in the death of many people, warriors and civilians alike.  The red horse symbolizes the blood that will be shed by the sword that is given. Some scholars believe the attacks on Israel predicted in Ezekiel 38 and 39 and in Daniel 11:40-44 will occur at this time. It has not taken the Antichrist long to show his true agenda, but by now the world believes and follows him.

==The Third Seal== 

===Verses 5-6=== 
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, “Come and see.” And I beheld a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, “A measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny, and see that you hurt not the oil and the wine.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Here, John is signaled by the man-faced cherub. The third seal brings runaway inflation and global famine, symbolized by the black horse. The balances held by the rider are for measuring out food for sale instead of the usual use of the balances to symbolize justice. In John's day, a penny (Roman Denarius) was the typical wage for a day's work. A measure (Greek choinix) was about one quart. Wheat was the desired food, barley was the fare of the poor. This seal tells the reader that a state of famine is to come. It will take planning and conscious awareness to make sure one's income can cover all of the body's needs. Man may be required to buy cheaper barley instead of wheat.

Witherington interprets the strange voice to mean the cost of food in famine. The exception of oil and wine can be seen as an allusion to Domitian's destruction of olive orchards and vineyards, that even God in his wrath will not go so far as to destroy wine and oil. The stubbling of orchards would have been escpecially devastating to the populace due to long nurturing required before a tree bears fruit. (A year's wasted barley crop, on the other hand, will sprout again next spring.) However, in a passage on the horrors of the four horsemen of the apocalyse -- unleashed upon the world by Jesus -- searching for a message of God's mercy seems counterintuitive.

==The Fourth Seal== 

===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, “Come and see.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I looked and saw a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over a quarter of the earth, to kill with sword, hunger, death, and the beasts of the earth.'''''

''Commentary:'' The fourth seal brings about disease and sickness, which historically follow in the wake of famine. The color of this horse is of interest.  The Greek word at use here is &quot;chloros,&quot; which typically refers to a yellow-green.  This can be interpreted as the color of a decaying corpse.  This horse can be understood to represent sickness and death. Although this translation states that the rider is Death and Hell is the follower, other translations hold that the rider is Death and the follower is Hades.  Hades is the Greek god of the underworld, the land of the dead. Death can be seen as the killer, while Hades is the collector.  Power is given to Death to kill off a quarter of the earth.  Some commentaries suggest that the previous three horsemen were mere instruments of this fourth one.

Death and Hell in the passage are given power over the earth with sword, which could represent war, disease, or murder, hunger which represents famine, death, which represents a spiritual death and the Heavens being put into trial, and the beasts of the earth. This is not the only place in the Bible that states these powers. Ezekiel 5:17 states, &quot;And along with the famine, wild animals will attack you and rob you of your children. Disease and war will stalk your land, and I will bring the sword of the enemy against you. I, the LORD, have spoken!&quot;

==The Fifth Seal== 

===Verses 9-11 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held,''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and they cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And white robes were given to every one of them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled.'''''

''Commentary:'' The writer had a very intense emotional response to the opening of the fifth seal.  At first glance, the fifth seal doesn't seem to be a judgment. He sees the souls of martyrs under the alter at of the Lord.   The death as martyrs of those who have come to the Lord during the Tribulation period, and have suffered for their faith.  Persecutors of martyrs are only able to kill an earthly body, after death, there is nothing more that they may do.  However, a follower of Christ's soul lives for all of eternity. The altar mentioned in this verse could be a symbol of protection. God has created a place in heaven for the souls of the faithful.  However, this place in heaven is not from works, but simply from the sacrifice of Christ on the cross that grants entrance into heaven.  In heaven they receive their white robes depict the righteous standing they have earned before God. They are told to wait, for there will be many more to join them as the Tribulation continues.  The Lord is the comforter of hurt servants, and each of his servants blood is valued in his eyes.  It is also possible that they are the Christian martyrs from throughout the Church era. Their persecutors will be judged in due time, but they are told to wait until their number is complete. If, as some interpreters have it, they are the 144,000 of 7:1-8 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_7#A_Hundred_and_Forty-four_Thousand_Israelites_Are_Sealed] and 14:1-5 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_14#A_Hundred_and_Forty-Four_Thousand_Virgins], that number is very specific and possibly preordained.

==The Sixth Seal== 

===Verses 12-13===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood,''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, even as a fig tree casts her untimely figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind.'''''

''Commentary:''  All of the series seem to be a form of judgement before Christ comes with the final judgement. The sixth seal brings a natural disastrous upheaval of nature, or perhaps a series of them. We know that the sun is darkened and the moon turns reddish when there is dust in the air. Obviously the stars cannot fall, but something like meteors or volcanic bombs would fit the description.. Modern science tells us that either a super-volcano or an impact event could produce these conditions. Unless the observer was at ground zero, the earth would be felt to shake first as described. When the disciples asked Jesus, &quot;What will be the sign of Your coming, and  of the end of the age?&quot; (Matthew 24:3), Jesus  replied, &quot;Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven and powers of the heavens will be shaken&quot; (Mt. 24:29). This is a very similar description of the same events that transpired in these verses.
Joel 2:30 and 31 predict such disasters as signs of the Day of the Lord.

There are other earthquakes mentioned in the book of Revelation as well--this is the first of five. The next is mentioned in 8:5 &quot;Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.&quot; The third earthquake is in 11:13 and talks more of the reaction that people had after the earthquake: &quot;At that moment there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.&quot; The fourth is in 11:19 when God's temple is opened in the heavens and that opening is accompanied by natural disasters, including an earthquake. The last and most powerful occurs in 16:18-21, &quot;And a violent earthquake, such as had not occurred since people were upon the earth...the cities of the nations fell...every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found.&quot; The repetitive use of these earthquakes is vivid--it could literally mean that earthquakes unlike anything the world has ever experience before will plague the world. Another interpretation is that this time will be full of tribulations and trials of faith unlike anything humans have faced before and that many will fall from grace during this time.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.'''''

''Commentary:'' The description of the sky (&quot;heaven&quot;), sun, and moon may be indicative of a deep haze where normally visible features like mountains and islands cannot be seen. This fits perfectly into the picture of the sun darkening and the moon turning red. Anyone who has experienced a volcanic ash-fall knows that it rolls across the land like a scroll and brings darkness with it. An impact event caused by the &quot;stars&quot; falling to earth (a possible reference to a meteor shower) would do much the same. However, the &quot;great earthquake&quot; of v12 suggests that the mountains and islands might literally be moved out of their places. Such movement is a common aftermath of earthquakes, though this passage suggests something out of the ordinary.
This event is coming from the wrath of the lamb. But, this event is not the destruction of all beings. Refugees are told to take cover. This verse continues the theme of natural disaster that comes up repeatedly in Revelation. It is said that natural disaster is related to divine judgement. This particular natural disaster is occurring because the seals are being opened, but not all disasters in revelation are related to the seals. It can be inferred that the storms show God's judgement, or the wrath of the lamb.

===Verses 15-17===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the chief captains, the mighty men, every bondman, and every free man hid themselves in the dens and rocks of the mountains,''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for the great day of his wrath is come, and who will be able to stand?”'''''

''Commentary:'' Everyone, regardless of their station, will be terrified of these events. Some few will realize what is really happening and may still manage to be saved. Most will just want to hide or die, because the disaster is unbearable. The great day of his wrath is the Day of the Lord (Joel 1:15 and 2:1, 11, 31). &quot;Is come&quot; means it has actually arrived, just as long promised. 

This last statement adds weight to the futurist interpretation, because it indicates that God has set aside a specific time for judgment, “the day of his wrath.” Furthermore, we have not yet seen catastrophes of the scale described, so that, according to the futurist, they must be still in the future. It must be remembered, however, that the futurist interpretation (and any interpretation which sees a fulfilment of Revelation's prophecies after the first century) is based on faith. Many scholars reject such a view of Revelation in the belief that it is impossible to foresee future events.It is interesting to remember that Christ is responsible for the seals and the results of opening them, but that the Lamb( possible symbol of Christ) is still so merciful and just.

      <comment>/* Internal Consistency */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Research methods often depend on taking measurements, the validity of those measurements and the reliability of the global procedure.  At first glance all this elements seems to be referring to the same, but you need to understand that all deal with the consistency in obtaining consistent and valid data at each level of complexity of he process.

Reliability is the degree of consistency of the examiner or the tools used to obtain the measurements.

== Consistency ==
Consistency deals with duplicability and the enforcement of the scientific method. All things being equal the results should remain the same.

=== Test/Retest ===

=== Internal Consistency (reliability) ===
Covers the degree of similitude in results regarding operations, inside a specific and limited range, regarding the locality of said operations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This page includes material about some utilities. Most of the functions presented here have nothing to do with statistical analysis but may be useful when working on a project. Many functions are just similar to standard unix functions. 

== System (Unix/DOS) ==

&lt;tt&gt;system()&lt;/tt&gt; gives access to the system (DOS or unix). The option &lt;tt&gt;wait=FALSE&lt;/tt&gt; means that you don't ask R to wait that the task is finished.

Some examples : 
* You can convert an image from to PS to PNG using the unix &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; function of your computer. If you want to know more about this function, open a Terminal application and type &lt;tt&gt;man convert&lt;/tt&gt; (This should work on Mac OS and Linux). 
* You can open Stata and run a program. 
* You can run pdflatex from R and directly open the pdf in a pdf browser.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
system(&quot;convert W:/toto.ps W:/toto.png&quot;) # converts toto.ps to toto.png
system(&quot;D:/Stata10/stata.exe do D:/pgm.do&quot;, wait = F) # opens Stata and run pgm.do
system(&quot;pdflatex.exe -shell-escape file.tex&quot;) # runs pdflatex
system(&quot;open file.pdf&quot;) # opens the pdf
system(&quot;open M:/.../doc/*.pdf&quot;) # opens all the pdf in a directory
&lt;/source&gt;
See also &lt;tt&gt;sys()&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Hmisc''' package, &lt;tt&gt;shell()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;shell.exec()&lt;/tt&gt;.

== File Handling ==
&lt;tt&gt;dir()&lt;/tt&gt; lists all the files in a directory. It is similar to the Unix function &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;code&gt;dir.create()&lt;/code&gt; creates a new directory. It is similar to &lt;tt&gt;mkdir&lt;/tt&gt; in Unix.

&lt;tt&gt;file.info()&lt;/tt&gt; gives information about a file. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; file.info(&quot;taille.txt&quot;)
           size isdir mode               mtime               ctime               atime exe
taille.txt  444 FALSE  666 2009-06-26 12:25:44 2009-06-26 12:25:43 2009-06-26 12:25:43  no
&lt;/source&gt;
Removing files with a specific pattern : 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
file.remove(dir(path=&quot;directoryname&quot;, pattern=&quot;*.log&quot;)) 
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;file.edit()&lt;/code&gt; opens a file in the text editor.
* &lt;tt&gt;file.show()&lt;/tt&gt; opens a file in a new window.
* &lt;tt&gt;tempfile()&lt;/tt&gt; creates a temporary file.

* &lt;tt&gt;getZip()&lt;/tt&gt; in the Hmisc package.

== Internet ==

&lt;tt&gt;browseURL()&lt;/tt&gt; opens an URL using an internet browser. &lt;tt&gt;download.file()&lt;/tt&gt; download a file from the internet.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; browseURL(&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

To see the default browser, use &lt;tt&gt;getOption()&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
getOption(&quot;browser&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can change the default browser using the &lt;tt&gt;options()&lt;/tt&gt; command. It is safer to store the options before. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
oldoptions &lt;- options() # save the options
options(browser = &quot;D:/FramafoxPortable/FramafoxPortable.exe&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

You can download a file from the internet using &lt;code&gt;download.file()&lt;/code&gt;. Note that very often you don't need to download a file from the internet and you can directly load it into R from the internet using standard functions. For instance, if you want to read a text file from the internet, you can use &lt;code&gt;read.table()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scan()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;readLines()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
# For example, we download &quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Text_Processing&quot; on our Desktop
download.file(url=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Text_Processing&quot;,destfile= &quot;~/Desktop/test_processing.html&quot;)
# You can also read it into R using readLines()
text &lt;- readLines(&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Text_Processing&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

See also '''RCurl'''

== Computing time ==

If you perform computer intensive task you may want to optimize the computing time. 
Two functions are available system.time() and proc.time(). Both returns a vector of values. 
The first is the standard [[Wikipedia |CPU time]].
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; system.time(x&lt;-rnorm(10^6))
[1] 1.14 0.07 1.83 0.00 0.00
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; debut &lt;- proc.time()
&gt; x &lt;- rnorm(10^6)
&gt; proc.time()-debut
[1]  1.66  0.10 10.32  0.00  0.00
&lt;/source&gt;

== Computing process ==

&lt;tt&gt;user.prompt()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''Zelig''') makes a pause in the computation process (useful if you want to do a demo). &lt;tt&gt; waitReturn()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''cwhmisc''') does the same job.
&lt;tt&gt;Sys.sleep()&lt;/tt&gt; stop the computation during a few seconds.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; user.prompt()

Press &lt;return&gt; to continue: 
&gt; Sys.sleep(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is possible to stop the computing process if a logical condition is not true using &lt;tt&gt;stopifnot()&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Miscellanous ==

* &lt;tt&gt;trCopy()&lt;/tt&gt; ('''TinnR''' package) copy an object to the clipboard. It is useful if you want to copy a large object to the clipboard. For instance, if you want to copy the code of a function and paste it in a text editor. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; trCopy(lm)
[1] TRUE
&lt;/source&gt;

* &lt;tt&gt;sessionInfo()&lt;/tt&gt; gives information on the current session info (R version + loaded packages). This function may be useful for reproducible computing. &lt;tt&gt;getRversion()&lt;/tt&gt; gives the current R version. &lt;tt&gt;R.version&lt;/tt&gt; gives more details about the computer and &lt;tt&gt;R.Version()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the same informations as a list.

== See Also ==

* See the '''R.utils''' package&lt;ref&gt;  Henrik Bengtsson (2009). R.utils: Various programming utilities. R package version
  1.1.7. http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R.utils&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 6.1: Learning About Constructivism by Authoring a Wiki Textbook'''

===Introduction ===
As a major theoretical framework and pedagogical system, Constructivism is a course topic offered in numerous graduate and undergraduate education programs in the USA and abroad.  With the increasingly interactive and social capabilities of the web, educators now have more opportunity to practice the principles of constructivism in the classroom learning environments at all levels. This chapter section describes the course “Principles of Constructivism” which uses one of those new web tools – WikiBooks – in a course that enables the learners to actually learn about constructivism by experiencing constructivist methods.

===Course Description ===
“Principles of Constructivism” is an online graduate education course at Webster University which aims to: 

:“… explore the history, theory and educational applications of constructivism. The course employs collaborative processes and learning community-based web technologies: Participants have direct experience learning about constructivism by doing and participating in the constructivist methodologies used in this course.” (Webster University, 2010)

The participants in the course are expected to be able to: 
*Demonstrate a working knowledge of the key principles of constructivism and constructivist theories
*Author original articles that describe constructivist theories and their applications in the classroom
*Adopt strategies to promote active student learning and questioning.
*Design lessons that involve constructivist principles such as collaboration, student-centered learnng, authentic (real-world) problems and other creative thinking processes
*Design pupil assessment strategies consistent with constructivist learning processes

The course is structured in an 8-week intensive term and organized into five modules. 

*Module A:  Introduction to the Course:. Leaning About Constructivism by Doing Constructivism. How to work with Collaborative Writing Tools (Wiki, Blogs, GoogleDocs).
*Module B: Authoring Wiki Textbook Chapter2: Major Contributors to Constructivist Theory
*Module C: Authoring Textbook Chapter 3-5: Constructivist Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment
*Module D: Authoring Wiki Textbook Chapter 6: Case Examples of Constructivist Learning
*Module E:  Course Conclusion / Reflections are rethinking classroom learning. 

Modules B, C and D involve authoring the chapters in this WikiBook. A team of two students work on a wikibook chapter. Both students conduct library research on their chapter topic and write notes on a shared “sandbox” document. GoogleDocs documents are used for this sandbox. One student is assigned the role of “initiating author.” In this role, the student composes the chapter or chapter section and posts it in the WikiBook.  The initiating author also grades the Chapter Quiz taken by all the class members using the answer key created by the Quiz Builder.  

The other student on the team plays the role of “editor and quiz builder.” The editor rewrites all references and URLs for the bibliography in proper APA format; and posts the bibliography section in the WikiBook. The editor also checks and edits for originality in writing in the WikiBook and composes chapter quiz questions and an answer key. 

Upon completion of the chapter, other class members read the chapter and take the chapter quiz, which is reviewed and graded by the initiating author of the chapter. 

In chapter 6, each student writes a case example of a course or unit in which constructivist principles are employed. This case example is a demonstration of the students’ application of the constructivist pedagogy into their own classroom or teaching environment.

===Constructivist Principles and Pedagogy  ===
The wiki textbook authoring process is suggested in the work of Cunnigham (2002), Watson &amp; Others (2004), and O'Shea (2007) as well as in Webster University's experiences with wiki textbooks (Webster University, 2008, 2009, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c). 

Wiki textbook authoring is consistent with the constructivist approach. According to Lepionka (2007), open content publishing “firmly supports and extends constructivist models of teaching and learning.” The following constructivist characteristics are applicable to the wiki textbook authoring project: (a) knowledge construction; (b) creativity and innovation, (c) critical thinking, inquiry and problem solving, (d) communication, collaboration, and community building, (e) Authentic (real-world) learning and assessment, (f) embedded interactive  technologies, and (g) student initiative and responsibility provide a solid basis for this skill development.

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Textbook Authorship as Knowledge Construction:'' 
The fundamental concept in constructivism is that learning occurs through a process in which a person “constructs or invents” knowledge through his or her experiences in the world, rather than being a recipient of information. In this vein, the authoring of chapters in the WikiBook enable the students to likewise construct their knowledge of constructivism, rather than just reading about constructivism in an already published textbook. 



&lt;li&gt;''Creativity and Innovation.'' 
The emphasis on creativity and innovation is a hallmark of constructivism. Learning itself is considered to be both (1) a creative process; and (2) resulting in novel and creative outcomes. Authoring the WikiBook chapters is itself a creative process. Farrell and Tanner (2002) point out that that wiki textbooks show more &quot;creativity and imagination of individual authors&quot; rather than the formulaic and hierarchical authoring emphasized in traditional textbooks.


&lt;li&gt;''Critical Thinking, Inquiry, and Problem-Solving''
The constructivist learning process is not passive: It capitalizes on the curiosities, interest, or questions that are meaningful to the learner. Student authoring of wiki textbooks is a high level writing task: It requires students to be continuously engaged in data gathering, organization, writing, revising and editing. Wikis foster immersion in the writing process.   


&lt;li&gt;''Communication, Collaboration and Community Building'' 
In constructivism, collaboration is an important part of the knowledge construction process. Working on problems and tasks with at least one other learner provides the environment for the necessary dialogue to challenge and form emerging concepts and ideas. Learner collaboration reflects the development and publishing of textual content as ongoing, dynamic and community dependent. The two-person or three-person team approach was used in this course as well as in in the Webster University class, Constructivism and Technology (2009).


Wiki textbooks enable instructors and students to build a community of learners. Using a wiki textbook provides instructor and students an opportunity to reinforce the value of social learning emphasized in constructivism (Barton, 2004).


&lt;li&gt;''Authentic (real-world) learning and assessment.'' 
Constructivism stresses that learning be in the real-world context rather than in the isolation of the classroom or ivory tower. Traditional textbooks and even some wiki textbooks could also be remote and isolated from authentic experiences. However, authoring wiki textbook chapters places students into the authentic publishing arena. The audience of their writing is not just their instructor or their classmates, but the real-world audience of peers, other professionals and experts, the WikiBook editors. Adhering to writing standards, WikiBook publishing guidelines, and digital ethics standards elevates the professionalism of the writing assignment.  With the work is subject to immediate publication, public critique and review, the writing process becomes a living interaction in coauthorship and professional writing, editing and publishing enterprise.


&lt;li&gt;''Embedded interactive technologies''
Various new social web tools provide interactive and communication capabilities that support the constructivist classroom. These technologies include wikis, blogs, podcasts, video and audio blogs, and social networking (e.g. ning, Facebook, Twitter). The WikiBook used in this course allows open viewing and editing of the chapter contents by anyone who can access the web.


&lt;li&gt;''Student initiative and responsibility.'' 
Student initiative and responsibility are supported in constructivist classrooms. The team approach to WikiBook chapter authoring structures team members to coordinate their efforts on the authoring of the chapter and the chapter quiz. Completion of the chapter and the grading of the quiz items are dependent on each team member fulfilling their role assignments.

&lt;/ol&gt;

===Conclusion ===
Wiki textbook authoring supports constructivist pedagogy in many ways. It goes beyond lecture notes, quizzes, and charts and graphs. Wiki textbooks provide support for interaction as students collaborate in their research, write, edit, and publish. They share knowledge with the general public as well as with classmates. Wiki textbook authoring enables students to assess themselves while collaborating, creating, researching, reading, and writing. From the research they do, students are inspired to develop multiple literacies and both critical and creative thinking skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 6.2: Constructivism in Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, (CBRN) '''

===Introduction ===
This unit is to coordinate previous learning into a comprehensive scenario driven Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, (CBRN) event. The student must be able to use the process of academic inquiry for successful completion of the unit and be employed as a viable response member and leader.

===Course Description ===
The aim of this course is to develop an academic inquiry process designed to enable the learner to develop critical thinking. The learning outcomes are based upon critical thinking and involve: a process that is not random or haphazard but rather focused and structured. If we look at critical thinking, an integral element of academic inquiry, we can find many different models presented in the literature —one of which is found in the &quot;Role of Critical Thinking&quot;. 
If we analyze the methods involved in thinking critically, solving problems, making decisions, and conducting research in preparation for writing a paper or creating a briefing, we will find that each is nothing more than a structured academic inquiry process. The process starts with a question or a problem about which one needs to 
- gather information and determine assumptions; 
- analyze the information garnered from various points of view; 
- draw conclusions or determine solutions; 
- determine the implications and consequences of the conclusion or solution.

The grade level for this unit is Post Secondary at the Associate through Bachelor Degree level.

The noted philosopher John Dewey (1938) describes the process of academic inquiry as a controlled or directed transformation of discrete bits and pieces of information or situations with no apparent connections or relationships into a unified and meaningful whole.

My assessment method is scenario driven

===Constructivist Principles and Pedagogy  ===
The processes for thinking critically, solving problems, making decisions, and conducting research are very structured, not all of the processes are necessarily sequential (or linear).  

Knowledge construction; “Given an objective to be obtained a student must have experience that give him the opportunity to practice the kind of behavior implied by the objective .” (Tyler, 1949) The learner must have had previous experience in Hazardous Materials Incident Response at the Operational Level. This certification can be gained either from the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC), Professional Qualification Board (PROBOARD) or Department of Defense CERTEST.

The learner will be guided by Bloom’s Taxonomy and using analysis and Synthesis although they are really two elements of a six stage hierarchy of how we acquire and use information. These six elements are usually titled: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation. This unit will require higher order thinking in the realms of analysis, synthesis and evaluation.  

'''creativity and innovation'''. Leaders have many key roles in developing an organization and having the organization reach its full potential. Leaders must understand that they have responsibilities that are required at various levels within the organization. Just as each person in an organization has distinct personalities and traits, organizational leaders have distinct goals.

In most organizations, a clear mission and vision will be established. The organizational leader focuses on mission accomplishment while the strategic leader focuses on vision. 
critical thinking, inquiry and problem solving, As part of the critical thinking process, the learner should be able to Analyze, Plan, Implement and Evaluate each course of action to determine the best results and fewest numbers of exposures or casualties at a CBRN Incident.
communication, collaboration, and community building, As we look at the organizational leader his focus must not only be on mission accomplishment, but also the team building concept. The organizational leader must ensure his subordinates have a clear understanding of the mission, means to accomplish the mission and resources necessary to ensure mission accomplishment.

The organizational leader may also have multiple missions that require a staff that is capable of interacting with various other staffs and agencies. While organizational leaders primarily exert direct influence through their chain of command and staff, they extend influence beyond their chain of command and organizations by other means (FM 6-22, 11-7, OCT 2006).

Organizational leaders must display various traits of leadership to influence their subordinates, integrity and compassion are key.

===Conclusion ===
'''Authentic (real-world) learning and assessment,''' The student will be assesses through numerous interactions with instructors at various phases of their development. Each development point has nationally established forms in the Incident Management System and Incident Command System. The main criteria will be presentation of an Emergency Action Plan and the learner will be assessed on its viability by actually executing the plan in a training environment. The goal is to minimize exposures and casualties. If the students plan is successful, then he has achieved the objective of the course.

'''Embedded interactive technologies,''' The interactive technologies are computerized reports, use of the Gas Chromatograph / Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS), Monitoring Equipment and communications skills written and oral.
student initiative and responsibility Student initiative and responsibility are the key to this unit. The student must take the initiative to develop an action plan, ensure all key members are in place i.e. safety officer, incident commander, survey team.

===Glossary ===
'''All-Hazards''' Term that encompasses domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and
other emergencies

'''Branch Plan''' A modification to an existing plan that usually adjusts the required resources or concept of operations. However, the end-state normally remains the same. For example, an existing plan calls for delivering medical supplies by rail transport but the situation prevents using rail, delivering the supplies by air transport or a combination of air and road transport represent a “branch” plan. See “sequel plan.”
Catastrophic Incident
Any natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other manmade disaster that results in extraordinary levels of casualties or damage or disruption severely affecting the population (including mass evacuations), infrastructure, environment, economy, national morale, or government functions in an area.

'''Contingency Planning'''
Planning that occurs before the incident or in the pre-incident phase. A contingency plan provides guidance for conducting operations.

'''Course of Action (COA)'''
Means available to the decision maker by which the objectives may be attained. A course of action is a broadly stated, potential solution to an assigned mission. A systems analysis usually considers several possible courses of action, which are then referred to as alternatives or as the decision maker's options.

'''Crisis Action Planning'''A planning approach that outlines incident priorities, objectives, and initial actions, and drives the development of supporting plans. Initial activities may include search and rescue, evacuations, communication of key information to the public, restoration of essential critical infrastructure, and provision of community law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services among others.

'''Functional Planning'''
Planning approach that identifies the common tasks that the community must perform during emergencies.

Hazard A source of potential danger or harm, often the root cause of an unwanted outcome.

'''Homeland Security Management System (HSMS)'''A continuous cycle of four phased activities, including guidance, planning, execution, and assessment and evaluation.

'''Incident''' An occurrence or event, natural or manmade, that requires a response to protect life or property. Incidents can, for example, include major disasters, emergencies, terrorist attacks, terrorist threats, civil unrest, wildland and urban fires, floods, hazardous materials spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, tsunamis, war-related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an emergency response.

'''Lessons Learned''' A collection and analysis of data from a variety of current and historical
sources, including operations and training events, that produces lessons for leaders and practitioners, staffs, and homeland security community at large.

'''National Incident Management System (NIMS)'''A system mandated by HSPD-5 that provides a consistent nationwide
approach for Federal, State, local, and Tribal governments; the private
sector; and NGOs to work effectively and efficiently together to prepare
for, respond to, and recover from incidents, regardless of cause, size, or
complexity. To provide for interoperability and compatibility among
Federal, State, Tribal, and local capabilities, NIMS includes a core set of
concepts, principles, and terminology. HSPD-5 identifies these as the
Incident Command System (ICS); multi-agency coordination systems;
training; identification and management of resources (including systems
for classifying types of resources); qualification and certification; and the
collection, tracking, and reporting of incident information and incident
resources.

'''National Planning Scenario (NPS)'''An event or threat scenario appropriate for national planning by and
among all levels and jurisdictions or government, and in coordination
with private, non-profit, and volunteer organizations.

'''Objective''' A clearly defined, decisive, and attainable goal toward which a homeland security operation is directed.

'''Operation''' A homeland security action or the carrying out of a strategic, operational, or tactical homeland security mission.

'''Operations Plan (OPLAN)'''
A plan that identifies detailed resource, personnel, and asset allocations in order to execute the objectives of the strategic plan and turn strategic priorities into operational execution. An operations plan contains a full description of the concept of operations, including specific roles and responsibilities, tasks, integration, and actions required, with support function annexes as appropriate.40 It represents a product of the operational planning level.

'''Scenario-Based Planning'''
Planning approach that uses scenarios as a focal point for developing the actions necessary to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from the specific scenario. HSPD-8, Annex I, requires the production of scenario based plans by using the NPSs.

'''Senior Leader''' For the purposes of the IPS, the Federal official tasked to oversee homeland security operations under the plan being prepared. For example, the Secretary of Homeland Security would be the senior leader for strategic plans based on the NPSs.

'''Staff Estimate''' An estimate that consists of significant facts, events, and conclusions for various functional areas (e.g., information, intelligence, resources, and operations) based on current or anticipated situations.

'''Task Specific''' actions that are implemented to achieve the identified objectives.

'''Tactical Plan''' The detailed development and identification of individual tasks, actions, and objectives tailored to specific situations and fact patterns at an operational level. Tactical planning is meant to support and achieve the objectives of the operations plan.48 It represents the product of the tactical planning level.

'''PROBLEM SOLVING''' 
Extracted from FM 5-0 

'''1. Identify the Problem''' A problem exists when there is a difference between the current state or condition and a desired state or condition. Army leaders identify problems from a variety of sources. These include— 
• Higher headquarters directives or guidance. 
• Decision maker guidance. 
• Subordinates. 
• Personal observations. 

When identifying the problem, leaders actively seek to identify its root cause, not merely the symptoms on the surface. Symptoms may be the reason that the problem became visible. They are often the first things noticed and frequently require attention. However, focusing on a problem’s symptoms may lead to false conclusions or inappropriate solutions. Using a systematic approach to identifying problems helps avoid the “solving symptoms” pitfall. 

To identify the root cause of a problem, leaders do the following: 
• Compare the current situation to the desired end state. 
• Define the problem’s scope or boundaries. 
• Answer the following questions: 
_ Who does the problem affect? 
_ What is affected? 
_ When did the problem occur? 
_ Where is the problem? 
_ Why did the problem occur? 
• Determine the cause of obstacles between here and the solution. Many times the causes of a problem are simply obstacles between the current situation and the desired end state. 

• Write a draft problem statement. 

• Redefine the problem as necessary as new information is acquired and assessed. 
After identifying the root causes, leaders develop a problem statement. A problem statement is written as an infinitive phrase: such as, “To determine the best location for constructing a multipurpose vehicle wash rack facility during this fiscal year.” When the problem under consideration is based upon a directive from a higher authority, it is best to submit the problem statement to the decision maker for approval. This ensures the problem solver has understood the decision maker’s guidance before continuing. 
Once they have developed the problem statement, leaders make a plan to solve the problem. Leaders make the best possible use of available time and allocate time for each problem-solving step. Doing this provides a series of deadlines to meet in solving the problem. Leaders use reverse planning to prepare their problem solving time line (see Chapter 1). They use this time line to periodically assess their progress. They do not let real or perceived pressure cause them to abandon solving the problem systematically. They change time allocations as necessary, but they do not ignore them. 

'''2. Gather Information''' 
After completing the problem statement, leaders continue to gather information relevant to the problem. Gathering information begins with problem definition and continues throughout the problem solving process. Army leaders never stop acquiring and assessing the impact of new or additional information. 
When gathering information, Army leaders define unfamiliar terms. Doing this is particularly important when dealing with technical information. Leaders consider the intended audience in deciding what to define. For example: a product for an audience that includes civilians may require definitions of all Army terms. A technical report prepared for a decision maker unfamiliar with the subject should include definitions the reader needs to know to understand the report. 

Army leaders gather information from primary sources whenever possible. Primary sources are people with first-hand knowledge of the subject under investigation, or documents produced by them. Methods of gathering information from primary sources include interviews, letters of request for specific information, and questionnaires. 
Two types of information are required to solve problems: facts and assumptions. Fully understanding these types of information is critical to understanding problem solving. In addition, Army leaders need to know how to handle opinions and how to manage information when working in a group. 

'''Facts''' 
Facts are verifiable pieces of information or information presented that has objective reality. They form the foundation on which the solution to a problem is based. Regulations, policies, doctrinal publications, commander's guidance, plans and orders, personal experience, and the Internet are just a few sources of facts. 

'''Assumptions''' 
An assumption is information accepted as true in the absence of facts. This information is probably correct, but cannot be verified. Appropriate assumptions used in decision making have two characteristics: 
• They are valid, that is, they are likely to be true. 
• They are necessary, that is, they are essential to continuing the problem solving process. 

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, it is discarded. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, it is treated as a fact. Problem solvers continually seek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. 
Opinions 

When gathering information, Army leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment that the Army leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result of years of experience. Army leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts, include them as opinions, or reject them. Army leaders neither routinely accept opinions as facts nor reject them as irrelevant—regardless of their source. 

'''Organizing Information''' 
Army leaders check each piece of information to verify its accuracy. If possible, two individuals should check and confirm the accuracy of facts and the validity of assumptions. 

Being able to establish whether a piece of information is a fact or an assumption is of little value if those working on the problem do not know the information exists. Army leaders share information with the decision maker, subordinates, and peers, as appropriate. A proposed solution to a problem is only as good as the information that forms the basis of the solution. Sharing information among members of a problem solving team increases the likelihood that a team member will uncover the information that leads to the best solution. 

Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the problem or its solution. Army leaders determine these as they gather information. They coordinate with other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations that may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine: for example, a squad leader checking with the squad on his right to make sure their fields of fire overlap; or it may be formal, as when a division action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, Army leaders always coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present it to the decision maker. 

'''3. Develop Criteria''' 
The next step in the problem solving process is developing criteria. A criterion is a standard, rule, or test by which something can be judged—a measure of value. Problem solvers develop criteria to assist them in formulating and evaluating possible solutions to a problem. Criteria are based on facts or assumptions. Problem solvers develop two types of criteria: screening and evaluation criteria. 

'''Screening Criteria''' 
Army leaders use screening criteria to ensure solutions being considered can solve the problem. Screening criteria defines the limits of an acceptable solution. As such, they are tools to establish the baseline products for analysis. A solution may be rejected based solely on the application of screening criteria. Five categories of screening criteria are commonly applied to test a possible solution: 
• Suitability—solves the problem and is legal and ethical. 
• Feasibility—fits within available resources. 
• Acceptability—worth the cost or risk. 
• Distinguishability—differs significantly from other solutions. 
• Completeness—contains the critical aspects of solving the problem from start to finish. 

'''Evaluation Criteria''' 
After developing screening criteria, the problem solver develops the evaluation criteria in order to differentiate among possible solutions. Well-defined evaluation criteria have five elements: 
• Short Title—the criterion name. 
• Definition—a clear description of the feature being evaluated. 
• Unit of Measure—a standard element used to quantify the criterion. 
Examples of units of measure are US dollars, miles per gallon, and 
feet. 
• Benchmark—a value that defines the desired state, or &quot;good&quot; for a 
solution in terms of a particular criterion. 
• Formula—an expression of how changes in the value of the criterion affect the desirability of the possible solution. State the formula in comparative terms (for example, more is better) or absolute terms (for example, a night movement is better than a day movement). 
A well-thought-out benchmark is critical for meaningful analysis. Analysis judges a solution against a standard, telling whether that solution is good in an objective sense. It differs from comparison, which judges possible solutions against each other telling us whether it is better, or worse in a relative sense. Benchmarks are the standards used in such analysis. They may be prescribed by regulations or guidance from the decision maker. Sometimes, the benchmark can be inferred by the tangible return expected from the problem’s solution. Often, however, Army leaders establish benchmarks themselves. Four common methods for doing this are— 
• Reasoning—the benchmark is based on personal experience and his or her judgment as to what would be good. 
• Historical precedent—the benchmark is based on relevant examples of prior success. 
• Current example—the benchmark is based on an existing condition, which is considered desirable. 
• Averaging—the benchmark is based on the mathematical average of the solutions being considered. Averaging is the least preferred of all methods because it essentially duplicates the process of comparison. 
In practice, the criteria by which choices are made are almost never of equal importance. Because of this it is often convenient to assign weights to each evaluation criterion. Weighting criteria establishes the relative importance of 
each one with respect to the others. Weighting should reflect the judgment of the decision maker or acknowledged experts as closely as possible. For example, a decision maker or expert might judge that two criteria are equal in importance, or that one criterion is slightly favored in importance, or moderately or strongly favored. If these verbal assessments are assigned numerical values, say from 1 to 4 respectively, mathematical techniques could be used to produce meaningful numerical criteria weights. 
Additionally, pair wise comparison is an analytical tool that brings objectivity to the process of assigning criteria weights. In performing a pair wise comparison, the decision maker or expert methodically assesses each evaluation criterion against each of the others and judges its relative importance. A computer equipped with simple software easily performs the mathematical algorithms. 
This process does not in any way diminish the importance of the decision maker's judgment. Rather it enables problem solvers to bring that judgment to bear with greater precision and in problems of greater complexity than might otherwise be possible. Regardless of the method used to assign criteria weights Army leaders state the rationale for each when recommending a solution to the decision maker. 

'''4. Generate Possible Solutions''' 
After gathering information relevant to the problem and developing criteria, Army leaders formulate possible solutions. They carefully consider the guidance provided by the commander or their superiors, and develop several alternatives to solve the problem. Several alternatives should be considered, however too many possible solutions may result in wasted time on similar options. Experience and time available determine how many solutions to consider. Army leaders should consider at least two solutions. Doing this enables the problem solver to use both analysis and comparison as problem solving tools. Developing only one solution to “save time” may produce a faster solution, but risks creating more problems from factors not considered. 
Army leaders follow two steps when developing solutions: 
• Generate options. 
• Summarize the solution in writing, sketches, or both. 
Generate Options 
Creativity by Army leaders is key to developing effective solutions. Often, groups can be far more creative than individuals However, those working on solutions should have some knowledge of or background in the problem area. 
The basic technique for developing new ideas in a group setting is brainstorming. Brainstorming is characterized by unrestrained participation in discussion. Its rules include— 
• State the problem and make sure all participants understand it. 
• Appoint someone to record all ideas. 
• Withhold judgment of ideas. 
• Encourage independent thoughts. 
• Aim for quantity, not quality. 
• “Hitchhike” ideas—combine one’s thoughts with those of others. 
At the conclusion of brainstorming, Army leaders may discard solutions that clearly do not approach the standards described by the screening criteria. If this informal screen leaves only one solution or none, then more options must be generated. 
Summarize The Solution In Writing And Sketches 
After generating options, Army leaders accurately record each possible solution. The solution statement clearly portrays how the action or actions solve the problem. In some circumstances, the solution statement may be a single sentence (for example, “Purchase Model XYZ computers”). In other circumstance the solution statement may require more detail, including sketches or concept diagrams. For example, if the problem is to develop a multipurpose small-arms range, Army leaders may choose to portray each solution with a narrative and a separate sketch or blueprint of each proposed range. 

'''5. Analyze Possible Solutions''' 
Having identified possible solutions, Army leaders analyze each one to determine its merits and drawbacks. If criteria are well defined, to include careful selection of benchmarks, analysis is greatly simplified. 
Army leaders use screening criteria and benchmarks to analyze possible solutions. They apply screening criteria to judge whether a solution meets minimum requirements. For quantitative criteria, they measure, compute, or estimate the raw data values for each solution and each criterion. In analyzing solutions, which involve predicting future events, it is useful to have a process for visualizing those events. Wargaming, models, and simulations are examples of tools that can help problem solvers visualize events and estimate raw data values for use in analysis. Once raw data values have been determined, the Army leader judges them against applicable screening criteria to determine if a possible solution merits further consideration. A solution that fails to meet or exceed the set threshold of one or more screening criteria is screened out. 
After applying the screening criteria to all possible solutions, they use benchmarks to judge them with respect to the desired state. Data values that meet or exceed the benchmark indicate that the possible solution achieves the desired state and thus is &quot;good&quot; with respect to that criterion. Data values that fail to meet the benchmark indicate a solution that is not good in terms of the identified criterion. For each solution, Army leaders list the respects in which analysis reveals it to be good or not good. It is quite possible for every possible solution being considered to fail to reach the benchmark, and so be considered not good in terms of a particular criterion. When this occurs, the Army leader has an obligation to point out to the decision maker that there are no good solutions under consideration in that particular respect. Army leaders are careful not to compare solutions during analysis. To do so undermines the integrity of the process and tempts problem solvers to jump to conclusions. They examine each possible solution independently to identify its strengths and weaknesses. They are also careful not to introduce new criteria. 

'''6. Compare Possible Solutions''' 
During this step, Army leaders compare each solution against the others to determine the optimum solution. Solution comparison identifies which solution best solves the problem based on the evaluation criteria. Army leaders use any comparison technique that helps reach the best recommendation. The most common technique is a decision matrix (see Chapter 3). 
Quantitative techniques (such as decision matrices, select weights, and sensitivity analyses) may be used to support comparisons. However, they are tools to support the analysis and comparison. They are not the analysis and comparison themselves. The quantitative techniques should be summarized clearly so the reader need not refer to an annex for the results. 

'''7. Make and Implement the Decision''' 
After completing their analysis and comparison, Army leaders identify the preferred solution. For simple problems, Army leaders may proceed straight to executing the solution. For more complex problems, a leader plan of action or formal plan may be necessary (see FM 22-100). If a superior assigned the problem, Army leaders prepare the necessary products (verbal, written, or both) needed to present the recommendation to the decision maker. Before presenting findings and a recommendation, Army leaders coordinate their recommendation with those affected by the problem or the solutions. In formal situations, Army leaders present their findings and recommendations to the 
decision maker as staff studies, decision papers, or decision briefings.

A good solution can be lost if the Army leader cannot persuade the audience that it is correct. Every problem requires both a solution and the ability to communicate it. The writing and briefing skills an Army leader possesses may ultimately be as important as good problem solving skills. 

Based on the decision maker’s decision and final guidance, Army leaders refine the solution and prepare necessary implementing instructions. Formal implementing instructions can be issued as a memorandum of instruction, policy letter, or command directive. Once Army leaders have given instructions, Army leaders monitor their implementation and compare results to the criteria of success and the desired end state established in the approved solution. When necessary, they issue additional instructions. 
A feedback system that provides timely and accurate information, periodic review, and the flexibility to adjust must also be built into the implementation plan. Army leaders stay involved, and are careful not to create new problems because of uncoordinated implementation of the solution. 
Army problem solving does not end with identifying the best solution or obtaining approval of a recommendation. It ends when the problem is solved

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 6.3: Constructivism in Reading Instruction'''

===Introduction ===
Cooperative learning in Reading uses sets if instructional methods in which students work in small, mixed-ability learning teams to achieve a common goal. The students in each small reading group are responsible not only for their own learning, but also for helping teammates learn. This positive interdependence is an essential feature for cooperative learning. 
Cooperative learning in Reading offers opportunities for students to discuss, share ideas, organize their thoughts, and work with other students. It lets them try out new ideas in a small group before speaking to the whole class or finishing a written product. Positive effects on academic achievements are a result of cooperative learning.

===Course Description ===
Reading Instructional Process 5-day cycle, 1 book.
The instructional process begins with active instruction. The teacher provides direct instruction with explanation and modeling of learned skills and strategies. Skills include: cause/effect, main idea, supporting details, plot, characterization, problem/solution, sequencing, and theme. The teacher present vocabulary words, models skill or strategy and then reinforces the skill or strategy as they read aloud. During each part of this process, students are actively engaged as they practice vocabulary review with partners and participate in learning the skill and strategy.
Two other components of active instruction is build background of the book and listening comprehension, when the teacher reads aloud. The next part of learning, is the Team work.
Teamwork is the cooperative learning aspect of this 5 day lesson. Teamwork consists of partner reading, team discussions, and class discussion. During this part of the process, students read with partners and then silently, discuss strategy use, and answer Team Talk questions. Partner Reading and Team Talk discussion are student-led activities. During this time, students work with partners and then teams as the teacher monitors and reinforces their discussions. Class discussion is teacher-led and serves as a time to review partner and team discussions at the class level.

===Constructivist Principles and Pedagogy  ===
When students work together with constructivist methods such as cooperative learning, academic work becomes more valued by the student themselves and by their peers. Also:

-Students become engaged in their learning because they have to explain their thinking to others.

-Students are motivated to help one another learn.

-Students take responsibility for their own learning.

-Students can &quot;translate&quot; the teacher's language into their own language for one another.

-Students learn to see situations from another's viewpoint, justify their own viewpoints, and analyze ideas.

-Students have fun learning.

When students have to organize their thoughts to explain ideas to teammates, they engage in cognitive elaboration, or an extension of their thinking, which enhances their own understanding.

===Conclusion ===
When students have to organize their thoughts to explain ideas to teammates, they engage in cognitive elaboration, or an extension of their thinking, which enhances their own comprehension of texts they read. Using constructivist theories in the reading process can help make reading not just an individualized sport, but a team process that students enjoy both individually and together as a group to share their own meaning and thoughts. Reading is fun again!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 6.4: Constructing through construction/ A unit on construction for prekindergarten children''' 

===Introduction ===

Each day the students will experience different activities with shapes.  For example, eating sandwiches cut into triangles, squares, or rectangles, pizza cut into triangles, and crackers for squares or circles. This uit is intended for a classroom of Early Childhood Special Education Students ages 3-5. All students exposed to this unit have an IEP with goals intended to be met by exposure and experience to different media and content. All children have little or no prior knowledge of shape names.

===Course Description ===




Goals:

Our goal is for students to be able to identify the shapes and where they occur in the environment.

Objectives:

After the teacher reads the story The Shapes of Me and Other Stuff by Dr. Seuss and discusses properties of the shapes (square, circle, triangle, and rectangle,) the student will be able to correctly identify each shape. 
After the teacher shows the student the PowerPoint presentation the students will be able to talk about the shapes and name their properties. 
After the teacher describes the sahpes and the students receive their shape books, the student will be able to identify the shape and name the characteristics. 
After watching the iMovie the students will have an understanding of the shapes in their environment and will be able to identify the shapes around them. 
At the end of the shape unit, the student will be able to walk around the classroom and correctly document at least 3 occurrences of each of the four shapes studied. 
Teaching Approach:

We use both directed and constructivist teaching approaches.  We have to use directed teaching approach in helping the student identify and understand the properties of the shapes.  Since they do not have the background knowledge of shapes this is the best approach to use.  Once the students begin to understand the shapes, we will use a constructivist approach to let them explore and discover the wonderful world of shapes.

Pass Skills: Pre-Kindergarten

Oral Language

Standard 1.1:  Listens with interest to stories read aloud.  The student will listen to the story that the teacher reads during the introduction of the unit. This will be done in Objective 1

Standard 1.2:  Understands and follows oral direction.  This will occur as the students receive directions from the teacher each and every day. This will be done in Objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Standard 3.1: Demonstrates increasing awareness of concepts of print. This will occur when the student reads their Shape Book on Day 2. Objective 3

Standard 3.2: Identifies the front cover and back cover of a book. This will occur when the student reads their Shape Book on Day 2. Objective 3 


Math

Standard 1.1:  Sorts and groups objects into a set and explains verbally what the objects have in common (e.g., color, size, shape).  This will occur when the teacher asks the students to identify the shapes. This will be done in Objective 3

Standard 3.1:  Begins to recognize, describe, compare, and name common shapes (e.g.,circle, square, rectangle).  This will happen when the student points to the shapes and identifies them for the teacher. This will be done in Objective 3

Assessment:

The students will walk around the classroom and tally every time they see a square, circle, triangle, or rectangle.

===Constructivist Principles and Pedagogy  ===

 The following is research project done in Tennessee where the school district implemented Constructivism into their Early Childhood Program. It proved to be extremely successful, but they had to overcome many obstacels to become accepted by the district. Similar stories are present in SLPS as we try to implement Developmentally Appropriate Practice into our pre-K classrooms and receive district approval.
Quality early childhood programs are well accepted, however, implementation of early childhood practices in an elementary program generally are complicated. The newness of the programs using constructivism brings with it major obstacles that are usually successfully overcome. The three most significant were community acceptance, staffing, and curriculum restructuring.
As in most new programs, the fear of the unknown must be overcome. Some parents had previously been aware of quality early childhood programs, however, others needed to be educated. This was accomplished by conducting the previously described home visits during the planning phase. Once the school opened it became evident that additional public relations were needed. Written information was prepared in the form of a newspaper informing parents and the community about the many components of the multiage, developmentally appropriate program. Newsletters describing learning activities unique to each learning center complemented this newspaper. Inviting the parents and community to participate in forums designed to further educate them, including one conducted by a nationally recognized non-graded, multiage specialist proved beneficial. These initial endeavors encouraged parents to become actively involved in the daily learning aspects of the program. The goal, as it was for the schools of Reggio Emilia (Edwards, Gandini, &amp; Forman, 1988), was to create an environment for children, teachers and parents.

===Conclusion ===
Proof of overcoming these obstacles was evidenced in various ways. A main indicator of success was the strong student achievement scores of 2nd– 5th grade students. The students have continuously scored above district and state averages, thus supporting the curriculum design. Anecdotal data reported by middle school teachers and administrators found fifth grade students who have moved on to the designated middle school make a smooth transition and stand out as a group of strong academic achievers. In addition, the overall success of the program has been confirmed by outside evaluations including “The National Blue Ribbon Schools” and “Southern Association of Colleges and Schools”. The nationally recognized non-graded, multiage specialist evaluated the design of the program positively. His visit confirmed for many that the multiage configuration was developmentally appropriate for the students.
School climate was evaluated formally in 1997 by consultants from the University of Tennessee. The program was rated higher by the parents than any other school that had previously been surveyed. A parent satisfaction survey in 1999 supported the 1997 evaluation by revealing an excellent rating for a consistently positive environment in which children learn. Parent involvement in the school through active participation in the learning process and evaluation of the program increases collaboration and the sense of community.
The school received the “2001 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award”. The site visit report concluded with the statement, “This school now enjoys a strong reputation for excellence and should be considered a demonstration school for all districts seeking to build a ‘better way.’” Maximizing early childhood practices by incorporating constructivist principles in this elementary school, enabled administrators, faculty, staff, children, and parents to engage in the collaborative process of creating an environment and program in which all children can learn!

===Introduction ===

Consideration of how to teach students is to acknowledge that each student does not learn in the same way. It is common practice for the teacher to choose one style of teaching (direct instruction, collaborative learning, inquiry learning, etc.), for the students they teach. Unfortunately, this will not maximize their learning potential. Realistically, it is not possible for the teacher to reach every student on the same level during one lesson, by implementing a variety of learning styles throughout the course it allows all the students will have the chance to learn in at least one way that matches their learning style.
Most of the materials used to educate students at grade levels beyond primary school are largely text and lecture based. These materials have many significant limitations. While reading is a very important learning mode, not all students learn effectively from reading. Some students respond better to visual and audio stimuli of lecture but often get lost in the material or lose interest in the presentation. In this type of a learning environment, students have limited opportunity to ask questions or may be uncomfortable asking a question in front of the class. It is well known that many questions go unasked.
For example, in most literature classes students read novels, poems and short stories form which they are told to give interpretation and insight. Most teachers have presupposed conclusions and interpretations in mind before hearing what the students have to say. Julie Mester writes in her article &quot;Creatively Constructing a Community of Learners&quot;,unless children are actively and socially constructing learning themselves, they are merely recipients of a teacher's perceptions of knowledge that she or he deems is relevant for children to learn. Thus, the hierarchy of teacher over students is maintained, where the former is the all-knowing person of authority, and the expectation for the latter is to be passively receptive. These individuals may all work together in the same classroom on curricular standards and outcomes, but they do not become an intrinsically motivated
community of learners.&quot; If the student does not respond with the answer already learned by the teacher they are usually dismissed without discussion or probing into why the student gave the answer they did. Culture, environment and experience have bearing on the way students respond to different writings.

===Course Description ===
The aim of this course is to introduce students to a variety of literary works. Students are reading less mainly due to the lack of understanding of the works and the importance and effect they can have on their lives. This course will allow students to read and reflect on different works of literature within their own realms of thinking and interpretation. Students will divide into groups and read specified text. They will then write their thoughts, ideas and conclusions on paper. They will then elect a representative to present the groups findings to the class. The other groups will then offer thoughts on the text and generate more discussion.
This course will be geared towards middle school students who are developing critical thinking, problem solving and writing skills.
Students will use authentic (real-world) learning and assessments to interpret the works studied.
Students will relate their findings to their own life and how it does or does not affect them. They will also discuss similar issues they may have experienced and how they can be handled in the future. Students will learn to interact with each other and gain better social and communication skills.

===Constructivist Principles and Pedagogy  ===
Students will work in groups rather than individually. Learning activities will involve projects that require reading different types of literary works to learn how characters deal with various experiences and then develop solutions. The aim is to introduce students to various views and situations that require critical thinking to solve. Interactive literary problems will be discussed and examined rather than instructional sequences that require learning certain content skills that are irrelevant and ineffectual for students.
As Nisbet (cited in Coles &amp; Robinson 1991, p. 27) states &quot;the concept of teaching thinking is not new. The same idea is stressed by Swartz &amp;Perkins (1990, p.5) 'it is important to remember that concern with developing students' thinking, far from being a fad, is one of the most persistent and ambitious aspirations of education, with a tradition stretching back at least to Plato'. Plato was famous for teaching thinking through the Socratic dialogue and traditional logic.&quot; This the aim of this course to teach thinking through the use of literature and writing.

===Conclusion ===
The need to implement new strategies that will engage students in reading is of great need in our schools today. The dropout rate and illiteracy that is so prominent among students is only increasing. It is clear that changes need to be made in curriculum if we are to change the trend.This is especially true for disadvantaged and impoverished students who tend to suffer most from the current system strategies. Allington and Walmsley (2007) stated &quot;children placed in low-achievement groups are “far more likely to (1) leave school before graduating, (2) fail a grade, (3) be placed in special education, (4) become a teenage parent, (5) commit a juvenile criminal offense, and (6) remain less than fully literate” (p.2). Researchers and educators must consider the complexity of the developmental issues surrounding adolescents who struggle with reading.&quot; It is a necessity that schools develop strategies and curriculum that addresses the special needs of these students.

Collaborative learning: the grouping and pairing of learners for the purpose of achieving a learning goal, has been widely researched and advocated - the term &quot;collaborative learning&quot; refers to an instruction method in which learners at various performance levels work together in small groups toward a common goal. The learners are responsible for one another's learning as well as their own. Thus, the success of one learner helps other students to be successful.

Direct instruction: is a method that is specifically designed to enhance academic learning time. Direct instruction does not assume that students will develop insights on their own. Instead, direct instruction takes learners through the steps of learning systematically, helping them see both the purpose and the result of each step. When teachers explain exactly what students are expected to learn, and demonstrate the steps needed to accomplish a particular academic task, students are likely to use their time more effectively and to learn more.

Inquiry-based learning: a range of philosophical, curricular and pedagogical approaches to teaching. Its core premises include the requirement that learning should be based around student's questions. Pedagogy and curriculum requires students to work together to solve problems rather than receiving direct instructions on what to do from the teacher. The teacher's job in an inquiry learning environment is therefore not to provide knowledge, but instead to help students along the process of discovering knowledge themselves. In this form of instruction, it is proposed that teachers should be viewed as facilitators of learning rather than vessels of knowledge. Even though this form of instruction has gained great popularity of the past decade, there is plenty of debate about the effectiveness of this form of instruction.

== The problem: How to convert a capacitor into an inductor ==

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_1_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 1: How do we convert a capacitor into an inductor?]]

Inductors are inconvenient: they are bulky, heavy and expensive; they cannot be miniaturized. So, it would be extremely useful if we manage to replace them by capacitors. The question is &quot;How do we convert a capacitor into an inductor?&quot; We begin looking for an idea how to convert the capacitor into an  inductor. ''Krasimir: &quot;We have to compare the properties of the two elements, to see what  capacitor and inductor are.'' Well, it seems we can't simulate all the inductor's properties; we will manage to simulate only particular properties.

What are the basic properties of these time-dependant elements? ''Krasimir: &quot;They are frequency dependent elements.'' You are right. But for our purposes (intuitive understanding) it is more convenient to investigate how they behave through time. Frequency dependent reactance (impedance), averaged and rms quantities are more abstract; they hide the circuit operation. Instantaneous voltages and currents are more real. At given moment (if we &quot;snap&quot; the circuit operation), we have a pair of two quantities: current flowing through the capacitor and voltage drop across it. The real things that we see at given moment are only the instantaneous voltage and current; and they are real, actual. Impedance is some derivative, more abstract quantity, based on the primary voltage and current quantity. Impedance is not a ratio of the instantaneous voltage and current quantity since they are phase shifted. That is why complex numbers are used to analyze AC circuits.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== How do capacitor and inductor in RC/RL circuit behave through time? ==

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_2_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig. 2: How do capacitor and inductor behave through time?]]

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_4_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|]]

What is the main property of the two elements? First at all, they can ''accumulate'', store energy. But we will not simulate this property in these circuits; storing is not our aim now. If you want, we may try to create such circuits but I am not sure if it is possible... Let's continue looking for another property... ''Krasimir: &quot;The one element creates voltage when we try to pass a current through it while the other does the opposite...&quot;'' So, we talk about the behavior of the two elements through time. We begin investigating how the voltages across them and the currents through them change through time.

What do we investigate - the particular elements or composed RC and RL circuits? If we get the particular elements, we can drive them by a voltage source or by a current source. Well, let's connect a voltage source to a capacitor. What will happens? It is quite incorrect connection, isn't it? How does the voltage change through time? If the voltage source is a power enough (an &quot;ideal&quot; voltage source), it will force the capacitor to take the voltage. And what about the current? It should be infinite in the beginning and then to decrease gradually... But there is some confusing in these &quot;ideal&quot; things... So, let's make them more real; for example, we may assume the input voltage source is real and it has some internal resistance or we may just connect a resistor R in series with the capacitor C. In other words, let's build and investigate a classic RC and RL circuit and investigate the particular element in this circuit. Then, let's apply the input voltage across the whole RC (RL) circuit and imagine what happens with the capacitor and the inductor. What is the voltage across the capacitor and the inductor? What is the current flowing through them? Let's present the voltages across the two elements constituting the circuits by bars and the currents by loops. There are two voltage drops in every circuit (across the accumulating element and across the resistor) and they are complementary; of course, the current flowing through the two elements is the same. Thinking in this way, we probably may find the solution...

How does the inductor behaves when the input voltage increases sharply? It produces an equal opposing voltage at the first moment. So, the input voltage source tries to change the current but the inductor impedes this attempt by subtracting an equal voltage from the input voltage. As a result, no current flows in the beginning; then, it begins increasing gradually. The current and the voltage drop across the resistor increase (exponentially) while the voltage across the inductor decreases. The inductor opposes the input voltage at the beginning and does not oppose it at the end (it is just a piece of wire then). There is no voltage across the inductor at the end; there is only (maximum) current according to Ohm's law. This action resembles the &quot;bootstrapping&quot; circuit trick. Well, let's we (Krasimir and I) illustrate this clever trick by a &quot;lever&quot; analogy - I raise my pointer from the one end; at the same time, Krasimir raises the other end.

The capacitor has a &quot;reverse&quot; behavior. In the beginning, the voltage across the capacitor is zero and it does not impede the input voltage source to produce current. As a result, the current is maximum at the beginning and then it begins decreasing. So, if we compare the two circuits, we see that in the RC and RL circuits the processes are reversed. Let's superimpose the voltages across an inductor and a capacitor and write the expressions showing how these voltages change through time (see the top of the picture on the right)...
 
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== How do capacitor and resistor of RC circuit behave through time? ==

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_3_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|]]

So far we have been comparing an RC with an RL circuit. Maybe, we have to pay attention to the particular RC circuit and to compare the voltage drops across the particular elements C and R. If we draw them (on the bottom of the figure above), we will see that the two curves are vertical mirrored; the voltage drop across the resistor is the complement of the voltage across the capacitor and v.v. At every moment, the sum of the instanteneous voltages is constant and it is equivalent to the input voltage; the two curves are complement. What else do we see looking at the picture? ''Krasimir: &quot;The voltage drop across the resistor represents the current through the capacitor...and the voltage across the dual inductor...&quot;'' Here is the clever idea - the resistor in each of these circuits (R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) behaves as the dual element (L/C) from the other circuit (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;). Let's repeat: the resistor of an R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; circuit behaves as the inductor of an R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; circuit. Then, what is the idea? It is so simple and powerful:

'''''As the resistor of an R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; circuit behaves as the inductor of an R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; circuit then let's use this resistor as a virtual inductor.'''''

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;/&gt;

== Trying to simulate directly an inductor by a resistor ==

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_5_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|]]

This is our inductor, the resistor... ''Krasimir: &quot;We have to use also the voltage across the capacitor to create a current flowing through the virtual inductor...&quot;'' Yes, you are right. To simulate an inductor, we have to make a two-terminal element have the same current and the same voltage as the ones of the resistor. Figuratively speaking, we can compose the inductor's behavior by its ingredients - the instantaneous voltage and current. As I can see, your idea is to get the resistor from an RC circuit and to use it as a virtual inductor. But how to realize this clever idea? Let's begin thinking...

What do we want? We have some external circuit; let's draw it in a blue color. It contains some input source (sinusoidal, square, etc.) with some internal resistance. And we want to supply an inductor by this input source. But, for some reasons, we do not have an inductor or it is inconvenient. So, we want to connect a simulated (virtual) inductor at this place; we want to connect here our element that has the same behavior. But how to connect it? It is a two-terminal element. Can we place it directly at this place? Will it has an inductor behavior? Obviously, we can't because we (the input circuit) will destroj the RC circuit operation... What do we do then?

== Simulating an inductor by &quot;copying&quot; the resistor's voltage ==

[[Image:Virtual_inductor_6_1000.jpg|right|thumb|400px|]]

Maybe, we have not to place the &quot;resistive inductor&quot; directly to this place but to &quot;copy&quot; its behavior. This is the next powerful idea:

'''''Since we can't connect the virtual element directly into the circuit, we may &quot;copy&quot; it by another element.'''''

How do we &quot;copy&quot; quantities in this world? Of course, by active followers (the most elementary negative feedback systems). Let's realize this idea. The problem was to &quot;copy&quot; a capacitor with the purpose to create an inductor. So, the voltage across the resistor has to be copied; it has to be the voltage across our inductor. We have to connect a follower (an amplifier with gain = +1). But let's first do it simpler. Imagine we do not know what a follower is and we have to make it ourselves. For this purpose, we place a varying voltage source and adjust its voltage equal to the input one; thus a voltage equal to V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; appears on the right. This source acts as a &quot;following&quot; voltage source that changes its voltage in the same manner as the voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; changes through time. But V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.R.

Actually we have created the voltage across our virtual inductor - the voltage of the following voltage source will behave in the same manner as the voltage across an actual inductor. 122 min

== Wikipedia discussions ==

(a copy from the Wikipedia [[w:Talk:Gyrator|talk page about gyrator circuits]])

=== Discussion about energy storage in Gyrator circuit===

I would like to discuss thoroughly the basic idea, the operation and the properties of this odd circuit. I suggest using the [http://sound.westhost.com/dwopa.htm#inductor Elliot's example ] as a base.

==== The basic idea ====

We may consider this circuit as consisting of two parts (branches) - an input part (the RC circuit) and an output part (the op-amp and the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We may think of the input part as of a &quot;modeling&quot;, &quot;shaping&quot; part that drives the power output part.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building a CR differentiator.''' The current flowing through a capacitor is proportional to the derivative of the voltage applied across it; so, a capacitor acts as a simple differentiator with voltage input and current output. But we need a voltage output; for this purpose, we connect in series a resistor acting as a current-to-voltage converter and get the voltage across the resistor as an output.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building an L differentiator.''' Dually, the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the derivative of the current flowing through it; so, an inductor acts as a simple differentiator with current input and voltage output. In this way, the voltage across the resistor R of the input CR circuit behaves as the voltage across the inductor; so, we may use this voltage to simulate an inductor. For this purpose, we buffer the weak &quot;shaping&quot; input part by an op-amp follower and apply this voltage back to the input. To limit the maximum current through the &quot;inductor&quot; (the op-amp), we connect a low resistor (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;); it represents the inductor's internal resistance... [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 19:04, 3 April 2010 (UTC)

==== The operation ====

In the classical voltage supplied RL circuit (voltage source --&gt; resistor --&gt; inductor), the inductor opposes to the input voltage variations by producing a contrary voltage that substracts from the input one (figuratively speaking, when the input source &quot;moves&quot; the left end of the resistor, the inductor &quot;moves&quot; the right end in the same direction). In our circuit, the op-amp does the same by &quot;moving&quot; the right end of the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. This &quot;bootstrapping&quot; increases many times the resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; when the input voltage changes; the combination of the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and the op-amp acts as a time-dependent dynamic resistor. Let's consider the typical moments of the transition process.

Imagine the input voltage (the voltage at the left side of the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) changes suddenly from zero to V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. The capacitor transfers immediately this change and the voltage drop across R becomes V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; as well. The op-amp follower &quot;copies&quot; this voltage drop and applies the same voltage at the right side of the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, no currents flows through the resistor and the circuit shows infinite large input resistance (impedance). In the course of time, the capacitor charges, the current passing through it decreases and the voltage drop across the resistor R decreases as well. The op-amp follower &quot;lowers&quot; continously the right end of R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and finally reaches the ground. At the end of the transition, the current is maximum - I&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 21:14, 3 April 2010 (UTC)

==== Energy considerations ====

===== The output part dominates over the input one =====

Well, let's continue... The two parts (branches) of the circuit are connected in parallel. The output part (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + op-amp) is the very &quot;inductor&quot; and it has to dominate over the input part (the input part has only &quot;shaping&quot; properties and it has not to disturb the &quot;inductor&quot;). In addition, the capacitor has to have as much as possible small capacitance (dimensions). So, the resistor R has very high resistance. In the [http://sound.westhost.com/dwopa.htm#inductor Elliot's example], C = 100 nF and R = 100 kΩ whlie R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is only 100 Ω. The obtained &quot;inductance&quot; is as many as 1 H.

===== Does the circuit store energy? =====

Lets' make a final conclusion. The capacitor is the only element that can store energy in this circuit. But it has very, very small capacitance and the resistor R has extremely high resistance; so, the stored energy is negligible. I give a chance to the formal thinking Wikipedians to calculate and compare the energy stored in the capacitor C = 100 nF through a resistor R = 100 kΩ with the energy stored in the equivalent real inductor with inductance 1 H through a resistance R = 100 Ω. So, the final conclusioh is:

'''''The simulated inductor has the same behavior through time as the real inductor but it does not have the same accumulating properties. The simulated inductor does not store energy.''''' [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 22:47, 3 April 2010 (UTC)

The small energy accumulated in the capacitor is even undesired in this &quot;inductive&quot; circuit as it behaves in the opposite (&quot;capacitive&quot;) manner - when the input voltage decreases, the capacitor passes a reverse current through the input source. If we want to eliminate completely this influence, we may connect another op-amp follower before the RC circuit. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 10:47, 4 April 2010 (UTC)

: The circuit has no need of storing energy - it is an active circuit - it just uses the capacitor as a impedance reference. The energy comes from the power supply of the op-amp or whatever other active element is used. --[[User:Ozhiker|Ozhiker]] ([[User talk:Ozhiker|talk]]) 00:01, 4 April 2010 (UTC)

:The capacitor is not part of the gyrator; it is a termination placed on port 2. An ideal gyrator neither stores energy nor requires a power-supply - though this isn't obvious from the article. --[[User:Catslash|catslash]] ([[User talk:Catslash|talk]]) 01:42, 4 April 2010 (UTC)

::As I have stated above and several times earlier it is incorrect to say that a gyrator circuit that has a reactance does not store energy.   This does not imply that you would use it to replace an inductor in a power switching circuit, like a switching regulator, etc.  That would be impractical.   Most people reading this article would assume this and anyway it is mentioned near the end of the article.  So the article does not need to be further adumbrated upon to the extent that is now present in other articles.  [[User:Zen-in|Zen-in]] ([[User talk:Zen-in|talk]]) 04:49, 5 April 2010 (UTC)

:: I think most of you are confusing the inductor example with the strict definition of a gyrator. A gyrator is an impedance transformer; it converts the ''i''&amp;ndash;''v'' characteristics at one port to different ''i''&amp;ndash;''v'' characteristics at a different port. It is true that in the inductor example, the capacitor &quot;stores&quot; energy. However, if you replaced a DC source at the input of the inductor circuit by a ground short, the energy that would be dissipated across ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; would be different than the energy stored in the capacitor. Thus, some of the energy would come from the amplifier's power supply (which is not shown in the diagram). In fact, in that particular example, all of the energy dissipated across ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; would come from the power supply; the capacitor's energy would be dissipated across ''R''. So it really sounds like the page should reflect that:
::* A gyrator is an impedance transformer; it need not store any energy. It just needs to translate one ''i''&amp;ndash;''v'' relationship to another. In the case of generating a purely resistive impedance, there would be no storage elements to find anywhere near the circuit.
::* The particular inductor example given, which is an active design, the ''i''&amp;ndash;''v'' characteristics of a capacitor are being transformed into the ''i''&amp;ndash;''v'' characteristics of an inductor. Hence, in the process of impedance transformation, some energy is being stored in the capacitor. However, this &quot;storage&quot; has nothing to do with the gyrator action.
::It would be incorrect to say that a transformer dissipated energy just because a generator attached to the primary side of the transformer faces a real load when a resistor is placed on the secondary side of the transformer. Hence, it is also inappropriate to say that a gyrator IN GENERAL must store energy. Having said that, the EXAMPLE CIRCUIT itself does have storage elements, but that's tangential to the topc of gyration. &amp;mdash;'''[[User:TedPavlic|TedPavlic]]''' ([[User_talk:TedPavlic|talk]]/[[Special:Contributions/TedPavlic|contrib]]/[[Special:EmailUser/TedPavlic|@]]) 17:35, 5 April 2010 (UTC)

=== Grounding ===

The circuit happens to be drawn connected to ground.  There is no such restriction as far as I'm aware; why couldn't we float the gyrator?

:Of course, we may float the circuit but together with the power supply. See for example, how I have floated a [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Revealing the Mystery of Negative Impedance#The op-amp implementation|VINIC]] in the story about negative resistance (BTW, I created it a year ago after Zen-in mutilated the [[Negative resistance|Wikipedia page]] about negative resistance).

=== R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; considerations ===

''&quot;There are contradictory requirements to the value of R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. From one side, it has to have some acceptable resistance to limit the maximum current through the simulated inductor (the op-amp output) and to obtain large inductance. From the other side, it has to have as much as possible low resistance to obtain high Q factor. Note if R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, the circuit will stop working at all: the op-amp output voltage will be zero, the op-amp will keep (almost) zero voltage across the capacitor and no current will flow through it.&quot;''

:Won't the Q factor be constant?  It's going to be (from [[Inductor#Q factor]]):
::&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{\omega R_L R C}{R_L} = \omega R C&lt;/math&gt;

::I'm not familiar enough with Q factor topic and I need time to realize it. But really it is very important to clarify the role of R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; as someone may try to make an &quot;ideal inductor&quot; (R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0). The results will be unfortunate - zero inductance (as the expression L = R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;RC says) and what is more important, the circuit will not operate at all (here I suppose an ideal op-amp).

=== Demystifying gyrator circuits ===

I start this discussion here to demystify, once and for all, the basic idea, implementation and operation of these exotic circuits. I will use the text below as a base (I wrote it two days ago):

''&quot;Gyrator circuits imitate real elements by dynamic voltage sources with swapped ''instantaneous values'' of the voltage and the current (the voltage across the new virtual element is proportional to the current flowing through the initial real element and the current flowing through the virtual element is proportional to the voltage across the real element). These voltage sources (gyrator's outputs) are connected in opposite direction to the exciting input sources as they mimic voltage drops (in contrast, negative impedance converters with voltage inversion produce voltages). So gyrators are not only positive impedance inverters; they can &quot;invert&quot; in this manner any elements (linear, non-linear, time-dependent, sources, etc.) connected as a load...&quot;'' [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 18:20, 11 April 2010 (UTC)

==== Impedance is a misleading concept here ====

The lede says ''&quot;the gyrator is a positive impedance inverter&quot;'' and this is true, especially in the case of a simulated inductor that converts a capacitive reactance into an inductive reactance (a capacitor into an inductor). But the problem is that ''[[Electrical impedance|impedance]]'' &quot;impedes&quot; the understanding gyrator circuits. What is the problem?

The problem is that impedance Z = V/I is defined as a ratio of the rms (&quot;effective&quot;) values of the voltage and the current (see [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imped.html#c1 hyperphysics]). Being some kind of averaged quantity, impedance hides the concepts behind all these odd circuits - gyrators, multipliers, negative impedance converters, etc. Impedance viewpoint does not allow us to realize what all these circuits actually do. As an example, you may see the result of this misleading &quot;impedance approach&quot; in the area of negative impedance if you browse these [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Negative_resistance/Archive_4 archived talk]. Then I ([[User:Circuit-fantasist|Circuit-fantasist]]) wasted plenty of time to show how simple the idea behind negative impedance is but I didn't manage. Now I realize why. The reason of this failure to understand one another was simple - I was thinking in terms of instantaneous values while my opponents were thinking in terms of averaged (rms) values.

The article says ''what'' a gyrator does (''inverts an impedance'') but it does not say ''how'' it does this magic. But the idea behind this mystic circuit is extremely simple; we will grasp it immediately if only we forget the misleading concept ''impedance'' and begin thinking in terms of instantaneous ''voltage'' and ''current'' quantities! This is the remedy - to imagine what the particular voltage and current are at each moment, to think &quot;instantaneously&quot;:)

==== What is actually a gyrator?  ====

To understand what the particular gyrator is, it is extremely useful to understand what all related exotic circuits are. [[Capacitance multiplier|Multipliers]], gyrators and [[negative impedance converter]]s are used to create virtual elements that are accordingly multiplied, inverse (dual) and negative copies of actual elements. These virtual elements only mimic the original elements; they have not the same nature as the initial elements since they are implemented as dynamic voltage sources. Actual capacitors and inductors create [[voltage drop]]s: a capacitor impedes the input voltage source by subtracting a voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; from the input voltage; an inductor impedes the input voltage source by creating a back emf V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and subtracting it from the input voltage. So, to simulate these behaviors, the &quot;multiplied&quot; and inverse virtual elements (voltage sources) are connected in opposite direction to the exciting input source to subtract a voltage drop while negative impedance converters (VNIC) are connected in the same direction to the input source to add a [[voltage]].

==== What does a gyrator actually do?  ====

A gyrator does only a simple donkeywork: it continuously &quot;observes&quot; the instantaneous values of the voltage across and the current through the original element (model, sample, pattern, load here...) and makes its own instantaneous output voltage proportional to the initial current and its current proportional to the initial voltage. Thus, the combination of the gyrator and the connected actual load acts as a dual 2-terminal virtual element. Shortly, ''a gyrator is a dynamic voltage source with swapped initial voltage and current''.

You can guess that a multiplier does the same but without inversion - e.g., it makes its own output voltage equal to the initial voltage and its current proportional to the initial current. For example, a capacitance multiplier emulates an actual capacitor with an opposing dynamic voltage source (see [http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-29.pdf AN-29, page 11, fig. 19] and try to guess how this clever circuit operates). Finally, you will probably realize that a negative impedance converter with voltage inversion (VNIC) is a dynamic voltage source emulating a negative resistor by adding a voltage that is equal to the voltage drop across the initial element (see this [http://nonlinear.eecs.berkeley.edu/chaos/introduction_nonlinear_circuit_analysis.pdf Chua's material] and try to see the clever idea behind this circuit). But let's return to the gyrator.

Imagine how simple it is! The gyrator does not &quot;know&quot; what it converts; it is not &quot;interested&quot; in what an initial element is connected. The only thing that a gyrator can do is to observe the input (load's) voltage and current to produce an output (simulated) current and voltage.

Following this simple procedure, a gyrator can &quot;invert&quot; not only classical impedance elements (capacitors and inductors); it can invert elements of all kinds including non-linear ones. For example, a gyrator can convert a diode or a varistor (voltage-stable elements) into a transistor or a [http://iopscience.iop.org/0959-5309/55/5/313;jsessionid=304000D8ACFD97CE16384B96C9578972.c1 baretter] (current-stable elements) and v.v. I suppose a gyrator can invert a negative impedance (negative capacitor into a negative inductance) and this extremely odd combination will have some fancy name (e.g., &quot;injectoplactor&quot;:) It turns out a gyrator can convert almost everything. If even we put some wikipedian (e.g., [[User:Zen-in|Zen-in]]/[[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]]) at the place of the load (this is only a joke!), the gyrator will convert the poor wikipedian into his/her inversion ([[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]]/[[User:Zen-in|Zen-in]]). It is wonderful, isn't it?

==== How does a gyrator do this magic? ====  
    
[[Image:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|left|thumb|250px|An example of a gyrator simulating inductance, with an approximate equivalent circuit below. The two ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' have similar values in typical applications.]][[Image:Simulted_inductor_basic_idea_1000.jpg|right|thumb|360px|An equivalent circuit of the simulated inductor is presented here as a balanced bridge. The red bars and green loops represent the instantaneous voltages and currents.]]

The circuit works by inverting and multiplying the effect of the capacitor in an [[RC circuit#Differentiator|RC differentiating circuit]] where the voltage across the resistor behaves through time in the same manner as the voltage across an inductor. The idea of the circuit is revealed in the figure on the right by an equivalent balanced bridge circuit. It consists of two legs connected in parallel: the left leg is the &quot;shaping&quot; RC circuit; the right leg is the virtual inductor V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; with its internal resistance R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

In balanced bridge circuits the voltages across the opposite elements are equal. Here, the varying voltage source Vs (the op-amp follower) balances the bridge by &quot;copying&quot; the voltage drop across the resistor R that is proportional to the current flowing through the capacitor. As a result, the voltage drop across the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the voltage across the capacitor; so, the current flowing through R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the voltage across the capacitor. The desired effect is an impedance of the form of an ideal inductor ''L'' with a series resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In the case of an [[LTI system theory|LTI]] component (resistor, capacitor, inductor), the effect of this is to invert the impedance.  Therefore, the article should explain the gyrator in terms of I-V relationships, not impedances (which are a specific case).''&quot;  Is that what you mean?

::Yes! Yes! Yes! This is exactly what I want to say! Impedance is not a suitable concept here as it is a some kind of &quot;derivative&quot; quantity based on the particular voltage and current quantities; impedance is a more general, global quantity that &quot;combines&quot; the two particular quantities into one. In the case of linear elements, it works fine, but it can't represent the circuit operation in the case of non-linear loads. But, what is worse, impedance can't explain what a gyrator does even in the case of these linear loads since it is not something real; it is some &quot;fiction&quot;. Only the instantaneous voltages and currents are real quantities in this (and in any) circuit; at each moment, there are only a pair of ''voltage drop'' across and a ''current'' through the load and a corresponding pair of ''voltage'' across and a ''current'' through the simulating virtual element. The gyrator does not know what it actually converts - impedance or &quot;no impedance&quot;; it acts as a functional converter that measures &quot;blindly&quot; the instant input voltage and current and converts them immediately into output current and voltage. Thus, if the input element (load) has an impedance, the output virtual element will have an impedance as well and v.v. If we want to see impedance here, we will see; if we do not want, we can think in terms of special voltage and current quantities.

::::A few days ago, I managed to grasp &quot;how a gyrator does this magic&quot; and started the section above. I found a powerful viewpoint at these multiplying, gyrator and NIC circuits and prepared informative pictures revealing the clever trick. This morning, in the beginning of the lecture, I posed the problem to my students. I drew the circuit on the whiteboard and asked them to reveal the basic idea behind it (I have been using this didactic approach since 80's). One of them (the best student) immediately began thinking and proposing ideas; as a result, I didn't manage to take a cup of coffee during the break:) I hope some of them will see the brilliant idea till the next week when we will investigate these circuits in the laboratory by [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Walking along the Resistive Film#How to visualize the voltage diagram on the screen|Microlab]]. [[User:Circuit dreamer|Circuit dreamer]] ([[User talk:Circuit dreamer|talk]]) 12:56, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

:::: [[Impedance (electrical)|Impedance]] implies [[LTI system theory|LTI]], which in turn implies the load has a defined [[transfer function]].  A diode (for instance) doesn't have a defined transfer function, and hence doesn't have a meaningful impedance (at least far as I understand it; it certainly can't be expressed in terms of a ratio of phasors).  However, the gyrator still inverts its I-V characteristic.  So I think Circuit-Dreamer's point stands.

...However, what I am saying is that Circuit-Dreamer does have a valid point.  [[User:Oli Filth|Oli Filth]]&lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Oli Filth|talk]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Oli_Filth|contribs]])&lt;/sup&gt; 22:36, 13 April 2010 (UTC)

:::::::: There is no transfer function of a diode; all there is are transfer functions of linearised (i.e. approximated) small-signal models, which only hold over small regions of operation around the bias point.  Whilst this may be what Spice uses to perform AC analysis, this is ''not'' what I'm referring to (and presumably, not what C-D is referring to).  The small-signal approximation is a consequence of the large-signal behaviour, which is what (IMHO) is the crux here.

:::::::: I'm not suggesting that we change an awful lot, merely that we start in terms of I-V relationships, rather than impedances (if sources permit us).  I may attempt this tomorrow.

:Thank you for the elucidations. Definitely, talk pages become more interesting than the main pages and I am apprehensive that our readers will begin reading talks instead articles:) Well, let's discuss the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gyrator&amp;oldid=357087255#Operation section] about circuit operation that you have reverted.

:'''Bridge viewpoint.''' Of course, we may consider the circuit without seeing any bridge idea behind it; we may see only the &quot;trees&quot; (the particular C, R, R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, op-amp, power supply) without seeing the &quot;forest&quot; (the bridge topology). But the bridge configuration is something familiar to nearly everyone; it is a ''concept'' helping understanding. We, human beings, understand new things (systems) by discerning old well-known patterns (subsystems, components, ideas, tricks, etc.) inside them..., by making associations based on what is familiar... Balanced bridge is another powerful concept whose amazing feature is the equality (horizontal symmetry) of the voltage drops. I realized it as far back as 1968 when I, 14-year-old boy, made a simple servo system by two potentiometers, a polarized relay with neutral position, split supply and a motor with reduction gear...

[[Image:Simulted_inductor_basic_idea_1000.jpg|thumb|right|320px|The two pairs C,R and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,Vs constitute a balanced bridge]]

:Wikipedia says ''&quot;...[[bridge circuit]] is a type of electrical circuit in which two circuit branches (usually in parallel with each other) are &quot;bridged&quot; by a third branch connected between the first two branches at some intermediate point along them. ..&quot;'' Look at the picture now: R and C constitute the left branch; Vs and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; constitute the right branch. The two branches are connected in parallel and they are &quot;bridged&quot; by the op-amp differential input. The bridge is balanced since the op-amp follower keeps Vs = V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;... plain, clear and simple... Tell me now, should we look for &quot;a reference that supports the idea that this is a bridge topology&quot;? BTW, an [[Negative impedance converter|INIC]] (drawn in such a symmetrical form), is another example of balanced bridge circuit where the op-amp changes the supply voltage to balance the bridge.

:'''Diagram.''' It is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the circuit operation where the instantaneous voltages across the elements and the currents flowing through them are shown by proportional voltage bars and current loops. This presentation allows readers to grasp the idea (equal voltages across the opposite elements) only by a glance at the picture. It is a colorful just because our world is colorful. Is your monitor black &amp; white? Do you watch black &amp; white TV? Then, why do you make readers look at this colorful world through black glasses? And what is the problem with this kind of hand-written diagrams in a [[Forrest Mims#Author|Forrest Mims style]]? If you do not like it, feel free to redraw the pictures by an editor.

:'''Positive feedback.''' There is no feedback in this circuit only if it is driven by a perfect voltage source (with zero internal resistance). Normally, in the case of a real voltage source (with some internal resistance), there is a positive feedback with a closed-loop gain 0 &lt; A.β = 1.β &lt; 1. So, this feedback is &quot;under control&quot; (the Armstrong's regenerative receiver idea). In comparison, in Schmitt triggers, the positive feedback is out of control as A.β &gt;&gt; 1. This is the &quot;trick&quot; here - to &quot;bridle&quot; the positive feedback by using a unity-gain amplifier. Another trick to make the positive feedback stay under control is to &quot;neutralize&quot; it by a negative feedback; an INIC operating in a [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Linear Mode of Current Inversion NIC|linear mode]] is based on this powerful idea. In INIC operating in a [[wikibooks:Circuit Idea/Bistable Mode of Current Inversion NIC|bistable mode]], the positive feedback dominates and it is out of control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Technology
Bluetooth is a de facto standard and specification for small-form factor, low-cost, short range radio links between mobile PCs, mobile phones and other portable devices. The technology allows users to form wireless connections between various communication devices, in order to transmit real-time voice and data communications. The Bluetooth radio is built into a small microchip and operates in the 2.4Ghz band, a globally available frequency band ensuring communication compatibility worldwide. It uses frequency hopping spread spectrum, which changes its signal 1600 times per second which helps to avoid interception by unauthorized parties. In addition software controls and identity coding built into each microchip ensure that only those units preset by their owners can communicate. 
The specification has two power levels defined; a lower power level that covers the shorter personal area within a room, and a higher power level that can cover a medium range, such as within a home. It supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections and provides up to 720 Kbps data transfer within a range of 10 meters (up to 100 meters with a power boost). The technology uses omnidirectional radio waves that can transmit through walls and other non-metal barriers. If there is interference from other devices, the transmission speed decreases but does not stop. 
With the current specification, up to seven slave devices can be set to communicate with a master radio in one device. This connection of devices (slaves and master) is called a piconet. Several piconets can be linked together to form scatternets which allow communication between other device configurations. 
Bluetooth SIG
The Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group) was founed in 1998 by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba. Since that time 3Com, Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola and more than 2000 member (adopters) companies have joined the organization.
Certification Process
Before a manufacturer can release a product with the Bluetooth wireless technology on the market they must receive product approval from two organizational bodies. The product must first comply with the required Bluetooth Specification ensuring interoperability with other products with the Bluetooth wireless technology. The manufacturer must also obtain Regulatory Type Approval from the legislative body responsible for such certification in each country where they wish to manufacture/sell products.
A Bluetooth profile is a wireless interface specification for Bluetooth-based communication between devices. In order to use Bluetooth technology, a device must be compatible with the subset of Bluetooth profiles necessary to use the desired services. A Bluetooth profile resides on top of the Bluetooth Core Specification and (optionally) additional protocols. While the profile may use certain features of the core specification, specific versions of profiles are rarely tied to specific versions of the core specification. For example, there are HFP 1.5 implementations using both Bluetooth 2.0 and Bluetooth 1.2 core specifications.

The way a device uses Bluetooth technology depends on its profile capabilities. The profiles provide standards which manufacturers follow to allow devices to use Bluetooth in the intended manner.

At a minimum, each profile specification contains information on the following topics:

    * Dependencies on other profiles
    * Suggested user interface formats
    * Specific parts of the Bluetooth protocol stack used by the profile. To perform its task, each profile uses particular options and parameters at each layer of the stack. This may include an outline of the required service record, if appropriate.

A protocol stack (sometimes communications stack) is a particular software implementation of a computer networking protocol suite. The terms are often used interchangeably. Strictly speaking, the suite is the definition of the protocols, and the stack is the software implementation of them.

Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind. This modularization makes design and evaluation easier. Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest protocol always deals with &quot;low-level&quot;, physical interaction of the hardware. Every higher layer adds more features. User applications usually deal only with the topmost layers (see also OSI model).

In practical implementation, protocol stacks are often divided into three major sections: media, transport, and applications. A particular operating system or platform will often have two well-defined software interfaces: one between the media and transport layers, and one between the transport layers and applications.

The media-to-transport interface defines how transport protocol software makes use of particular media and hardware types (&quot;card drivers&quot;). For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to Ethernet hardware. Examples of these interfaces include ODI and NDIS in the Microsoft Windows and DOS environment.

The application-to-transport interface defines how application programs make use of the transport layers. For example, this interface level would define how a web browser program would talk to TCP/IP transport software. Examples of these interfaces include Berkeley sockets and System V STREAMS in the Unix world, and Winsock in the Microsoft world.
[edit] General protocol suite description

  T ~ ~ ~ T
 [A]     [B]_____[C]

Imagine three computers: A, B, and C. A and B both have radio equipment, and can communicate via the airwaves using a suitable network protocol (such as IEEE 802.11.) B and C are connected via a cable, using it to exchange data (again, with the help of a protocol, for example Ethernet). However, neither of these two protocols will be able to transport information from A to C, because these computers are conceptually on different networks. One, therefore, needs an inter-network protocol to &quot;connect&quot; them.

One could combine the two protocols to form a powerful third, mastering both cable and wireless transmission, but a different super-protocol would be needed for each possible combination of protocols. It is easier to leave the base protocols alone, and design a protocol that can work on top of any of them (the Internet Protocol is an example.) This will make two stacks of two protocols each. The inter-network protocol will communicate with each of the base protocol in their simpler language; the base protocols will not talk directly to each other.

A request on computer A to send a chunk of data to C is taken by the upper protocol, which (through whatever means) knows that C is reachable through B. It, therefore, instructs the wireless protocol to transmit the data packet to B. On this computer, the lower layer handlers will pass the packet up to the inter-network protocol, which, on recognizing that B is not the final destination, will again invoke lower-level functions. This time, the cable protocol is used to send the data to C. There, the received packet is again passed to the upper protocol, which (with C being the destination) will pass it on to a higher protocol or application on C. Often an even higher-level protocol will sit on top, and incur further processing.

An example protocol stack and the corresponding layers:
Protocol 	Layer
HTTP 	Application
TCP 	Transport
IP 	Internet
Ethernet 	Link
IEEE 802.3u 	Physical

The TCP/IP model is a description framework for computer network protocols created in the 1970s by DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense. It evolved from ARPANET, which was the world's first wide area network and a predecessor of the Internet. The TCP/IP Model is sometimes called the Internet Model or the DoD Model.
The TCP/IP model, or Internet Protocol Suite, describes a set of general design guidelines and implementations of specific networking protocols to enable computers to communicate over a network. TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. Protocols exist for a variety of different types of communication services between computers.
TCP/IP is generally described as having four abstraction layers (RFC 1122). This layer architecture is often compared with the seven-layer OSI Reference Model; using terms such as Internet Reference Model in analogy is however incorrect as the Internet Model is descriptive while the OSI Reference Model was intended to be prescriptive, hence Reference Model.
The TCP/IP model and related protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)

'Bluetooth' is therefore a proprietary open wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short length radio waves) from fixed and mobile devices, creating personal area networks (PANs) with high levels of security. Invented by telecoms vendor Ericsson in 1994,[1] it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization. Today Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.

A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computer devices, including telephones and personal digital assistants, in proximity to an individual's body. The devices may or may not belong to the person in question. The reach of a PAN is typically a few meters. PANs can be used for communication among the personal devices themselves (intrapersonal communication), or for connecting to a higher level network and the Internet (an uplink).
Personal area networks may be wired with computer buses such as USB and FireWire. A wireless personal area network (WPAN) can also be made possible with network technologies such as IrDA, Bluetooth, UWB, Z-Wave and ZigBee.
The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is the body that oversees the development of Bluetooth standards and the licensing of the Bluetooth technologies and trademarks to manufacturers. Founded in 1998 by Ericsson, the inventors of Bluetooth, and Toshiba and Intel, it is a privately held trade association headquartered in Bellevue, Washington with Michael W. Foley (Mike) presently its executive director.

Ericsson (Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson) (OMX: ERIC B, NASDAQ: ERIC), one of the largest Swedish companies, is a provider of telecommunication and data communication systems, and related services, covering a range of technologies, including especially mobile networks. Directly and through subsidiaries, it also has a major role in mobile devices and cable TV and IPTV systems. Ericsson was also the inventor of bluetooth.
Founded in 1876 as a telegraph equipment repair shop by Lars Magnus Ericsson, it was incorporated on August 18, 1918. Headquartered in Kista, Stockholm Municipality, since 2003, Ericsson is considered part of the so-called &quot;Wireless Valley&quot;. Since the mid-1990s, Ericsson's extensive presence in Stockholm has helped transform the city into one of Europe's hubs of information technology (IT) research. Ericsson has offices and operations in more than 150 countries, with more than 20,000 staff in Sweden, and also significant presences in, for example, the UK, India, Ireland, the USA, Finland, China, and Brazil.
In the early 20th century, Ericsson dominated the world market for manual telephone exchanges but was late to introduce automatic equipment. The world's largest ever manual telephone exchange, serving 60,000 lines, was installed by Ericsson in Moscow in 1916. Throughout the 1990s, Ericsson held a 35-40% market share of installed cellular telephone systems. Like most of the telecommunications industry, Ericsson suffered heavy losses after the telecommunications crash in the early 2000s, and had to fire tens of thousands of staff worldwide in an attempt to manage the financial situation, returning to profit by the mid-2000s.
Ericsson is currently the world's largest telecommunications equipment vendor with a market share of 35%.
Foundation
 
 
Lars Magnus Ericsson
Lars Magnus Ericsson began his association with telephones in his youth as an instrument maker. He worked for a firm which made telegraph equipment for Swedish firm Telegrafverket. In 1876, aged 30, he started a telegraph repair shop with help from his friend Carl Johan Andersson. The shop was in central Stockholm (No. 15 on Drottninggatan, the principal shopping street) and repaired foreign-made telephones. In 1878 Ericsson began making and selling his own telephone equipment. His phones were not technically innovative, as most of the inventions had already been made in the US. In 1878, he made an agreement to supply telephones and switchboards to Sweden's first telecom operating company, Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag.
Also in 1878, local telephone importer Numa Peterson hired Ericsson to adjust some telephones from the Bell Telephone Company. This inspired him to buy a number of Siemens telephones and analyze the technology further. (Ericsson had had a scholarship at Siemens a few years earlier.) Through his firm's repair work for Telegrafverket and Swedish Railways, he was familiar with Bell and Siemens Halske telephones. He improved these designs to produce a higher quality instrument. These were used by new telephone companies, such as Rikstelefon, to provide cheaper service than the Bell Group. He had no patent or royalty problems, as Bell had not patented their inventions in Scandinavia. His training as an instrument maker was reflected in the high standard of finish and the ornate design which made Ericsson phones of this period so attractive to collectors. At the end of the year he started to manufacture telephones of his own, much in the image of the Siemens telephones, and the first product was finished in 1879.
With its reputation established, Ericsson became a major supplier of telephone equipment to Scandinavia. Because its factory could not keep up with demand, work such as joinery and metal-plating was contracted out. Much of its raw materials were imported, so in the following decades Ericsson bought into a number of firms to ensure supplies of essentials like brass, wire, ebonite and magnet steel. Much of the walnut used for cabinets was imported from the US.
As Stockholm's telephone network expanded rapidly that year, the company reformed into a telephone manufacturing company. But when Bell bought the biggest telephone network in Stockholm, it only allowed its own telephones to be used with it. So Ericsson's equipment sold mainly to free telephone associations in the Swedish countryside and in the other Nordic countries.
The high prices of Bell equipment and services led Henrik Tore Cedergren to form an independent telephone company in 1883 called Stockholms Allmänna Telefonaktiebolag. As Bell would not deliver equipment to competitors, he formed a pact with Ericsson, which was to supply the equipment for his new telephone network. In 1918 the companies were merged into Allmänna Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.
In 1884, a multiple-switchboard manual telephone exchange was more or less copied from a design by C. E. Scribner at Western Electric. This was legal, as the device was not patented in Sweden, although in the US it held patent 529421 since 1879. A single switchboard could handle up to 10,000 lines. The following year, LM Ericsson and Cedergren toured the US, visiting several telephone exchange stations to gather &quot;inspiration&quot;. They found that US engineers were well ahead in switchboard design but Ericsson telephones were as good as any available.
In 1884, a technician named Anton Avén at Stockholms Allänna Telefonaktiebolag had combined the earpiece and the mouthpiece of a (by then) standard telephone into a handset. It was used by operators in the exchanges that needed to have one hand free when talking to their customers. Ericsson picked up this invention and incorporated it into Ericsson products, beginning with a telephone named The Dachshund.
International expansion
As production grew in the late 1890s, and the Swedish market seemed to be reaching saturation, Ericsson was able to expand into foreign markets through a number of agents. Britain and Russia were early markets. This eventually led to the establishment of factories in these countries. This was partly to improve chances of gaining local contracts, and partly because the Swedish factory could not keep up supply. In Britain, the National Telephone Company had been supplied with Ericsson equipment for some time and was a major customer. By 1897, Britain was accounting for 28% of Ericsson's sales. Other Nordic countries had become Ericsson customers as well, spurred by the rapid growth of telephone services in Sweden.
Other countries and colonies were exposed to Ericsson products through the influence of their parent countries. These included Australia and New Zealand, which by the late 1890s were Ericsson's largest non-European market. With mass production techniques now firmly established, the phones were losing some of their ornate finish and decoration.
Despite their successes elsewhere, Ericsson did not make significant sales into the United States. The Bell Group and local companies like Kellogg and Automatic Electric had this market tied up. Ericsson eventually sold its US assets. In contrast, sales in Mexico were good and led to further development into South American countries. South Africa and China were also generating significant sales. With his company now multinational, and growing strongly, Lars Ericsson stepped down from the company in 1901.
On October 1, 2001 the handsets division formed a joint venture with Sony called Sony Ericsson.[2] Ericsson is now a major provider of handset cores and an infrastructure supplier for all major wireless technologies. It has played an important global role in modernizing existing copper lines to offer broadband services and has actively grown a new line of business in the professional services area.
In July 2009, the company signed a $1.7 billion deal in China with local operators China Mobile Communications Corp and China Unicom [3]
Automatic equipment

In a curious oversight, Ericsson ignored the growth of automatic telephony in the US. Instead it concentrated on squeezing the most sales out of manual exchange designs. By 1910, this weakness was becoming seriously apparent, and the company spent the years up to 1920 correcting the situation. Their first dial phone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early automatic switching systems were slow until the equipment had proved itself on the world's markets. Phones of this period were characterized by a simpler design and finish, and many of the early automatic desk phones in Ericsson's catalogues were simply the proven magneto styles with a dial stuck on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. A concession to style was in the elaborate decals (transfers) that decorated the cases. These phones have been also highly collectable and attractive.
World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.
Shareholding changes
The purchase of other related companies put pressure on Ericsson's finances, and in 1925, Karl Fredric Wincrantz took control of the company by acquiring the majority of the shares. Wincrantz was partly funded by Ivar Kreuger, an international financier. The company was renamed Telefon AB LM Ericsson. At this time, Kreuger started showing interest in the company, being a major owner of Wincrantz holding companies.
In 1928, Ericsson began its long tradition of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares, where an &quot;A&quot; share has 1000 votes against a &quot;B&quot; share. Wincrantz controlled the company by having only a few &quot;A&quot; shares, not a majority of the shares. By issuing a lot of &quot;B&quot; shares, much more money was fed to the company, while maintaining the status quo of power distribution.
In 1930, a second issue of &quot;B&quot;-shares took place, and Kreuger gained majority control of the company with a mixture of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares. He bought these shares with money lent by LM Ericsson, with security given in German state bonds. He then took a large loan for his own company Kreuger &amp; Toll from ITT Corporation (administered by Sosthenes Behn), giving large parts of LM Ericsson as security, and used its assets and name in a series of doubtful international financial dealings that had little to do with telephony.
Financially weakened, Ericsson was now being seen as a take over target by ITT, its main international competitor. In 1931 ITT acquired from Kreuger enough shares to have a majority interest in Ericsson. This news was not made public for some time. There was a government imposed limit on foreign shareholdings in Swedish companies, so for the time being the shares were still listed in Kreuger's name. Kreuger in return was to gain shares in ITT. He stood to make a profit of $11 million on the deal. When ITT's Behn wanted to cancel this deal in 1932, he discovered that there was no money left in the company, just a large claim on the same Kreuger &amp; Toll that Kreuger had himself lent money to. Kreuger had effectively bought LM Ericsson with its own money.
With Kreuger no longer in control, the company's shaky financial position became quickly evident. Kreuger had been using the company as security for loans, and despite his profits, was unable to repay these loans. Ericsson found that they had invested in some very doubtful share deals, whose the probable losses were significant. ITT examined the deal and found that it had been misled quite seriously about the Ericsson's value. It summoned Kreuger to New York City for a conference, but Kreuger had a &quot;breakdown&quot;. As word of Kreuger's financial position spread, pressure was put on him by the banking institutions to provide security for his loans. ITT canceled the deal to buy Ericsson shares. Kreuger could not repay the $11 million, and committed suicide in Paris in 1932. ITT owned one third of Ericsson, but was forbidden to exercise this ownership because of a paragraph in the articles of association stating that no foreign investor was allowed to control more than 20% of the votes.
The Wallenberg era begins
Ericsson, a basically stable and profitable company, was only saved from bankruptcy and closure with help of loyal banks and some government backing. Marcus Wallenberg Jr negotiated a deal with several Swedish banks to rebuild Ericsson financially. Some of those were Stockholms Enskilda Bank (after a later merger part of the present Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken) and other Swedish investment banks controlled by the Wallenberg family. Then gradually increased their possession of LM Ericsson &quot;A&quot; shares, with ITT still being the single largest owner. In 1960 the Wallenberg family struck a deal with ITT to buy its shares in Ericsson, and has since controlled the company, under the &quot;Wallenberg sphere&quot;.
Market development
In the 1920s and 1930s, the world telephone markets were being organized and stabilized by many governments. The fragmented town-by-town systems which had grown up over the years, serviced by many small private companies, were integrated and offered for lease to a single company. Ericsson managed to obtain some leases, which was vital to the company as it represented further sales of equipment to the growing networks. The other large telephone companies, of course, had exactly the same goal. Ericsson managed to get almost one third of its sales under the control of its telephone operating companies.
There were a number of negotiations between the major telephone companies aimed at dividing up the world between them, but the sheer size of the ITT empire made it hard to compete with. With its financial problems, Ericsson was forced to reduce its involvement in telephone operating companies and go back to what it did best, manufacturing telephones and switchgear. It could do this easily now, thanks to its overseas manufacturing facilities and its associated supply companies. These had not been involved in the previous shady financial dealings and were generally in a sound position. The Beeston factory in Britain became a very useful asset here. It had been a joint venture between Ericsson and the National Telephone Company. The factory built automatic switching equipment for the BPO under license from Strowger, and exported a large amount of product to former colonies like South Africa and Australia. The British government divided its equipment contracts between competing manufacturers, but Ericsson's presence and manufacturing facilities in Britain allowed it to get most of the contracts. Ericsson equipment maintained its reputation for quality.[citation needed]
Sales drives resumed after the Great Depression, but the company never achieved the market penetration that it had at the turn of the century. Although it still produced a full range of phones, switching equipment was becoming a more important part of its range. The distinctive Ericsson styles soon became subdued by the increasing use of moulded thermoplastic phones (Bakelite, etc).
Further development
Yet, Ericsson remained a world telecommunications leader. It released one of the world's first handsfree speaker phones in the 1960s. In 1956, it released the Ericofon, which was such a radical departure in styling that it has been highly collectable. Ericsson crossbar switching equipment is the mainstay of many telephone administrations around the world, and its influence is still felt strongly in such areas as mobile phones with its reputation for quality.[citation needed]
Acquisitions, expansion, consolidation and cooperation
As the Internet and wireless telephony began to merge during the turn of the century, Motorola (US), Ericsson, and Nokia (Finland) announced plans to develop standards jointly for the security of electronic transactions over mobile devices in 2000. In May 2000 the European Commission created the Wireless Strategic Initiative,[4] a consortium of four leading telecommunications suppliers in Europe — Ericsson, Nokia, France-based Alcatel, and German Siemens AG — to develop and test new prototypes for advanced wireless communications systems. After meeting with an international think tank, the consortium partners in December 2000 invited other companies to join them in a Wireless World Research Forum held in 2001.
In 2000, the bursting of the information technology bubble had marked economic implications for Sweden. Ericsson, the world's largest producer of mobile telecommunications equipment, shed thousands of jobs, as did the country's once fast-expanding Internet consulting firms and dot-com start-ups. In 2000, Intel Corp., the world's largest chip manufacturer, signed a $1.5 billion deal to supply flash memory to LM Ericsson over the next three years.
In 2001 telecommunications companies around the world experienced a year of tumbling stock prices and huge job losses. By September the stock market valuation of the world's telecom carriers and suppliers had declined by $3.8 trillion from a peak of $6.3 trillion in March 2000. More than a quarter of a million jobs were lost globally in the second quarter of 2001 alone. The major equipment manufacturers — Motorola (US), Lucent Technologies (US), and Cisco Systems (US), Marconi (UK), Siemens AG (Germany), Nokia (Finland), as well as Ericsson — all announced job cuts both in their home countries and in subsidiaries around the world. Some of the biggest losses were announced by the Canadian supplier Nortel Networks Ltd., which shed 50% of its workforce (almost 50,000 jobs), while in France equipment manufacturer Alcatel cut 33,000 jobs (almost a third of its employees).
In April 2001, Ericsson and Sony Corp of Japan announced that they were setting up a joint venture, based in London, to combine their cellular handset manufacturing businesses.
Financially, 2002 was even worse for the global Internet and telecommunications industry than the previous year had been due the excesses of the investment bubbles. LM Ericsson, Royal KPN NV, Vodafone Group PLC, and Deutsche Telekom AG experienced the biggest losses in corporate history. The telecommunications sector's problems brought bankruptcies and job losses, and led to changes in the leadership of a number of major companies. The most high-profile victim in 2002 was Ericsson, then the world's largest producer of wireless telecom systems, as it was forced to let go thousands of staff and raise about $3 billion from its shareholders.
In June 2002, Infineon Technologies AG (then the sixth largest semiconductor supplier and a subsidiary of Siemens AG) bought the microelectronics unit of LM Ericsson for €400 million.
In October 2005, LM Ericsson acquired the bulk of the troubled British telecoms manufacturer Marconi, including the Marconi brand name, which dates back to the creation of the original Marconi Company by the &quot;father of radio&quot; Guglielmo Marconi. In September 2006, LM Ericsson sold the greater part of its defense business Ericsson Microwave Systems, which mainly produced sensor and radar systems, to SAAB AB, which renamed the company to Saab Microwave Systems. The sale meant that Saab Ericsson Space, previously a joint venture, is now fully owned by SAAB. Not included in the sale to Saab was the National Security &amp; Public Safety division, which was transferred to Ericsson with the sale. In November 2006, LM Ericsson purchased the UIQ software business for smartphones from Symbian.
In January 2007, LM Ericsson completed the merger of its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Maxwell Acquisition Corporation, with and into Redback Networks Inc. (Redback), with Redback surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of LM Ericsson. In February 2007, LM Ericsson acquired Entrisphere, a company providing fiber access technology, based in the United States. In September 2007, LM Ericsson acquired an 84% interest in German software firm, LHS Telekom Inc., a stake since raised to 87.5%.
In July 2009, Ericsson acquired Nortel's wireless-equipment unit at price $1.13 billion in cash, the unit mainly include CDMA2000 and LTE. Other companies, also bidding for it included Nokia Siemens Networks and MatlinPatterson Global Advisors.
On February 18, 2008, it was announced that Aastra Technologies would acquire the enterprise PBX division of Ericsson.[5]
Major competitors today include, in the main business, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, Nokia Siemens Networks and ZTE, with Cisco, IBM, EDS, Accenture, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, LG Electronics, NEC, Sharp and most recently Apple Inc., competing with aspects of the business (for more details, see the last template at the end of the page).
Corporate governance
Current members of the board of directors of LM Ericsson are: Monica Bergström, Peter Bonfield, Kristina Davidsson, Börje Ekholm, Anna Guldstrand, Jan Hedlund, Katherine Hudson, Ulf Johansson, Per Lindh, Sverker Martin-Löf, Nancy McKinstry, Torbjörn Nyman, Anders Nyrén, Carl-Henric Svanberg, Michael Treschow and Marcus Wallenberg.[6]
LM Ericsson offers end-to-end solutions[clarification needed] for all major mobile communication standards, and has three main business units.
•	Business Unit Networks (BNET) focuses on networks for mobile and fixed line public telephone networks.
•	Business Unit Global Services (BUGS) provides telecoms-related professional services, including for example taking responsibility for running an operators network and related business support systems.
•	Business Unit Multimedia (BMUM) provides charging, provisioning, IPTV, mobile TV and other support and media systems, primarily for telecom operators.
In addition, there is a very substantial research and development element, and a range of central functions. Operations locally are coordinated through a structure of regions and Market Units, with some Global and Multi-Country Accounts for large customers.
Business Unit Networks: Mobile and fixed networks
LM Ericsson provides mobile systems solutions to network operators. Its systems offerings include radio base stations, base station and radio network controllers, mobile switching centers and service application nodes. Its end-to-end solutions offer operators a network migration to 3G.
Mobile access
Ericsson provides mobile telecommunications systems that incorporate any of the major second-generation (2G) (global system for mobile communications (GSM), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA)), 2.5G (General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)) and 3G (enhanced data for GSM evolution (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), code division multiple access (third generation cellular/radio technology) (CDMA2000), time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA)) mobile technology standards. It is able to offer tailored solutions to a network operator, regardless of the existing network standard used. Ericsson is actively involved in the development of standards for the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) of 3G.
Fixed broadband access
The expansion of Ericsson's fixed broadband offering is an important step to address network operators as they begin integrating their fixed and mobile networks. It supplies broadband multi-service communications equipment and services mainly to fixed network operators in Latin America and Europe. Its solution for such multi-service networks utilizes a layered soft-switch service and control architecture, combined with broadband access and core network routing and transmission elements. Fixed network equipment and associated network rollout services account for 7% of Systems sales.
Radio access networks
LM Ericsson offers radio base stations ranging from small pico cells (small cells in a mobile network that boost capacity and coverage within buildings) to high-capacity macro cell applications. Radio base stations provide access and interconnection between mobile handsets and the mobile network. A central feature of the 2G GSM radio base stations and base station controllers is their ability to be upgraded to enable 2.5G/GPRS and 3G/EDGE transmissions. Similarly, its W-CDMA base stations can be upgraded to HSDPA.
Other elements of the radio access networks are the controllers for radio base stations and radio access network, which manage the traffic between the radio base stations and core networks. In 2G, base station controllers in conjunction with mobile switching centers, effect call handovers between radio base stations as subscribers move between cell sites while engaged in a voice call or data transmission. Similarly, in 3G networks, a radio network controller effects call handover in conjunction with mobility server nodes within the service layer.
The core network nodes interconnect radio access networks with other parts of the network. Many of the core network switching systems, controllers for base stations and radio networks are built upon common platforms. Like its radio base station products, LM Ericsson's mobile switching products have scalability and capacity. Mobile network equipment and associated network rollout services account for approximately 74% of its sales.[citation needed]
IP core network (switching, routing, control and transport)
Ericsson's core network solutions include the mobile softswitch, IP infrastructure, IMS, media gateways, Mobile Packet Backbone Network (MPBN) and microwave and optical transport solutions to provide management of voice and data traffic.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;Font face=&quot;Ubahn&quot;&gt;&lt;Font face=&quot;Ubahn&quot; color=#535353&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;big&gt;~&lt;/big&gt;&lt;Font face=&quot;Schwaben Alt&quot; color=#003300&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Wes hal!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

This lesson will deal with simple sentences and simple grammar.

==Greetings (Grœtungen)==
*Hallo! - Hello!
*Wes haal! - Hello! (literally: be hale, also a farewell)
*Weseþ haale! - Hello all!

==Farewells (Faarwelle)==
*Wes haal!
*Weseþ haale!
*Faarwell!
*tscau!
*oþ lætter!

==Simple Sentences (Anfalde Kwidden)==
*Ic em Michael.  - I am Michael.
*Hu hattest þu? - what's your name?  (literally: how are you called?)
*Hwat is þein Name? - what is your name? (can be written &quot;ƕat is þein Name&quot; as well)
*Hwanen kommst þu? - where are you from? (literally: from where do you come?)
*ic em of Engelland - I am from England (Frankland, Italien, etc.)
*Hu ald ert þu? - how old are you?
*Hu maniȝ Ȝære hæfst þu? - how old are you? (literally: how many years do you have?
*ic em feif Ȝære ald - I am five years old.
*Ic habe feif Ȝære - I am five years old. (literally: I have five years)
*ic em feifwintre - I am five years old. (literally: I am a five-year-old person or five-winters-old)

==Sample Dialog (Biȝspells-Gespræk)==
Dialogue: What's your name?
 
Alex 	Hallo, ic em Alex. Hu hattest þu?&lt;br&gt;
Emma    Hallo, Alex. Ic hatte Emma. Hu gæþ't?&lt;br&gt;
Alex 	It gæþ miȝ well. Kannst þu þen Lærer?&lt;br&gt;
Emma    Ȝa, he hatte Herr Hweit.&lt;br&gt;
Alex 	Oh, Þanke, Emma. Oþ þonn!&lt;br&gt;
Emma    Eftseen!&lt;br&gt;

==Polite and Familiar Forms==
There is no specific polite form of the pronoun.  The only method to indicate 'politeness' would be to capitalize the pronoun, and then, only when referring to God, or to heads of state or royalty.

==Personal Pronouns in Subject and Object form==
The personal pronouns will be familiar to anyone who speaks English or German today.  The personal pronoun has a subject form (nominative case), and an object form (accusative case).

In Englisc:
*I, me: ic, mic
*thou, thee; you (singular): þu, þic
*he, him: he, hin
*she, her: scie, sco
*it, it: it, it
*we, us: wiȝ, usic
*ye, you: ȝiȝ, ȝuic
*they, them: hje, hje
&lt;br&gt;
Example:
*I find her: ic finde sco
*we find him: wiȝ findeþ hin

Sue-
I have really been struggling with embedding the pictures on my page.  I have spent hours trying to figure it out.  I have looked at many different &quot;help&quot; forums on Google and none of them are very clear to me.  I just may take you up on your offer of help :(

===April 16, 2010===

Erin, it looks that you have a nice start to your page. I found it hard to embed pictures but then it finally 'clicked'. I also found it difficult to find pictures that were public domain so I decided to take my own! If you need help with adding pictures, shoot me a line and I can try to guide you through the process. Can't wait to see the finished product! --[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 21:56, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

Erin:
I ended up going to the upload file and using the basic form.  This was pretty easy. I have several hours into the pics, also!

I used the basic form as well but I am still confused as to the whole licensing thing and what we can and cannot use.  :( --[[Special:Contributions/204.186.151.50|204.186.151.50]] ([[User talk:204.186.151.50|talk]]) 12:44, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

== April 18, 2010 ==

Erin,
Nice content. I too am struggling with the pics and will follow Sue's sage advice. Grace


==April 20, 2010==
Erin, I am not sure if you are finished, but you need to add the APA reference for #1, #5 &amp; #6.  Joan</text>

Melanie, you look like you are quite far on your page and that you have some details to add. I would suggest moving the first picture over to the right side. This will get rid of the 'white' space at the top of the page. You have great content, don't make your readers wait any longer than they have to in order to read it. I am interested to see the final product on Monday. --[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 21:59, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

Melanie, there is a site that you can go to which evaluates the strength of your password. I do not remember the URL, but if you do a Google search, I am sure that you can find one. That might be something beneficial to add to your last section.

===April 16, 2010===

Kathleen, LOVE the picture. Did you have trouble finding Public Domain photography? I did. Therefore, I took my own pictures for my chapter. I also like the subheadings that you will be including in your book. It looks like you and I will be working at the final hour to finish the content. I suppose that is the unfortunate curse of taking methods at the same time as another course. I wish I could just work on this book and not our sample proposal because I am enjoying this activity much more! Can't wait to see the final product on Monday! --[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 22:06, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

===April 17, 2010===
Kathleen, great topic and great job so far.  However, I would like to comment that you should add a reference to the first paragraph in Benefits of Mobile Devices in Education to show where you obtained the stat.
--[[User:Jstempin|Jstempin]] ([[User talk:Jstempin|talk]]) 17:22, 17 April 2010 (UTC)


==April 18, 2010==
Kathleen, great topic. We are so often distracted by student mobile devices, we forget that they can actually be used for educational purposes. I liked the way you balanced the benefits and challenges in a realistic manner and, stressed the importance of an AUP Committee in writing the policy. Thanks! Grace

Kathleen, 
Nicely done and what a pertinent topic for our times. So many teachers don't yet see the benefits of student mobile devices. I also think you did a nice job balancing the challenges with the benefits.
I will also be taking my own pictures. You want to be careful how you license your picture otherwise the people who check wikis will take them down on you. Check out the information behind the picture I took for the non-communicative student page: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:HappyChildwAutism.jpg
It may help you with correct licensing. --[[User:Dkellner|Dkellner]] ([[User talk:Dkellner|talk]]) 22:55, 18 April 2010 (UTC)


==April 20, 2010==
Kathleen, your reference to the video about the 13 year old girl sentenced to 90 lashes was very effective.  It is unbelievable.  And the students think our schools are strict.  I also love your idea of taking the pics of your son.  Not only are you sure you are not violating copyright, but I am sure he feels like a star.     Joan</text>

==Confusing Notes==
These notes were removed from the page, as they look more related to verb perfect tenses than pronouns.[[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 22:54, 16 April 2010 (UTC)

===Direct Objects===
* When the direct object comes before a verb in a perfect tense, a tense that uses a past participle, the direct object must agree in gender and plurality with the past participle. For example, in the phrase ''Je les ai eus'', or ''I had them'', the past participle would be spelled ''eus'' if the direct object, ''les'', was referring to a masculine object, and ''eues'' if ''les'' is referring to a feminine object.

===Indirect Objects===
* The indirect object pronouns do '''not''' agree with the past participle like the direct object pronouns do. When ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are used in a perfect tense, the writer must decide whether they are used as direct or indirect object pronouns. This is done by looking at the verb and seeing what type of action is being performed.

The bread ''is given'' by the man (direct). Pierre ''gets the given'' bread (indirect).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Hundred and Forty-four Thousand Israelites Are Sealed==  

===Verses 1-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying, “Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Chapter 7 is a pause in the chronology of Revelation. The interruption of the events that are transpiring in this revelation are interrupted to inform the reader of God's activity. It explains God's program of grace and salvation during the judgment period. The &quot;winds&quot; represent the already started judgment of the earth, and the four angels who &quot;hold&quot; them are &quot;pausing&quot; the Tribulation until God's special servants can be sealed. These servants are sealed just before the trumpeted judgement. The servants will then be martyred before the final judgement.  The winds in this verse could also be referring to the four horseman of the apocalypse. Some scholars believe the &quot;pause&quot; actually occurs ''before'' the opening of the seals, others believe the chronology is literal and that the first six seals have already run their course. Either interpretation is possible and satisfactory. The reader is also provided with great insight into God's divine plan for the Jewish people during this first half of the Tribulation. His word to preserve the seed of Abraham is kept.

''“Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.”'' In 14:1, the 144,000 are described as “having His Father’s name written on their foreheads,” and 22:4 says that God’s servants “shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.” Notice that this is a fixed number here and that he is referring to those who are ''already'' servants of God, not a form of baptism. To have the “seal of God” on their foreheads or the &quot;Father's name&quot; on their foreheads appears to be figurative language for the same thing. It is also thought that the servants had a X put upon their head as a symbol of the cross. For more on the possible significance of this, see the commentary on 3:12 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_3#Verse_12].

===Verses 4-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard the number of those who were sealed, and there were 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel.''''' 
::&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand.'''''  
::'''''Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand.'''''  
::'''''Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand.'''''  
::'''''Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand.''''' 
::'''''Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.'''''

''Commentary:'' Compare 14:1-5 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_14#A_Hundred_and_Forty-Four_Thousand_Virgins].

How literal is the 144,000 servants of God and who are they?  Many answers have been offered including Israel, the most recent generation of Christians, all Christians, only Christians who were killed on account of their beliefs, or even Jewish Christians.  Later John mentions an innumerable multitude instead of only 144,000.  Perhaps confusion comes from using symbolism which is no longer easily accessible to modern day readers.  When put in the context of the rest of the vision, it seems Christians are told they are not to fear as long as they remain faithful to Christ.  The number 144,000 (12 x 12 x 1000) likely represents the complete quantity of believers.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seal shows ownership and security, just as a king's signet ring did for documents. God's protection from wrath is over this populace. 

The tribe of Dan is omitted from John's list of tribes, but the list still totals the correct number of tribes.   There are still twelve tribes because both the tribe of Joseph and the tribe of Manasseh are both listed despite the fact that the tribe of Joseph is traditionally described as the combination of Manasseh and Ephraim.  The absence of the tribe of Dan has often led to speculation as to why Dan was omitted, even spawning suggestions that the Antichrist, or the False Prophet, was to come from the tribe of Dan, despite the fact that the author offers no explanation. This correlated with Genesis 49 vs 17 and it certainly seems to be the meaning of an ancient prophecy that Jacob had given about the tribes of Israel, &quot;Dan will be a serpent in the way, a venomous viper by the path, that bites the horse's heels so that his rider falls backward&quot;.

 However it is entirely possible that it was an honest omission, due to the confusion about the distinction between Joseph, Manasseh, and Ephraim.However, this omission cannot be fully deciphered since John gives no reason for their removal.

It is interesting that he notes the tribes as the literal twelve tribes of Israel, because at the time of writing the book John would have been aware that they did not exist. After being conquered by both the Assyrians and the Babylonians, the tribes were never again truly reunited. It may be reasoned that the author is suggested that there will be a great reunification that will undo the scattering of the tribes. This section also appeals distinctly to a Jewish tradition, perhaps  to either maintain the connection to Judaism or in order to bring more Jews into Christianity. The next passage, however, extends the message of unity to Gentiles as well, which reflects Christianity's nature of including both insiders and outsiders to Judaism.

It is also worth noting that the hundred and forty-four thousand appear again later, in Chapter 14. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_6#The_Fifth_Seal].

==A Great Multitude before the Throne of God==

===Verses 9-10===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''After this I beheld, and a great multitude, which no one could number, of all nations, kindreds, peoples, and tongues stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and with palms in their hands,''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and crying with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb.”'''''

''Commentary:'' 

'' Interpretation 1: ''  Through the evangelism of the sealed Jews, a great multitude of Gentiles are saved as well. These are given white robes to symbolize righteousness and palms to symbolize peace. The multitude praises God for their salvation. Note the final fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham that through his seed all the nations of the world would be blessed.

'' Interpretation 2: ''  While some have speculated that the &quot;great multitude&quot; are converts resulting from an evangelistic campaign of the 144,000 in the previous passage, this is an interpretation which is imposed upon the text, rather than stated or implied within it, so such a view must be held with reservations. Similarly, the identification of the 144,000 as Jews, while not unusual, may also be a misinterpretation (see commentary on verses 4-8, above). Who, then, is this multitude? If the interpretation (see on 4-8) of the 144,000 as resurrected martyrs is correct, this multitude may be the rest of the resurrected people of God, who naturally would be far more numerous. The martyrs come first because they have a special status, but the two passages are possibly two parts of a single vision of the resurrected people of God.

It is possible that this great multitude, by extension of the above passage, completes the number of those who are &quot;sealed.&quot; (With regard to the sealing of believers, see verses 1-3 above with link to cross-reference.)

Witherington hypothesizes the word salvation (soteria) in the Greek may have shades of rescue, portraying god as rescuer of his people. Unfortunately for the sufferers, the rescue party arrives after they're already dead.

These two verses also hold some special value because they are the first time that God's promise of salvation is discussed in light of the plagues and destructive forces unleashed upon the earth.

===Verses 11-12 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying, “Amen. Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The angels and the saved already present join in the praise, offering a sevenfold benediction to God. Since all in heaven agree with and participate in God's plan, all are thankful for its fulfillment.  The angels standing around the throne represents the great quantity of &quot;adorers of God&quot; in heaven.  Amen usually is a concluding statement in prayer or praise.  But it is followed by a doxology.  This doxology has seven powerful words.  The seven words may be associated with completion in the end of time.  These words describe God perfectly, but also may be a prayer for the end of time and the judgement.  This may also show that God's plan and design of the end of time, as well as heaven is complete and perfect.  The saved in heaven will experience complete and perfect happiness though God's design and his sacrifice of Christ Jesus.

A word on translation. The word Amen comes from the Hebrew root for firm, and by extension, truly, solidly, absolutely. It is an indication that this is an absolute. All Blessings, and all Glory, and all wisdom, and all thanksgiving, and all honor, and power and might be unto &quot;our&quot; God. Absolutely! Truly!

===Verses 13-14===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And one of the elders answered, saying to me, “Who are these who are dressed in white robes? And where did they come from?''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are those who came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”'''''

''Commentary:'' These redeemed Gentiles are either saints martyred during the Tribulation, or those who survive and enter the Millennial Kingdom, or both. They have been washed of their sins and are fully acceptable to God.

An elder addresses John with a seemingly rhetorical question concerning the multitude &quot;clothed with white robes&quot; first seen in verse 9.  This presents the reader with an interesting shifting of roles.  One would expect John to be asking the questions, considering that he is the ignorant one, but instead it is the wise elder who poses a question to John.  The effect of this role reversal is that the exchange appears staged and draws the reader's attention even more closely to the surrounding events.  The answer given by the elder is that they are those who &quot;came out of great tribulation.&quot; This may be a reference to the Rapture, or the Resurrection, or both, for they take place at the time of the Tribulation. 

It is interesting to note the colorful contradiction within this verse.  The elder states that the robes are washed with blood (a red substance), but somehow emerge white.  Obviously, this is meant as a symbolic metaphor.  This &quot;blood of the Lamb&quot; may be an allusion to the Crucifixion, though it may also refer to the Spirit of God which was embodied in Jesus, who used the metaphor of blood for the Spirit, saying, &quot;Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day&quot; (Jn 6:54).

===Verse 15===
&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“Therefore they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sits on the throne will dwell among them.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Because they went through this &quot;Great Ordeal&quot; and are and have been servants of God on Earth, they are presented as a righteous assembly before the Throne of God. Serving him day and night simply means to just worship God for all eternity similar to the elders in the throne room.  In return, God will give them His love and all the blessings that entails including sparing them from the trials the rest of the Earthly inhabitants are facing since they have earned this right.

The &quot;Therefore&quot; could also refer back to Jesus' death on the cross. Because He died a martyr's death, the ultimate martyr's death, humans are able to bow before the throne of God. His cross has sealed the Lord's servants in righteousness. This is why they are around the throne, and serve Him day and night. This is also why He shall never leave nor forsake them.

===Verses 16-17===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“They will hunger no more, nor thirst any more, nor will the sun shine on them, nor any heat,''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of waters, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.'''''

''Commentary:'' These people hunger no more because they have eaten the bread and therefore hunger no more. The bread that is being eaten is the bread of life, Jesus Chirst. Once  one eats this bread, they hunger no more and live forever. And there will be no more suffering, no pain, no sorrow for all eternity. The heat here may be referring to the devil and Hell since it is often thought of being warm with many open flames. In the presence of God, there is only joy and light. He will give them all they need in every respect. The &quot;living fountains of waters&quot; are reminiscent of the &quot;hidden manna&quot; of 2:17 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_2#Verse_17].

These verse feeds the martyr fetish seen throughout Revelation, portraying the final reward for enduring suffering on earth. It is a fantastic, but hopeful picture that presumably encouraged those in tribulation. Through the blood of God and Jesus Christ, they have been washed clean of their sins.

Although this verse seemingly ends the series of catastrophes wrought on Earth, this is not the case. Suffering is only over for those who are in heaven worshipping. Their tribulations on Earth have given them a special place in Heaven, but the judgements unleashed on Earth continue in the next few chapters which deal with the Seven Trumpets. Still, this verse serves to end the dramatic action of the Seven Seals. Although the seventh is not opened until the next verse, it serves a pause in the action before more judgement is inflicted upon the Earth with the blowing of the trumpets. Therefore, the seventh seal is in place mostly to serve as the completion of this section of Revelation.

While not entirely opposed, I'm not exactly in favor of this suggestion either.

::Apparently nobody ever did this, though I agree that this work should not be merged to [[Bourne Shell Scripting]], there is a fully fledged book [[Bash Shell Scripting]], which ''is'' the same topic.

      <comment>/* The Mechanical Age */  fixed spelling of Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz from Willhelm to Wilhelm</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Mechanical Age ==
Since the early ages of computer history there have been innovations that have led to the advancement of technology. The first computers were mechanical, and sometimes prone to errors. They were calculating machines.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Pascal Pajou Louvre RF2981.jpg||250px|Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) studying the cycloid, engraved on the tablet he is holding in his left hand; the scattered papers at his feet are his Pensées, the open book his Lettres provinciales.

&lt;/center&gt;
[[w:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]] (June 19, 1623, Clermont-Ferrand – August 19, 1662, Paris) built a numerical wheel adding machine in 1642 in order to help out his father, who was a tax collector. It was a heavy burden to add numbers by hand, and Pascal had seen it as a chance to relieve that burden. He built twenty of these machines (called the Pascaline).

In 1673 Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, a German mathematician, built a calculator device that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It provided more functions than Pascal's machine and allowed users of it to solve more problems. Yet both Pascal's and Leibniz's machines were not totally dependable and suffered from flaws.

== Mechanical Innovations ==
Joseph Jacquard, a French weaver, designed a punch card loom in 1805. A chain of punch cards in an certain order provided instructions for the loom's weaving pattern.  The pattern could be changed by using different cards in different orders. This later lead to storing computer instructions on these cards.

[[Image:Thomas Charles Xavier.jpg|380px||center|||]]
Charles Xavier Thomas, another Frenchman, worked on a new mechanical computer. He called it the four-function machine and it was more reliable than Pascal's or Leibniz's machines. This was in 1820 as technology had progressed, and Thomas learned from Pascal's and Leibniz's works and flaws.

== Larger Scale Mechanical Computers and Logic ==
Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace made contributions since 1842. The Difference Engine, the machine that became the template for the Analytic Engine, was an automatic logarithm tabulator and printer. It had a memory unit, automatic printout, sequential program control and punch-card input. The punch card idea was borrowed from Jacquard's loom.

Babbage had worked with computers for 20 years with the British government, and the government was threatening to withdraw funds because it had nothing to show for its investments. The project needed someone new to help out, and enter Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and Lady Annabella Milbanke. Lovelace corrected some of Babbage's mistakes in the instructions and became the world's first debugger. It was a milestone for women in computer history. Lovelace suggested a binary system of numbers be used, which set the standard of future computers to use.

Sadly the Difference Engine did not function properly. The technology to create proper gears and shafts was not good enough to provide accuracy. Yet it helped pave the way for future computers. Later the IBM Corporation was able to build a working model of the Difference Engine using more modernized parts.

      <comment>/* The Vacuum Tube */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Vacuum Tube ==
[[Image:Elektrometerroehren.PNG|150px||right|||]]
The vacuum tube, also known as a valve because it controls electron flow the way a faucet valve controls the amount of water flow, was originally developed to amplify and demodulate (&quot;detect&quot;) radio signals. Later on, it also amplified audio for sound reinforcement. In World War 2, radar (and sonar) used tubes for more-sophisticated processes, many of which were described at the time as &quot;pulse circuits&quot;. Once the War ended, digital computers using tubes were built, however the sheer number of logic functions meant that very large numbers of tubes were needed. Heater power, on the order of a few watts per tube, had to be provided, and the heat removed. Large cooling systems were needed to carry away the heat.
While tubes designed for simpler systems such as radios, as well as stereo and musical instrument amplifiers could last for decades, for digital computers, tubes were not adequately reliable. Later, tubes specially designed for computers, such as the RCA &quot;Special Red&quot; series, type numbers 5961, 5962, and 5963, were better suited, although their heaters still consumed significant power.

[Nevertheless, the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) air-defense computers in the USA, although using only tubes, were extremely reliable because the computers were installed in essentially-identical pairs, only one being in service. The other was run periodically at reduced power, which made weak tubes fail, so they could be replaced. Periodically, the standby computer was placed into service, relieving the other computer for maintenance. However, for civilian work, duplicate computers were impractical, and tube reliability was not really satisfactory.]

== The Transistor ==
[[Image:Transistor-photo.JPG|380px||left|||]]
[[wikipedia:William_Shockley|Shockley]], Bardeen and Brattain's discovery of the point-contact transistor, followed by the more-practical [[wikipedia:bipolar_junction_transistor|junction transistor]] resolved the vacuum tube limitations and in the process started the shrinking of computers.

The transistor is a solid-state amplifier that, when driven to fully-on or fully-off states, serves as a logic gate switch: it does not need to heat a filament nor open or close physical contacts to cause a change in electron flow. The functional part is made of a semiconductor, a solid material that can be one of two types ( p or n) of conductor (or resistor) depending on concentration and choice of trace amounts of chemical elements put into the ultra-pure substrate.

The original substrate for transistors was germanium. The move to silicon, one of the most readily available chemicals on Earth, made transistors cheap to manufacture and eventually made computers ubiquitous. Comparatively recently, for special applications, such compounds as gallium arsenide have come into use.

Until integrated circuits became practical, transistor computers were made of individual transistors (as well as individual diodes, resistors, and capacitors), all referred ot collectively as components. They were supported on etched-circuit cards (&quot;Printed circuit boards&quot;). Such construction was referred to as &quot;discrete component&quot;. Component density was, comparatively, quite low, and computers of this period comprised floor-mounted cabinets typically having a volume of a few cubic yards/meters.

There are several types of transistors which combine to make full logic circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Altair ==
[[File:Altair 8800.jpg|thumb|right]]
The MITS Altair 8800 was designed around a new microprocessor, the Intel 8080, and debuted in 1975. Its announcement on the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine led the Albuquerque-based manufacturer to a four-month backlog attempting to fill orders.

The Altair is considered the first home computer. Its only input was a series of front-panel switches. However, it had a motherboard with a bus, which allowed other companies to provide keyboards, tape readers and other devices to access the registers.

A group of Harvard students wrote a BASIC interpreter for the MITS. These students -- Steve Ballmer, Paul Allen, and Bill Gates -- left school to focus on code development and not long afterward created MicroSoft.

== Radio Shack ==
[[File:Okona-GfhR-TRS-80.jpg|thumb|right|TRS-80 Model 2]]
The TRS-80 series computers were based on the Zilog Z80 processor and ran TRS-DOS on a monochrome monitor. It used floppy disks and then later hacks were made to use hard drives.

The TRS-COCO computer was developed as a home computer with color graphics and the TRS-80 series was marketed towards businesses. The COCO used a TV set as a monitor to save on costs and tried to compete against the Atari 400 and 800 and Commodore 64 series. The COCO used a 6809 Motorola processor and ran OS9 (no relation to Mac OS 9).

The Tandy 1000 series was based on the IBM PCJr graphics and sound chips, it used expansion slots but had the pins wired differently than PC and AT ISA expansion slots, and ran Deskmate as a GUI under Tandy DOS (Which was a modified MS-DOS that even reversed the DOS Interrupts to make sure it only ran on Tandy series computers.) Many MS-DOS video games were made with CGA, EGA, and Tandy graphics, and the Tandy version had advanced sound until the ISA sound cards like the AdLib and Sound Blaster got created. Eventually the IBM PS/2 series came out with VGA graphics and nobody wanted to buy the Tandy series PCs anymore. Once Windows 3.X became standard Radio Shack stopped selling the Tandy 1000 series, and then eventually dropped out of the PC business and sold PCs made by other companies like Dell or Compaq, and then eventually stopped selling computers.

=== Apple II ===
[[File:Apple II IMG 1107.jpg|thumb|right]]
The Apple II was produced by Apple Computer. It used a BASIC-type operating system and was marketed toward home use. The original Apple I computer was created by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in a garage. Both were college drop-outs that wanted to make one of the first micro computers with a color screen for under $1000. Steve Wozniak carefully chose chips from a catalog to make sure he got the best price and quality and settled for a MOS 6502 processor, which was a Motorola 6800 clone with some of the pins changed to avoid copyright laws. The MOS 6502 processor was cheaper and helped make the Apple I and then later Apple II series cost effective. The original Apple I was $666, and sold enough units in custom wooden cases to not only pay back loans, but help fund the Apple II series. The Apple II series ran Apple DOS and then later Pro DOS and a version of BASIC. It had expansion slots for floppy drive controllers, modems, and other things like a Z80 CP/M card to run CPM-80 software. Steve Wozniak was in a plane crash and lost most of his memory and dropped out of Apple, and Apple tried to make an Apple III series but it was nothing like the Apple II and had series hardware issues like loose chips and Apple's fix was to drop it six feet from a chair to snap the chips back into place. After the Apple II, Apple II+, Apple IIe, the Apple IIc was developed to help Apple compete in the home market against the Commodore 64, Atari 800, and IBM PCjr. After the Macintosh and Amiga the Apple //GS was developed with a 65C816 16 bit CPU to run Apple II code and enhanced Apple IIGS code that was based on the Mac Finder GUI, and later the Macintosh II series replaced it and the Macintosh II NuBus slots had an Apple II emulator card to run Apple II software. Apple used to have the slogan &quot;Apple II Forever&quot; but eventually abandoned the Apple II series in favor of the Macintosh series.

=== Apple Lisa &amp; Macintosh ===
[[File:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|right|Macintosh]]
Apple Computer followed the Apple II with the Apple Lisa, and after that, the Apple Macintosh. These computers were unique due to their graphical user interface (GUI), introducing the concept of icons, windows, pull down menus, and mice. (The GUI concept was actually taken from Xerox, via two of their computers, the Xerox Star and Xerox Alto). Apple was later sued by Xerox, but Xerox lost the lawsuit because the Macintosh GUI was different enough from the Xerox Star GUI to qualify as not the same GUI. The original Macintosh was $4000 and used the Motorola 68000 CPU and had 128K of RAM and a 400K 3.5&quot; Floppy drive and a nine inch black and white monitor. It did not sell very well and Steve Jobs was fired from Apple and left and took key employees with him to found Next Inc. and base the Nextcube and NextOS on BSD Unix and the MACH kernel. Apple made the Macintosh II which had NuBus expansion slots and had color graphics like the Commodore Amiga and competed with the Commodore 2000 but had a 68020 32 bit CPU for faster speed. Eventually the Macintosh would be upgraded to the PowerPC processor via a joint effort by Apple, IBM, and Motorola to develop a processor to challenge the Intel 80386 and up processors. The new Macintosh series was called PowerMacs and continued on until Apple lost a lot of money due to Mac OS not being able to preemptive multi-task and have an error recovery system and ran sluggish. The PowerPC emulated the Motorola 68K series via software so the PowerMacs ran Classic Macintosh software. But Apple debated bringing Steve Jobs back to save the company, but also considered buying out Be Inc. the makers of BeOS and base future Macintosh systems on BeOS. Ultimately Apple decided to bring Steve Jobs back and buy out Next Inc. and merge Mac OS 9 and NextOS together to make Mac OSX. Steve Jobs got rid of nonprofitable products such as the Apple Newton and Apple printers and scanners and developed a new lower cost Mac named the iMac which was an all in one Macintosh inside a 15 inch monitor using translucent plastic colors and designs on the PowerPC G3 processor. Then Apple developed iTunes from Quicktime and developed the iPod to play music on it and later models played videos and movies. The iMac and the iPod were a success and Apple was able to turn itself around and start earning a profit again. The iMac series was updated to PowerPC G4 and G5 processors and became based on a LCD flat screen monitor and base. Mac OS X was finally finished and Apple made more profits from upgrades and ran Classic Mac software via the Carbon library and emulation. The Mac Mini was made with a $599 price to migrate PC users to the Mac, and it didn't include a keyboard, mouse, or monitor, but could use PC ones. Eventually Apple moved to Intel processors as Motorola could not keep up with demand and made video game consoles have priority for PowerPC processors over Apple's Macintosh systems, and could not keep up with Intel's Ghz levels. The Intel Macs were made with Rosetta software to emulate PowerPC macs, and then later the Mac OSX binary format was invented that ran code on PowerPC or Intel Macs. The Apple made the iPhone based on the iPod to make a Touch Screen Cell Phone and then made the iPod Touch to have a Touch Screen like the iPhone but it can't make phone calls. Apple developed BootCamp to partition an Intel Mac hard drive to Boot and Install Microsoft Windows on it since Macs have Intel chips they are basically a PC Clone now. Thus Apple gave Mac users the option to boot Mac OSX or Windows.

=== Commodore 64 ===
[[File:Commodore64.jpg|thumb|right|Commodore 64]]
The Commodore 64 was a revolution at the time it was released in 1981, expanding on the Vic 20's 8 colors to an amazing 16 colors and increasing the screen resolution to 40 columns and 25 lines. A 3 voice synthesizer topped off the features of this amazing computer.

In its time. the Commodore 64 was one of the most popular home computers in the market with thousands of games and business applications available. (''I still have a copy of Microsoft Multiplan for the C64'')

Its built-in BASIC and a plethora of magazines (''ZZap64'', ''Commodore'', ''Compute's Gazette'') with programs for readers to enter, enabled many people to learn BASIC and even Machine Code.

In 1986, the C64C was introduced, its changes (a lighter colored case and a different shape) were mainly cosmetic but still compatible with all previous add-ons and software.

Another version of the C64 was the SX-64. This was a &quot;portable&quot; version of the Commodore 64. I use the term portable very loosely, this thing was ''heavy''. It contained a 5-inch color Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor and a built-in disk drive. The keyboard doubled as the lid of the unit.

Commodore64 was a must for its time.

This computer offered:
:* An amazing 64K of RAM
:* Built-in BASIC
:* Built-in TV adapter
:* A cartridge expansion port
:* 3-channel audio (via the SID chip)
:* 2 x D 9-pin input ports
:* Serial port
:* Optional external floppy drive (the 1541)
:* Optional tape drive (normally supplied with the computer)

===Commodore 128===

===Commodore Plus/4===

=== Amiga ===
The Amiga microcomputer, compared to other computers of its age, was much more advanced in the areas of graphical processing, display, and manipulation. The Amiga series used the 68000 series Motorola processor along with customized co-processors for audio, video, and I/O, and the series went as far as the 68040 processor before moving on to the IBM/Apple/Motorola PowerPC series for the Amiga One.

At the release of the original Amiga computer, the Amiga 1000, had the Amiga 1020 5.25&quot; floppy drive that came with the PC-Transformer software that emulated an 8088 IBM Monochrome PC and ran MS-DOS at the speed of a 1.0 Mhz 8088, it was the only machine capable of displaying 12 bit color, using a format known as HAM-12, or Hold And Modify-12. This made it Amiga the only machine, for several years, to have as many as 4096 colors on screen at a time. 

The machine was replaced by the Amiga 500, a slightly enhanced and stripped down version of the Amiga 1000, with some of the same capabilities, as well as some different expansion ports. After the Amiga 500, came the Amiga 2000, 3000, 600, 4000 and 1200 machines were released, each having minor enhancements over the previous. Currently, the Amiga corporation has handed off development of a new model, titled the Amiga One, to a separate company. This new machine would support speeds of up to 800 MHz, as opposed to the Amiga 4000, which had a top speed of 60 MHz, not counting the PPC enhancements which were released near the end of the Amiga 4000 life-cycle, which did not do well, due to lack of support from programming companies.

The Amiga 2000 and above supported PC BridgeCards, developed that contained most of a PC Clone with an 8088, 80286, 80386 processor on it to run MS-DOS and Windows 3.X. The Amiga could use the BridgeCard CPU as a co-processor when it didn't run MS-DOS. The AMax program emulated a Macintosh using a Macintosh Plus or under BIOS chip and used the Amiga resolution to get a better graphics mode than a Macintosh Plus. There also existed Commodore 64, Apple //, Atari 8 bit, and other emulators for the Amiga, and the Amiga was one of the first computers to offer emulators for almost any system. Now the Amiga Forever emulator runs Amiga software, and the open sourced UAE (Universal Amiga Emulator) and Fellows projects run Amiga software as well, with the difference that Amiga Forever comes with the Kickstart Disks and ROMs as well as Workbench boot disks as part of the license and the others require users to copy them from an Amiga or buy them from Amiga, Inc.

The Amiga series is still popular in parts of Europe and the old Motorola 68K series Amiga computers can have PowerPC upgrade boards to run the latest AmigaOS 4.0 and above operating systems. [http://www.scribd.com/doc/18058526/Amiga-History-and-Patent This is a link to the History of the Amiga via questions and answers in the early 1990's and the original Amiga patent in one PDF document at Scribd] for those interested in history and patents.

== Atari ==

===Atari 8-bit===
Atari Inc. released it's first 8-bit computers, the 400 and 800 PCS's, in 1979.  Jay Miner was integral in the development of the computer before leaving Atari to develop the 68000 based Lorianne under Amiga in the early 80's.  Featuring custom graphics (CTIA/GTIA and Antic) and sound (POKEY) chips, and a custom expansion port (the SIO intelligent &quot;plug and play&quot; port), the systems are centered around the 6502 CPU.  The 400 was intended to fill the low end gaming computer market and game with a membrane keyboard and 16K RAM, while the 800 was intended to be the more serious computer with a full typewriter keyboard and 48k.  In 1982 Atari released the 1200XL which changed the styling of the case, increased RAM to 64k, and added function keys.  Software compatibility issues caused it to only be on the market for a year before being replaced by the 600xl and 800xl computers.  Similar in looks to the 1200XL, the 600XL (16K) and 800XL (64K), they included an expansion port in addition to the SIO standard, the Parallel Bus Interface (PBI).

In 1983-1984, Atari's video game section of it's Consumer Division suffered massive losses that effected the entire company and prompted Atari owner Warner Communications to try and sell the company.  Jack Tramiel the founder of Commodore, left Commodore in early '84 and then went on to buy out Atari Consumer to form Atari Corporation in July of 1984.  Jack released several 8-bit computers under Atari Corporation, upgrading the model line to the XE series in 1985.  The 65XE (64K) and 130XE (128K) took on a new case style, and replaced the PBI with a semi-compatible bus called the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI).

In 1987 Jack took the 65XE, restyled the case and moved to a detached keyboard, releasing it as the XE Game System (XEGS).  When the keyboard was not plugged it, it functioned as a game console including Missile Command in it's ROM.  When the keyboard was plugged in it functions as a full 65XE computer, with full peripheral support through it's included SIO ports.

=== Atari ST ===
[[File:Atari 1040STf.jpg|thumb|right|Atari ST]]
After leaving Commodore in January of 1984, by the Spring of 1984 Jack had decided to return to the computer business and formed Tramel Technology Ltd. (TTL).  Key engineering and management began to leave Commodore to join Jack, and in early May of 1984 former Commodore 64 engineer Shiraz Shivji lead a team to build Jack's next generation computer - code named Rock Bottom Price (RBP).   Initially based around the National Semiconductor NS32032, the design soon moved to a 68000 based system.  A wire wrap of RBP was completed by late August and in September began working with Digital Research Incorporated (DRI) on porting it's GEM GUI and newly developed GEMDOS to run as part of the TOS (The Operating System). ST also stood for SixTeen because the 68000 that powered it had a 16 bit I/O bus. The first ST series model, the 520ST, was released in 1985, to be followed by the 1040ST the following year.  Later the Atari TT used the 68020 and 68030 processors that were Thirty Two bits. The Atari Falcon was developed and released in 1992 to provide a 32 bit multimedia system and included a DSP audio chip, enhanced graphics modes, and a multi-tasking operating system. Like the Amiga, the Atari ST and above suffered lack of third party software support and lack of proper marketing. When the IBM PC Clones used 80386 processors and above and ran Microsoft Windows 3.X and used VGA or SVGA and the Sound Blaster or similar sound card, they were cheaper than the Amiga or Atari series computers and drove both companies into almost bankruptcy. Atari was resold many times, and now is a Video Game company for modern game consoles and Windows and Macintosh computers. A version of the Atari ST software is available via the [[Wikipedia:MiNT|MiNT]] project for the Atari St series hardware, an Ubuntu port of MiNT is being done to run Atari ST software under Ubuntu. When Windows 95 and above became standard many Atari ST users migrated to PC Clones and Windows, while others went to the Macintosh. The Atari ST had a Macintosh emulator called Magic Sack that used an old Macintosh Plus and under BIOS chip to emulate a Macintosh Plus or under system.

== IBM ==
[[File:IBM PC.jpg|thumb|right|IBM PC]]
The IBM PC was a personal computer built around the Intel 8088 microprocessor (which was modeled after the Intel 8086). It became standardized, and today, the majority of personal computers are IBM compatible. IBM started out with the IBM DisplayWrite word processor, and then later made the IBM 5150 aka IBM PC based on the Intel 8088 processor. IBM had Microsoft write IBM Personal Computer DOS 1.0, and reserved DRI's CP/M-86 and Microsoft Xenix as standby operating systems. But DOS was the more popular operating system. IBM made the IBM PC/XT which was like the IBM PC but had more expansion slots, and then the IBM PC/AT based on the Intel 80286 16 bit processor (Skipping the Intel 80186) and 16 Bit ISA bus. Originally IBM had two displays MGA (Monochrome) 80X25 text graphics, and CGA (Color Graphic Adapter) with 80X25 text mode and 16 colors, 320x200 in 4 out of 16 colors and 640x200 in 2 colors. To compete with Atari and Commodore IBM made the IBM PCJr for home use, but it flopped despite having a wireless infrared keyboard and cartridge slot to make loading software easier. Each expansion took place on a sidebus and the more sidebus adapters added to it the larger it got. The PCJr had better graphics and a sound chip and the original PC series only had a PC speaker with limited sounds, so PCJr video games were better, but IBM sold the PCJr graphics and sound to Tandy for their Tandy 1000 series. IBM invented EGA graphics which used 16 colors in 320x200 mode and 4 colors in 640x200 mode. Eventually IBM moved on to the PS/2 series and OS/2, Personal Series 2 computers (A PS/1 was made with IBM PC specs but a better graphics card aka VGA) and PS/2 series had VGA graphics 256 colors out of 16 million and up to 640x480 graphics. Most of the PS/2 series had MCA slots or Microchannel slots that were not ISA compatible like the original IBM PC (and PS/1) and IBM considered it their &quot;Clone Killer&quot; while PC Clone makers tried to push EISA also a 32 bit expansion bus but backward compatible with 16 bit ISA. Ultimately either one caught on and Intel's PCI bus replaced ISA and Intel's VESA Local Bus briefly caught on that extended ISA with another slot in front of it for 32 bits, but ultimately PCI and later PCI Express beat all. Briefly video cards had an AGP video standard, but PCI Express beat it later on. IBM made the ValuePoint series using ISA slots, and the ThinkPad as a laptop, but eventually offshored work to Lenovo for making their PC systems to save on costs.

      <comment>/* BASIC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The first version of a programming language arose from work by [[wikipedia:Ada_Lovelace|Ada Lovelace]], the benefactor and business partner of [[wikipedia:Charles_Babbage|Charles Babbage]]. Unfortunately her work went mostly ignored since Babbage never built a completed Analytical Engine so there was no public deployment. She is remembered in the programming language still in use on military-grade projects, [[Ada]].

== Wiring and Raw Binary ==
Early work with analog and electromechanical computers did not involve programming languages the way we know them. Since early computers needed to be wired directly for each problem set, the process of setting plugs took the place of having a text-based distillation of an algorithm.

As electromechanical machinery gave way to mercury delay lines and drum memory, it became possible to write directly to addresses in memory and provide instructions without rewiring. This typically meant writing what we would call &quot;machine code&quot;. This often gets called &quot;hex&quot; today, as modern 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessor systems read binary data in 8 or 16 hexadecimal chunks per clock cycle.

Writing code at the machine level is difficult: it requires that the programmer know the specific locations for registers in hardware and the instruction set for the processor. Reading machine code is often more difficult than writing it, thus tracking code changes is nearly impossible for a human.

== Assembly ==
The first upgrade to the machine code level of programming was [[wikipedia:assembly_language|assembly language]]. This provided a way to write machine code with string manipulators and names for instructions instead of the raw binary versions. It can still be difficult to read and still requires knowing which instructions and register locations exist, but it can be read on paper or screen and assembled into machine code cycle by cycle.

Assembly programming has not gone away. Most device drivers for computer peripherals are written in C code, but some real-time glitches are best resolved by hand optimizing the mid-step assembly output from the C compiler. This is becoming increasingly rare. 

== FORTRAN ==
[[File:Punch card with Fortran - 20091211.jpg|thumb|right|A punchcard form 1971 programmed with FORTRAN.]]
[[wikipedia:fortran|FORTRAN]] Stands for FORmula TRANslation. This language was invented at IBM in the mid-1950s for the IBM 704 series computer.

== BASIC ==
In computer programming, [[BASIC]] (an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code[1]) is a family of high level languages. It was originally designed in 1963, by John George Kemeny and Thomas Eugene Kurtz at Dartmouth College, to allow students not in science fields to use computers. At the time all computer use required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to do. It became widespread on home microcomputers in the 1980s, and remains popular to this day in a handful of heavily evolved dialects.

== COBOL ==
COBOL, an acronym that stands for '''COmmon Business Oriented Language''', is a high-level programming language developed in the 1960s and still used in business applications. It is used extensively in the financial services industry for large scale mainframe based applications. It uses instructions resembling English statements and imposes an overall framework for a program. The design goal for COBOL was a language that self-documented so that it could be revised and maintained easily.

== PL/1 ==
'''Programming Language 1''' is a high-level programming language designed for scientific, engineering, and business applications. It is one of the most feature-rich programming languages and one of the very first in the highly-feature-rich category. It has been used by various academic, commercial and industrial users since it was introduced in the early 1960s, and is still actively used today. It supports recursion and structured programming. The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats, with a wide set of functions available to verify and manipulate them.

== Early 4GL ==
* MARK IV - source level specified data extraction from existing files
* NATURAL - a language for extracting data from ADABAS files
* IBM RPG - a &quot;Report generator&quot; language that could also generate other types of applications

== Operating system 'wars' ==
When the PC was introduced, it needed an operating system. IBM approached a company named Digital Research, which was owned by Gary Kildall. IBM sought the use of Digital Research's CP/M, a popular operating system in earlier systems. (It was, in fact, the first operating system that wasn't hardware-specific.) IBM did not want to pay royalties, however, but sought a one time purchase, which included a rename. Digital Research refused, and IBM withdrew. They then approached Microsoft and Bill Gates, who purchased an existing operating system (Seattle Computer Company's 86-DOS) and renamed it MS-DOS. This name was later used on non-IBM models; Microsoft agreed to IBM's desire to use their own name, and the operating system was sold as PC-DOS on the PC.

86-DOS was modelled after CP/M, and Digital Research filed legal action for patent infringement. IBM settled by offering computer buyers a choice of either; however, CP/M-86 (as the PC version was named) cost almost $200 more than PC-DOS, and it did not sell well.

MS/PC-DOS quickly became the standard for the PC-compatible market. Digital Research would attempt to regain the market, eventually settling on an MS-DOS clone, DR-DOS. DR DOS was sold off the shelf (while MS/PC-DOS was only sold bundled with new computers), and would later gain a large market share with version 5, which had new memory management that broke down an early limitation of DOS, a maximum usable memory of 640 kB.

By this time, Microsoft was holding the market not only with MS-DOS, but Microsoft Windows, a graphical shell program for DOS. Windows was based on the Macintosh, and Apple filed suit. Complicating the matter was a suit against Apple by Xerox, claiming that ''Xerox'' was the rightful owner of the design. Eventually, it was ruled that the design factors in question could not be copyrighted, and Macintosh and Windows continued to coexist.

In 1995, Windows was re-worked to be a self contained operating system, Windows 95. By this time, DR-DOS had been sold twice, becoming Novell DOS 7, then Caldera DR-DOS 7. IBM had also split from Microsoft and was developing PC-DOS 6 separately. The new version of Windows that didn't coexist with DOS was ultimately the focus of an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft. Despite this, Microsoft was able to continue developing Windows.

Today, the market is dominated by the IBM PC-compatible computer, the majority of which run Microsoft Windows. Also present is an up-and-coming system, Linux, which is an [[open source]] system based on UNIX (an alternate PC-compatible system dating to the late 1970s; it was more complex and used for industrial, rather than home, use). On a separate platform, the Apple Macintosh also exists, running the newest Apple operating system, Mac OS X. Mac OS X is a combination of Mac OS 9 and the NextOS operating system that Steve Jobs second company Next Inc. created based on BSD Unix and the MACH kernel. Since it is based on Unix, Mac OS X is a much better operating system than previous Macintosh operating systems and helped save Apple from losing money as without it, it would not be able to compete against Linux, or modern Windows operating systems.

OS/2 was a joint project by IBM and Microsoft to create an Advanced DOS (ADOS was the code name, a replacement for MS-DOS that makes use of the 80286 and 80386 processors and breaks 8088/8086 limitations) OS/2 1.X was based on the MS-Windows GUI, but IBM and Microsoft broke off support of each other and IBM licensed the AmigaDOS/Workbench 1.3 code to create the Workplace GUI based on Workbench for OS/2 2.0 and stopped using the Windows 2.X shell and Commodore Amiga got the IBM REXX scripting language in exchange named AREXX (Amiga REXX) for AmigaDOS/Workbench 2.0 to have a scripting language. Microsoft took their OS/2 code and made Windows NT (codenamed MS-OS/2 3.0 but renamed Windows NT and NT stood for New technology) and Windows NT 3.1 Workstation and Server were invented by Microsoft. IBM improved OS/2 and named OS/2 3.0 as OS/2 Warp taking a Star Trek name and joked about &quot;Arrive in Chicago earlier than expected&quot; in that OS/2 Warp could do what Windows 95 code named Chicago could do but OS/2 Warp came out before Windows 95. Microsoft beat OS/2 Warp by using OEM agreements that each new PC would ship with Windows 95 and pay for a Windows 95 license even if the PC ran a different OS like OS/2 Warp, and shut IBM out of the PC market. IBM sold PS/2 and later VaulePoint and other systems like IBM Thinkpads with OS/2 Warp and then later OS/2 Merlin or OS/2 4.0. Eventually IBM gave up on OS/2 and migrated towards Linux, and licensed OS/2 to an OEM named Serenity Systems that made eComStation based on it, a more modern OS/2 based operating system. OS/2 was billed as &quot;A better DOS than DOS, and a better Windows than Windows&quot; because it ran MS-DOS programs in a Window, and used WIN-OS2 based on Windows 3.X to run 16 bit Windows programs. OS/2 also ran OS/2 command line and OS/2 GUI mode programs native as well. Some say OS/2's failure was that it ran DOS and Windows programs, so nobody wanted to make OS/2 native programs for it. Microsoft shut IBM out of the 32 bit Windows code and then OS/2 couldn't run Windows NT or Windows 95 software, until later when the ODIN project was based on the Linux WINE project to run some 32 bit Windows code. By that time it was too late and Microsoft Windows dominated OS/2.

=== Printer Spooling ===
* FIDO  - for IBM DOS, original author Simon Wheaton-Smith
* PATCHES - for IBM DOS and replaced FIDO, original author Simon Wheaton-Smith
* GRASP - for IBM DOS, original author Boyd Munro
* JES2  - for IBM MVS
* JES3  - for IBM MVS
* HASP  - for O.S. (MFT and MVT) was the fore runner of JES2
* ASP   - like HASP but supported attached processors, a fore runner of JES3

On the IBM 360, core memory was very limited, and as systems were rather slow, separating input and output from application programs became critical, and had to be transparent. The IBM offering was, for DOS systems, POWER, an unwieldy system that consumed a lot of resources. That created an opportunity for GRASP (designed by Boyd Munro, an Australian) and shortly after, FIDO (Fast Increase in Device Output) (designed by Simon Wheaton-Smith). FIDO and GRASP were very small, but with larger IBM systems, more options were needed. PATCHES (Powerful ATtached Checking on Enlarged Systems) used the SHADOW teleprocessing control program and replaced FIDO. FIDO and PATCHES, as well as SHADOW were named after the author's dogs.

=== Teleprocessing Systems ===
* BTAM - Basic telecommunications access method
* BATS - Basic additional teleprocessing system
* GENA - 
* FASTER - 
* TCAM - Telecommunications Access Method
* Qtam -
* CICS - Customer Information Control System
* SHADOW - Semi Heuristic Approach to Devices Online (woof), original author Simon Wheaton-Smith
* Intercom - 
* Browns Operating System -
* VTAM - Virtual Telecommunications Access Method

On the IBM 360, core memory was very limited. Using crt and vdu devices required very careful programming to conserve space. The IBM access method BTAM was very difficult to use when writing programs for multiple terminals. Hence the control programs sprung up. BATS was one such attempt. CICS was IBM's adopted system, however it was large and complex to use, albeit transaction oriented. SHADOW was conversational as opposed to transaction oriented, small, easy to use, and very reliable. When the IBM 370 came into fruition, memory was at less of a premium, and the basic access methods (BTAM) declined while the more advanced methods such as VTAM took over the role of not only BTAM, but also TCAM and QTAM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Seventh Seal== 

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.'''''
''Commentary:'' The seventh seal is the last of the seals that keep the content of the scroll hidden.  After this seal is broken, the entire content of the scroll is visible.  Like the previous three seals, it has to do with the wrath of God.  This seal is about the wrath of God in the form of seven trumpet judgments.  It is important that silence, which is not the usual sound pattern, does take place in heaven because it means that the angels and adorers of heaven are in continuous praise and worship of God's glory.  In the course of history the only event that could cause the silence of heaven is the wrath of God.  This wrath has been promised since the fall of man in the garden with Adam and Eve.  The story is starting to get exciting...it is just beginning.
This silence is something to take note of.  One explanation of the silence is that it is something like a devotional time, in which the heavenly multitude is in silent contemplation of the Divine presence. The length of silent time (1/2 an hour) may also be interpreted as a pregnant pause staged for dramatic effect, presumably to contrast the forthcoming sound of the trumpets.  The great events about to be ushered in during the &quot;final acts&quot; of this masterful performance may have brought forth the silence. Again, it's important to note that these attempted explanations are speculative statements.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw the seven angels which stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.'''''

''Commentary:'' This begins the second set of judgments.  Like the judgments released by the seals, the judgments of this set number seven, each revealed
by and angel blowing a trumpet. The trumpet is an instrument used to announce the presence of God and was also used it battle. It the follow verses, the trumpet blasts are to announce a coming judgment, and that the wrath of God was present. With this in mind, it is difficult to say whether or not the judgments of the seven trumpets are in addition to those of the seven seals, or if they are merely more detailed descriptions of the same judgments.  It is possible to read images like those of the four angels, bound by the Euphrates as separate or analogous figures to those of the four horsemen described in the judgments of the seals.  Also like the judgments of the seals, the judgments of the trumpets are not example of personal, punitive, or vengeful judgments, instead they are depicted as just occurrences designed to cause the rest of humanity to repent.  The first four judgments, which appear in chapter eight, are of a somewhat natural nature.  In these judgments both the church and non believers are affected.  In the final three of the seven judgments which are to come, believers, those who bear the mark of God, are set aside and spared those judgments  The first four angels sound their trumpets releasing the plagues

===Verses 3-4===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.''''' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.'''''

''Commentary:'' According to Witheringon III, this vision seems to harken back to the image of the priest in the Temple of Jerusalem. The priest would take hot coals from the sacrifice alter and light incense with them. The angel behaves in a similar manner.

The smoke of the incense is used as a metaphor for the prayers of God's people. The prayers were mixed with the incense and offered unto God. As incense is pleasing to the senses, so the prayers are pleasing to God. The alter of incense is before the Throne of God showing that the prayers are given directly to God. The prayers are cries of relief,vengeance, and retribution from the saints, and they lead to the final judgement, the seven Trumpets. It can be inferred from the text that these prayers are for.

===Verses 5-6===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared to sound.'''''

''Commentary:'' The same censer which carried the prayers of the faithful to the throne of God is now used to bring a reply.

The prayers of the saints, which have risen to heaven with the incense smoke lit at the time of prayer, and then mixed with the smoke of the prayers of the angels, is then answered by casting coals from the heavenly fire onto the earth. These manifest in thunder, lightening, and quakes. These prayers, then, are prayers for vengeance.

Regardless of which view one accepts on the chronology of this next set of judgments (after the seventh seal, a further description of the seventh seal, a repetition of the seals, etc.), this set of judgments teaches us more about John’s understanding of God’s justice.  First of all, here the church is not specifically judged; rather it is the whole earth.  However, and possibly most importantly, the church is not exempt from the first four judgments.The first four trumpets sound attacks upon earth's nature and also the cosmos. The following three blasts are directed toward the people on earth. This clearly negates some modern ideas that believers will be “raptured” (taken up into Heaven), thereby bypassing any suffering.  Christians are rewarded for faithfully enduring suffering, not for avoiding it.  Another point worth mentioning is that unlike the plagues of Egypt described in Exodus, there is no known possible natural explanation for these acts of judgment; they are undeniably supernatural/divine.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to not that what is important here is not knowing the exact chronological order of how this events may happen. It seems that John is more to present grotesque and terrifying images to the people into reading to turn away from idolatry and repent (Fiorenze, Revelation, 1991). Even more, the chronology is not the point and the series events described by John is an attempt to paint a picture of how grand and dramatic divine judgement will be.

==The First Four Trumpets==

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.'''''

''Commentary:'' The plagues are said to be controlled by the Two Witnesses to be used to defeat the Antichrist through the latter part of the Tribulation. The hail and fire may be an ancient vision of modern weapons, with the blood symbolizing the associated loss of life. The hail calls to mind an Egyptian plague from the days of Moses, but God ups the ante on this one with blood mixed in the ice. Witherington suggests it is impossible to associate this plague with any natural phenomena, but that it is a godly brimstone.

One should also note that one third is probably not literal.  Like other numbers in this book, it simply means a lot, specially more than the destruction caused by the seals.  One third also illustrates that the whole earth is not destroyed in this first round of judgments, more is to come.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verses 8-9===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the second angel sounded and, as it were, a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood,''''' &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and a third of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.'''''

''Commentary:'' The great mountain is most likely a Volcanic Eruption where the top of the mountain is blown off into the sea. This brings back images from Mt. Vesuvius in Italy which erupted near the coast causing a tidal wave which destroyed many boats.  The reference to the sea becoming blood is more-so a metaphor for the large amount of death and blood loss because of it.  However, this could also be a possible reference back to Exodus of the Red Sea which Moses crossed escaping Egypt.

&quot;A third of the sea became blood&quot; The destruction is focused solely on one-third of the salt water of the earth. Salt water becomes blood. This text can be taken literally if the story of Moses and the Nile becoming blood is taken literally as well.  As the Nile became blood for Moses, one-third of salt water will do the for this event. This naturally results in death for those creatures needing oxygen. Blood is the only element of a dead body which cannot be harvested.

===Verses 10-11 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven burning, as it were, like a lamp, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of waters.''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.'''''

''Commentary:'' Like the “great mountain” of the second trumpet, it appears to be a huge meteorite or comet, though it might also represent a nuclear weapon, which not only causes great destruction, but poisons the environment with radiation. This was most common after the Chernobyl disaster, since the word &quot;wormwood&quot; can be translated to be Chernobyl. Some even take it to be a portrayal of Satan's fall from Heaven. Wormwood is actually the name of an extremely bitter herb, and it may be that the name is used symbolically in reference to the bitter effect the event has. However, it should be noted that wormwood is not actually poisonous. This event of natural disaster continues the theme of devastation in the natural order. It has a gloomy tone and adds to the ever growing theme of perdition in Revelation.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun was smitten, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.'''''

''Commentary:'' Just as the seal judgments began with a group of four (the four horsemen), the trumpet judgments follow the same pattern, also beginning with a set of four. Each of the trumpets results in the destruction of a third of one particular aspect of earth’s life support system.
The imagery of the moon and stars falling and causing darkness in the world refers to the fact that there will be great calamity. This imagery may infer that the world in in darkness and gloom during this time of great disaster. It could also mean that a day becomes much shorter and the night much longer or that the lightness of the day becomes darker, almost clouded over in a sense.

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I looked, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, which are yet to sound.”'''''  

''Commentary:'' This verse shows an angel crying out “Woe” three times, once for each of the remaining trumpets.  This serves as an announcement of the impending judgment. Each woe is worse than any of the previous plagues released by the sounding of the initial four trumpets.

Although this translation states that it is an angel who cries out in warning, nearly every other translation of this verse maintains that it is an eagle who performs this action.  The Greek word at use here is the noun &quot;aetos,&quot; which generally translates as &quot;eagle.&quot;  However, Luke 17:37 translates this word as &quot;vulture.&quot; Some commentators have suggested that vulture would be more appropriate in this verse because the vulture is a bird of prey.  In light the human slaughter that has already occurred and that is soon follow, a carrion bird such as a vulture might be a better translation.

White has brought his minor piece into action and taken control of the middle. Simultaneously, he has put pressure on Black's e4 pawn, which Black must now try and defend. [[/3...Nf6|Nf6]] or [[/3...Bf5|Bf5]] would most commonly be used to defend the lone pawn, while [[/3...e5|e5]] gives the option of a pawn transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Fifth Trumpet ==  

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.'''''

''Commentary:''
It is commonly accepted that the star falling from this trumpet is actually some sort of being, because of the fact that it is given a key to open the abyss. Many believe that the star could actually be seen as Satan.  Part of the reason for viewing the fallen star as Satan can be found in the foreshadowing from Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12, &quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, you who have weakened the nations.&quot;   Ezekiel 28 is also thought to contain a similar reference.  It may also be relevant to note that in Revelation chapter 11 Satan is depicted as being thrown down to earth from heaven. The word for abyss would have brought to mind to the readers the original chaotic pre-creation waters in the beginning of Genesis.  It was here also that Leviathan, the great sea monster, was thought to live.  Although some might argue that the star being that opens this “Pandora’s Box” of torment is evil, John clearly tells us that it receives the key from Heaven.  Again, God is in control of the divine judgment.  This is not an evenly matched battle between Satan and God, but rather an attempt by God to dramatically call people to repent before the final judgment.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke rose out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.'''''

''Commentary:''
The bottomless pit is believed to be an abyss. The abyss is the place of residence of Satan and following demons, which are expected to deceive and destroy. The abyss is originally thought to be the flood that once covered the earth and that God confined. It is supposedly the place were evil creatures are kept, such as the sea monster Leviathan. This is a relevant theory considering what is to come out of the smoke, referring to the locusts in verse 3.It is also easy to think of the abyss as a place for the evil creatures and a great furnace for its' closeness to Hell and most peoples images of the underworld. The smoke from the furnace will not only cover and hide the sun's light but in a spiritual sense will hide the Light of God. 

The concept of an abyss wherein beasts and monsters and fallen angels are trapped is not unique to Revelation; it can be found in Isiah, Enoch, and Jubilee.

===Verses 3-6===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth, and to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power,''''' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and they were commanded to not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God in their foreheads.''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months, and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he strikes a man.''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And in those days people will seek death, but will not find it, and they will desire to die, but death will flee from them.'''''

''Commentary:'' These locusts have been interpreted in different ways. Some say that they are demons, others that they symbolize a huge army.The enemies of the Church of Christ are often noted to be locusts. This is because they come in large numbers and because they have the capability to be very destructive. Regardless, they only have authority to hurt those &quot;who have not the seal of God in their foreheads.” In 14:1, the 144,000 are described as having God's name &quot;written on their foreheads,&quot; and 22:4 says that God’s servants &quot;shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.&quot; These are among several figures of speech used in Revelation which appear to refer to the same thing: having the &quot;seal of God&quot; on their foreheads; having the &quot;Father's name&quot; on their foreheads; having access to the &quot;hidden manna&quot;; etc. For more on this fascinating topic, see the commentary on 3:12  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_3#Verse_12].

===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.'''''

''Commentary:''
A theory exists that the images that John describes as locusts are actually military helicopters. Because of the time of authorship, John would not have had the vocabulary to adequately denote what he was seeing, the theory suggests. However, this theory should certainly be taken with a grain of salt. While it is true that that John would not have possessed the language to describe helicopters, there is otherwise extremely little to suggest that these could be helicopters. For example, this description uses anthropomorphic  language, which indicates that these locusts resemble humans in some way. If it is a helicopter, then what are the crowns, faces, hair, and teeth? Perhaps, the teeth of lions shows the sharpness and ability to shred and break things into pieces, exhibiting the great power behind the &quot;locusts.&quot;Furthermore, the book of Revelation is packed full of bizarre imagery which leaves countless readers perplexed. It may be the natural tendency to thrust meaning upon the more obscure passages, but these claims should be examined carefully.

===Verses 9-10===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they had breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots and horses running to battle.''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they had tails like scorpions and there were stings in their tails, and their power was to hurt mankind five months.'''''

''Commentary:'' The breastplates of iron is referring to the animal like characteristics like horses equipped for battle, mentioned in verse 7.  The sound of these locusts is to show the tremendous number and power they hold.  The very purpose of these creature is to bother, harass, and terrorize mankind.  The tails of these insects is also to show the power, authority, and terror that these creatures are have over man.  This passage is similar to the plague of locusts in Egypt in Exodus 10:1-18.  This verse also can remind the reader of the full armor of God in Paul's letter to Ephesus in Ephesians 6:13-14.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they had a king over them who is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue is Apollyon.'''''

''Commentary:'' This verse figures a very interesting character, who is portrayed in several different ways.  First and foremost, he is a celestrial figure who is given charge of the locusts who plague humanity.  While this may appear to make Abaddon/Apollyon a malevolent figure, it is important to remember that God has given Abaddon this appointment as part of the judgments intended to cause humanity to repent.  The name Abaddon is Hebrew for destroyer or an idea likened to the Greco-Roman idea of Hades, and Apollyon has ssimiliar connotations, but, according to Witherington, also can be connected with the Greek God, Apollo, whose symbol was the locust, and after whom Emperor Domitian styled himself as.  

In extra-canonical texts, Abaddon has been identified as the angel of death, but there are still other who argue that Abaddon is Satan or the anti-Christ.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''One woe is past. Behold, there come two woes more hereafter.'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse is simply saying that the fifth trumpet has sounded and sent devastation to the disbelievers on earth. There will be two more to come to come from the sixth and seventh trumpet blasts. This is also an indication that chronology and sequence is important to correctly understand the book of Revelation.

==The Sixth Trumpet ==

===Verses 13-14===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice, from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, “Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The Euphrates River begins in eastern Turkey, then flows through Syria and Iraq to the Persian Gulf. The location of the Garden of Eden was said to be at the junction of the Euphrates with the Tigris, just north of the Persian Gulf.
The voice is coming from the trumpets. These trumpets are in praise of God, from  the altar of God. God responds to the sixth angel, who has the trumpet. There is a difficulty in this verse, however, because we can't be sure who the four angels are. There were the angels mentioned in verse 7:1, but these are bound, indicating a different set of angels. 

Witherington supposes an importance for the location of the Euphrates as a dividing line of civilization. Wicked hordes lived beyond the river -- the oppressing Babylonians and Assyrians, in Jewish histories; and the Parthian hordes in the contemporary Roman era.

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year to slay a third of mankind.'''''

''Commentary:'' It is suggestive that the time frame is symbolic to mean that these four angels were in a constant preparative state and could inflict pain, pestilence, and kill those in which they were assigned to slay. Some scholars, however, believe that the time specificity are divisions representative of prophetical periods. Some believe that this means that one third of mankind will be slain. These four angels are &quot;demons of death&quot; that are released to kill mankind.  This also clearly indicates the predetermined will of God and that He had a specific purpose in mind for these angels and now their time has come.

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred million, and I heard the number of them.'''''

''Commentary:''
It may be that the large number is just to give the reader a picture of  the vastness of the approaching multitude of horsemen and that all the soldiers were employed to fight in this battle. The battle refers to the battle of all the countries. It is possible that the attacking horsemen outnumbered the entire Middle Eastern population at the time of writing.  Some conspiracy theorists believe that this number today could be seen as the Chinese who claim to have a standing army of 200 million.  However, this is just speculation to try and tie the apocalypse to modern times.

===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone, and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.'''''

''Commentary:'' &quot;Out of their mouths issued fire and brimstone&quot;: It is an interesting description, considering that at the time of writing, armies fought with swords and clubs. It is interesting to note the primary color vibrancy of red, blue, and yellow; the first being the color of fire, the second of jacinth, and the third of sulphur. The fire and smoke issued forth from their mouths may be a figurative expression employed to demonstrate the power of destruction, fierceness, and mighty force or it may be a representative statement of the use of gunpowder.

Witherington writes that the feared Parthian horsemen rode horses with brightly colored breastplates, and links this verse with descriptions of Parthians in Horace and Martial.

===Verses 18-19===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''By these three a third of mankind was killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the brimstone which issued out of their mouths,''''' &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for their power was in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails were like serpents, and had heads, and with them they do harm.''''' 

''Commentary:''

Witherington finds meaning in the image of horses with biting tails in descriptions of mounted Partian archery whereby the riders could shoot arrows facing forward or back. 

The fire, smoke, and brimstone appear to be a form of plague, according to John.

===Verses 20-21===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk,''''' &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.'''''

''Commentary:'' This verse suggests that the fundamental purpose of these judgments, specifically the trumpets, is to provoke repentance.  Even though those without the seal of God are subjected to these horrific woes, they continue in their sinful ways.  Most commentaries conclude that humanity actually becomes even more hardened in their wicked ways after these judgments.  The Greek word &quot;pharmakon&quot; is translated here as &quot;sorceries.&quot;  This likely refers to use the of magical spells, charms, and potions in order to achieve some end.  This verse has striking similarities to the story of Pharaoh in Exodus.  Just like humanity maintains their wicked ways after the trumpets, Pharaoh maintains his hardened heart even after the plagues.

Besides the Intuition type requesters, there are the Asl.library requesters that have built in requesters for 
* File Open/Save 
* Font  
* Public Screen selection 
* etc

You need to use AllocAslRequestTags to set up an ASL requester, the reqType can be ASL_FileRequest, ASL_FontRequest or ASL_ScreenModeRequest, you can then optional specify parameters for the ASL requester here or in the AslRequest function such as size of requester, title text, initial file, drawer and file pattern, font information or initial screen information as defined in libraries/asl_intern.h header file.



&lt;pre&gt;
/* Internal requester structure */
struct IntReq
{
    UWORD		ir_ReqType;
    struct Window	*ir_Window;
    struct Screen	*ir_Screen;
    STRPTR		ir_PubScreenName;
    struct Hook 	*ir_IntuiMsgFunc;
    struct TextAttr	*ir_TextAttr;
    struct Locale	*ir_Locale;
    struct Catalog  	*ir_Catalog;
    APTR		ir_MemPool;
    ULONG		ir_MemPoolPuddle;  	/* if 0, no pool is created */
    ULONG		ir_MemPoolThresh;
    LONG    	    	ir_TitleID;
    STRPTR		ir_TitleText;
    STRPTR		ir_PositiveText;
    STRPTR		ir_NegativeText;
    WORD		ir_LeftEdge;
    WORD		ir_TopEdge;
    WORD		ir_Width;
    WORD		ir_Height;
    UBYTE		ir_Flags;

    APTR		ir_BasePtr;	/* Compatability: Saved copy of REG_A4 */
};
&lt;/pre&gt;


The AllocAslRequster will return a pointer and can be a pointer to a FileRequester, FontRequester or ScreenModeRequester structure (these are read only). Once a structure is set up, you can call the AslRequest function to display the requester and retrieve data from the structure afterwards such as Filename, Font or ScreenMode for use in your program. Once you have finished with the requester structure, you should call FreeAslRequest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Angel with the Little Book== 

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.'''''

''Commentary:''  The description of this angel in particular in interesting because it draws on images from several other places.  Firstly, the cloud image quite possibly refers to the dream-like quality of John's revelation.  The rainbow part of the description refers back to God's covenant with Noah.  By using this symbol, John is emphasizing the fact that the goal of the plagues and judgments is to cause people to repent and come back to God.  John's reference to the face like the sun, hearkens back to the way in which John described Jesus at the beginning of the Book of Revelation.  The legs life pillars of fire evoke imagery of the pillar of fire that led the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness. So far 2 angelic beings are marked as mighty or strong. The first angel identified as mighty appears in Revelation 5:2. There may be some significance or distinguishing mark about &quot;mighty angels&quot; versus John just using the term angel. In Revelation 5, the angel is a revelatory angel that acts as a messenger between God and man, carry critical information to pass on. This also poses the question of whether or not there is some sort of hierarchical system among the angels in Heaven.  There has also been some suggestion that the mighty angel is in fact Christ, however there seems to be no good reason why the author would then identify the figure as an angle instead of Christ.  The imagery of the angel complete with rainbow, a face like the sun, and legs which were as pillars of fire seems to suggest that this figure is a positive one rather in contrast with the graphic descriptions of other figures in Revelation which bring death.

The rainbow image associated with the avenging angel can be interpreted as an allusion to an older apocalyptic act by a vengeful god -- the rainbow was the symbol of the covenant between god and Noah. Witherington imagines that this then, is a sign of hope of salvation for a godfearing few.

===Verses 2-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars, and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.'''''

''Commentary:''

The fact that the angel is on both land and sea shows that this message is for everyone in heaven, on earth, and hell. It also shows that both land and sea are under the authority of this mighty angel. This open book can be contrasted to the scroll mentioned in Revelation 5, as this book is opened and exposed, revealing things to come to John.It speaks of the coming of Christ, the millennium kingdom, the heavens, and the final judgement. It is also interesting that this little book, or scroll, is already opened, as opposed to the previous scrolls that had all been sealed. The idea of the open book suggest that there is no secret hidden inside to reveal. The cry with a loud voice is a term that is mentioned multiple times in the book of Revelation and may be a typical oratorical communication used to convey critical messages by the heavenly beings.
The planting of feet on the sea and dry land shows that Jesus has authority over all of the earth. This also shows that he inherets the earth as being Messiah.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.”'''''

''Commentary:''

The Lord showed John a glimpse of what the end of time would bring. As John is getting ready to write about this, the Lord tells him to not write a thing. Many have said that John was shown a vision that no one else was as a means to comfort John during troubled times. Therefore, showing him a glimpse of what will happen on Judgement day gave John some relief.

This passage is especially interesting since John is instructed to not write something down, which seems counter to the rest of the book. This shows that his purpose was not, in fact, to write down everything, but only to write down what he was directed to. This makes his purpose, and the purpose of the book, much more specific. It is not meant to be all encompassing, but instead it only conveys very specific information. In other words, the book is intended to be incomplete, instead of a full record of what will come. It is not for John, or his audience to know everything.

As a syntactical point, this is first instance in the text in which the author indicates that he is recording all of these things. The voice is an example that John is to only record what he is instructed, and not what he is experiencing. Within the frame of the narrative John displays, it is now shown that these events transpire, and John records them journalistically. It is still uncertain if these images are poetic, prophetic, allusions to the past or present, or any of the other varieties of interpretations.

===Verses 5-7===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and swore by him that lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be time no longer,''''' &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he will begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets.'''''

''Commentary:''  In this translation, the mighty angel proclaims, &quot;there should be time no longer.&quot;  As many commentaries suggest, this phrase with the Greek word &quot;chronos&quot; (generally translated as &quot;time&quot;) should not be interpreted literally.  In other words, time will continue to exist; it will not fold or dissolve into eternity.  Instead, this proclamation can be understood as an answer to the question posed by saints under the altar in Revelation 6:10.  They essentially ask, &quot;How much longer until God's judgment is carried out?&quot;  Here we see the mighty angel responding to that cry.  Other translations suggest that the angel announces, &quot;There will be no more delay.&quot;  This seems to indicate that the sounding of the seventh trumpet is imminent.  The mystery of God refers to all that has previously been revealed and is leading up to the end. Some believe that he is referring to &quot;mystery of God&quot; because man is uncertain and unable to tell what God will do next.

The confusion that may have occurred at the beginning of the chapter about who the &quot;strong angel&quot; is has now been cleared up. Although there are parallels that can be drawn between the &quot;strong angel&quot; and Jesus Christ, this passage clears that blurry line up. The angel being Jesus is really limited when John states &quot;and the angel;&quot; while it is indeed a unique angel, it is most certainly not Jesus Christ.

==John Eats the Little Book==

===Verses 8-10===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again, and said, “Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I went to the angel and said to him, “Give me the little book.” And he said to me, “Take it and eat it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be sweet as honey in your mouth.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but as soon as I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.'''''

''Commentary:'' The &quot;little book&quot; or little scroll, is mentioned earlier in the chapter. There are many interpretations of the angel's stance. The angel's dominion may be over land and the sea, this expression could be used to show that the message is applicable to everyone, or the angel may truly be a mighty or large angel. The phrase &quot;Take it and eat it&quot; is a parallel to the verses found in Ezekiel 2 &amp; 3 (vv 8-3:3) in which a man is also given a scroll and is instructed to eat it, the taste of which he describes as sweet as honey. The reasoning behind eating the book and the significance of the bitter feeling, but sweet taste is widely debated and merely speculatively interpreted. Some believe the bitter coupled with sweetness demonstrates the grievous feelings that John would experience with the revelation of the impending destruction and state of the world intermingled with sweet or future hopeful events for the righteous. Ezekiel was instructed, almost 700 years earlier, to eat the scroll and deliver the message to the people of Israel, so John is most likely intended to deliver the message also. He was most likely intended to deliver the second half of the tribulation because chapter ten takes place just before the second half. 

C. Koestler has speculated that this little scroll is an overture to the bloody denouement of Revelation, serving as John's further prophesies. John here sheds his role of observer and becomes an actor. That the scroll is initially sweet and ultimately bitter suggests a final hopelessness and discomfort that is contradicted elsewhere in the book. This image seems to undermine the central concern of Revelation -- that though god's judgement is violent and fearful, it is a required step toward salvation.

The idea of eating scrolls or other sacred scripture is found elsewhere in the Bible. In the ancient Hebrew context there was not a separation between the physical and the spiritual like we have in modern times. For example, the same word for heart was used to describe their ancient conception of the abstract concept of the mind and at the same time for what we know now to be a cardiac muscle. So when the writer says to &quot;eat&quot; the scripture he is more or less saying to read it, memorize it, and to absorb it. In general, the symbolism is meant to give the reader an idea of how important what is written on the scrolls is.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he said to me, “You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.”'''''

''Commentary:''  This is a contrasting statement to John being told earlier that he should not write something down.  It also exemplifies that John is not seeing these visions to record everything he senses, but more-so to write down what God has specifically told him in order to get a certain point across.  This also adds to the idea that this work is incomplete and not an exact chronology of what the apocalypse is supposed to entail.

The term &quot;must&quot; is the closest translation to the Greek verb for divine necessity.  John has no other choice because this is God’s implicit will.  John is called to be a prophet by God, he is expected to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the message of God.  The term before is from the Greek word epi, meaning against.

The next 10 chapters is focused on the wrath of God and the fulfillment of His promise, bringing justice, and God’s judgment of his people. 

The Last part of this verse “many peoples and nations and tongues and kings”  defines the audience of Johns prophecy, it is a list of four ethnic groups, it is the third time of seven times that it is mentioned in the book of Revelation. (Fun fact: never in these 7 times is the order of the nations, tongues, kings, and peoples in the same order.  Perhaps this shows that John focused on universality, or is just a fluke)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Two Witnesses== 

===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there was given me a reed like a rod, and the angel stood, saying, “Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship therein,''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''but the court which is outside the temple leave out, and measure it not, for it is given to the Gentiles, and they will tread the holy city under foot forty-two months.”'''''

''Commentary:'' 

&quot;...forty-two months&quot; (3½ years or 1,260 days), see note on 13:5 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_13#Verses_4-6]. It defines the length of time that the &quot;holy city&quot; will undergo hardship. This time frame is also observed in Daniel 12:11. 

This passage may have its roots in Ezekiel 40-48, in which measuring also plays a very important role. However, this passage is not just a commentary, reference, or play on those chapters of Ezekiel. It likely deals with the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem. Whether or not it is about the past or the future depends on what date the Book of Revelation was written, which of course cannot fully be ascertained. Passages such as these support a date after 70 A.D., since they seem to describe the destruction of the temple.

Significance of measuring:	

        1) Necessary before rebuilding and restoring – This would make sense after the destruction of the temple in 70AD.  On the other hand, why would John want to prepare to rebuild the old temple when a new earth is being created?

	2) Assessed for destruction – This would make sense only in the unlikely event that this book was written prior to 70AD.  

	3) Setting aside some parts to be protected – This does not fit well with the idea that all are subject to the divine judgments before this portion in the book. The theme includes the notion that everyone, including Christians, will suffer to some degree.

	4) Protection from spiritual harm – If the temple here does not signify the physical building but rather the group worshipping, this could refer to keeping believers spiritually safe. The temple is symbolic of all God's followers, not only a structure to worship in. This metaphorical interpretation is consistent with 3:12 and 13:6.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The measuring rod has a connection to Ezekiel 40:3:

&quot;He took me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway&quot; (KJV).

&quot;Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship therein&quot; is an explanatory command of what John is supposed to measure on earth. He is supposed to measure the temple, the altar (which is located in the holy place), and &quot;those who worship therein&quot; = the counting of prients worshipping near the altar.
----

 John is to proceed to measure the altar. Since the altar of incense is located in the holy place, which is part of the building that houses the holy of holies, this altar is more than likely the altar of burnt offerings. It (in the Herodian temple) was located in the court of the priests, which is the next area one sees when leaving the building that houses the holy of holies.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy 1,260 days clothed in sackcloth.”'''''

''Commentary:'' While the two witnesses are unnamed, some commentaries have suggested some possible identities.  Two of these interpretations include Enoch (Genesis 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:1-11) or Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15, 18) and Elijah.  Even though John does not explain who these witnesses are,  he does bring the reader's attention to their attire.  They are said to be wearing sackcloth. This gives the reader a clue of the prophecies will entail. Attire made of sackcloth is usually indicative of a state of mourning (rf. Gen. 37:34).  For they were faithful teachers of the Lord despite their trials. All who despise these witnesses and the teachers of the Lord will experience eternal death in hell rather than eternal life in Heaven. This chapter of Revelation gives hope to Christians, that even during times when the antichristians try to take over, there will be some holding firm to their ground (the witnesses)

The 1,260 days (3½ years) in this verse appears to be the same time period as the forty-two months of the preceding verse.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The olive trees reveal yet one more clue about the identity of the two witnesses.  It is also a reference to Zechariah 4:14’s mentioning of the two anointed witnesses standing by the Lord of the entire earth.  However, the iditity of the two witnesses is not revealed completely.  Quite possibly, John recognized these witnesses as prophetic characters but did not know or did not have the ability to know their names, identity and character.  The two candlesticks, or lampstands is this verse’s second clue about the identity of the two witnesses.  It refers to Zechariah 4:11-13. 

Zechariah 4:11-14, Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?”  And I answered the second time and said to him, “What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?”  So he answered me, saying, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.”

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And if anyone hurts them, fire proceeds out of their mouths and devours their enemies, and if anyone hurts them, he must in this manner be killed.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Those that would try to harm them are identified at the enemies of the two witnesses. Whether or not the fire is literal or symbolic has often been debated. It may be that the fire which will proceed forth from their mouths is the Word of God. God's word has been previously compared or associated with fire in the Bible as evidenced by Jeremiah 23:29 and Ps. 119:105. It could very well be literal fire, as John describes the fire devouring the enemies and &quot;killing&quot; them.

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“These have power to shut heaven, so that it does not rain in the days of their prophecy, and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.”'''''

''Commentary:''
It is important to note that these two witness have been given to authority to induce plagues. Verse 6 seems to indicate that these plagues include, though are not explicitly restricted to, natural phenomenon. It has been suggested that the two witness are or at least allude to Moses and Elijah.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, and will overcome them, and kill them.”'''''

''Commentary:''
&quot;And when they have finished their testimony&quot; refers back to the 1260 days, or three and a half years, in Revelation 11:3. Because of these witnesses, many people will come to Jesus Christ because they were openly giving their testimony. 
&quot;The beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit&quot; refers back to the fourth scroll and the beasts that are introduced there. It is very important to John that readers understand how dangerous and bad the beasts are. While it may be hard to fathom, the beast here is not an animal, but a kingdom, or man, of course this may be figurative language that will tempt the people a final time before the judgement.
&quot;Will make war against them&quot; is interesting because war is not typically thought of as one against two, but the power of the two witnesses is greater than that of the beast's armies. Therefore, the beast has to use every possible way to defeat the witnesses.
&quot;And will overcome them, and kill them&quot; is the result of three and a half years of desiring this outcome. Having tormented the people without mercy, permission is possibly granted the beast to kill the witnesses. Satan is in the body of the Beast, or AntiChrist, and will kill them at the midpoint of the 7-year period. 

Modern readers may associate the &quot;bottomless pit&quot; with Hell. This would be an error since the ancient Hebrew conception of the universe did not have a modern perception of a fiery hell deep in the earth. Although, there are elements in Revelation where hell begins to enter the picture, the ancient Hebrew conception would have been one that had Sheol directly underneath the earth and then under Sheol was the 'great deep'. Sheol is unlike hell because both the righteous and the unrighteous are sent after they die there to wait for the resurrection of the dead. Sheol might be translated 'the pit', the 'great abyss', or the 'grave' leading us to believe that the bottomless pit described here is not hell in a modern conception but a dark, slimy, pit, where both the righteous and unrighteous awaited the end times. 


===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.”'''''

''Commentary:''

Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem, which makes Sodom and Egypt a dysphemism for Jerusalem. The two witnesses will serve, as Christ did, as a public display for all to see. In other words, Jerusalem is a place of slavery, oppression, and immorality. Witherington postulates without citation that John may have seen pilgrims to Jerusalem somehow corrupted by the city.



===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the people, kindreds, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves.”'''''

''Commentary:''

An unburied body was considered a soul's worst fate - the body becoming not animated life but meat - in the levantine tradition, as seen in Isiah 5.25 and Psalms 2.30.

For three and a half days the world will be celebrating the deaths of the witnesses because through their deaths, the judgments from Heaven fell onto the Earth. 

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And they that dwell upon the earth will rejoice over them, and make merry, and will send gifts one to another, because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Those that have survived the opening of the seals and the judgement will rejoice because they have overcome the trials and tribulations. They will also rejoice by sending gifts to one another. The two prophets that came were a torment to those who lived sinful lives on earth and were blamed for the problems that the sin had caused on the Earth. 

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them which saw them.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This could be referring to the first resurrection of martyrs, which we learn more Chapter 20.
Just as Jesus rose from the dead after 3 days, these two prophets receive eternal life from the Holy Spirit. And, just like Jesus, their bodies will be raised after 3 days. This will be a rude awakening for the world because everyone will think that they are dead, but they will live after 3 days.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, ‘Come up hither.’ And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The ascension of the two witnesses into heaven mirrors the story of Elijah being caught up into heaven in 2 Kings 2:11.
By including the detail that the enemies of the witnesses watch the ascension, the author of the Book of Revelation is reiterating a point found repeatedly in the text: Evil does not really conquer Good, it wins temporary victories that further God's plans for the world.  While it is true that the forces of the beast are able to overcome and kill God's two witnesses, the enemies of the witnesses, those who refuse to believe and worship God, are themselves witnesses to God's power and ability to grant a life beyond death for faith and loyalty.

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the same hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell, and in the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the remainder were afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.”'''''

''Commentary:''

The death of seven thousand can be interpreted as a reversal of the events in 1 Kings 19.18, when god promises Elisha that seven thousand godfearing Israelites will be spared a vengeful death, while the rest will be killed as punishment for praying to Baal. Combined with the knowledge that only a tenth of the city is demolished while the rest are saved, the fate of Jerusalem, at least in this verse, is a relatively tame one.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.”'''''

''Commentary:''

The promise of a third woe is not answered in chapter 11. Instead, this ominous setup leads into a hymn of praise.

==The Seventh Trumpet==

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This is signifying that after the seventh trumpet (God's complete number and presumably the last of God's plagues on the earth) and in the end of all things, the Lord and Christ will reign over the earthly kingdom and make it his own.  The voices in heaven can be seen as rejoicing because they have been waiting for this day for quite some time.

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying, “We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, and was, and is to come, because you have taken to yourself your great power, and have reigned.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Notice in this verse that God has become of reality, he is no longer &quot;was, is, and is to come&quot;.

===Verse 18===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should reward your servants the prophets, and the saints, and those who fear your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.'''''

''Commentary:''
This is basically describing the scene that has just happened.  Because of God's wrath, the people and non-believers of the world became angry at him, but since most of them have died, they are all going to be judged.  At the same time, God is rewarding all the believers of the world with everlasting life in heaven.  The last phrase is just reiterating the fact that God is punishing the sinners of the world particularly those who were a force of destruction in the world.

===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple, and there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.'''''

''Commentary:'' The ark of the covenant, which according to the Torah was used to house the original stones upon which God wrote the Ten Commandments, symbolizes law and judgment.  Before the destruction of the temple in 70 CE the ark of the covenant was housed in the holiest of holies which was the innermost chamber of the temple which only the high priest was allowed to enter.  After the destruction of the temple the ark became lost, something which would have been of great concern to Jews and some Christians.  The fact that the ark is described in being in the heavenly temple instead of the earthly one might be an indication that the date of Revelation is after the destruction of the temple. This is the time of God’s judgment upon the Earth. Like the seventh seal, the seventh trumpet is not an end, but a new beginning. When it is sounded, yet another series of seven catastrophic judgments begins. These are the seven bowls which are poured out on the earth by seven angels coming out of the heavenly temple. But before the bowls are poured out, John is shown several things which further shed light on the events of the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Minimal Styling Rules ==

There are probably two basic kinds of layout that people might want:

(1) '''Inline Forms''' All Xform controls &quot;flowing&quot; into the page and moving to the next line when there isn't enough room for the control to fit on the end of the current line;

(2) '''Block Forms''' All XForm controls appearing each on a separate line down the page and aligned vertically.

By 'XForm controls' we mean the 'label', the 'value' and the associated 'icons' (help, valid/invalid). For both of the above cases we want all of the parts of the control to stay on the same line, a label shouldn't be separated from its value. So, in the first case &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; of the parts should move down to the next line if there isn't enough space.

Each xform control is converted to something like the following HTML structure via the XSLTForms stylesheet

span.xforms-control&lt;br/&gt;
|_span&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_span&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_span&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_span&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_label&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_span.value&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|_input&lt;br/&gt;

By default a span will have no 'display' function so by adding styling to the span elements created by XSLTForms we can achieve what we want.

So for minimal styling rules, firstly to get everything within an Xform control to stay together we can use the following CSS rule:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''span.xforms-control span {display:inline-block; white-space:nowrap; }''

Using 'white-space:nowrap' seems to be enough on most browsers but adding 'display:inline-block' seems to force the nowrap behaviour.

Then to make the control label appear to 'belong' to the control value we can set the width of the label and make it display as an inline-block as well:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''label.xforms-label { display:inline-block; width:300px; text-align:right; margin-right:4px;}''

The above two selectors seem to achieve the flow layout that you'd expect as default with HTML but also makes each XForm control behave as an atomic unit.

To get the second tabular layout is simply a matter of forcing each control to appear on a new line as follows:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''span.xforms-control {display:block;}''

The fact that we have made each label one standard width means that the values will align nicely.

However, if you don't want xform trigger buttons to behave the same way as other controls then instead you have to be more specific in your display:block selector, something like:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''span.xforms-input, span.xforms-select1, span.xforms-textarea, span.xforms-output {display:block;}''

== XSLTForms classes for XForms pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes ==

The CSS XForms pseudo-element and pseudo-class selectors are not implemented in XSLTForms; instead, XSLTForms generates elements carrying equivalent classes that can be selected by CSS rules.  

For example, instead of

 /* Color current item yellow. */
 ::repeat-index {background-color: yellow;}
 
 /* Within an invalid control, color the input field pink. */
 :invalid ::value {background-color: pink;}

write

 /* Color current item yellow. */
 .xforms-repeat-item-selected {background-color: yellow;} 
 
 /* Within an invalid control, color the input field pink. */
 .xforms-invalid .xforms-value {background-color: pink;}

{| border=1
  |+ Pseudo-elements defined by XForms
|-
  ! CSS
  ! Equivalent XSLTForms class values
|-
  | ::value
  | .xforms-value

|-
  | ::repeat-item
  | .xforms-repeat-item

|-
  | ::repeat-index
  | .xforms-repeat-item-selected

|}


{| border=1
  |+ Pseudo-classes defined by XForms
|-
  ! CSS
  ! Equivalent XSLTForms class values

|-
  | :enabled &amp; :disabled
  | .xforms-enabled
.xforms-disabled

|-
  | :required &amp; :optional
  | .xforms-required .xforms-optional

|-
  | :valid &amp; :invalid
  | .xforms-valid .xforms-invalid

|-
  | :read-only &amp; :read-write
  | .xforms-readonly .xforms-readwrite

|-
  | :out-of-range &amp; :in-range
  | (Not implemented)

|-
  | :value-empty &amp; :value-non-empty
  | (Not implemented)

|}


It helps to be clear about the nesting relations here.  The pseudo-properties &lt;code&gt;:valid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:invalid&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are assigned to controls; the pseudo-element &lt;code&gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; is a child of the control, not the control itself.  So neither the CSS selector &lt;code&gt;::value:invalid&lt;/code&gt; nor the equivalent selector using the equivalent XSLTForms classes, &lt;code&gt;.xforms-value.xforms-invalid&lt;/code&gt; will select anything:  the &lt;code&gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-element doesn't have the &lt;code&gt;:invalid&lt;/code&gt; class.  Instead, the pseudo-element is ''inside'' an element with that class.  (Theoretically, XForms says the &lt;code&gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-element is a child of the control; in practice, for practical reasons XSLTForms makes it a descendant, not a child.)

In case of doubt, careful study of the HTML generated by XSLTForms can help a form author understand how to write CSS selectors that select the intended elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Woman Clothed with the Sun== 

The source of the story below of the woman, her baby, and the dragon is clearly rooted in pagan mythology.  Almost universally ancient cultures of this region contained stories of a woman giving birth to a son who would fight dragon that had either disposed or killed the ruling god.  Greece had Leto, Apollo, and Python; Babylonia had Marduk and Tiamat; in Egypt there were Isis, Horus, and Typhon.  The striking similarities with all these stories show that John was intentionally drawing on this material and one may assume that his original audience knew this.  John uses these myths to teach about Christ.  Christ becomes the fulfillment of accepted universal truths, the archetype of all myths.  This chapter also undermines Domitian’s claim that he was the incarnation of Apollo, i.e., the fulfillment of the myth.  Christ alone has the power to triumph and therefore he alone is worthy of our praise and worship.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge press, 2003.  &lt;/ref&gt;  
===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there appeared a great wonder in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.'''''

''Commentary:'' Many have speculated as to the identity of this women, but her precise identity is unknown because John does not name her.  Many scholars have understood the woman to be a symbolic representation of Israel, from whom the messiah is born (see v. 5).  Others, particularly the Roman Catholic scholars, have suggested that the woman is actually Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. The problem with thinking of the woman as Mary is that in versus 17 we will hear &quot;...the rest of her offspring...&quot; Still others propose that the woman represents the Church. The woman symbolizing the church would be a logical guess if &quot;the rest of her offspring&quot; is referring to believers.  The sun with which she is clothed could represent God, while the moon could represent the people of God.  The twelve stars may refer to the twelve tribes of Israel or the constellations (more specifically, the 12 signs of the zodiac). It is interesting to note that numerous elements of her description are characteristic of several ancient goddesses.The woman could be a symbol for the destiny of the whole world, if you conclude the notion that star's control our fate.

The Greek word &quot;ouranos&quot; is translated here as &quot;heaven,&quot; but it can also be understood as &quot;sky.&quot;  Scholars have debated as to which interpretation is more fitting.

===Verse 2 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And she being with child cried out, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.'''''

''Commentary:''  If the woman represents Israel, the child represents the Church, which was the offspring of Israel. (This will become clearer as the chapter progresses.) Christianity began as a Jewish sect until it came of age, so to speak, and established itself as a separate religion, as described in the Book of ''Acts''. There are a number of other passages in Revelation that describe or refer to the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, which was in many ways still emerging. For example, in Revelation 7 there are the 144,000 that come from the twelve tribes of Israel that are joined by an innumerable multitude, which symbolizes Christianity  being extended out beyond Judaism, which is an exclusive religion. That Christianity is shown here as the child of Judaism shows that although Christianity was coming into its independence, it still felt a very strong connection to Judaism. In fact, at the time of the writing of Revelation, many Christians of Jewish origin would still think of themselves as Jewish, not Christian. That distinction did not occur immediately, but happened over the first hundred years of Christianity.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there appeared another wonder in heaven: a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.'''''

''Commentary:'' The &quot;dragon&quot; is identified in Verse 9 as Satan. The dragon, the beast from the sea of chapter 13 (generally identified with the Antichrist), and the Babylon of chapter 17 are all described as having seven heads and ten horns, which implies that the three are connected. It may be that Satan is the spiritual driving force, the Antichrist is the emperor, and Babylon is the political-religious empire over which he has power.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And his tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth to devour her child as soon as it was born.'''''

''Commentary:'' The tail drawing 1/3 of the stars of heaven demonstrates the supernatural power of the dragon. &quot;A third of the stars of heaven&quot; may be those angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. Having been expelled from heaven, they have made their home on Earth. The dragon (Satan) stands before the woman who is giving birth (Israel) to destroy her child (the Church). As the Church was going through the stages of birth and growth on its way to eventual independence from its mother (Israel), the forces of evil sought to destroy it, as recorded in the Gospels and Acts. The reason to kill this child is not stated. Why is he waiting until the child is given life on earth? Why does the dragon just want the child?
There is a parallel with Herod the Great's attempt to destroy Christ at his coming by having all the infants of Bethlehem slaughtered (Mt 2). Perhaps this is alluding to the dragon (Satan) seeking to destroy the seed of the women who will eventually destroy him (Gen 3: 15 &amp; Rom. 16:20).The dragon in chapter 12 represents the devil. In verse 4 the dragon is waiting for the woman (who represents the Church of Zion) to have her child, so he may kill it. This being said, means that even Christians are not free from the evil acts of the devil. They will be tortured, but the devil cannot stop them from having eternal salvation through Christ. The Lord protects His church.

===Verses 5-6===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And she brought forth a male child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron, and her child was caught up to God and to his throne.''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there 1,260 days.'''''

''Commentary:'' The male child, who is Jesus Christ, is to rule all of the nations as mentioned in the verse, showing that he is the Messiah. He is to rule with a rod of iron, which suggest strict rule with no room for acting out. The Christian countries of the world did, in fact, eventually rule most of the globe &quot;with a rod of iron&quot; during the European colonial period. Israel's escape to the wilderness for 1,260 days (3½ years) may be in response to a terrible persecution which takes place after the “rapture” of the Church, which is “caught up to God and to his throne.” The place that is prepared by God for the woman who fled could potentially symbolize Jesus Christ taking rule over the people. With regard to the 1,260 day time period (3½ years), see note on 13:4-6 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_13#Verses_4-6].

This passage is used in support of a midtribulation rapture because the woman's child is &quot;caught up to God and to his throne&quot; at this point, immediately after the seventh trumpet. Earlier in the New Testament, Paul writes: 
:“Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed” (1 Cor 15:51-52). 
If we equate Paul’s “last trumpet” with the last trumpet of Revelation, then the resurrection and the rapture would be in the middle of the tribulation, after the seal and trumpet judgments, but before the bowl judgments. Nevertheless, there are also arguments for a pretribulation rapture and a posttribulation rapture.

There is a limited parallel, begun in the previous verse, with Herod’s efforts to kill the infant Christ and the escape of Joseph and Mary to Egypt with him (Mt 2).The child being caught up could be referring to the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. He is going from his earthly figure to the Son of God with even more incredible power.

==Satan Is Cast Down to the Earth==

===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought,''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''but prevailed not, nor was their place found anymore in heaven.'''''

''Commentary:'' Although angels play a highly visible part throughout Revelation, Michael is the only one mentioned by name (12:7). He is given the considerable responsibility of expelling Satan and his demonic armies from heaven. He is first mentioned in the Bible in a vision of Daniel, where another angel refers to him as “one of the chief princes” (Dan 10:13). Even then, he was involved in the battle against the forces of evil in the heavenly realms, for the other angel tells of how Michael came to his aid against the angels of Persia and Greece, saying, “No one supports me against them except Michael, your prince” (Dan 10:21). In a further mention of Michael in Daniel, we find out that he is the protector of Israel, for in a passage about the end times, the angel tells Daniel, “At that time, Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise” (Dan 12:1). We hear of him again in the New Testament epistle of Jude, which shows that he was active in Moses’ time also. Jude writes, “Even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, ‘The Lord rebuke you!’” (Jude 9).

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.'''''

''Commentary:''  This is another representation of Satan as the Fallen One and the Great Deceiver and its hosts.  This is also the beginning of the fall of Satan, which starts here with Satan falling from heaven to earth, then from earth to the abyss (20.2), and from the abyss into the lake of fire (20.10).  This can also be seen as a mirror of Christ rising to heaven after his death.  Since Christ relieved the people of the world from sin, it is logical that Satan would no longer have a place in heaven since he was an accuser of the people of God of sin.  On the other hand, Satan's expulsion from Heaven, and his banishment to earth, could also be indicative of the beginning of the God's judgment, through trials and tests of his people.

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Without the divisive energies of Satan and his angels, heaven gains in strength and unity. This transfer from heaven to Earth is the first of three downward steps for Satan. The second is into the Abyss (Rev 20:1-3). The third is into the Lake of Fire (Rev 20:10).

In this verse &quot;our bretheren&quot; may refer to the martyrs already killed. The accuser, of course, represents Satan. Witherington places then the casting down of Satan to earth at the point of Christ's death, when his full power was revealed. Koester imagines Satan now as a creature on the run, banished from heaven and corralled on earth to vent and rage. Satan's rampage on earth, then, can be perceived as his last hurrah and a signal that he is near defeat.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives to the death.'''''

''Commentary:'' By giving his life as an atoning sacrifice, Christ has foiled Satan's attempt to lead the people of the Earth to their destruction. Their faith in Christ and their love for truth have saved them. A loud voice comes form Heaven announcing that it is time for the power of the Kongdom of God. This passage says that those who overcame Satan did so because Jesus shed his own blood for the sake of man. The people who overcame Satan died for their faith in Jesus, which cost them their natural lives. Thus, they are modern martyrs

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea, for the devil is come down to you having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time.'''''

''Commentary:'' Satan is angry at his defeat by the powers of heaven. This is bad news for the Earth, which will suffer the brunt of his anger, but we may take comfort in the fact that his days are numbered. Satan will use his dark angels to destroy all of mankind left on earth. He will do this even though he knows that Jesus will return to earth with his Angels. This verse really shows the darkness of Revelation and how terrifying the final judgement days will be.

==Satan Persecutes the Woman==

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the male child.'''''

''Commentary:''The dragon being put on earth shows that Satan was cast out of heaven. The woman could represent Israel, Virgin Mary, or the church.  As the women is the first of Satan’s persecution, this mirrors that the woman is the first of creation to fall into sin in the Garden of Eden.

An alternative view is that Satan is persecuting the woman (Israel) so that God's people will be exterminated and His promise to the descendants of Abraham will not be fulfilled.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.'''''

''Commentary:'' Once again, we see the flight into the wilderness. The &quot;two wings of a great eagle&quot; may be a first-century description of modern aircraft. The &quot;place where she is nourished&quot; may be a country that offers her a safe haven. The time period described in v5-7 above as 1,260 days is here called a &quot;time&quot; (one year), and times (two years), and half a time (six months), but is still the same  three-and-a-half year period.

The two wings could also be viewed as two prophets sent to carry Israel and her people away in a great Exodus.

===Verses 15-16===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the serpent cast water out of his mouth as a flood after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood,''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''but the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.'''''

''Commentary:'' This mysterious flood is probably symbolic, though of what is hard to say. It is possibly a huge military force. Regardless, natural phenomena prevent the &quot;flood&quot; from destroying Israel.

There is a parallel here with the flight of the Israelites from Egypt (Ex 14), where &quot;Satan&quot; (acting through Pharaoh) sends a &quot;flood&quot; (military force) in pursuit of the &quot;woman&quot; (Israel), but the Earth &quot;swallowed up the flood&quot; (the military force was engulfed by the Red Sea).

The sea, in Babylonian and Canaanite traditions, embodied the original chaos of the world. The sea monster, called in the Jewish tradition Leviathan, can be associated here with Satan, as he harnesses the power of the sea to attack the woman.

===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the dragon was angry with the woman and went to make war against the rest of her offspring, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'''''

''Commentary:'' The dragon’s anger with the women shows the response the dragon had to the women’s escape and his loss of an army.   The dragon went off to make war shows that the dragon was not able to persecute the woman (Virgin Mary, Israel, the Church), which provides some light of hope.  However, the dragon focuses his aggression to her children which comes from the Greek term for “her seed”, which is a term usually assigned to a man, not a woman. Galatians 3:16 refers to Christ as the seed of the woman.  See also Genesis 3:15, Revelation 14:12, and I John 5:3.

:I can't see that this is a direct lift - it is similar in structure and content, but sufficiently different to not be an obvious copyright violation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bivalves''' include all marine and freshwater [[Invertebrate Zoology/Mollusks|mollusks]] with two shell-like plates hinged together by a muscle. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bivalve Definition of bivalve]&lt;/ref&gt; This group includes popular foods such as [[cookbook:clam|clams]], [[cookbook:mussel|mussels]], [[cookbook:scallop|scallops]] and [[cookbook:oyster|oysters]]. They are commonly referred to as shellfish. However, bivalves should not be confused with [[w:crustacean|crustaceans]], another variety of shellfish including [[cookbook:lobster|lobsters]], [[cookbook:crab|crabs]] and [[cookbook:shrimp|shrimps]].

When buying live bivalves, there are some rules to keep in mind about how to keep them alive, cook and eat them safely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodreference.com/html/clamshappy.html Chef Mark R. Vogel's instrucions on bivalve preparation]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Never buy a bivalve that's cracked or that won't close after you tap it.
*Store bivalves in the fridge in an open bowl '''WITHOUT''' water.
*Always brush and rinse bivalves clean ('''never''' use soap) before cooking and remove their beards if they have them.
*Cook bivalves within 24 hours of purchasing.
*Bivalves are ready to eat once they've opened during cooking. Overcooking will make them chewy.
*Never eat a bivalve that won't open during cooking.

There are four popular ways to cook bivalves: [[cookbook:saute|sauteing]], [[cookbook:boil|boiling]], [[cookbook:bake|baking]] and [[cookbook:grilling|grilling]].

Sue, I realize that you are not finished with your chapter,
so you may already be considering this. But I would add a 
definition of worm and virus.  From my experience, there 
are many that don't know exactly what these terms mean.
--[[User:Jstempin|Jstempin]] ([[User talk:Jstempin|talk]]) 16:23, 17 April 2010 (UTC)

Thanks, Joan. That is helpful.--[[User:Stomchak|Stomchak]] ([[User talk:Stomchak|talk]]) 17:59, 17 April 2010 (UTC)

Sue, Your page looks great so far and I think that you've got some really useful information.  I thought that the section about the AUP &quot;in plain English&quot; was a great idea since so many people really aren't familiar with what it is.  I also think that your choice of pictures compliments your page nicely. --[[User:Thomernie|Erin Thomas]] ([[User talk:Thomernie|talk]]) 01:43, 18 April 2010 (UTC)


=== '''April 18, 2010''' ===
Sue, great page and content! I think your examples listed hit on many of the problems commonly found in school settings. We read about these incidents every day but do we think of them when we are creating our Acceptable Use Policies? From the examples you have identified, I would say no. Thanks! Grace

I see you reverted some text on this page which I agree was probably not suitable there. However, it looks like it was originally added in good faith so the previous contributor would probably appreciate some explanation.

== [[Radiation_Oncology]] wikibook ==

You recently added the ''status|100%'' tag on the main page. It now displays over portion of the title of the wikibook on top, and it doesn't look very professional.

== Status icon template ==

Adrignola, the {{tl|Status}} template is a great idea.  However, to users not familiar with the idea of development stages, the icons that now appear on the main pages of each book can be confusing.  For instance, the {{tlx|Status|100%}} icon [[File:100%.svg|30px]] looks a bit like the Windows symbol :)  It would be useful to have information about the icon, such as through mouse-over captions.  I've created a modified {{tl|Status}} template on my Sandbox page at [[User:Brim/Sandbox/Status]]. This template places a mouse-over caption with the icon and goes to the [[Help:Development stages]] page when the icon is clicked on. Feel free to copy and use this template if you like it. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] ([[User talk:Brim|talk]]) 22:50, 17 April 2010 (UTC)

== Noob Admin question ==

Let me ask a simple question.  How does one generated the closed discussion boxes at [[RfD]], do you simply subst {{template|closed}} and {{template|end closed}}? (I ask because the two most recently added cases seem straight forward deletes per policy, so I was going to close them.  And in general I should do a bit of this work aswell.) &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:Actually, I've never substituted them, though it wouldn't be a problem if you did.  You can see what I did at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/How to Use Wikibooks for My Students]] and on the RfD page you'll see how I transcluded that subpage on the main one. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:41, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
== Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment ==

Hi!

I've been working with the ODU team on these foundations of education texts for a long time, and I notice that you've consolidated these books.  Can you tell me what strategy you used to consolidate these texts?  I'm concerned because we are still conducting research on these books, so we'd really like a means to see all editions of the book in their original form.  Is this possible?  Thanks for your help.

[[User:PbakerODU|PbakerODU]] ([[User talk:PbakerODU|talk]]) 17:58, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

:The process was this: each edition of the texts had several submissions of the same chapter submitted by editors.  Then students voted on the best one for that edition.  The next edition took that best one and put it up against the new attempts by students for that next edition.  The best one by rating would move on to the next edition and so on.  The consolidation reflects the versions of the chapters that won out over a series of four different iterations.  Additionally, I went through and applied consistent formatting to [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]] (in the headings and especially the question-answer area).  I have not had a chance to format the pages of [[Foundations of Education and Instructional Assessment]] at this time, so they do employ different colors and heading styles on each one.  The end goal, seen in SCFAE, is a well-formatted book that has the final and best version of each chapter presented to the reader.  I had the impression that [[Foundations and Assessment of Education]], which I have not touched, was the current project ODU is working on.  Even that book hasn't been edited since July 2009.  The two older books linked above seemed like good candidates to clean up since they were no longer being worked on and I proposed this [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2010/January#ODU_book_consolidation|in January 2010]] to the Wikibooks community and then followed through two months after that.  

:The edit histories of the chapters are still there; they have simply been merged.  Let's take a look at [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Philosophy and Ethics/Educational Philosophies]] for an example.  If you click the [{{fullurl:Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Philosophy and Ethics/Educational Philosophies|action=history}} history] tab, you'll see several revisions with red links.  Those red links indicate the original edition and page number of the page that was merged in.  On each of those lines there is a date that the revision was made.  Clicking that will show you the content of the page merged in.  For example, on 14 February 2010, there is a line that says ''moved [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Chapter 1 Supplemental Materials/Why are they important to education? 2]] to [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education/Philosophy and Ethics/Educational Philosophies]]''.  The date on that line, to the left of my username, can be clicked.  Doing so gives you [{{fullurl:Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Philosophy_and_Ethics/Educational_Philosophies|oldid=1719873}} this page] with Gregg Mottinger's version.  Back in the history, you can click the date for the revision before that and get [{{fullurl:Social_and_Cultural_Foundations_of_American_Education/Philosophy_and_Ethics/Educational_Philosophies|oldid=1719872}} this page] with Ruth McCarthy's version.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:37, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

:::It's not about the time, it's the content.  Countless pages have been created by users experimenting with the ability to create pages by clicking on a red link they find in a book.

== Sustainable business ==

Hi Adrignola, I noticed that you are undoing the redirects (moves) I have been making to Sustainable Business. I think I know why - having all the sub pages out on their own makes them vulnerable to conflicts with other books, not to mention taking up page names.. but can you help me? I was moving them so the parent page name doesn't show up in the print-to-book PDF. Is there a template like &quot;MyTitle&quot; where I can remove the parent page? [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:15, 25 April 2010 (UTC)
:Thanks for the help Adrignola. [[User:Leighblackall|leighblackall]] ([[User talk:Leighblackall|talk]]) 00:28, 25 April 2010 (UTC)
== Title Change ==

[[History of Apple Computer]] may need a title change since a) It doesn't cover only the computers (but also the history of  the corporation) b) Apple isn't a single computer (there are various models beyond a specific line they shouldn't be considered the same &quot;computer&quot;) c) It may relate to Apple Inc. was formally named Apple Computer, Inc. (the merged work had Apple Inc. in the title).&lt;br&gt;
I'm bothering you because you by now have more experience on how book naming is done in relation to the content (and access to the tools).&lt;br&gt;
The book also seems to be an orphan from contributors, and I've lost faith on posting on the general discussion area, so if you don't have a better idea, renaming it to Apple Inc. History could be the best option (since having Apple in the beginning would facilitate searches), see what you think...

PS: I've also added a &lt;nowiki&gt;TODO&lt;/nowiki&gt; box on the [[History of Computers]] since some content is needlessly replicated there, the content could be be simplified there and lengthly covered on the other book with a link to it.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:44, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

:More advanced tools would only be necessary for moving all subpages at once.  That was a single page so it was not hard to do.  It's now at [[History of Apple Inc.]]  &quot;Apple Inc. History&quot; doesn't sound grammatically correct or roll off the tongue well. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:18, 26 April 2010 (UTC)

== Odd completion box placement. ==

I think this call for participation in Wikimania box changes the placement of the title but not the completion box.  See for example [[:File:Odd placement.png]].  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 20:39, 30 April 2010 (UTC)
:That's expected; the icon is placed absolutely, outside the normal content area.  The notice at the top is placed inside the code for the page and pushes all the page's content down.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Hundred and Forty-Four Thousand Virgins==
===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I looked, and a lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 having his Father's name written on their foreheads.'''''

''Commentary:'' 

&quot;a lamb&quot;: Christ is consistently represented as a Lamb throughout Revelation (a parallel with the unblemished lamb of Old Testament sacrifices).

&quot;Mount Zion&quot;: Possibly Jerusalem, though ''Hebrews'' refers to Mount Zion as &quot;the heavenly Jerusalem&quot; (Heb 12:21-23). 

&quot;144,000&quot;: Chapter 7 speaks of 144,000 &quot;of all the tribes of the children of Israel.&quot; This may refer to a separate group of 144,000, though it seems likely that the two groups are the same. If they are, it should be noted here, as with chapter 7, that &quot;children of Israel&quot; does not necessarily equate to &quot;Jews.&quot; See notes on 7:1-8 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_7#A_Hundred_and_Forty-four_Thousand_Israelites_Are_Sealed]. The 144,000 may be alluding to God's army which we will learn about later in Revelation.

&quot;having his Father's name written on their foreheads&quot;: In chapter 7, the 144,000 are described as being &quot;sealed&quot; in their foreheads (v3). For more on this, see notes on 3:12 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_3#Verse_12].

===Verses 2-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard a voice from heaven like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of a great thunder, and I heard the sound of harpers harping with their harps,''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and they sung a new song before the throne, and before the four creatures, and the elders, and no one could learn that song but the 144,000 who were redeemed from the earth.'''''

''Commentary:'' The voice of many waters and of a great thunder refers to God. If the 144,000 are martyrs (see on 7:1-8 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_7#A_Hundred_and_Forty-four_Thousand_Israelites_Are_Sealed]), this passage appears to refer to a special reward set aside for those who have made that ultimate sacrifice, perhaps a song set aside only for them to learn. Perhaps the harpers are angels and saints that were previously accepted into heaven. Not everyone could hear these glorious tunes, only those who are true believers.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''They are not defiled with women, for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from among mankind, being the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.'''''

''Commentary:'' In the first sentence of this verse, John seemingly asserts that the 144,000 are actually all celibate men.  This is certainly problematic because it would mean that all the victims of persecution would be male.  Consequently, scholars agree that this depiction should not be taken literally.  Rather than an exaltation of celibacy, this verse should be taken metaphorically in terms of the sexual abstinence required before contact with the divine (Exodus 19:15).  Also, John could be drawing on the sexual abstinence required of warriors entering a holy war (Deuteronomy 23:9-14; 1 Samuel 21:5; 2 Samuel 11:9-13).  Instead of referring to a physical purity, John is likely referring to a spiritual purity.  Babylon is seen as a great whore and the soldiers of Christ are not to be seduced by her wicked ways.This virgins here are the ones, not only men, who avoid the idol worshipping that is famous in Babylon, or Rome.

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And in their mouths was found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God.'''''

''Commentary:'' They are innocent of the only sin which Jesus did not forgive: religious hypocrisy.
These men are perceived as perfectly pure because they were never married. God sees them as the purest of the bunch. It is said that the remaining people will be judges based on how they treated these pure men. This will decide whether they will enter the Kingdom of Heaven or be crushed.

==Three Angels Make Announcements==
===Verses 6-7===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,''''' &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come. Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the springs of waters.”'''''

''Commentary:'' We have a cultural idea that angels are spiritual beings with wings. The Greek ''angelos'' literally means ''messenger'', however, and it is translated both as ''angel'' or ''messenger'', and refers to both heavenly and earthly beings. The Greek word for heaven also means ''sky''. With that in mind, this angel may be a man or woman of God who travels the world preaching the gospel by &quot;flying in the midst of heaven,&quot; which is possibly a first-century vision of modern air travel.
God will send this Angel so that all may hear the good news of God and that no one has an excuse for not hearing the message of the salvation of Christ.

Again we see worship showing up, which serves as a reminder than proper worship of God is one of the key themes of the book. This chapter is at a crossroads of worship, in chapter 13 those who do not worship the beast are killed, but in chapter 15 the righteous are rewarded for their proper worship of God. This chapter is then about the outcome of each choice. Of course, there is no middle ground-either one worships God or one is in league with the beast. This reflects the outsider mentality of early Christians. Being unable to take part in many aspects of Roman life, it would be easy to be tempted to worship the Roman Gods and therefore partake in the benefits of Roman life, John views this as immoral. They are to worship God and only God.

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there followed another angel, saying, “Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”'''''

''Commentary:'' This &quot;angel&quot; truly is a messenger, for he or she brings the news of Babylon's fall.

The Greek “thumos” here translated as wrath can also be rendered passion.  Some have preferred this because it seems to make more since that fornication would have passion rather than wrath.  However, in verse 10, the same phrase is used clearly referring to wrath.  The image of God’s wrath being like a drink of wine is frequent in the Old Testament (see Job 21:20, Ps 75:8, Isa 51:17, and Jer. 25:12).  Wine causes stagger, just as following Rome (the woman) has caused people to do.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verses 9-11===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead, or on his hand,''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''the same will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot;'''''

''Commentary:'' Just as the people of God have his name &quot;on their foreheads&quot; (see v1 above), Satan, in imitation of God, initiates his followers with his mark. In spite of his pretensions to divinity, he apparently will not be fooling anyone, because this verse indicates that those who follow him do so knowingly and willingly, and as a result will receive a stern punishment. 

&quot;He will be tormented with fire and brimstone int he presence of the holy angels...&quot; refers to the eternal torture the devil followers will face. They will be able to see the happiness of all in Heaven, but will never be able to attain this because they bare the mark of the devil. Instead, they will be in the heat of hell where everything constantly burns, but the people will never be consumed. Instead, they will be in pure agony. 

This chapter in revelation is interesting because these three angels are no longer people to worship and cleave to God.  Instead, three angels carry messages of judgment and punishment to the people of earth.  The eternal punishment that is the price for bearing the mark of the beast is just the beginning of the divine justice that is inevitable.

==The Son of Man Reaps the Harvest==
===Verses 12-13===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Here is the patience of the saints. Here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours and their works follow them.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse serves to bring edification and encouragement to the saints, telling them to remain faithful and continue their preservation. The identity of the voice from Heaven is not explicitly stated, but it is presumably  the voice of God. The beatitude nature of the speaker's statement offers a promise of eternal rest, and ultimately life. The earthly struggles in comparison to the Heavenly treasures they will inherit and the sleep they will attain are minuscule. Since many people will take what these men have to say to heart, they will have trust in Jesus, and receive awards for their patients.

The phrase &quot;blessed are the dead who die in the lord from now on,&quot; can be translated as &quot;henceforth,&quot; if the Greek word is ap arti, or &quot;assuredly&quot; if the word is aparti. The difference is an issue of permanence or consequence.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I looked and saw a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.'''''

''Commentary:''

The remaining verses of Chapter 14 are to serve as a preview of God’s final judgment over the “wicked earth-dwellers”. The appearance of a white cloud has appeared time and time again in both the Old and New Testament.  In this instance, the white cloud is an introduction of a fourth event.  Unlike other events, it is not introduced by an angelic being.  Clouds metaphorically act as ambulatory &quot;vehicles&quot; to transport heavenly beings in heaven and on earth. In this case, one who is like a son of man. Some state that it is indeed Jesus, while others proclaim it is the angel Michael, as his name means &quot;who is like God.&quot; Regardless of the identity of “one like the son of man” is a heavenly being because he is “like the son of man”, the fact that he rides on the white cloud, and the golden crown.  A golden crown similar to this is worn by each one of the twenty-four elders mentioned in Chapter 4, the rider on a white horse in Chapter 6, and the locust cavalry wear golden crowns in Chapter 9.  The golden crown on his head signifies that this being has authority and a great status. A sickle was a hand-held agricultural cutting tool typically used during harvest time. The sharp sickle signifies the new beginning of harvest.

===Verses 15-16 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, “Thrust in your sickle, and reap, for the time is come for you to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.'''''

''Commentary:''
In this sense, the sickle and reaping the earth is referring to the harvest of those ripe for judgment.  Some believe that Christ will be the one to harvest the good while the other angel would be the one to harvest the wicked.  The loudness of the angel's voice suggests a sense of urgency and also that the angel would want many to hear of his cry.  The shear size of these angels must also be mentioned since they are sitting on the clouds yet have a sickle big enough to harvest the entire earth.

==The Grapes of Wrath==
===Verse 17-18===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.''''' &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And another angel came out from the altar who had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to the one that had the sharp sickle, saying, “Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This is the second angelic being with a sharp sickle, also ready to begin harvest. This being is like the one mentioned in verse 14.  The third angel has “authority over fire”, a symbolic image of judgment. The fire shows the holiness of God. &quot;Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of earth”  comes from Joel 3:13.  This shows that this harvest is a grape harvest.  The general idea of this passage is that the wicked get the punishment they deserve.

Some propose that this angels has come to harvest the wicked, just as Christ harvests the righteous.

===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even up to the horses' bridles, for 1,600 furlongs.'''''

''Commentary:''
The angel is to gather the wicked of the hearth in the harvest and give them to the Lord for his judgment. This also shows the severity of the punishment. 1,600 furlongs is approximately 185 miles, also the length of Palestine and a horse's bridle is normally 4–5 feet off the ground. The blood could refer to grape juice, but is more-likely to refer to blood from a great battle that will occur outside the city.The point of the detail of blood is to show the severity and the vast people that were judged by the Son of Man. The fact this occurs outside the city is fitting because this is where people would have been executed. The only valley that fits this description is the Jordan Valley. It is also unclear whether this is a literal war or an event directly from God, comparable to Sodom and Gomorrah.

Witherington argues that this vicious judgment must be interpreted as &quot;God's justice tempered with mercy.&quot; But this mercy can be better described as vengeance, or the justice of a jealous autocrat without consideration of morality or forgiveness. This image of blood running like a river was presumably a hopeful on to Christian sufferers at the time of writing.

      <comment>There were ten plagues of Egypt.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Sea of Glass==

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete.'''''

''Commentary:''
Chapter 15, the shortest in this book, serves as an introduction to chapter 16, where God’s wrath is fulfilled.  The portent in this verse shows us that John is looking into the future. This verse shows the third sign that John is able to see into heaven, which is the last and final victory over the beast. The earth and the followers of the Beast are subject to punishment, while the seven angels will poor out the cups of God's judgement. Unlike other events he describes which may be in the past or present, the final judgment has not yet occurred.  Also, the final judgment which this chapter introduces is that of the natural world.  The judgment of the supernatural will come later.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

These seven plagues can be considered an allusion to the ten plagues that forced the Pharaoh to release the Jewish slaves in the old testament.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.'''''

''Commentary:''
Just as Satan looked out at the sea in Revelation 13, so God's people look out at the sea, watching the saints after the Heavenly harvest. And, just as the Israelites crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians were drowned, so God's people stand before this heavenly mass of water and sing a song of Moses. Those standing here are the people who overcame the beast and are true followers of God. Those persecuted by the beast are now in Heaven and are considered martyrs because they have remained faithful to Jesus. 

 This same imagery is pictorially depicted in Revelation chapter 4. The sea of glass is interpreted 
to identify a mass of humanity, in this case the believers within the church. 
Throughout the New Testament, fire is often symbolic of the Holy Spirit. The mingling of the two elements reveal the activity of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the believers. John also describes victorious people who have overcome  the Antichrist and his system.

The first part of chapter 15 can be seen as a merging of two, until now, separate sets of images. The images of the beast, his spokesman, and his number have been readily present in recent chapters. First with the image of the sea of glass, the author brings back a scene set in chapter 4 that had been, relatively, moved on from. The sea of glass, the living creature, and the temple full of smoke reminds the reader of a setting established early on in the text.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvellous are your works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, O king of the saints.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The song of Moses may be considered as an allusion to Exodus, just as in the last verse a sea was crossed. John finds similarities between this image of great liberation that the Jews met in the flight from bondage and God's final judgment on the oppressors of Christians. This chapter and the next are very closely tied to the events of Exodus, so much so that it has been called the Revelation of the Old testament. First, there is a sea that the faithful are apparently able to cross, which is reminiscent of the Red Sea in Exodus, and later there will be seven plagues that are very heavily reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt. The song of Moses is also called the song of the Lamb, which provides an even stronger link between the two stories. In each story there is a group of the faithful that is oppressed and outnumbered by the ruling forces, yet through belief in God they overcame their oppressors. However, the events of Revelation are of much greater magnitude since they encompass the end of time. 

This song of praise does not mention the trials and tribulations the people went through. Instead, their only focus is on worshiping and glorifying God. &quot;Lord God Almighty&quot; displays the great power that God has, and that he is able to instill on those believers that follow the Lord. 

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''”Who will not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you only are holy, and all nations will come and worship before you, for your judgments are made manifest.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse creates many parallels to prophesy and letters to the churches.  The term for “fear” in this passage is from the Greek word phobeo or reverence or awe.  In the passage, the Saints stand in awe of the Lord it is a reference to Psalm 111:10, “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.” By using the term all nations come and worship before the Lord implies that all nations convert to following Christ (like in the Great Commission in Matthew 28:16-20).  This salvation of the Gentiles is prophesied by Isaiah, “Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth...” (Isaiah 45:22). Micah 4:2 records, &quot;Many nations will go and say, 'Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths...'&quot; In addition to Paul’s letter to the church in Philippi, “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Philippians 2:9-11).

==Seven Angels Appear with the Seven Last Judgments==

===Verses 5-6===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And after that I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having golden sashes around their chests.'''''

''Commentary:''

&quot;And after that I looked&quot; is a transitional statement indicative of a change in imagery through John's revelatory vision. John is now seeing inside the temple of the tabernacle. This is important because within the holiest of holy areas inside the tabernacle is where &quot;God resides.&quot; In this verse, God is using his messengers to execute his wrath. The angels are wearing white, clean linen, the symbol of holiness and purity. This is an interesting thought since these are the angels that are to execute God's wrath. The introduction of God's judgment is presented and carried out by seven angels. However, the propensity of these plagues have yet
to be stated.

The golden sashes the angels have on their chest emphasize their significance within the order of the heavenly beings.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And one of the four creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.'''''

''Commentary:''  Recall that the &quot;four creatures&quot; are the creatures first introduced in Revelation 4.  This verse shows the four creatures giving the seven angels seven &quot;phials,&quot; a Greek word translated here as &quot;bowls.&quot;  As Ben Witherington III notes, &quot;[Phials] can refer to anything from a bowl used a saucepan for cooking to a bowl-shaped cup used for drinking.&quot;  He goes on to note that Isaiah 51:17 utilizes the equivalent word in Aramaic to describe the cup of God's wrath, suggesting that John intends this word to be understood as &quot;bowl-shaped cup used for drinking.&quot;  These bowls are said to be full God's wrath.  Revelation 16 shows these angels pouring the bowls onto the earth.

These four creatures can be paralleled to the four creatures mentioned in another prophetic book of the Bible. In the book of Daniel, there are four creatures, believed to signify four kingdoms, but some scholars believe that they are a direct parallel to the four creatures mentioned in this passage. However, some scholars believe that the four creatures are related to creatures of the Beast and not of God. It is not known for sure.

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.'''''

''Commentary:''

This verse tells of God's coming into his temple. The smoke is not only a symbol of God coming, like the smoke in Isa. 6, but that he is also going to act. It's interesting to note that in order for there to be a metaphorical smoke, there has to be a fire to cause it.  Therefore, the fire can be compared with the sinful nature of mankind especially those that have not repented.  This would mean that the smoke could also be God's wrath following it.  God will not permit anyone to be in his presence until his wrath is finished.

When the average person thinks of network security within a school they often think of the student trying to hack into the system to change their grade, to see if they can take over their friend’s computer, or to put a prank up on the school website. In light of the current network dangers these may be some of least of the school system worries. 


All of the following cases are based upon real situations.&lt;br&gt;
As you read through each case ask yourself these questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a) What should be the very first course of action?&lt;br&gt;
b) Should the public be informed about the situation? If so, how will their trust be regained?&lt;br&gt;
c) What steps should be taken to prevent similar attacks in the future?&lt;br&gt;
d) What are the ethical issues of this situation?&lt;br&gt;
d) How should students be dealt with if they were the people initiating the attack?

==Breached Passwords==
There are many ways for people to get passwords. What they do once they have them can be devastating.
The important first step in data security is for everyone to take password security seriously. Choosing good passwords, not posting it on your computer, making sure no one is looking when you are typing it in are all simple steps in password security. For password security tips see the page on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Authentication Safeguarding passwords for today's technology]. 

===Brute force=== 
Hackers used brute force password cracking program to break into the district’s computers and initiated a batch of bogus transfers out of the school’s payroll account. The transfers were kept below $10,000 to avoid the anti-money laundering reporting requirements. The hackers had almost 20 accomplices they had hired through work at home job scams. Over $100,000 was successfully removed from the account. Two days later a school employee noticed the bogus payments. Unfortunately, unlike consumers who typically have up to 60 days from the receipt of a monthly statement to dispute any unauthorized charges, organizations and companies have roughly two business days to spot and dispute unauthorized activity. This is because school organizations that bank online fall under the Uniform Commercial Code. Due to this law, the district was able to get less than $20,000 of the transfers reversed.

===Shoulder surfing=== 
A former student “shoulder surfed” (physically observed) the password of an employee while still in high school. After graduating, he used this information to get into the district’s student information system. From there, he gained access to a different district’s payroll data including birth dates, social security numbers, and bank account information of 5000 current and former employees. This information was then used for identity theft purposes including requesting and using credit cards, creating checks and altering bank account information. The perpetrator was caught and arrested after attempting to use a fake check at a local store. At a cost of $62,000 the district gave all of the affected employees fraud prevention and resolution services. According to the district superintendent, the district suffered “damage to our reputation with the public and our employees. Hundreds of hours were spent investigating the extent of the compromised data and developing the plans and procedures to protect staff from further exposure to fraud.... District staff also spent countless hours working with financial institutions, answering employee questions, and preparing internal and external communications. It is impossible to measure lost productivity as employees worried about their financial security and work to change bank account and payroll information.&quot;

===Key logger=== 
A group of students installed a keystroke-tracking program (this could also fall under malware or student hacking) on computers at their high school to grab the user names and passwords of about 10% of the students, teachers, parents, and administrators that use the system. The students then  used this password information to access the system to change grades for themselves and others. They did not seem to do anything else to the system while they had access.

==Malware==
Programs can be installed into a computer with dangerous consequences. See the page on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Information_Security_in_Education/Malicious_Software malicious software] for a more indepth description of these types of programs[[Image:Msf3-hashdump small.jpg|right|thumb|400px|malware can infect your computer]] 

===Malware=== 
A school computer containing no confidential information was hooked to the network containing the personal information of over 15,000 students. This computer was breached with malware designed to steal sensitive data. Names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Social Security numbers were all part of the database that was potentially exposed to this malware. It is uncertain if any of this information was actually accessed, but the malware was found to have been on the breached computer for approximately five years.

===Botnet=== 
A school network administrator was contacted concerning spam e-mail and other attacks emanating from the district system. When the administrator looked into the problem, it was discovered several computers had been infected with a botnet. Several of the district computer’s operating systems had been commandeered and were being used by the person controlling the botnet for illicit activities.

==Stolen or lost equipment==
[[File:USB flash drive.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Flash Drive]]

===Lost Flash Drive=== 
A school employee was using a flash drive to transfer personal information of 6000 employees for job related purposes. The information included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. This flash drive went missing. There is currently no evidence that the sensitive information has been accessed or used inappropriately.


===Stolen &amp; Returned Mobile Storage Device=== 
A mobile storage device was stolen and retrieved in a matter of three hours. The thief was apprehended. The device contained names and Social Security numbers for approximately 1600 individuals in a welfare reform program. A computer expert could not determine if the information on the data storage device had been copied off it. There is currently no evidence that the sensitive information has been accessed or used inappropriately.


===Stolen Laptop=== 
A district business office laptop was stolen. The laptop contained sensitive employee and student data. The laptop was password protected and contained data in a format that would not be easily accessible. There is currently no evidence that the sensitive information has been accessed or used inappropriately.


===Protecting the School’s Investment===
[[File:Laptop.svg]]&lt;br&gt;
The district has decided to initiate a one-to-one initiative. Each child from middle school through high school will be issued an internet and wireless enabled laptop for use both in and outside of school. Since this is a significant investment of tax dollars, the school board would like a system put into place for theft protection. The system administrator installs a program for remote access of each computer with the capability to track the IP address and take a picture of the current user. If a computer is reported as missing the system will be activated and the information can be used to recover the computer. There is no mention of this software to the students or parents. If a thief was aware of this software they may be able to disable it, defeating its purpose. Only two district employees have the capability to activate this system.
	A student was called into the office by the assistant principal and accused of wrong-doing. The proof supplied included a picture of the student taken by his school issued laptop’s webcam after school hours in the privacy of his home.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
a) Is this type of system appropriate for use on a school computer?&lt;br&gt;
b) Should students be made aware of this type of system being installed on the computer?&lt;br&gt;
c) How can the school ensure this system is used correctly?&lt;br&gt;
d) What other methods could be used for theft protection and prevention?&lt;br&gt;

==Information Posted to the Web==
===FTP installed=== 
A member of a school association installed a file transfer program onto a server without permission, inadvertently exposing the names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of thousands of associated members around the country. The program was installed and had the information exposed for almost a year before it was discovered.

===Wrong information uploaded=== 
An assessment specialist who handled testing data accidentally uploaded personal information including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and test scores of the district’s 17,000 students to a Web site for an unrelated school study. 


==Student Hacking==
Approximately 67 percent of teens admit to &quot;having tried, on at least one occasion, to hack into friends' instant messaging or social network accounts&quot; (Masters, 2009) &lt;ref&gt;Masters, G. (2009, May 15). Study: majority of adolescents online have tried hacking. SC Magazine for IT security professionals, Retrieved from http://www.scmagazineus.com/study-majority-of-adolescents-online-have-tried-hacking/article/136926/&lt;/ref&gt; Students need to be taught proper ethical behavior when it comes to the internet and computer usage. 

===Grade &quot;Fixing&quot;===

A group of high school students managed to infiltrate the school district's records management system. Once in they changed grades for students who paid them to accomplish this task. The students said in addition to the money, they did it for kicks, to prove they could do it.[[File:Child and Computer 08473.jpg|right|thumb|400px|[[Child &amp; Computer]], Hacking has become child's play]]

===Moving files===
A high school student taking a networking class hacked into an administrator's user file. Once in, he changed student's passwords, remotely shut down computers, and created and copied folders in an assistant principal's file. He just wanted to see what he could get away with and didn't do any real damage despite his capability to do so.

===Looking around===
A third grade student used the teacher's password to gain access to the instructor's portion of the blackboard online learning environment. Once in, he changed some student's passwords and some of the homework assigned.

===Senior Project===
A 15 year old student used three hacking programs to gain access to the district records management system in 200 milliseconds. Once in, he lowered his grades, since he couldn't raise them, he already had 4.0. He then wrote a three page paper on how to improve the security of the system. Finally, he proceeded to help the district to improve the security of the network in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navigate|Book=Geometry for Elementary School|Prev=The Side-Angle-Side congruence theorem |Curr=The Angle-Side-Angle congruence theorem
|Next=The Side-Angle-Angle congruence theorem}}

In this chapter, we will discuss another congruence theorem, this time the Angle-Side-Angle theorem, usually shortened as ASA. The side in this theorem is called the included side.

== The Angle-Side-Angle congruence theorem ==
[[Image:asa_congruence.svg|400px|right]]
Given two triangles &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle DEF &lt;/math&gt; such that their sides are equal, hence:
# The angle &lt;math&gt;\angle BAC &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle EDF &lt;/math&gt;.
# The side &lt;math&gt;\overline {BA} &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\overline {ED} &lt;/math&gt;.
# The angle &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC &lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\angle DEF &lt;/math&gt; (These are the angles between the sides, or the included angle).


Then the triangles are congruent and their other angles and sides are equal too.  Note that the side must be the included side of the two angles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &quot;Related Subjects&quot; -&gt; &quot;Subsections&quot; ==
I changed the title of that column because the relation is hierarchical; it is not a general loose relation. Alternatively it could be named &quot;Subordinate Subjects&quot; but I think the latter is too technical a term. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:24, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
:That heading has gone through several different revisions; I'm personally fine with that title.  And that's the benefit to using a template transcluded instead of substituted&amp;mdash;it's easy to make changes and have them all be updated at once. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
::Is there a discussion about that heading? If it isn't appropriate for some subjects, there should probably be an optional parameter to change it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:32, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

== Featured books of subsections? ==
I think there should be at least an option to include featured books (and books with print version etc.) of subordinate subjects (subsections) in the list of featured books of the parent subject. For example, none of the featured language books appears on [[Subject:Languages]]  (although there are only a handfuld of them). Because of this empty list, most readers will probably conclude that there aren't any featured language books. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:24, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
:This is the one thing I'm sure can be technically accomplished, at least with my knowledge.  I know it's probably the one remaining objection that might be leveled at subjects, now that I've created a system and altered the subject code to indicate book completion progress.  But, let's say a subject could pull all the featured books from every sub-subject out there.  The higher-level subjects, as more sub-subjects are added or featured books are assigned, would see the list of featured books shown on them balloon out, with none of those shown actually members of that subject page itself.  The one consolation I can give is that [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] is linked prominently from the main page and left-hand navigation, and lists all the featured language books in the languages section.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:25, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
::I've added an optional parameter &quot;featuredbooks&quot; which replaces the dynamic list of featured books by whatever is specified (preferably a list of Goodbook templates); see [[Subject:Languages]] for an example. What do you think? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:14, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

== books in main subjects ==

For some (all?) of the main subjects (e.g. Mathematics, Languages, etc.) the subsections/subtopics are actually more important than the books that are not  classified in any of the subsections. Therefore, I would suggest to classifiy these books as &quot;Miscellaneous Mathematics&quot; etc. instead of just &quot;Mathematics&quot; etc. (These books are not important enough to be listed on the main subjects page.) The template should accept an optional paramter that indicates that a subject is one of these main subjects. In this case the left column should include the subsections/subtopics and the right column should only show the list of featured books (as specified by the &quot;featuredbooks&quot; parameter). Comments? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:41, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

:I made {{tl|root subject}} with your changes and with some tweaks to reflect that some parameters from this template will be known (for instance, there will be one parent and it will be &quot;books by subject&quot;.  Trying to use parser functions in this template to have this one do both messes up the tables and requires using {{tl|!}}, making the code ugly.  Now, the only problem is that when I try to use {{tl|root subject}} on [[Subject:Languages]] it messes things up.  I already filed the books that were in that subject elsewhere or in [[Subject:Language education]].  Can you take a look at {{tl|root subject}} and see if you can't figure out the problem? -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:40, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

Hi Joan:
Nice work.  Your pics are excellent.  Where did you find them?  I was too nervous so I took my own pics.

I did take a few of them myself.  The others I found within the wikibooks library.  If you click on upload files, you can type in your topic and see what is already available.

Joan, what a great page! You have taken content that can cause the non-mathematician a serious headache and put it in language we can all understand. This is such a great resource! Thanks!  Grace

Joan, 
Your page is fun. I love the examples of the different ciphers. It makes it like a game.
--[[User:Dkellner|Dkellner]] ([[User talk:Dkellner|talk]]) 21:18, 19 April 2010 (UTC)

Joan-
I liked the way you set up your information.  It was easy to follow and the examples really helped me understand.  Erin

==Introduction==

[[Image:Malware logo.png|right|thumb|300px]]

The specific Malicious Software detailed within this page can come in the form of attacks on a single computer or computer network attacks. Malicious Software can be responsible for damage and reduced computer security on both the individual and network levels. A basic understanding of Malicious Software can be helpful in recognizing the threats that you may encounter in the digital age.

The topic of Malicious Software is broad and technical. This page will focus on the questions of &quot;What is it?&quot; and &quot;What does it do?&quot; for each topic.

==Malicious Software==

[[w:Malicious Software| Malicious Software]] is also commonly referred to as [[w:Malware| Malware]]. According to Bruce Schneier, &quot;Malicious Software includes computer viruses, worms, and trojan horses&quot; (Schneier, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Schneier, B. (2004). ''Secrets and Lies''. Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts include spyware, dishonest adware, crimeware, rootkits, and other unwanted software. Bots and botnets will also be presented as they have also become a more common threat to computer security.

What is it? Malicious Software or malware is software designed to infiltrate a computer system without the owner's informed consent.

What does it do? Depending on the variety of malware, &quot;it can hijack your browser, redirect your search attempts, serve up nasty pop-up ads, track what web sites you visit, and generally screw things up&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=Malware: what it is and how to prevent it| url=http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2004/11/malware.ars | accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The bottom line is malware can cost you or your organization time, money, resources, privacy, and security.

==Computer Viruses==

[[Image:Attack tree virus.png|left|thumb|300px]]

What is it? A [[w:Computer virus| Computer virus]] &quot;is a program that can infect other programs by modeling them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself. It can spread throughout a computer system or network. Every program that gets infected may also act as a virus and thus the infection grows&quot; (Thompson, 1984). &lt;ref&gt;Thompson, K. (1984) &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust,&quot; Communications of the ACM, Volume 27&lt;/ref&gt;

What does it do? &quot;A properly engineered virus can have a devastating effect, disrupting productivity and doing billions of dollars in damages&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How Computer Viruses Work| url=http://http://www.howstuffworks.com/virus.htm/ | accessdate=2010-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses can cause any number of symptoms ranging from slowing down the computer to ultimately crashing it.

Viruses have been around since virtually computers have been in existence, dating back to 1949. The term virus dates back to 1984 and is credited to Kenneth Thompson. The term computer virus is often used synonymously for all forms of malware, although each form of malware discussed on this page has a different function. [http://computer.howstuffworks.com/virus2.htm| Here] is a great link to explore the history of viruses.

==Worms==

What is it? [[w:Computer worm| Computer worms]] are independent programs that copy themselves and reproduce at a rapid pace, usually over a computer network. &quot;The programs on individual computers are described as the segments of worms. The segments in a worm remain in communication with each other, should one segment fail, the remaining pieces must find another free computer, initialize it, and add it to the worm. As segments(computers) join and then leave the program, the worm itself seems to move through the network&quot;(Schoch, J., &amp; Hupp, J., 1982).&lt;ref&gt; Schoch, J., &amp; Hupp, J., (2006). “The Worm Programs-Early Experience with a Distributed Computation,” Communication of the ACM, Volume 25. &lt;/ref&gt;

What does it do? It is similar to a computer virus because it magnifies the damage it does by spreading rapidly, and can include malicious instructions that cause damage or annoyance. &quot;Unlike a virus, which attaches itself to a host program, a worm keeps its independence and usually doesn't modify other programs&quot;(Lehtinen, 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehtinen&quot;&gt; Lehtinen, R., Russel, D. &amp; Gangemi, G. (2006). Computer Security Basics. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Worms can infect your email, delete computer files, lock you out of your computer, and even steal your information.

[http://news.cnet.com/60-minutes-whats-next-for-the-conficker-worm/| Here] is an interesting link to a 60 Minutes investigation that explains what computer worms are and chronicles the spread of the Conficker worm in March of 2009.

==Trojan Horses==

[[Image:Troi.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]

What is it? A [[w:Trojan horse(computing)| Trojan horse (computing)]] is a code fragment that hides inside a program and performs a disguised function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehtinen&quot;/&gt; It takes its name from the classical mythology tale of the hollow wooden horse made by Odysseus wherein soldiers hid and then launched their attack during the Trojan War.

What does it do? A Trojan horse hides inside a independent program that performs a useful task. Along with that function, it performs some other unauthorized operation. &quot;Once a Trojan horse is activated, it can access files, folders, or your entire system. Commonly, Trojans create a &quot;backdoor”, which can be used to send your personal information to another location&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is a Trojan Horse | url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-trojan-horse.htm | accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;Some Trojans may open up the possibility of someone accessing your machine, while others may monitor your Internet connection and grab your email addresses and access passwords. One common and annoying function is the annoying unwanted pop-up messages that seemingly arise from nowhere.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssckV79mNLs| Here ]is a six minute YouTube video that explains most of what you might want to know about Trojans.

==Spyware==

What is it? [[w:Spyware| Spyware]] refers to programs that use your Internet connection to send information from your personal computer to some other computer, normally without your knowledge or permission. 

What does it do? On the Internet (where it is sometimes called a spybot or tracking software), &quot;spyware is programming that is put in someone's computer to secretly gather information about the user and relay it to advertisers or other interested parties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is spyware|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci214518,00.html| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;Different strains of spyware perform different functions. Some might also hijack your browser to take you to an unexpected site, cause your computer to dial expensive 900 numbers, replace the Home page setting in your browser with another site, or serve you personal ads, even when you're offline.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is spyware | url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-spyware.htm| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adware==

What is it? [[w:Adware| Adware]] is short for Advertising Supported software. The legal type of adware is a way for shareware authors to make money from a product, other than by selling it to the users. But since this page is about Malicious Software, dishonest adware is what is explained more fully. Dishonest adware is an aggressive form of unwanted software that evolved from legal adware. Adware then began exhibiting spyware and malware characteristics. Dishonest adware writers began to design their programs so that they would reinstall automatically if removed, sometimes using different file names. As Adware has matured it has become smarter. Historically, as fast as the clean-up experts have worked out how to fight malware, those behind it have fought back with new tricks.

What does it do? It generates advertisements such as pop-up windows or hotlinks on Web pages that are not part of a page's code. &quot;Adware may add links to your favorites and your desktop. It can hijack your home page and search engine, create tool bars that appear out of nowhere, and generate unwanted pop-up windows.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=Adware and Bad Things it Does| url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/columns/adware.mspx| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALC7imY8bWs| Here] is another short YouTube video that does a nice job of simply explaining the differences between adware and spyware.

==Crimeware==

What is it? [[w:Crimeware| Crimeware]] is any software tool used in cybercrime. Crimeware is software that is:

*used in the commission of the criminal act 
*not generally regarded as a desirable software or hardware application 
*not involuntarily enabling the crime 

Like cybercrime itself, the term crimeware covers a wide range of different malicious, or potentially malicious software.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is crimeware? | url=http://www.symantec.com/norton/cybercrime/crimeware.jsp/ | accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What does it do? Because the definition above states just about any software could be used in a manner that would deem is crimeware, examples of how a software program can be used as crimeware follows. For example, child predators often use various IM clients to converse with their intended victims. Another example would be FTP sites are sometimes set up to facilitate the distribution of pirated software.

==Rootkits==

What is it? [[w:Rootkit| Rootkits]] are mechanisms and techniques whereby malware, including viruses, spyware, and trojans, attempt to hide their presence from spyware blockers, antivirus, and system management utilities.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is Rootkit. How to remove it. | url=http://forums.techarena.in/guides-tutorials/1000985.htm| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;A rootkit is a collection of tools (programs) that enable administrator-level access to a computer or computer network.

What does it do? Typically, a cracker installs a rootkit on a computer after first obtaining user-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password. Once the rootkit is installed, it allows the attacker to mask intrusion and gain root or privileged access to the computer and, possibly, other machines on the network.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=Antivirus, antispyware management  | url=http://searchmidmarketsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid198_gci547279,00.html| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bots &amp; Botnets==

[[Image: Botnet.svg|left|thumb|300px]]

What are bots and botnets?[[w:Botnet| A bot]] is a is a type of malware which allows an attacker to gain complete control over the affected computer. Computers that are infected with a 'bot' are generally referred to as 'zombies'. There are literally tens of thousands of computers on the Internet which are infected with some type of 'bot' and don't even realize it. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is a bot?  | url=http://netsecurity.about.com/od/frequentlyaskedquestions/qt/pr_bot.htm| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A botnet is the network of computers that have been infected by a particular bot software. The term &quot;botnet&quot; is short for &quot;robot network&quot;. 

What does a botnet do? Computers that have been caught up in a botnet have been effectively taken over, and can be used to perform almost any task by the person or persons who control the botnet. Botnets are controlled by criminals whose motives include selling products, operating financial scams and crippling websites through coordinated attacks.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=Warning, Danger: Botnets!| url=http://askbobrankin.com/what_is_a_botnet.html| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting fact is that while it is possible for Mac or Linux systems to become victim to botnets, the vast majority of botnets are Windows PC based.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=What is a bot anyway?| url=http://www.itworld.com/security/74656/what-botnet-anyway| accessdate= 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR2hj6eEN6k| here] is a YouTube video that explains the bot and botnet tale.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Two ways of finding the OpenClinica-ID's (OID's) for a rule ==

=== Ingredients for a rule ===
 
When you want to construct a rule for a CRF, you're going to need four OpenClinica ID's or OID's as ingredients:
#the OID of an event
#the OID of a CRF-version in that event
#the OID of a group in that CRF 
#the OID of an item in that group

You can access this information via two completely different routes:&lt;br /&gt; 
#using the StudyMetaData-file 
#using the OpenClinica-application
 
If you are familiar with XML-formatted files and you can find your way around in your study, choose the first option.
If this is one of the first times you are using the OID's, chose the second option.

=== Using the StudyMetaData-file ===
Login to OpenClinica as Study Director and click on &quot;Tasks&quot;. Choose from the list that appears &quot;Study setup&quot;, &quot;View study&quot;. 
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:TaskMenuViewStudy.jpg|none|thumbs||Taskmenu]]
&lt;br&gt;

In the first line screen that appears (Download all of the OIDs needed for Data Import and Rules in the ODM XML File format by clicking here.) you find the link to the StudyMetaData-file
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DownloadStudyMetaData.jpg|none|thumbs||Taskmenu]]
&lt;br&gt;

Clicking on this link will start the download of a compressed file. The name of this file is the name of your study, plus the date and time the file was generated, with extension &lt;b&gt;.txt.zip&lt;/b&gt;. Unzip this file and rename it to extension &lt;b&gt;.xml&lt;/b&gt;. Now you can open it, preferably in an XML-editor.
			
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:OIDsinXML.jpg|none|thumbs||Taskmenu]]
&lt;br&gt;
	
If you have looked at a StudyMetaData-file before, you will notice that this is just a simple version of it. For this example I threw out a few hundreds of lines and left only the relevant ones.&lt;br&gt;
 
We are looking for four OID's and they come in pairs: &lt;br&gt; 
*in the StudyEventDef is a reference to the form 
*in the ItemGroupDef is a reference to the items 
			
In the two red circles you'll find all the information you need to build your rule:&lt;br&gt; 
			 	
There is however one last thing to consider: the OID for the group has an extra extension in the StudyMetaData-file: in the example above this is &lt;b&gt;ItemGroupOID=&quot;IG_SF36_UNGROUPED-F_SF36_15&quot;&lt;/b&gt;. So the OID of the form is appended to the OID of the ItemGroup. To use this GroupItem OID you must not use the extension! 

			&lt;table&gt; 
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Study event OID	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;: SE_ENDOFSTU&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CRF version OID	&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;: F_SF36_15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Group OID &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;: IG_SF36_UNGROUPED&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
			&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Item OID &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;: I_SF36_GH01&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
			&lt;/table&gt; 
			
			&lt;p&gt;			
			Thus the target for your rule 
			would be :&lt;br&gt; 
			&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;Target Context=&quot;OC_RULES_V1&quot;&amp;gt;SE_ENDOFSTU.F_SF36_15.IG_SF36_UNGROUPED.I_SF36_GH01&amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
			&lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;You can now start writing your rules. But below is another way to find OID's.&lt;/p&gt;

=== Using the OpenClinica-application ===

Here is an alternative for finding the OID's. It uses the OpenClinica-interface. We'll walk through step by step and you 
will get the same results as the when using the method described above.

Login to OpenClinica as Study Director and click on &quot;Tasks&quot;. Choose from the list that appears &quot;Study setup&quot;, &quot;Build study&quot;. 

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:TaskMenuBuildStudy.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;

Click on the magnifier-icon in step 3 &quot;Create Event Definitions&quot;. 

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:ViewEventDefinitions.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;


You now see a list of all the events in your study and for this example we'll use EndOfStudy. Click on the magnifier-icon of this event. 

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:01ListEventDefinition.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;

Now a screen opens, displaying information about the event and about the CRF's in that event. Here you can find your first ingredient: the OpenClinica ID (OID) of the StudyEvent, in this case &lt;b&gt;&quot;SE_ENDOFSTU&quot;&lt;/b&gt;. Write this down for later use. Then click on the magnifier-icon on the right of the CRF you want to use for your rule.

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:02ViewEventDefinition.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;
 
In the screen that opens you see the CRF-details, including the OID of this version of the CRF: &lt;b&gt;&quot;F_SF36_15&quot;&lt;/b&gt;. Again: write this down, because this is your second ingredient. 

Now click on the strange icon on the right to view the meta-data of the CRF. 

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:03ViewCRFMetaData.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;

This next screen gives you both the OID of the item and of the group this item belongs to: ingredients 3 and 4.

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:04ItemGroupID.jpg|none|thumbs||Task menu - Build study]]
&lt;br&gt;

As described above you can now define the target for your rule:&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;Target Context=&quot;OC_RULES_V1&quot;&amp;gt;SE_ENDOFSTU.F_SF36_15.IG_SF36_UNGROUPED.I_SF36_GH01&amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Darlene, what a thorough and clear explanation of the need for Information Security and Acceptable Use Policies.  As you stated and we have discussed previously in class, the reality of what is at stake when a teacher or administrator signs an AUP &quot;hits home&quot; when they are given examples such as those you have identified. Thanks. Grace

Thanks Grace,
Not all administrators have a cache of stories like Dr. Garrigan, so hopefully this page can be used in a way to bring a more realistic level of understanding of the dangers.--[[User:Dkellner|Dkellner]] ([[User talk:Dkellner|talk]]) 23:00, 18 April 2010 (UTC)

Darlene, excellent topic. What a great idea to gather various cases together for a cohesive chapter. It was also a great idea to link to other chapters within the wikibook.  Joan</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The First Six Bowl Judgments==

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go your ways and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This great voice speaking is the voice of God. He holds the vials of wrath and gives them to his messengers for them to carry out his wrath. This first bowl is poured onto the earth (land) signaling the first of the final phases of God's wrath, and it affects man directly. The people affected with this bowl are those who have worshipped the Beast, thus they are punished with horrible sores. These people have rejected God and all his teachings and their time of judgement has come. They are punished with these ugly and painful sores for their misdoings. Many experts relate this first bowl's plague to the sixth plague put onto the Egyptians. In Exodus 6, the Egyptians and their animals suffer from horrible boils to threaten the life of the Egyptians. However, the purposes of the sores that God sends appears to be unparalleled suffering. The sores serve to warn the people who have not given themselves over to Satan. It is a call telling the people to surrender their lives to the Lord.

===Verse 2===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and there fell a foul and loathsome sore upon those who had the mark of the beast, and upon those who worshipped his image.'''''

''Commentary:''
It is interesting that the judgements are presented in the same order here as they are with the seven Trumpets. The following are affected in the same order: 1)the earth 2)the sea 3) the waterways 4) the sun 5)darkness comes 6)judgement from beyond the Euphrates 7)thunderous voices from heaven.  This is a reference to the sixth plague (Exodus 9:8-12). The bowl poured unto the earth is for those who do not believe in Christ, but rather follow the Antichrist, or &quot;the mark of the beast.&quot;

The &quot;foul and loathsome sore&quot; could be paralleled to the plague of boils that befell the Egyptians during the great Exodus, although their purposes are not the same. In Egypt, the sores were the first plague that could cause death, whereas in this case, it seems that they are just meant to cause great suffering.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.'''''

''Commentary:'' This has major implications for the world’s food supply and all whose livelihoods are connected with the oceans, because all of the fish and sea creatures has died. It may be that the image of the sea turning to blood is not intended to be taken literally, but is a symbolic way of saying that the sea will be full of death.  This judgment parallels the first plague (Exodus 7:14-25).

===Verses 4-7===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and springs of waters, and they became blood.''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard the angel of the waters say, “You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and was, and will be, because you have judged thus,''''' &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink, for they are worthy of it.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard another voice out of the altar say, “Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments.”'''''

''Commentary:'' This is what is termed “poetic justice.” If the second and third bowls are taken literally, there is now neither salt water nor fresh. The rivers and springs were the sources of drinking water, and now they have no clean drink water. It has been said that this is only right to do since they shed blood, they must now drink of the blood they shed. 

It is important to take note of the author description of the angel as one &quot;of the waters.&quot;  This phrasing is very much in the tradition of apocalyptic literature and is consistent with other descriptions the author uses.  In Revelation 14:18, there are angels that control the winds.  This imagery is important because it allows the readers to see the world as the author might have.  Regardless of which theory concerning the date of the Book of Revelation, everyone agrees that this piece of literature was written in ancient time.  This means that John and everyone else was living in a pre-industrial world, perhaps a world that we would consider to be barely civilized.  It is only after an industrial revolution that human beings began to truly dominate and exploit nature.  Before industrialization, humans were able to use natural forces and resources to our advantage; however, we did not dominate those forces.  As such, it may have seemed very logical that angels, messengers and representatives of God, might in fact have some influence or control, given to them by God, over the natural elements. 

The angel of water takes time to worship God with a song of praise and say that God is righteous.  Often in this book we have encountered worship of God in the middle of judgments.  Some may be offended by this.  How can one praise God in the middle of all this blood?  This is not the praise of the haughty gleefully delighting in the death of nonbelievers and destruction of the world.  Rather it is praise of God’s redemptive-judgment.  God’s holiness includes love and mercy, as well as righteousness and justice.  The nonbelievers have been given every chance to repent.  Even now, in the face of complete annihilation, they refuse to accept God.  God would not be the God he claims to be if such outright blasphemy were to continue unchecked, He has always been a virtuous God. This praise from the angels worshiping God is for being true to his nature – offering mercy to those who accept and then judging those who refuse it.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verses 8-9===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and power was given to him to scorch people with fire,''''' &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and people were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory.'''''

''Commentary:'' There is much talk today about global warming, and this passage could be used by some as a sign that the events of Revelation are happening now. However, the intense heat of the fourth bowl judgment is presented as something which occurs suddenly, dramatically, and supernaturally, as an act of God.

Although it is implied that there is an opportunity for repentance, none is given. Early in the book the various punishments seem to be designed to bring forth some kind of repenting, but that point has passed and now it is time for punishment. This leads to more blasphemy, which further justifies God's punishment. Time and time again they have not given him proper glory, and this is the price that they must pay.

===Verses 10-11 ===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they did not repent of their deeds.'''''

''Commentary:''  It is not quite clear what causes the pain in this instance, but experiments have shown that prolonged total darkness can have a damaging effect on the human psyche. The fact that the Beast's kingdom was turned to dark could be why people perceive Hell as a dim place. Even so, like Pharaoh before the Exodus, the hearts of the people are hardened to the point where even supernatural events will not move them. The fact that they refule to repent to God but rather speak blasphemy indicated they recognize their punishments but refuse to give up their rebellious ways.
This judgments and the subsequent judgments of this chapter seemed aimed primarily at the beast and his Kingdom, whereas the previous judgments were of a somewhat natural nature and followed a similar structure to that of the Exodus plagues.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.'''''

''Commentary:'' The stage is set for the greatest and most famous of battles: Armageddon, so named in Verse 16. The fact the Euphrates is identified specificially could be to emphasize that this is done by a divine source. Under normal circumstances, the Euphrates is too large to dry up by way of natural causes. It is also one of the most historically significant rivers in the whole world. It was the site of the first civilization in the area of Sumer and allowed travel between lands that were too far to travel to on foot.

==Preparation for the Battle of Armageddon==

===Verses 13-14===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet,''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.'''''

''Commentary:'' These demons may be understood as the spirits of the dragon, beast, and false prophet, themselves, or as emissaries for them which go out to deal with the nations. They are corrupt, for they are described as “unclean.” They have more than convincing words with which to manipulate the earth’s leaders, but go out performing “signs.” Whatever these signs may be, they are sufficiently compelling to bring the nations together for the world’s last and greatest battle.
It maybe that frogs were a bad omen and thus an understandable image to utilize, or it may simply be that the author uses frogs to continue to refer to the plagues of Egypt, the second of which was a plague of frogs (Exodus 8:1-15).

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.”'''''

''Commentary:'' This verse is strikingly similar to Revelation 3:3:  &quot;Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.&quot;  As noted in the commentary for that verse, these words have strong allusions to the words of Jesus, as seen in Matthew 24:42-44, 1 Thessalonians 5:2-5, and 2 Peter 3:10.  However, it is important to note that  John does not specify whether these words actually come from Jesus.

The Greek word &quot;aschemosune&quot; is translated here as &quot;shame,&quot; but it is actually a euphemism for male genitalia in Jewish contexts.  Ben Witherington III notes that this image of a person being found naked symbolizes the lack of preparation for the last day (Ezekiel 23:24-29, 2 Corinthians 5:3).  He goes on to note, &quot;Captives in war were led away naked as part of their shaming.&quot;

The Lord provides some relief by saying that His day of return will come. He will come like a thief, meaning his return will not be known by any. All must wait, pray, and be prepared.

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue: Armageddon.'''''

''Commentary:'' The name is the Hebrew form of Mt. Megiddo, a location in northern Israel, though whether this exact location is implied is open to interpretation.

The location and determination of Armageddon (which also may be written with a rough breath as Har-magedon) is one of contention. Witherington notes that some consider the location to be the mountain of Megiddo, or a mountain of &quot;marauding or attack,&quot; or even Rome's seven hills. Witherington suggests that the final battle will take place at the city of Megiddo, but Beasely Murray suggests that we ignore textual indications and imagine it as an event, not a place. But if so, why has John even written a name? There is no meaningful answer.

==The Seventh Bowl==

===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The words, “It is done!”, remind us of Jesus’ last words on the cross (Jn 19:30). They are said here at the completion of the tribulation which is said to occur at the end of this age. The same words are repeated at the completion of the Last Judgment at the end of the world (21:6). Ben Witherington's commentary suggests that it is unlikely that the author of Revelation had the words of Jesus in mind, although there seems to be a parallel for the reader.

===Verse 18===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there were voices and thunders and lightenings; and there was a great earthquake and so great.''''' 

''Commentary:''
These voices are coming from Heaven. It is announcing the victory. This emphasizes the violent natural events that are occurring because of God's wrath; in fact, the earthquake is so powerful that one of such a magnitude had not ever before plagued the earth.  Lightning, thunder, and earthquakes were all believed to be caused by divine beings at the time this text was written, so it was natural for the people reading this to assume that God caused this natural event as well if one so powerful was to occur.

===Verse 19===

:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.''''' 

''Commentary:''
The great city being split into three parts may be a parallel to Zechariah 13:8, “It will come about in all the land [of Israel], declares the Lord, that two parts in it will be cut off and perish; but the third will be left in it.&quot;  It is thought that the great city is Jerusalem (Revelation 11:8).  Maybe in accordance to Zechariah, the two parts will be destroyed and one part will remain.  But, it is unclear why the third part will remain. Zechariah 14:2 refers to God leaving people in Jerusalem, and other nations will come together to destroy Jerusalem. However, Zechariah 14:5 says that God will empty Jerusalem of his people with His angles before His arrival for the battle of Armageddon. The destruction of Jerusalem will be occur in Revelation 17 and 18.
If Jerusalem is this great city, the other cities of the nations are Gentile nations, making the punishment for Jerusalem not as severe as the punishment of the Gentile nations
This is the second time that Babylon has been mentioned in Revelation.  Perhaps, God’s wrath on Babylon will be the worst the world has seen.

===Verse 20===

:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.'''''

''Commentary:'' This is a more extreme form of the sixth seal, where “every mountain and island was moved out of its place” (6:14). This could mean the seizure of seaport and fortified towns.

===Verse 21===
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And there fell upon people a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent, and people blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague thereof was exceedingly great.'''''

''Commentary:''
Witherington finds some meaning in the fact that the people, when subjected to the plagues, continue in their blasphemy rather than repenting and praising god. Perhaps what these people should be doing is praying and worshiping their oppressor. A talent is equivalent to about 3000 shekels which weigh about one hundred pounds each. The use of this word may be employed to illustrate the greatness of the ongoing oppression.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:CMS_Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|450px|A simulated collision data that creates a Higgs Boson.]]

The [[w:Higgs_boson|Higgs Boson]] theoretical particle is a focus of keen interest for [[w:Particle_physics|high-energy particle physicists]]. However, the Higgs Boson is also forging a strong bond with [[w:Cosmology|cosmologists]] that is likely to grow as the study of modern physics unfolds. Particle physicists regularly create exotic particles that have not existed abundantly and naturally since the [[w:Big_bang|earliest moments of the universe]], which has been an important step in drawing the disciplines together. The discovery of the Higgs Boson could benefit cosmology by resolving some unanswered questions in the current theory. The mutually beneficial nature of this relationship becomes more apparent as the costs rise to perform high energy particle collision experiments. The next generation of particle experiments may rely on high-energy particles from space to attain higher power collisions for a lower price. This beneficial merging of fields is being called [[w:Astroparticle_physics|Astroparticle Physics]] (or Particle Astrophysics). This chapter will focus on how the Higgs Boson is essential to both parties' theories and how they are collectively seeking to discover the elusive Higgs particle.

== What is the Higgs Boson? ==
[[File:AIP-Sakurai-best.JPG|thumb|350px|2010 Sakurai Prize Winners - Kibble, Guralnik, Hagen, Englert, and Brout, the members of the other groups that published alongside Higgs.  Higgs also was part winner, but was not pictured.]]
The Higgs component of the particle name bears no physical significance. It is named after [[w:Peter_Higgs|Peter Higgs]] who independently published results around the same time as [[w:Overview_and_differences_of_1964_PRL_symmetry_breaking_papers|two groups]] released similar and related material. In 2010, all six contributors to the Higgs theory received the [[w:Sakurai_Prize|J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics]].

The [[w:Boson|Boson]] component does bear physical significance. Bosons are a class of particles that are governed by [[w:Bose–Einstein_statistics|Bose-Einstein statistical theory]] and have the ability to occupy the same [[w:Quantum_state|quantum state]]. This behavior is disallowed by most more commonly known particles ([[w:Proton|Protons]], [[w:Neutron|Neutrons]], [[w:electron|Electrons]], which are [[w:fermion|Fermions]]) by the [[w:Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli Exclusion Principle]]. It is a mark of importance as the mediating forces are considered Bosons. This includes: [[w:photon|Photons]], [[w:gluon|Gluons]], the [[w:W_boson|W and Z]], the Higgs, and the [[w:graviton|Graviton]] (like the Higgs, currently just theoretically proposed to exist). Bosons have integer spin: the first four above have spin one, the Higgs theoretically has 0 spin, and the Graviton theoretically has spin 2.

=== And what does it do? ===
Theoretically the Higgs Boson is the particle form of the mediating [[w:Higgs_mechanism|Higgs Mechanism]], also known as the Higgs Field. The Higgs Field is supposedly responsible for the mass of all particles, and so the substance to all things in the universe. It is also a possible answer to the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter that makes our reality possible (if equal the universe would be filled only by energy). It is the only undiscovered particle of the [[w:Standard_model|Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics]]. The Higgs Mechanism is the supposed field that endows all the components of nature with [[w:mass|mass]]. Thus, if the Higgs Boson is discovered it will confirm the existence of the Higgs Mechanism which shows that the entire universe is permeated by the field and without it no object would have mass.  

A simple example with familiar terms for how it operates is a party. If someone of low social worth to those present walks in they will be largely ignored as they make their way around.  This matches a particle of little mass passing through the universe quite freely because it has less interaction with the Higgs Field.  However, if someone who is idolized by the members of the party enters, people will quickly gather around them and make it quite difficult for free motion.  This is the equivalent of massive particles that are greatly bogged down by the Higgs Field.  The only neglected component in this example is massless particles.  One could introduce them as follows: enter a small child that has utterly overdone a reasonably alloted quantity of sugar.  The participants generally ignore the child as it runs around the room easily squeezing through gaps in people barring some mishaps where the child hits a person. &lt;ref name = &quot;two&quot;&gt; Berkeley Lab: Video Glossary: Higgs Boson (http://videoglossary.lbl.gov/2009/higgs-boson/)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection of the Higgs Boson to Cosmology ==
[[File:CMB_Timeline75.jpg|thumb|400px|The timeline of the universe in a visual form including the period of inflation.]]
The Higgs Boson theoretically has an obvious link in the sense that there's a lot of massive objects in the universe from basic masses like the [[w:quark|quarks]] that comprise hadrons to our [[w:earth|Earth]], [[w:sun|Sun]], and the [[w:milky_way|Milky Way's]] [[w:Supermassive_black_hole|super-massive black hole]].  However, the connection has a deeper core than that.  

=== When the Universe was Less Massive than You ===
The title is not a lacking-class, physics-based fat joke: there's some merit to it. It is actually believed in Cosmology that there was a period early in the universe where not even Photons manifested themselves because the temperature was so great.  That is, there was no light at all in the very early universe.  This principle is believed to extend to the Higgs Boson and Mechanism as well.  This has a greatly profound implication: immediately following the Big Bang the universe had zero mass because there was nothing there to endow anything present with mass.  This was very brief (on the order of tiny fractions of a second), but a vital consideration to make for Cosmology.

This could be one potential explanation for the phenomenon of [[w:inflation_(cosmology)|inflation]] where the universe was able to expand extremely rapidly early in the universe to explain why the universe currently appears to be flat or very nearly flat despite this contradicting expectations based on models of the universe.

=== What's the [[w:antimatter|Antimatter]]? ===
[[File:080998_Universe_Content_240.jpg|thumb|The content of the universe relative to age.]]
Another problem with the Benchmark Model of the universe is that it lacks a clear explanation of why the Big Bang produced more matter than antimatter (hence the absolute lack of abundant, naturally occurring antimatter).  If it was consistent with other Laws of Physics, there would have been an absolute match in quantities that resulted in the entire matter content of the universe having annihilated with the entire antimatter content of the universe leaving essentially no matter behind.

This problem, properly titled: the [[w:Baryon_asymmetry|asymmetry of the universe]], has been delegated to be potentially caused by the Higgs Mechanism causing a minor asymmetry in the early universe that ultimately caused the matter-prevalent universe that surrounds us.  The Benchmark Model indicates the asymmetry as unimaginably small to most of us: that is, once upon a time there was 1,000,000,000 quarks, but only 999,999,997 antiquarks.  Those three bachelor quarks, when propagated over the massive quantity of material involved in the Big Bang, became all the baryonic matter we see today while the rest annihilated with their significant antiquark other.  &lt;ref name = &quot;three&quot;&gt; Barbara Ryden, Introduction to Cosmology. San Francisco: Addison Wesley Company, 2003. p.188.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rouses another curiosity of Dark Matter, much of which is believed to be non-baryonic (essentially: isn't made of Protons and Neutrons that comprise the elements of the [[w:periodic_table|Periodic Table]] which, in turn, comprise all the molecules that represent everything someone not delving deeply into Physics needs to know about).  A pressing question for the near-future of Cosmology: what exactly is this large quantity of matter not comprised of the remains of asymmetry that appears to be present (by observations) in a quantity five times larger than the baryonic matter that comprises everything we know?  But that's a digression from this chapter and fairly unfamiliar ground to even the boundaries of Physics at this point.

== Where in the World is the Higgs Boson? ==
[[File:LHC.svg|thumb|250px|A map of the LHC particle accelerators with experiments labelled.]]
So, this particle seems pretty important towards the greater fate of the universe, how are this Physicists coming together to find it?  This is where the chapter probably gets more familiar as the [[w:LHC|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] has been greatly popularized in recent years as the &quot;Big Bang Machine.&quot;  It's not the first, but it's the shiny new, fast, and powerful accelerator on the block that will, if it exists, be able to provide the energies necessary to create it for sure whereas its predecessors wouldn't if it's heavier than expected.  But first, lets explain how the search works before detailing the handful of experiments that are working, perhaps competing is a better term, to be the first to find it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Observing stars we can calculate their velocity, orbital recession, magnitude and distance using simple physics. The stars rotating in a given galaxy show two different types of motion depending on their distance from the center of the galaxy. The stars closer to the center of the galaxy exhibit the rigid body motion where all the stars have the same period of rotation. However the more distant stars show the differential rotation where each of them have their own separate period of rotation.

As can be seen in the graph above the rotational velocity ‘v’ of the stars do not fall off with the with the distance from the center of the system, but is rather slowly rising with the radius. According to the data we should have ten times more mass then what we can see to account for the observed velocities. Something must be there and that is what astrophysicists refer to as dark matter. These are the stellar objects that are too dim to be detected directly using current technology. These objects don’t emit, absorb or scatter light at all. Stellar remnants such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) predicted by the Standard Model of Particle Physics and neutrinos qualify as dark matters.

&lt;/center&gt;


This lesson will deal with simple conversation topics such as greeting people, saying goodbye, and asking people how they are feeling, the alphabet, and nominative case pronouns and articles. This lesson also has soundbites so that you can learn how to pronounce everything, including the alphabet and some introductory verbs.

==Hellos and Goodbyes in Englisc==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Greetings|Grüße|144|2}}
|-
|Hello!||Hallo!*
|-
|||''Morgen!''
|-
|||''G'Mor'n!'' &lt;small&gt;(shorter)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|||''Mor'n!''  
|-
|||''Grœt Godd!''
|-
|||''Servus!'' &lt;small&gt;(informal)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|||''Hi!'' &lt;small&gt;(pronounced as in English, although colloquial and only used by the younger generation)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|Good morning!||Goden Morgen!*
|-
|||''Morgen!'' &lt;small&gt;(shorter)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|Good day!||Goden Dæȝ!*
|-
|||''G'Dæȝ!'' &lt;small&gt;(shorter)&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|Good evening!||Goden Æfen!*
|-             
|Goodbye!||Wes haal!*
|-
|See you later!||Oþ lætter!*, Oþ þann!*
|-
|Good night!||Gode Niht!*/Gode Naht!*
|}

You will need to know each expression with an asterisk (*) after it. The others, of course, would be useful to know if you are traveling to regions where they are used. 

===Formal and Informal Greetings in Englisc===
Englisc speakers respect higher authority with their choice of certain phrases. The more formal phrases above are ''Goden Morgen'', ''Goden Dæȝ'', and ''Oþ lætter'' (as well as ''Grœt Godd''). The least formal one is ''Wes haal''. The others are neutral on the formal - informal scale.



Here are some examples:

* ''Claudia'': Goden Morgen, Herr Wagner!&lt;br/&gt;
*''Herr Wagner'': Hallo, Claudia!

*''Birgit'': Sei gesund, Susi!&lt;br/&gt;
*''Susi'': Bis lætter, Birgit!


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Mr. &amp; Ms.|Herr und Frau|0|2}}
|-
|Mr.||Herr
|-
|Mrs.||Hlafdiȝ/Kwene, Frowe
|-
|Miss||Mæȝþ, Mæȝden, Frœwen
|}
There is a small distinction in the words for women.  A Hlafdiȝ is a married woman without children, while a Kwene has children.  A Mæȝden is a young, unmarried woman, typically teenagers and early twenties, while Mæȝþ is for any woman over 21 who is not married.  Some people use Frowe for all married women, and Frœwen for any unmarried woman, though Frowe is properly the generic for 'woman.'


==The Englisc Alphabet==

The 32 letters in both Englisc and English are shown above. One, the ligature ƕ (hwair), is used in case 'hw' shows up at the beginning of a word, and is mostly encountered in the written language as a shortcut to writing out the 'h' and the 'w'.  Also, in words such as Hring and hlahhen, the 'hr' and 'hl' are often written together as well.

Another difference between Englisc and English is the '''Umlaut'''. The vowels a, o, and u can take an umlaut (in the form of æ, œ, and y). The Umlaut changes the sound of the vowel. For pronunciations of all the letters, go to the [[NiwEnglisc/Appendices/Alphabet|pronunciation guide]].  The umlauted 'u' is sometimes written with a single-dotted y, as in ẏ.  

'''Notes''': 
 
*In writing, the Umlaute are sometimes substituted with the vowel plus e, i.e ae, oe and ue. 
*In typing, the umlauted vowels are sometimes substituted with the German umlauted vowels ä, ö, and ü.  However, if you have no way to type Umlaute you ''must'' use vowel-plus-e.

==&lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Nominative Case&lt;/font&gt;==

Cases describe what a noun or pronoun does in a sentence. When a noun or pronoun is the subject of a sentence, it is considered to be in the '''nominative case'''. For example, in the sentence &quot;I ate an apple&quot;, '''I''' is the subject and the '''apple''' is the direct object. You will learn more about cases as the course continues.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{NiwEnglisc table|Grammar|Subject Pronouns|Subjekt-Fornamen|87|4}}

'''Note:''' There ''are'' possessive pronouns in Englisc, they just don't apply here. For instance, &quot;Mein Name is...&quot; would not be considered correct.

==Verbs==

You have already learned one verb: hæten, to be called.  It is the only verb with a passive form, &quot;hatte.&quot;  The active form means &quot;to command, order&quot; as in &quot;I had him get my drink&quot; (Ic heht hin mein Gedrink getten).

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Hu gæþ't?|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Articles==

Englisc, like many other languages, gives each noun a gender: '''Masculine''', '''Feminine''' or '''Neuter'''. '''Plural'''  is easy; the definite nominative Article is always ''þie''. And as in English there is no indefinite article in plural. Nouns in plural form require different verb forms than nouns in singular. 

In English, there are two different types of articles: definite (the) and indefinite (a and an). Englisc is the same, except that there are four different articles of each type. The nominitive case articles are as follows:
===Definite Articles===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{NiwEnglisc table|Grammar|The Definite Article in the Nominative Case|Þe definitive Artikel þes Nominativ|0|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''singular'''||''masculine''||þe||þe Knafe||the boy

|''feminine''||þie||þie Frowe||the woman

|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot; |'''plural'''||||rowspan=&quot;3&quot; |þie||þie Knafen||the boys
|-
|||þie Frowen||the women
|-
|||þie Mæȝden||the girls
|}
* '''Note''' that girl is neuter.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Articles|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Forming Questions==

The basic word order in an Englisc sentence is the same as in English: Subject verb Objects. (SvO)

*''Þe Knafe pleȝþ Fotball.
:The boy plays football.

This sentence is in the ''indicative mood'', the mood that states a fact. The ''interrogative mood'' asks a question. To change the English sentence &quot;The boy throws the ball&quot; to the interrogative mood, we insert the helper verb &quot;does&quot; before &quot;boy,&quot; ending with,&quot;?&quot;. &quot;Does the boy throw the ball?&quot;

The process is very similar in Englisc. However, since Englisc verbs express both the simple and progressive aspects, we '''switch the whole verb with the subject''', ending up with, 

*&quot;''Pleȝþ þer Knafe Fotball?''&quot;
: Does the boy play football?

You have learned two questions so far: &quot;Hu hatte...?&quot; and &quot;Hu gæþ't?&quot;. In Englisc, there are two basic ways of forming a question. The first is the method described above. In addition to this, you can use an ''interrogative adverb''...


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Questions|Fragen|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
| Who?||Hwa? 
|- 
| What?||Hwat?
|-
| Where?||Hwær?
|-
| When?||Hwenn?
|-
| Why?||Hwy?
|-
| How?||Hu?
|-
| Which||Hwilc?
|}


The question &quot;Hu hatte...?&quot;, literally translated, means &quot;How is ... called?&quot;, though the latter is a sentence no native-English speaker would ever say (the correct English equivalent of the Englisc being &quot;What is ... called?&quot;). That is why it does not contain ''Was'' (&quot;Hwat hatte...?&quot; means something like &quot;What do you mean...?!&quot;) . These words come first in the sentence; the word order is: Interr. Adverb Verb Subject Object. For example:

*''Hwy pleȝþ þe Knafe Fotball?'' 
:Why does the boy play football?

You should note at this point that in Englisc, '''the verb always comes second in the sentence''', except in the case of a question as described above. '''The subject is always next to the verb, if not in front of it then following it.''' For example:

*''Þe Knafe pleȝde am Monendæȝ Fotball.'' 
:The boy played football on Monday.

*''Am Monendæȝ pleȝde þe Knafe Fotball.'' 
:On Monday, the boy played football.

At this point, you should know the words for &quot;yes&quot;, ''ȝa'' and &quot;no&quot;, ''na'' respectively. There is also an emphatic &quot;Yes!&quot; called ''ȝese!''

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Forming Questions|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==What's On the Test?==

To go straight to the lesson test, go [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Hu hattest þu?/Test|here]].
&lt;!--
The test consists of four parts: Grammar (18 points), Translation (34 points), Reading Comprehension (20 points) and Vocabulary (28 points). The Grammar section will test your ability to conjugate verbs according to the given infinitive and subject. You will also need to know the articles of certain nouns. 

The Translation section is worth the most points, and it too has two sections. You must translate the sentences and phrases from English to Englisc and vice versa.

The third section, Reading Comprehension, will be all &quot;Fill in the Blanks&quot;. You will get two dialogues and be asked to fill in the blanks with respect to them. Some of the hardest parts deal with the greetings, so make sure you remember these.

The last section is the Vocabulary section. You will get 28 English words on the left and 28 Englisc words on the right, and be asked to match them accordingly. That is the whole test. [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Hu hattest þu?/Test|Take it!]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Babylon the Great==

===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, “Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great whore that sits upon many waters,''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.'''''

''Commentary:''
The phrase, &quot;Many waters,&quot; may be a reference to images of the city, Babylon, which had extensive irrigation systems.  Others who believe that this chapter of the Book of Revelation refers Rome, believe that this phrase could in fact refer to various ethnic groups of people, who were subjected to Rome's rule.  From Rome's founding, the city, the Republic, the Empire has organized a variety of people.  The first groups to be included were the Romans themselves, the neighboring Latins and Etruscans, then Greeks, Germans, Franks, Celts, and Jews.  Additionally, Rome's legal tradition supports this idea because at various point in Roman history, citizenship was extended to yet another group of people under Roman influence.  If the image of water is then taken one step further to say that water represent the life of this city, then the comparison to Rome and its diverse citizenship still makes logical sense.  The Romans, though very traditional with respect to the fact that they would retain practices and offices that were superfluous and relatively defunct, were adept at gleaning useful cultural aspects from any group they encountered.  One such example would be the way in which Rome adopted the Greek Pantheon and Egyptian gods like Isis into the Roman religion.  IN this way, it is possible to say that the various ethnic groups over which Rome presided kept Rome alive culturally.

Harlot is a common Old Testament term to apply to cities, including Jerusalem when the people were idolatrous. It is no coincidence that Babylon is used as an example, since it was the ruling power in the book of Daniel, which also features apocalyptic literature. The language of whoring and unfaithfulness is also used in other Old Testament prophetic books such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. Some make the argument that other kings’ patronage to Rome was like “getting into bed with” her, while others see this reference as purely referring to idolatry, specifically emperor worship. This also would include the worship of Roma, which was the goddess of the city of Rome. The image of Rome as a woman sitting on seven hills may come from a coin originally minted by Vespasian in which Rome was depicted as a goddess sitting on seven hills. Here it has been distorted in order to decry the mythical status of the Roman Emperor. &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns.'''''

''Commentary:'' The beast from the sea in Chapter 13 and the dragon of Chapter 12 are also described as having seven heads and ten horns, which implies that these three (Satan, the Antichrist, and Babylon) are connected. As noted in chapter 12, it may be that Satan is the spiritual driving force, the Antichrist is the emperor, and Babylon is the empire. The scarlet color of the Beast may be to represent royalty since scarlets, purples, and reds were colors used often by weathly and royalty people in Rome. These colors were also worn by prostitutes. Alternatively the scarlet color might be meant to refer back to the color of the dragon referred to in Revelation 12:3.

Witherington argues that John has not been carried away into the desert, and that he has not literally traveled to the desert, but that this wording symbolizes an ecstatic experience.

Witherington considers verious origins for the witch of Babylon: that it is a reference to the chaos monster Tiamat, a female Babylonian deity; that it reflects the worship of Magna Mater; or that Cybele, the Roman form of Magna Mater whose cult holydays were sordid affairs; or that it reflects the worship of Rome as the goddess Roma.

===Verses 4-5===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, and had a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And upon her forehead was a name written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.'''''

''Commentary:''
The woman's name is revealed in this verse as Babylon. Babylon is the &quot;great city&quot; that was split into three parts. It represents sin and persecution. By her being named Babylon, she is associated with all these things. She is the mother of prostitutes as her offspring has the same characterization of her. The name Babylon comes from the Greek word &quot;Babal.&quot; The Hebrew form of Babel, Balal, means &quot;to confuse.&quot;

The woman is depicted with expensive jewelry. These jewels are likely to represent the riches of the world. She also has a golden cup in her hand filled with all the filthy acts she had done. This cup is the very dangerous because it is filled with acts derived by Satan. This woman is trying to deceive others. 

Roman patricians and office holders typically wore scarlet or purple robes. Expensive whores did too, and the whores also wore headbands with their names written across the forehead of them.

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, and when I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.'''''

''Commentary:''
Not only is she herself drunk, but she makes other drunk. It is said that to be drunk off the blood of saints is to hunger and thirst for violence and peril. She sits upon the beast while he wages war against the saints. John is not to be interpreted here as being amazed by the woman's beauty, but is astonished by the immorality of Roman culture.

A second option takes a more figurative approach to this passage. Perhaps the woman is not actually drunk in the sense of our modern-day understanding of the term, but drunk, meaning satiated. It could be a reference to the prophetic book of Ezekiel, passage 39:18-19, where God says the birds will be drunk on blood. It actually means that they will drink blood until they are satisfied, symbolizing a great number of deaths.

==The Angel Explains the Vision==

===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the angel said to me, “Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition, and those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.”'''''

''Commentary:''  Verse 7 suggests that John is so amazed by this sight that the angel has to the angels stops to explain exactly what is happening.  The Greek word &quot;thauma&quot; suggests that John was flabbergasted, astounded, and even confused.

Verse 8  seems to be foreshadowing the upcoming events in Chapter 20. It concludes with the words &quot;[He] was, and is not, and yet is.&quot;  This suggests that the figure in question existed in the past, does not exist at the time of writing, but will exist again in the future (i.e., he will rise again).  The last verb is &quot;parestai&quot; in Greek, which is a form of Parousia, referring to the second coming of Christ.  Ben Witherington II suggests that the use of this verb is extremely significant.  As he notes, &quot;[John] is suggesting two things:  (1) the figure in question obviously had made some sort of claims to divinity, but the joke is that at present &quot;he is not.&quot;  What kind of deity ceases to exist?; and (2) his second coming, like the real second coming, will mean bad news for many.&quot;  Some may joke that John is suggesting Nero will one day return, but he is likely just drawing on general ideas of a anti-Christ.

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The seven heads represent the seven hills of Rome hence the reference to the mountains.  To any ancient reader, the reference to seven mountains would have easily been noticed as the hills.  They also represent the leaders of the Empire:  &quot;five have fallen, one is living, and the other has yet to come.&quot;

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And there are seven kings: five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come, and when he comes, he must continue for a short time.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The context has led interpreters to asssociate the seven kings with the seven heads of the beast in the previous passage, but a careful reading of the passage shows that this connection is not explicit, but only assumed. After the description of the heads, the author merely says, &quot;And there are seven kings...&quot; It is left to the interpreter to decide if these constitute a second level of symbolism for the heads of the beast, or if they are, in fact, something else. The next verse (11) suggests the latter, for it speaks of one of the seven coming back as the eighth, and it refers to it as a ''beast'', not as a ''head'' of a beast.

According to the preterist interpretation, the seven kings are the succession of Roman emperors up to the time of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. There were actually nine emperors during this period, as follows:  Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. However, if we subtract Galba, Otho, and Vitellius from the list, who all ruled less than a year, we would then be left with a total of six. Some scholars also argue that Julius Caesar was really the first Roman emperor, not Augustus as recorded by the Roman historians.&lt;ref&gt;Mounce, pg.315-316&lt;/ref&gt; If we add him to the list, we  have the required seven. The emperor about whom the author says, &quot;one is,&quot; would be Nero, under whose reign a persecution of Christians took place between about 64 and 68 AD. He would be the sixth and current emperor, and if we leave out his three short-term successors, Vespasian would be the seventh who ruled during the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 70 AD. 

The only remaining issue is the identity of the eighth emperor of verse 11, &quot;the beast that was, and is not,&quot; who &quot;is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven.&quot; The quote implies that one of the first seven emperors will also be the eighth, but actually Titus (79-81 AD) ruled after Vespasian, and none of the emperors mentioned above was ever reinstated. Titus was Vespasian's son, however, as was Domitian, who succeeded Titus.

According to the historicist and futurist interpretations (the latter ties in with v. 11), the kings are not emperors, but empires. Many scholars believe that Israel is a key to understanding Biblical prophecy. Applying that principle here, we can interpret the kings as representing the seven nations which have ruled over Israel (not the land, but the people) during its history. The empire about which the angel says, “One is,” is Rome, which ruled Israel in John’s time. The angel says, “Five have fallen.” These are the empires which had formerly ruled Israel: Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Greece. Together with Rome, these account for six of the seven. At the time of writing, the seventh had “not yet come.” Since then, the Ottoman Empire has ruled over Palestine, but not the people of Israel, who were dispersed among the nations during Ottoman rule. They began to trickle back in the late 19th century, but the trickle turned to a flood after Britain conquered Palestine in WWI. The British ruled Israel from 1917 until Israel's independence in 1948 (see [[w:British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]). True to the prophecy, British rule lasted only “a short time.” It is deeply significant, however, because it means that all seven of the empires have now come and gone. The time is ripe for the eighth empire mentioned in the next verse.

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.”'''''

''Commentary:'' One of the empires mentioned above (see v10) will be revived in some form. This is usually equated with the empire of the Antichrist (see ch 13). The phrase, &quot;goes into perdition,&quot; indicates that its end will not be a happy one.

Much debate surrounds who the previous seven rulers are and, thus, the identity of the eighth. Starting with Julius Caesar, Nero is the sixth. This interpretation entails that the book was written while Nero was reigning, which Ben Witherington III states is not impossible despite the absence of a &quot;return of Nero&quot; myth during his life. If counting rulers begins with Augustus, the count does not lead up to Domitian. Starting with Nero ends with Domitian as the seventh. Others suggest that the eighth could be an eschatological anti-Christ. Witherington III urges readers to view the number &quot;seven&quot; as symbolic of a full set of rulers.

===Verses 12-13===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet, but will receive power as kings one hour with the beast. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;These have one mind, and will give their power and strength to the beast.”'''''

''Commentary:'' S. Friesen suggests that John's jeremiad is directed as much or more to local interests than the emperor. Witherington imagines that these ten horns may be provincial governors in Asia Minor, or &quot;Parthian satraps invading Rome and led by the returned Nero.&quot;

The ten kings, at midpoint of the tribulation, will forgo their power and the beast, who represents the Antichrist, will gain this power over the kingdoms. The &quot;one mind&quot; suggests that all of the kingdoms will come together giving the beast greater power to try and overcome Christ. Daniel 7:25 confirms this when it states, &quot;He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.&quot;

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“They will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and those who are with him are called, chosen, and faithful.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Waging war against the lamb shows that there is a purpose of the ten kings.  Together they have a united attitude toward the lamb.  However, the lamb defeating the ten kings includes defeating the beast.  The title of “Lord of lords and King of kings” is also given to the rider of the white horse in chapter 19:16.  The terms “called” and “chosen” are Greek terms klatos and eklektos which are only used in this passage of Revelation, but they also occur in Matthew 22:14.

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and languages.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The angel explains the mysterious woman to John. Initially the identity of the women was revealed as &quot;the great harlot who sits on many waters&quot; (verse 1) and the first beast sprung out from these same waters (Rev. 13:1+). The use of a fourfold descriptor of peoples, multidues, nations, and language, it may be that the woman's influence spans globally.

===Verses 16-17===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these will hate the whore, and make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire,''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for God has put it in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Revelation does not clearly indicate why the kings (10 horns) hate the whore and destroy her. The reasons may be religious, pecuniary, or political.

make her ... eat her ... burn her: 

make her desolate- brought to ruin

and naked- stripped completely of fineries and riches

eat her flesh- an all consuming harm to flesh

burn her with fire- consuming and as if she's burned at the stakes

The destruction of the whore is purposeful, fierce, and comprehensive.

This verse indicates that the members of the evil empire are not consistently united in their purpose. They will war among themselves in their quest for power and wealth.

===Verse 18===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Together with 17:9, this verse appears to refer to the city of Rome. In 17:9, we are told that the seven heads of the beast &quot;are seven mountains on which the woman sits” (17:9). The angel now tells us that the woman who sits on the beast &quot;is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.” Babylon, then, is associated with a city. That city was the head of a great empire in John’s time, for it “reigns over the kings of the earth,” and it is located on seven mountains. Rome was the capital of the empire in John’s time, and it is a well-known fact that it is built on seven hills.

Witherington suggests that this chapter is an attempt to satirize Rome, mocking its self made myths of a divine emperor and his eternal city in much the same vein as a political cartoon does today.  The author may even have a specific image of Rome in mind, that which appeared on a circulating bronze coin of Roma sitting on its seven hills.

We must be open to multiple levels of symbolism here, however, for the chapter also tells us that the seven heads represent seven rulers (17:10). It may be that the seven mountains are seven empires over which these rulers have power. Or, as in the preterist interpretation, the heads may be a succession of Roman emperors. As with the best allegorical writing, the symbolism can operate on multiple levels simultaneously.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I disagree with the following text
----

'''&quot;An SR (Set/Reset) flip-flop is perhaps the simplest flip-flop, and is very similar to the SR latch, other than for the fact that it only transitions on clock edges.&quot;'''
----

A simple SR latch is level sensitive. A gated(or clocked if the Enable input is connected to a clock signal) SR latch is also level sensitive.It only adds one more level of control of the output.
According to many textbooks an SR Flip-Flop is sensitive to clock edges only when it is connected with well-known master-slave configuration.
So, the above text is confusing. It implies, that an SR Flip-Flop is similar to the SR Latch with the only difference being the type of sensitivity.It must be clarified.

The '''Apache HTTP Server''', commonly referred to as '''Apache''', is the most successful [[w:web server|web server]] software. In 2009 it became the first web server software to surpass the 100 million web site milestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;100millionsites&quot;&gt;[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html February 2009 Web Server Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; Apache was the first viable alternative to the Netscape Communications Corporation web server (currently known as [[w:Sun Java System Web Server|Sun Java System Web Server]]), and has since evolved to rival other [[Unix]]-based web servers in terms of functionality and performance. The majority of web servers using Apache run a Unix-like operating system like [[Linux]].

Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. The application is available for a wide variety of operating systems, including Unix, GNU, the [[Guide to Unix/BSD|BSDs]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris]], Novell NetWare, [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and more. Released under the Apache License, Apache is characterized as open source software.

Since April 1996 Apache has been the most popular HTTP server software in use. As of February 2010 Apache served over 54.46% of all websites and over 66% of the million busiest.&lt;ref name=&quot;netcraft&quot;&gt;[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2010/02/22/february_2010_web_server_survey.html February 2010 Web Server Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

The software license under which software from the Apache Foundation is distributed is a distinctive part of the Apache HTTP Server's history and presence in the open source software community. The Apache License allows for the distribution of both open and closed source derivatives of the source code.

The Free Software Foundation does not consider the Apache License to be compatible with version 2 of the GPL in that software licensed under the Apache License cannot be integrated with software that is distributed under the GPL:

{{quotation|This is a free software license but it is incompatible with the GPL. The Apache Software License is incompatible with the GPL because it has a specific requirement that is not in the GPL: it has certain patent termination cases that the GPL does not require. We don't think those patent termination cases are inherently a bad idea, but nonetheless they are incompatible with the GNU GPL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html Various Licenses and Comments about Them] from GNU&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, version 3 of the GPL includes a provision (Section 7e) which allows it to be compatible with licenses that have patent retaliation clauses, including the Apache License.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Performance ==
Although the main design goal of Apache is not to be the &quot;fastest&quot; web server, Apache does have performance comparable to other &quot;high-performance&quot; web servers. Instead of implementing a single architecture, Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules (MPMs) which allow Apache to run in a process-based, hybrid (process and thread) or event-hybrid mode, to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure. This implies that the choice of correct MPM and the correct configuration is important. Where compromises in performance need to be made, the design of Apache is to reduce latency and increase throughput, relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Features ==
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. Some common language interfaces support [[../mod_perl/|Perl]], [[../mod_python/|Python]], [[Tcl]], and [[PHP]]. Popular authentication modules include [[../mod_access/]], [[../mod_auth/]], [[../mod_digest/]], and [[../mod_auth_digest/]], the successor to mod_digest. A sample of other features include [[../SSL/]] and [[../TLS/]] support ([[../mod_ssl/]]), a proxy module ([[../mod_proxy/]]), a URL rewriter (implemented under [[../mod_rewrite/]]), custom log files ([[../mod_log_config/]]), and filtering support ([[../mod_include/]] and [[../mod_ext_filter/]]).

Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, [[/mod_gzip/]], implemented to help with reduction of the size of web pages served over HTTP. ModSecurity is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for web applications. Apache logs can be analyzed through a web browser using free scripts such as AWStats/W3Perl or Visitors.

[[../Virtual hosting/]] allows one Apache installation to serve many different actual websites. For example, one machine with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve www.example.com, www.test.com, test47.test-server.test.com, etc.

Apache features configurable error messages, DBMS-based authentication databases, and content negotiation. It is also supported by several graphical user interfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History and name ==

The first version of the Apache web server software was created by Robert McCool, who was heavily involved with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications web server, known simply as NCSA HTTPd. When McCool left NCSA in mid-1994, the development of httpd stalled, leaving a variety of patches for improvements circulating through e-mails. These patches were provided by a number of other developers besides McCool, and they thus helped to form the original &quot;Apache Group&quot;.

There have been two explanations of the project's name. According to the Apache Foundation, the name was chosen out of respect for the Native American tribe of [[w:Apache|Apache]] (Indé), well-known for their endurance and their skills in warfare. However, the original FAQ on the Apache Server project's website, from 1996 to 2001, claimed that &quot;The result after combining [the NCSA httpd patches] was ''a patchy server''. The first explanation was supported at an Apache Conference and in an interview in 2000 by Brian Behlendorf, who said that the name connoted &quot;Take no prisoners. Be kind of aggressive and kick some ass&quot;. Behlendorf then contradicted this in a 2007 interview, stating that &quot;The Apache server isn't named in honor of Geronimo's tribe&quot; but that so many revisions were sent in that &quot;the group called it 'a patchy Web server'&quot;. Both explanations are probably appropriate.

Version 2 of the Apache server was a substantial re-write of much of the Apache 1.x code, with a strong focus on further modularization and the development of a portability layer, the [[Apache Portable Runtime]]. The Apache 2.x core has several major enhancements over Apache 1.x. These include UNIX threading, better support for non-Unix platforms (such as Microsoft Windows), a new Apache API, and [[IPv6]] support. The first alpha release of Apache 2 was in March 2000, with the first general availability release on April 6, 2002.

Version 2.2 introduced a more flexible authorization API. It also features improved cache modules and proxy modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Apache is primarily used to serve both static content and dynamic Web pages on the World Wide Web. Many web applications are designed expecting the environment and features that Apache provides.

Apache is redistributed as part of various proprietary software packages including the Oracle Database and the IBM WebSphere application server. Mac OS X integrates Apache as its built-in web server and as support for its WebObjects application server. It is also supported in some way by Borland in the Kylix and Delphi development tools. Apache is included with Novell NetWare 6.5, where it is the default web server. Apache is included with many Linux distributions.

Apache is used for many other tasks where content needs to be made available in a secure and reliable way. One example is sharing files from a personal computer over the Internet. A user who has Apache installed on their desktop can put arbitrary files in Apache's document root which can then be shared.

Programmers developing web applications often use a locally installed version of Apache in order to preview and test code as it is being developed.

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is the main competitor to Apache, followed by Sun Microsystems' Sun Java System Web Server and a host of other applications such as Zeus Web Server.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''mod_perl''' is an optional module for Apache. It embeds a [[Perl]] interpreter into the Apache server, so that dynamic content produced by Perl scripts can be served in response to incoming requests, without the significant overhead of re-launching the Perl interpreter for each request. As Lincoln D. Stein defined mod_perl in his words:

{{quotation|mod_perl is more than CGI scripting on steroids. It is a whole new way to create dynamic content by utilizing the full power of the Apache web server to create stateful sessions, customized user authentication systems, smart proxies and much more. Yet, magically, your old CGI scripts will continue to work and work very fast indeed. With mod_perl you give up nothing and gain so much!}}

mod_perl can emulate a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) environment, so that existing Perl CGI scripts can benefit from the performance boost without having to be re-written.

Unlike CGI (and most other web application environments), mod_perl provides complete access to the Apache API, allowing programmers to write handlers for all phases in the Apache request cycle, manipulate Apache's internal tables and state mechanisms, share data between Apache processes or threads, alter or extend the Apache configuration file parser, and add Perl code to the configuration file itself, among other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Fall of Babylon the Great==

===Verse 1===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was illuminated with his glory.'''''

''Commentary:''
This angel is described as producing his own radiance, an attribute often given to God.  This sharing of a divine characteristic shows the angel’s importance, which in turn points to the importance of his message.  The following lament for the city, however, is in John’s words, not those of the angel.  Whether or not one believes that John actually saw visions, it seems clear he reflected on them before committing them to writing.  The saturation of Old Testament imagery (see primarily, Is 13, 34: Jer 51; Ezk 26-28, and Nah 3), shows the reader as much the inner workings of John’s head as it does the actual vision itself.   &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
Verses 1-3 refer to the city as already fallen, but latter in verses 4-8 the scene seems to be taken place in present.

===Verses 2-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, “Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and the prison of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird,''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for all nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.”'''''

''Commentary:''  The repetition of the word fallen alludes to Isaiah's announcement where he declares twice: &quot;Babylon has fallen, has fallen&quot; (Isaiah 21:9). The repetition emphasizes the promise of what God said He would do and that's bring judgment upon Babylon. 

The Greek word &quot;phulake&quot; is translated here as &quot;prison,&quot; but it could also refer to a &quot;watchtower.&quot;  In any event, this verse conveys that the city is in a state of utter desolation.  Quite simply, it has been destroyed and made the home of demons, foul spirits, and unclean birds (e.g., vultures).  It is important to note that other translations, such as the New Revised Standard Version, utilize the word &quot;haunt&quot; here.  The NRSV reads, &quot;It has become a dwelling place of demons, a haunt of every foul spirit, a haunt of every foul bird, and a haunt of every foul and hateful beast.&quot;  This description has strong allusions to Jeremiah 51:37 and Isaiah 34:11-15. The city was filled with demon infestation and inhabitants were held captive under the harlot's spell. The offering of immorality and sin 'without consequence' is provided.

It should also be noted that the &quot;fornication&quot; the kings of the earth have committed does not refer to literal sexual intercourse.  This metaphor is utilized numerous times throughout the book of Revelation.

The reason behind the judgment brought down upon Babylon is found in verse 3. Babylon's influence was comprehensive. Simply put the punishment was due to the idolatry of materialism and greed in Babylon. It's important to note that the sin was not obtaining prosperity and wealth, but rather the pursuit of such where it becomes an idol replacing God.

===Verses 4-5===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, so that you do not partake of her sins, and so that you do not receive her plagues,''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.”'''''

''Commentary:''

This could be a proclamation to leave Rome, if the reader believes that John knows that Rome will fall. However, Rome was doing well at the time and in no real danger of falling. This statement could then be a call for the reader to refuse to partake in the sins of room, such as excess, gluttony, and other various types of immorality that go against Christian teaching. Since it is made clear at many points in the book that Rome is evil, this passage would be redundant if that was its only purpose. However, if it is a warning against types of sin then it has a more specific purpose, although it still fits with the larger theme of righteousness throughout the book.
There is another voice that comes from Heaven and that is Jesus. Jesus is speaking to people leaving under the captivity of Babylon and telling them to not give in to her allurements.

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“Reward her even as she rewarded you, and repay her double according to her works. In the cup which she has filled, fill to her double.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Here is ancient law of lex talionis -- eye for an eye -- which echoes throughout the book of Revelation.  This concept of justice is founded upon the principle that the punishment must meet and not exceed the crime. The first part o f this verse is written much like the sermons of Jesus Christ in the Gospels (Matthew 5-7).  In addition, the context of this verse resembles something that Christ would say in a sermon or teaching.  The phrase &quot;double according to her works&quot; denotes full requital as seen in Jer. 16.18, 17.18, 50.29. This verse carries along a recurring motif of divine retribution. Witherington III adds that it indicates &quot;divine ''lex talionis'' and, in particular, that the punishment should be fit for the crime.&quot;

While this verse may very well be an excellent example of &quot;eye for an eye&quot; justice, this particular discourse is more often than not, associated with the Old Testament. For example, God's justice takes the form of plague very similar to those in the Book of Revelation when Moses attempts to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.  Throughout the vast majority of the New Testament, Jesus' teachings focus on moving beyond this sort of archaic justice to a structure of forgiveness.  If this is the tone that the majority of the New Testament, it is interesting that this verse in particular, and, in general, the rest of the Book of Revelation, departs so sharply from the prevailing tone.

===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“As much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, that much torment and sorrow give her, for she says in her heart, ‘I sit as a queen, and am no widow, and will see no sorrow.’''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Therefore will her plagues come in one day: death, mourning, and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The amount of suffering she will endure is equivalent to the amount of pride she possesses. It is also ironic how quickly the plagues come upon her because she is a majestic city with much power. This city is home to all seven kings/kingdoms, yet it only takes God one day to destroy her. And the plagues that will befall the city are listed clearly: death, mourning, and famine. However strong she believed herself to be because of her connection with the dragon, God is stronger and will conquer all. 

The fact the town is burned with fire could be referring to the experience of Rome under Nero's rule.

==The World Mourns for Babylon==

===Verses 9-10===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will wail and lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning.''''' &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city, for in one hour is your judgment come.’”'''''

''Commentary:''
The kings mentioned in verse 9 are most likely the 10 kings who rule the kingdom of the Antichrist. Here again is lex talionis: just as the kings have warred with the lamb for one hour in Rev 17.12-14, so judgment comes in a single hour when the cty of Babylon will fall. This in turn represents the destruction and fall of evil.  

===Verses 11-14===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:''''' &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, citron wood, all kinds of objects of ivory, all kinds of objects of wood, brass, iron, marble,''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''cinnamon, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, animals, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves, and people’s souls.''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the fruits that your soul lusted after are departed from you, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from you, and you will find them no more at all.”'''''

''Commentary:''
These verses list all items that were imported into Rome.  It is interesting to note that the gifts given to Jesus Christ upon his birth are also listed here (gold, frankincense, and myrrh).  Also, more importantly pointing to Rome is the sense that human slaves were trafficked.  During this time, it was a common practice to trade slaves that were mainly acquired from war with there being approximately 60 million slaves in Rome at the time of this writing.  Also, its important to note that all these items were considered luxury items imported to Rome that only the wealthy could afford. We may compare this product listing with Tyre's listed luxurious items from Ezekiel 27.2-24.

===Verses 15-17a ===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“The merchants of these things who were made rich by her will stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls,''''' &lt;sup&gt;17a&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for in one hour such great riches have come to nothing.’”''''' 

''Commentary:''
The merchants who have continuously ripped off their customers with extremely high prices will no longer be able to sell. In a sense, their materialistic ways will be cut off, and come to have no value. 

===Verses 17b-19 ===
&lt;sup&gt;17b&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And every shipmaster, and all who travel in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off''''' &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like to this great city?’''''' &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, ‘Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships in the sea were made rich because of her wealth, for in one hour she has been made desolate.’”'''''

''Commentary:''
The fall of the city comes very quickly and God is taking his revenge for those sinners and murders of his prophet.

==The Completeness of Babylon’s Destruction==

===Verse 20===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her.”'''''

''Commentary:''
These are four groups called to rejoice in the judgment of God.  It is rejoicing in God’s wrath of the evil and bringing of justice.  “Oh heaven” is a figure of speech in which Heaven is a person.  Saints are people of God, believers in general since apostles and prophets are also mentioned.  It is likely that Apostles refer to the twelve desciples (excluding Judas, including Paul) in this context.   Prophets could indicate just Old Testament prophets, or both Old and New Testament prophets.  The word ''kirma '' likely refers to judgment as passed by a judge.  Thus Rome is being judged for the martyrs she has killed.

===Verse 21===
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will that great city Babylon be thrown down and will be found no more at all.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse is similar to in Jeremiah, when Jeremiah tied his prophecies to a stone and threw them into the Euphrates River, symbolizing the fall of Babylon.

===Verses 22-23===
:&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And the voice of harpers, musicians, pipers, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft will be found anymore in you, and the sound of a millstone will be heard no more at all in you,''''' &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and the light of a candle will shine no more at all in you, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you, for your merchants were the great men of the earth, and by your sorceries were all nations deceived.”'''''

''Commentary:''
According to D.E. Aune, the believe is that the wealth of Rome could only be attributed to sorcery and not naturally capable. Sorcery, prostitution, and idolatry allude to descriptions of Jezebel in 2 Kings 9.22.

===Verse 24===
:&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“And in her was found the blood of prophets, saints, and all who were slain upon the earth.”'''''

''Commentary:'' Babylon is a complex concept in Revelation. It is associated with a city which is the seat of international power; with the empires which have ruled over Israel throughout history; with a confederation of ten nations in service of the Antichrist; with false religion, or the manipulation of religious institutions for ungodly ends; and with the abuse of power in general. Babylon is opposed to Christianity, for it is &quot;drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (17:6). The Babylonian system gains total control by usurping both political and religious power. In its most consummated form, it features the Antichrist as a political leader who presents himself as a savior to the people of the world and insists on being worshiped as the incarnation of God. The false prophet, in cooperation with the Antichrist, and under the pretense of being a great man of God, is the most powerful religious leader in the world. With the influence of his office, he proclaims the Antichrist to be the Messiah and people are forced to worship him as such.

==Pleȝen, Maken and Other Verbs==

All three verbs that you were introduced to in Lesson 1 are irregular in some way; however, most verbs are regular verbs. The following is a table of the endings you add to the stems of regular verbs to conjugate them:


{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Verb|conjugation|Konjugation|168|7}}
!  
! colspan=3 | Singular
! colspan=3 | Plural
|-
! first person||ic
| -e
! wiȝ
| -þ
|-
! second person
! þu
| -st
! ȝiȝ
| -þ
|-
! rowspan=3 | third person
! he
| -þ
! rowspan=3 | hje
| rowspan=3 | -þ
|-
! scie
| -þ
|-
! it
| -þ
|}


For example, the verbs ''pleȝen'' and ''maken'',

{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Verb|to play|pleȝen|187|7}}
!  
! colspan=3 | Singular
! colspan=3 | Plural
|-
! first person||ic
| pleȝe
! wiȝ
| pleȝþ
|-
! second person||þu
| pleȝst
! ȝiȝ
| pleȝþ
|-
! rowspan=3 | third person
! he
| pleȝþ
! rowspan=3 | hje
| rowspan=3 | pleȝþ
|-
! scie
| pleȝþ
|-
! it
| pleȝþ
|}
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Verb|to do_make|maken|152|7}}
!  
! colspan=3 | Singular
! colspan=3 | Plural
|-
! first person||ich
| make
! wiȝ

! rowspan=3 | hje
| rowspan=3 | makþ
|-
! scie

|}
===Applications===

*''Hwat dœst þu?''
:What are you doing?
*''Ic pleȝe Basketball.''
:I play basketball.
*''Pleȝst þu Fotball?''
:Do you play soccer?
*''Ic make Husniede.''
:I do homework.
*''He makþ Husniede.''
:He does homework.
*''Makst þu Sport?''
:Do you play sports?

Note the last sentence. In English one ''plays'' sport, while in Englisc one ''does'' sport. You can also use the w-words from [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Hu hattest þu?#Forming Questions|Lesson 1]] to make some more combinations:

*''Hwy pleȝst þu Baseball?''
:Why do you play baseball?
*''Hwa hæfþ Husniede?''
:Who has homework?
&lt;!--&quot;Who has the homework?&quot;? Only used if it's specific--&gt;

To say &quot;not&quot;, use &quot;ne&quot; before the verb. &quot;Nan&quot; is another word to emphasize that you play ''none'' of a sport, and declines like ''an'' does. 

*''Hwa ne pleȝþ Fotball?''
:Who doesn't play soccer?
*''Wiȝ pleȝeþ nanen Tennis.''
:We don't play tennis.

===Compound Sentences===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Conjunctions|Fœgunge|72|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|and||and
|-
|but||ak
|-
|or||oþþe
|}


Both Englisc and English have compound sentences; the applications of these are enormous. They can be used in lists, but also in compound sentences. For example,

*''Ic pleȝe Basketball and he pleȝþ eak Basketball.''
:I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.

The new word, '''&quot;eak&quot;''', is very important and it means &quot;also&quot;. The one grammar rule about &quot;eak&quot; is that it always comes after the verb.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Pleȝen, Maken, and Other Verbs|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Other Verbs and Their Conjugations===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Grammar|Verbs|Verben|135|2}}
!Englisc||English
|-
|ræden||to read
|-
|lesen||to gather
|-
|bescawen||to watch
|-
|seen||to see
|-
|wœrken||to work
|-
|wreiten||to write
|-
|finden||to find
|-
|swimmen||to swim
|}


Bescawen, wreiten, and swimmen are all regular verbs, they follow normal conjugations. To conjugate, you first remove the ' ''en'' ', then add the correct ending, here is an example,

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Verb||First Step||Finished
|-
|swimm'''en'''||swimm||ich swimm'''e'''
|}

*Finden is an irregular verb; however, it has a simple change. Whenever the verb ends with a consonant cluster like &quot;nd&quot;, an 'e' is added before it. So it would be '''du findest''', not ''du findst''. As well as '''he, scie, it, and ȝiȝ findeþ''', not ''he, scie, it, and ȝiȝ findþ''.

*Lesen is also an irregular verb. First, when forming &quot;'''þu'''&quot; it is ''liest'' and with &quot;'''he, scie, it'''&quot; it is ''liesþ''. 

*Seen is the last irregular verb. When forming &quot;'''þu'''&quot; it is ''siehst'' and with &quot;'''he, scie, it'''&quot; it is ''siehþ''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Other Verbs and Their Conjugations|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Two More Verb Forms===

There are two more verb forms in English that you will learn this lesson: the present progressive (&quot;I am playing, he is making&quot;), and the affirmative &quot;I do play, he does not play&quot;, which includes a form of 'to do'.

It might be tempting to make the present progressive sentence, &quot;I am playing.&quot; into &quot;Ic em pleȝen.&quot;. After all, 'pleȝen' sounds a lot like 'play-ing', but that is not the definition. 'Pleȝen' means 'to play', which makes &quot;Ic em pleȝen.&quot; into &quot;I am to play.&quot;, not at all what you are trying to say, and a collection of words that does not make sense. So it is not &quot;Ic em pleȝen.&quot;

The second phrase, &quot;I do play&quot;, is another tricky one. This one may seem like, &quot;Ic do pleȝen.&quot; But don't forget, there are no helping verbs in Englisc. &quot;Ic do pleȝen.&quot; just doesn't work.

Both of the phrases above are simplified in Englisc. Instead of &quot;I am playing.&quot; and &quot;I do play.&quot;, Englisc makes them both simply: &quot;Ic pleȝe.&quot; When using 'not', instead of &quot;does not play&quot;, you get &quot;Ic ne pleȝe&quot;. This may sound like old English, and there you see where English came from, and why it is called a &quot;Germanic&quot; language.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Two More Verb Forms|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Expressing likes and dislikes==
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Expressing likes and dislikes|Verbindungen|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|I like...||Ic habe ... ȝorn
|-
|I like to play...||Ic pleȝe ȝorn...
|-
|What do you like?||Hwat hæfst þu ȝorn?
|-
|}

&lt;small&gt;* ''I like ... also translates to: Ic ann. Unnen being the root verb, to like.''
''What do you like? translates to: Hwat annst þu?''
''Ic ann, þu annst, he/scie/it ann, wiȝ unneþ, ȝiȝ unneþ, hje unneþ.''&lt;big&gt;


In Englisc, there are several ways to express likes and dislikes. This way is a casual way. You can also add other verbs for other things, like asking or saying if they like to play, or make things.

*To express preference, use '''liefer''' instead of ''ȝorn.'' For example, ''&quot;Wiȝ pleȝeþ liefer Fotball.&quot;''

*To express favorites, you use '''am liefsten''', meaning &quot;most of all&quot;, in the same context as ''liefer''. For example, ''&quot;Ic pleȝe am liefsten Raafgamen.&quot;''.

*To express dislikes, use ''ne ȝorn'' instead of ''ȝorn''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Expressing likes and dislikes|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Numbers==

The first big unit in this level is time, which we are just about to get to. German time is very much like English time. However, we must begin with Englisc numbers.
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Numbers|Zahlen|536|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|zero||null
|-
|one||aan
|-
|two||tweȝn
|-
|three||þrie
|-
|four||fier
|-
|five||feif
|-
|six||six
|-
|seven||sefen
|-
|eight||aht
|-
|nine||niȝn
|-
|ten||tien
|-
|eleven||endlefen
|-
|twelve||twelf
|-
|thirteen||þrietien
|-
|fourteen||fiertien
|-
|fifteen||feiftien
|-
|sixteen||sixtien
|-
|seventeen||sefentien
|-
|eighteen||ahttien
|-
|nineteen||niȝntien
|-
|twenty||tweȝntiȝ
|-
|thirty||þrittiȝ
|-
|forty||fiertiȝ
|-
|fifty||feiftiȝ
|-
|sixty||sixtiȝ
|-
|seventy||sefentiȝ
|-
|eighty||ahttiȝ
|-
|ninety||niȝntiȝ
|-
|hundred||hundred/hund
|-
|hundred and one||hundredaan
|-
|hundred and ten||endlefentiȝ
|-
|hundred and twenty||twelftiȝ
|-
|thousand||þusend
|-
|1001||þusendaan
|-
|1101||þusendaanhundaan
|-
|3000||þrieþusend
|-
|200 000||twahundþusend
|-
|}


*Above are some basic numbers in Englisc. If you haven't noticed the pattern, &quot;'''-tien'''&quot; creates &quot;''-teen''&quot; and &quot;'''-tiȝ'''&quot; creates &quot;''-ty''.&quot; 

*The numerals, when written as figures, appear the same in Englisc and English, but when spoken or written in full, the units normally come before the tens. They are connected by ''and''.  
for example, &quot;aanandfeiftiȝ&quot;, which is 51, from &quot;aan&quot; and &quot;feiftiȝ&quot;.

*In spoken words, &quot;twa&quot; can be used for &quot;tweȝn&quot;, used before a hundred or a thousand.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Numbers|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Time==

===Asking the Time===

{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Time|Teid|243|3}}
!||English||Englisc
|-
|||What time is it? (How late is it?)||Hu læt is it?
|-
|||What time is it? (How much clock is it?)||Hu fele Uhr is it?
|-
|&lt;small&gt;Ef&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Nu is tien Uhr feiftien.
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:15||Fierðel æfter Tien
|-
|&lt;small&gt;BoA&lt;/small&gt;||It is 10:45||Fierðel ær Endlefen 
|-
|}


In table above you might have seen the Ef and BoA, those stand for exact form and before or after. Specific times can be expressed in two ways: Exact form (e.g. &quot;Four thirty-seven&quot;) or before or after form (e.g. &quot;Twenty-three to five&quot;).

===Exact form===

This form is the same as English. For example,

*'''It is tien Uhr feiftien.'''
:It is 10:15 a.m.
 
*The new word '''Uhr''' means &quot;o'clock&quot;, and is used in all exact times, it comes between the hour and the minute.

*Also, Englisc-speakers generally use the 24-hour clock when expressing time this way, therefore, 3:29 p.m. (15:29) is &quot;feiftien Uhr niȝnandtweȝntiȝ.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Exact form|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Before or After the Hour===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|BoA|BoA|111|2}}
|-
!English||Englisc
|-
|After, Past||æfter
|-
|Till, to||ær
|-
|quarter||Fierðel
|-
|half before||Half
|}


*Use the same form as in English. For example, 10:57 can be said as, &quot;þrie ær Endlefen(three minutes to eleven&quot;. Likewise, 4:10 would be &quot;tien æfter Fier(ten minutes past four).&quot; 

*Typically, use the smaller time interval with 'æfter' or 'ær'. Don't say, &quot;sefenandfeiftig æfter Tien.&quot; 

*You don't need a ''ær'' when using half. For example, 11:30 can be said as, &quot;Half twelf&quot; and 5:15 can be said as &quot;Fierðel æfter Feif&quot;, 5:45 would be &quot;Fierðel ær Six&quot;.

'''Note:''' This is only used with informal time telling. You don't use 'Uhr'.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Before/After the Hour|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Saying When You Do Something===
''Hwann pleȝst þu Football?'' (Football means American Football. Soccer would be &quot;Fotball&quot;, which lit. means Football)

To say you play a sport at a certain time in English, you would answer, &quot;I play football ''at'' 3:30.&quot; This is all the same in Englisc, with the translation of 'at' being ''um''. That makes the above response &quot;Ic pleȝe Football um half Fier.&quot; or &quot;Ic pleȝe Football um feiftien Uhr þrittiȝ.&quot;.

===Times of Day===

{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Times of Day|Dæȝesteide|364|2}}

|-
|morning||undern
|-
|afternoon||Ofernon
|-
|evening||Æfen
|-
|night||Niht
|}

&lt;small&gt;*In Englisc, the words for &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; are almost the same: ''morgen'' and ''to-morgen''. If you want to say ''tomorrow morning'' use ''on morgen'' (meaning: ''in the morning'') instead of ''tomorgen morgen''.&lt;big&gt;

*The words above can be combined into phrases like &quot;ȝestern Æfen&quot;.

|August||Weedmonþ
|-
|September||Haliȝmonþ
|-
|October||Winterfylleþ
|-
|November||Blotmonþ
|-
|December||Ȝolmonþ
|}

*To say &quot;on Monday&quot;, say ''&quot;am Monendæȝ&quot;'' or whatever applies. To say &quot;in January&quot;, say ''&quot;im Wintermonþ&quot;'' or whatever applies. This is the same for all of the days and months.

*You can also combine the times of day from earlier with the days of the week. But they're both nouns. To do this, therefore, we must combine the two words into one, as in &quot;Tiwsniht&quot; (Tuesday night) and &quot;Wodensæfen&quot; (Wednesday evening).

'''Culture Note:''' The Englisc week begins on Monday.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Days and Months|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Dates===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Dates|Daten|305|2}}
!English||German
|-
|first of (''month'')||ærste
|-
|second of (''month'')||oðer
|-

|-

|-
|thirty-first of||aanandþrittiȝþe
|-
| -th of [''20 to 31'']||-þe
|-
|on (the)||am
|}

*The ordinal numbers from 2 to 19 take the endings ''þ/t''  and from 20 upwards take the ending ''þ''

*For example &quot;on the 25th of December&quot;, 
:Simply say &quot;am feifandtweȝntiȝþe'''n''' Ȝolmonþ.&quot; 
:In other cases you say &quot;feifandtweȝntiȝþe'''''' Ȝolmonþ&quot; or &quot;þe feifandtweȝntiȝþe'''e''' Ȝolmonþ&quot;.

*In Englisc, dates are written out in the logical order '''''Month'' . ''Day'' . ''Year''''', instead of the American ''Month''/''Day''/''Year''.
:Engliscuses a dot or a dash instead of a slash. Do not use the slash in dates, as it is unusual and confusing because you cannot tell if &quot;4/6&quot; means 4th of June (4.6.) or 6th of April (6.4.) 

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Dates|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Birthdays====
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Birthdays|Gebyrddage|237|2}}
!English||German
|-
|Birthday||Gebyrddæȝ
|-
|Happy Birthday||Alle Gode tom Gebyrddæȝ!
|-
|Best wishes on your birthday!||Gesælige Wyscunge tom Gebyrddæȝ!
|-
|Here is your present!||Hier is þeine Gife!
|-
|Thank you!||Þankewell!
|-
|That's a nice party!||Þat is ane tolle Party!
|}

*To say, &quot;My birthday is on November 13th&quot;, say, &quot;Ic habe am þrietienþen Blotmonþ Gebyrddæȝ.&quot; 
Here ''am þrietienþen Blotmonþ '', ''am 13. Blotmonþ'', ''am þrietienþen elfþen'' (a shorter version of endlefenþen) and ''am 13. 11.'' represent the same date.
:Note the order; it translates back literally as &quot;I have on the 13th of November birthday.&quot;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Birthdays|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Seasons===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Ȝearsteide|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|Spring||Lenkten
|-
|Summer||Summer
|-
|Autumn||Hærfest
|-
|Winter||Winter
|-
|in (the)||im
|}

To say &quot;in Summer&quot;, say &quot;im Summer&quot;. For example, 

*''Im Summer pleȝe ic Baseball.''
:I play baseball in summer.

The time always goes before the verb and the subject. (time, verb, and subject)

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Seasons|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Periods of Time===

If you want to express a certain period of time, but it doesn't have a specific name, like ''Ofernon'', you can do it like this:,
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Seasons|Ȝearsteide|0|2}}
!Englisc||Time
|-
|of||Starting Time
|-
|oþ||Ending Time
|}

*This is the same as ''from ... till ...'' in English.

*This can also apply with dates. For example, &quot;Wiȝ habeþ Scole (school) of Monenedæȝ oþ Friȝedæȝ&quot;.

*'''Exceptions'''
:Wiȝ habeþ free of þem feifandtweȝntiȝþen Ȝolmonþ oþ þem oðern Wintermonþ.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Periods of Time|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===How often?===

''Hu oft?'', there are many ways to answer this question. Two are &quot;once, twice, or three times in a ...&quot; or &quot;always, often, or never.&quot;

====A Number or Times====

To say, &quot;once a month&quot;, or &quot;four times a week&quot;, add ''&quot;seiðe(n)&quot;'' to the end of the number and use the examples below.

{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Daily|Dæȝlic|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|Day||''am'' Dæȝ
|-
|Week||''in þer'' Wuke
|-
|Month||''im'' Monþ
|-
|Year||''im'' Ȝear
|-
|Weekend||''am'' Wukenende
|-
|Morning||''morgens''
|-
|Evening||''æfens''
|-
|Afternoon||''ofernons''
|-
|Night||''nihtes'' oþþe ''in þer'' Niht
|}

'''For example'''

*''Wiȝ kegelþ tweȝnseiðen in þer Woche.''
:We bowl twice a week.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#How often?|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

====Common Adverbs====
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Sometimes|Hweilen|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|always||allteids
|-
|most of the time||mæstens
|-
|often||oft
|-
|sometimes||hweilen
|-
|seldom||selden
|-
|never||næfre
|-
|only||aanen
|}

*To apply these words, put them in the sentence, '''after the verb and subject, but before the sport/activity'''. 

*You can also use 'aanen' to say things like, ''Scie pleȝþ aanen hweilen Tennis.'' 

*Note that if this is translated word-for-word, it becomes, ''She plays only sometimes tennis.'' That's just the way Englisc is.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Often Adverbs|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Time-Related Words===
{| {{NiwEnglisc table|Vocabulary|Sometimes|Hweilen|0|2}}
!English||Englisc
|-
|Time||þie Teid
|-
|Free time||þie Freeteid
|}

*To say you have time, ignore the 'die'. 
*To say when, insert other phrases you have learned this lesson. For example, ''Ic habe am Sæternsæfen Teid.''
::Note that the word order is the same as that of birthdays. You can use Freeteid in the same way.

==What's On the Test==

To go straight to the lesson test, go [[/Test|here]].
&lt;!--
The test will have four parts to it: Grammar (79 points), Translating (95 points), Reading Comprehension (20 points), Vocabulary (20 points), and Previous Topics (10 points) in that order. The Grammar section will test your ability to know the verbs from this lesson and it's various visions, to know articles - the genders of them and the correct usage of them, and correct word order. 

The Translating section is worth the most points, and it too has three sections. You must know the translations for sentences and phrases going from English to Englisc, and be able to take a Englisc dialogue and translate it back into English. Also you must know the translation from Numbers to German.

The third section, Reading Comprehension, is Comprehension Questions you must know how to read the conversion and after reading you will be asked question on the previous conversion.

The fourth section is a vocabulary section. You get 20 English words on the left and 20 Englisc words on the right, and be asked to match them. To study for that, check out the 401 flashcards related to this lesson at [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249128 FlashcardExchange.com]
''Part I'' and [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249218 FlashcardExchange.com] ''Part II''.

The last section, Previous Topics, is a quick review on [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Hu hattest þu?|Lesson 1]] to get ready for this section, just look at some past notes or go to [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Hu hattest þu?|Lesson 1]] and study. That is the whole test. [[NiwEnglisc/Level I/Freeteid/Test|Take it!]]

== Explanation of curly braces in Command grouping section ==

It says they don't do anything but require peculiar syntax without giving anything back.

What they do is concatenate the stdout of the commands on the enclosed list, which can be further redirected to either a file or a command.

Here is an example showing how curly braces can help one append or prepend some text to the stdout of a command (crontab here), and redirect the whole thing to another command (again crontab), all without using a temporary file:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# Append a cron job to crontab
{ crontab -l; cat &lt;&lt;EOF; } | crontab -
* * * * * echo something
EOF

# Prepend a cron job to crontab
{ cat &lt;&lt;EOF; crontab -l; } | crontab -
* * * * * echo something
EOF
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far we've talked about basics and theory. We've covered the different shells available and how to get shell scripts running in the Bourne Shell. We've talked about the Unix environment and we've seen that you have variables that control the environment and that you can use to store values for your own use. What we haven't done yet, though, is actually ''done'' anything. We haven't made the system act, jump through hoops, fetch the newspaper or do the dishes.

In this chapter it's time to get serious. In this chapter we talk programming &amp;mdash; how to write programs that make decisions and execute commands. In this chapter we talk about control flow and command execution.

==Control Flow==
What is the difference between a program launcher and a command shell? Why is Bourne Shell a tool that has commanded power and respect the world over for decades and not just a stupid little tool you use to start ''real'' programs? Because Bourne Shell is not just an environment that launches programs: Bourne Shell is a fully programmable environment with the power of a full programming language at its command. We've already seen in [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Environment|Environment]] that Bourne Shell has variables in memory. But Bourne Shell can do more than that: it can make decisions and repeat commands. Like any real programming language, Bourne Shell has ''control flow'', the ability to steer the computer.

===Test: evaluating conditions===
Before we can make decisions in shell scripts, we need a way of evaluating conditions. We have to be able to check the state of certain affairs so that we can base our decisions on what we find.

Strangely enough the actual shell doesn't include any mechanism for this. There is a tool for exactly this purpose called '''test''' (and it was literally created for use in shell scripts), but nevertheless it is not strictly part of the shell. The 'test' tool evaluates conditions and returns either '''true''' or '''false''', depending on what it finds. It returns these values in the form of an exit status (in the $? shell variable): a zero for '''true''' and something else for '''false'''. The general form of the test command is

{{bcode:Example|'''test''' ''condition''}}

as in 

{{code:Basic|A test for string equality|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;test &quot;Hello World&quot; = &quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/source&gt;}}

This test for the equality of two strings returns an exit status of zero. There is also a shorthand notation for 'test' which is usually more readable in scripts, namely square brackets:

{{bcode:Example|'''[''' ''condition'' ''']'''}}

Note the spaces between the brackets and the actual condition &amp;ndash; don't forget them in your own scripts. The equivalent of the example above in shorthand is 

{{code:Basic|A shorter test for string equality|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;[ &quot;Hello World&quot; = &quot;Hello World&quot; ]&lt;/source&gt;}}

'Test' can evaluate a number of different kinds of conditions, to fit with the different kinds of tests that you're like to want to carry out in a shell script. Most specific shells have added on to the basic set of available conditions, but Bourne Shell recognizes the following:

'''File conditions'''
;-b ''file'':''file'' exists and is a block special file
;-c ''file'':''file'' exists and is a character special file
;-d ''file'':''file'' exists and is a directory
;-f ''file'':''file'' exists and is a regular data file
;-g ''file'':''file'' exists and has its set-group-id bit set
;-k ''file'':''file'' exists and has its sticky bit set
;-p ''file'':''file'' exists and is a named pipe
;-r ''file'':''file'' exists and is readable
;-s ''file'':''file'' exists and its size is greater than zero
;-t [n]:The open file descriptor with number n is a terminal device; n is optional, default 1
;-u ''file'':''file'' exists and has its set-user-id bit set
;-w ''file'':''file'' exists and is writable
;-x ''file'':''file'' exists and is executable
'''String conditions'''
;-n ''s'':''s'' has non-zero length
;-z ''s'':''s'' has zero length
;''s0'' = ''s1'':''s0'' and ''s1'' are identical
;''s0'' != ''s1'':''s0'' and ''s1'' are different
;''s'':''s'' is not null (often used to check that an environment variable has a value)
'''Integer conditions'''
;''n0'' -eq ''n1'':''n0'' is equal to ''n1''
;''n0'' -ge ''n1'':''n0'' is greater than or equal to ''n1''
;''n0'' -gt ''n1'':''n0'' is strictly greater than ''n1''
;''n0'' -le ''n1'':''n0'' is less than or equal to ''n1''
;''n0'' -lt ''n1'':''n0'' is strictly less than ''n1''
;''n0'' -ne ''n1'':''n0'' is not equal to ''n1''

Finally, conditions can be combined and grouped:
;\(''B''\): Parentheses are used for grouping conditions (don't forget the backslashes). A grouped condition (''B'') is true if ''B'' is true.
;'''!''' ''B'':Negation; is true if ''B'' is false.
;''B0'' '''-a''' ''B1'':And; is true if ''B0'' and ''B1'' are both true.
;''B0'' '''-o''' ''B1'':Or; is true if either ''B0'' or ''B1'' is true.

===Conditional execution===
Okay, so now we know how to evaluate some conditions. Let's see how make use of this ability to do some programming.

All programming languages need two things: a form of decision making or conditional execution and a form of repetition or looping. We'll get to looping later, for now let's concentrate on conditional execution. Bourne Shell supports two forms of conditional execution, the '''if'''-statement and the '''case'''-statement.

The '''if'''-statement is the most general of the two. It's general form is

{{bcode:Example|'''if''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
'''then''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
'''elif''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
'''then''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
...
'''else''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
'''fi'''}}

This command is to be interpreted as follows:

# The command list following the '''if''' is executed. 
#If the last command returns a status zero, the command list following the first '''then''' is executed and the statement terminates after completion of the last command in this list.
#If the last command returns a non-zero status, the command list following the first '''elif''' (if there is one) is executed. 
#If the last command returns a status zero, the command list following the next '''then''' is executed and the statement terminates after completion of the last command in this list.
#If the last command returns a non-zero status, the command list following the next '''elif''' (if there is one) is executed and so on.
#If no command list following the '''if''' or an '''elif''' terminates in a zero status, the command list following the else (if there is one) is executed.
# The statement terminates. If the statement terminated without an error, the return status is zero.

It is interesting to note that the '''if'''-statement allows command lists everywhere, including in places where conditions are evaluated. This means that you can execute as many compound commands as you like before reaching a decision point. The only command that affects the outcome of the decision is the last one executed in the list.

In most cases though, for the sake of readability and maintainability, you will want to limit yourself to one command for a condition. In most cases this command will be a use of the 'test' tool.

{{code:Output|Example of a simple if statement
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;if [ 1 -gt 0 ]
then
  echo YES
fi&lt;/source&gt;
|YES|}}

{{code:Output|Example of an if statement with an else clause
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;if [ 1 -le 0 ]
then
  echo YES
else
  echo NO
fi
&lt;/source&gt;
|NO|}}

{{code:Output|Example of a full if statement with an else clause and two elifs
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rank=captain

if [ &quot;$rank&quot; = colonel ]
then
  echo Hannibal Smith
elif [ &quot;$rank&quot; = captain ]
then
  echo Howling Mad Murdock
elif [ &quot;$rank&quot; = lieutenant ]
then
  echo Templeton Peck
else
  echo B.A. Baracus
fi&lt;/source&gt;
|Howling Mad Murdock|}}

The '''case'''-statement is sort of a special form of the '''if'''-statement, specialized in the kind of test demonstrated in the last example: taking a value and comparing it to a fixed set of expected values or patterns. The case statement is used very frequently to evaluate command line arguments to scripts. For example, if you write a script that uses switches to identify command line arguments, you know that there are only a limited number of legal switches. The '''case'''-statement is an elegant alternative to a potentially messy '''if'''-statement in such a case.

The general form of the case statement is

{{bcode:Example|'''case''' ''value'' '''in'''&lt;br/&gt;
''pattern0'' ''')''' ''command-list-0'' ''';;'''&lt;br/&gt;
''pattern1'' ''')''' ''command-list-1'' ''';;'''&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
'''esac'''}}

The value can be any value, including an environment variable. Each pattern is a regular expression and the command list executed is the one for the first pattern that matches the value (so make sure you don't have overlapping patterns). Each command list must end with a double semicolon. The return status is zero if the statement terminates without syntax errors.

{{code:Output|The last 'if'-example revisited
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;rank=captain

case $rank in
    colonel) echo Hannibal Smith;;
    captain) echo Howling Mad Murdock;;
    lieutenant) echo Templeton Peck;;
    sergeant) echo B.A. Baracus;;
    *) echo OOPS;;
esac&lt;/source&gt;
|Howling Mad Murdock|}}

=====If versus case: what is the difference?=====
So what exactly is the difference between the '''if'''- and '''case'''-statements? And what is the point of having two statements that are so similar? Well, the technical difference is this: the '''case'''-statement works off of data available to the shell (like an environment variable), whereas the '''if'''-statement works off the exit status of a program or command. Since fixed values and environment variables depend on the shell but the exit status is a concept general to the Unix system, this means that the '''if'''-statement is more general than the '''case'''-statement.

Let's look at a slightly larger example, just to put the two together and compare:

{{code:Basic||&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

if [ &quot;$2&quot; ]
then
  sentence=&quot;$1 is a&quot;
else
  echo Not enough command line arguments! &gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi

case $2 in
  fruit|veg*) sentence=&quot;$sentence vegetarian!&quot;;;
  meat) sentence=&quot;$sentence meat eater!&quot;;;
  *) sentence=&quot;${sentence}n omnivore!&quot;;;
esac

echo $sentence&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note that this is a shell script and that it uses positional variables to capture command-line arguments. The script starts with an '''if'''-statement to check that we have the right number of arguments &amp;ndash; note the use of 'test' to see if the value of variable $2 is not null and the exit status of 'test' to determine how the '''if'''-statement proceeds. If there are enough arguments, we assume the first argument is a name and start building the sentence that is the result of our script. Otherwise we write an error message (to stderr, the place to write errors; read all about it in [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Files and streams|Files and streams]]) and exit the script with a non-zero return value. Note that this else statement has a command list with more than one command in it.

Assuming we got through the '''if'''-statement without trouble, we get to the '''case'''-statement. Here we check the value of variable $2, which should be a food preference. If that value is either fruit or something starting with veg, we add a claim to the script result that some person is a vegetarian. If the value was exactly meat, the person is a meat eater. Anything else, he is an omnivore. Note that in that last case pattern clause we have to use curly braces in the variable substitution; that's because we want to add a letter n directly onto the existing value of sentence, without a space in between.

Let's put the script in a file called 'preferences.sh' and look at the effect of some calls of this script:

{{code:Basic|Calling the script with different effects|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ sh preferences.sh
Not enough command line arguments!
$sh preferences.sh Joe
Not enough command line arguments!
$sh preferences.sh Joe fruit
Joe is a vegetarian!
$sh preferences.sh Joe veg
Joe is a vegetarian!
$sh preferences.sh Joe vegetables
Joe is a vegetarian!
$sh preferences.sh Joe meat
Joe is a meat eater!
sh preferences.sh Joe meat potatoes
Joe is a meat eater!
sh preferences.sh Joe potatoes
Joe is an omnivore!&lt;/source&gt;}}

===Repetition===
In addition to conditional execution mechanisms every programming language needs a means of repetition, repeated execution of a set of commands. The Bourne Shell has several mechanisms for exactly that: the '''while'''-statement, the '''until'''-statement and the '''for'''-statement.

====The while loop====
The '''while'''-statement is the simplest and most straightforward form of repetition statement in Bourne shell. It is also the most general. Its general form is this:

{{bcode:Example|'''while''' ''command-list1''
'''do''' ''command-list2''
'''done'''}}


The '''while'''-statement is interpreted as follows:

#Execute the commands in command list 1.
#If the exit status of the last command is non-zero, the statement terminates.
#Otherwise execute the commands in command list 2 and go back to step 1.
#If the statement does not contain a syntax error and it ever terminates, it terminates with exit status zero.

Much like the '''if'''-statement, you can use a full command list to control the '''while'''-statement and only the last command in that list actually controls the statement. But in reality you will probably want to limit yourself to one command and, as with the '''if'''-statement, you will usually use the 'test' program for that command.

{{code:Output|A while loop that prints all the values between 0 and 10|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;counter=0

while [ $counter -lt 10 ]
do
  echo $counter
  counter=`expr $counter + 1`
done&lt;/source&gt;
|0&lt;br/&gt;1&lt;br/&gt;2&lt;br/&gt;3&lt;br/&gt;4&lt;br/&gt;5&lt;br/&gt;6&lt;br/&gt;7&lt;br/&gt;8&lt;br/&gt;9
|Note the use of [[#Command_execution|command substitution]] to increase the value of the counter variable.}}

The '''while'''-statement is commonly used to deal with situations where a script can have an indeterminate number of command-line arguments, by using the '''shift''' command and the special '$#' variable that indicates the number of command-line arguments:

{{code:Basic|Printing all the command-line arguments|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

while [ $# -gt 0 ]
do
    echo $1
    shift
done&lt;/source&gt;}}

====The until loop====
The '''until'''-statement is also a repetition statement, but it is sort of the semantic opposite of the '''while'''-statement. The general form of the '''until'''-statement is

{{bcode:Example|'''until''' ''command-list1''&lt;br/&gt;
'''do''' ''command-list2''&lt;br/&gt;
'''done'''&lt;br/&gt;}}

The interpretation of this statement is almost the same as that of the '''while'''-statement. The only difference is that the commands in command list 2 are executed as long as the last command of command list 1 returns a non-zero status. Or, to put it more simply: command list 2 is executed as long as the condition of the loop is ''not'' met.

Whereas '''while'''-statements are mostly used to establish some effect (&quot;repeat until done&quot;), '''until'''-statements are more commonly used to poll for the existence of some condition or to wait until some condition is met. For instance, assume some process is running that will write 10000 lines to a certain file. The following '''until'''-statement waits for the file to have grown to 10000 lines:

{{code:Basic|Waiting for myfile.txt to grow to 10000 lines|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;until [ $lines -eq 10000 ]
do
    lines=`wc -l dates | awk '{print $1}'`
    sleep 5
done&lt;/source&gt;}}

====The for loop====
In the section on [[#If_versus_case:_what_is_the_difference.3F|Control flow]], we discussed that the difference between '''if''' and '''case''' was that the first depended on command exit statuses whereas the second was closely linked to data available in the shell. That kind of pairing also exists for repetition statements: '''while''' and '''until''' use command exit statuses and '''for''' uses data explicitly available in the shell.

The '''for'''-statement loops over a fixed, finite set of values. Its general form is

{{bcode:Example|'''for''' ''name'' '''in''' ''w&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ...&lt;br/&gt;
'''do''' ''command-list''&lt;br/&gt;
'''done'''}}

This statement executes the command list for each value named after the 'in'. Within the command list, the &quot;current&quot; value ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is available through the variable ''name''. The value list must be separated from the 'do' by a semicolon or a newline. And the command list must be separated from the 'done' by a semicolon or a newline. So, for example:

{{code:Output|A for loop that prints some values|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for myval in Abel Bertha Charlie Delta Easy Fox Gumbo Henry India
do
  echo $myval Company
done&lt;/source&gt;
|Abel Company&lt;br/&gt;Bertha Company&lt;br/&gt;Charlie Company&lt;br/&gt;Delta Company&lt;br/&gt;Easy Company&lt;br/&gt;Fox Company&lt;br/&gt;Gumbo Company&lt;br/&gt;Henry Company&lt;br/&gt;India Company&lt;br/&gt;
|}}

The '''for''' statement is used a lot to loop over command line arguments. For that reason the shell even has a shorthand notation for this use: if you leave off the 'in' and the values part, the command assumes $* as the list of values. For example:

{{code:Output|Using for to loop over command line arguments|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

for arg
do
  echo $arg
done&lt;/source&gt;
|$ sh loop_args.sh A B C D&lt;br/&gt;
A&lt;br/&gt;
B&lt;br/&gt;
C&lt;br/&gt;
D
|This use of for is commonly combined with case to handle command line switches.}}

==Command execution==
In the last section on [[#Control_Flow|Control Flow]] we discussed the major programming constructs and control flow statements offered by the Bourne Shell. However, there are lots of other syntactic constructs in the shell that allow you to control the way commands are executed and to embed commands in other commands. In this section we discuss some of the more important ones.

===Command joining===
Earlier, we looked at the '''if'''-statement as a method of conditional execution. In addition to this expansive statement the Bourne Shell also offers a method of directly linking two commands together and making the execution of one of them conditional on the outcome (the exit status) of the other. This is useful for making quick, inline decisions on command execution. But you probably wouldn't want to use these constructs in a shell script or for longer command sequences, because they aren't the most readable.

You can join commands together using the '''&amp;&amp;''' and '''||''' operators. These operators (which you might recognize as borrowed from the C programming language) are ''short circuiting'' operators: they make the execution of the second command dependent on the exit status of the first and so can allow you to avoid unnecessary command executions.

The '''&amp;&amp;''' operator joins two commands together and only executes the second if the exit status of the first is zero (i.e. the first command &quot;succeeds&quot;). Consider the following example:

{{code:Basic|Attempt to create a file and delete it again ''if the creation succeeds''|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo Hello World &gt; tempfile.txt &amp;&amp; rm tempfile.txt&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this example the deletion would be pointless if the file creation fails (because the file system is read-only, say). Using the '''&amp;&amp;''' operator prevents the deletion from being attempted if the file creation fails. A similar &amp;ndash; and possibly more useful &amp;ndash; example is this:

{{code:Basic|Check if a file exists and make a backup copy if it does|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;test -f my_important_file &amp;&amp; cp my_important_file backup&lt;/source&gt;}}

In contrast to the '''&amp;&amp;''' operator, the '''||''' operator executes the second command only if the exit status of the first command is ''not'' zero (i.e. it fails). Consider the following example:

{{code:Basic|Make sure we do not overwrite a file; create a new file only if it doesn't exist yet|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;test -f my_file || echo Hello World &gt; my_file&lt;/source&gt;}}

For both these operators the exit status of the joined commands is the exit status of the last command that actually got executed.

===Command grouping===
You can join multiple commands into one command list by joining them using the ''';''' operator, like so:

{{code:Basic|Create a directory and change into it all in one go|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;mkdir newdir;cd newdir&lt;/source&gt;}}

There is no conditional execution here; all commands are executed, even if one of them fails.

When joining commands into a command list, you can group the commands together for clarity and some special handling. There are two ways of grouping commands: using curly braces and using parentheses.

Grouping using curly braces is just for clarity; it doesn't add any semantics to joining using semicolons. The only differences between with braces and without are that if you use braces you ''must'' insert an extra semicolon after your command list and you have to remember to put spaces between the braces and your command list or the shell won't understand what you mean. Here's an example:

{{code:Basic|Create a directory and change into it all in one go, grouped with curly braces|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;{ mkdir newdir;cd newdir; }&lt;/source&gt;}}

The parentheses are far more interesting. When you group a command list with parentheses, it is executed... in a separate process. This means that whatever you do in the command list doesn't affect the environment in which you gave the command. Consider the example above again, with braces and parentheses:

{{code:Output|Create a directory and change into it all in one go, grouped with curly braces|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;/home$ { mkdir newdir;cd newdir; }&lt;/source&gt;
|/home/newdir$
|Note that your working directory has changed}}

{{code:Output|Create a directory and change into it all in one go, grouped with parentheses|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;/home$ (mkdir newdir;cd newdir)&lt;/source&gt;
|/home$
|Note that your working directory is still the same &amp;mdash; but the new directory ''has'' been created}}

Here's another one:

{{code:Output|Creating shell variables in the current and in a new environment|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ VAR0=A
$ (VAR1=B)
$ echo \&quot;$VAR0\&quot; \&quot;$VAR1\&quot;&lt;/source&gt;
|&quot;A&quot; &quot;&quot;
|VAR1 was created in a separate process with its own environment, so it doesn't exist in the original environment}}
===Command substitution===
In the chapter on [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Environment|Environment]] we talked about variable substitution. The Bourne Shell also supports ''command substitution''. This is sort of like variable substitution, but instead of a variable being replaced by its value a command is replaced by its output. We saw an example of this earlier when discussing the '''while'''-statement, where we assigned the outcome of an arithmetic expression evaluation to an environment variable.

Command substitution is accomplished using either of two notations. The original Bourne Shell used grave accents (`''command''`), which is still generally supported by most shells. Later on the POSIX 1003.1 standard added the '''$(''' ''command'' ''')''' notation. Consider the following examples:

{{code:Basic|Making a daily backup (old-skool)|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cp myfile backup/myfile-`date`&lt;/source&gt;}}

{{code:Basic|Making a daily backup (POSIX 1003.1)|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cp myfile backup/myfile-$(date)&lt;/source&gt;}}

===Regular expressions and metacharacters===
Usually, in the day-to-day tasks that you do with your shell, you will want to be explicit and exact about which files you want to operate on. After all, you want to delete a specific file and not a random one. And you want to send your network communications to the network device file and not to the keyboard.

But there are times, especially in scripting, when you will want to be able to operate on more than one file at a time. For instance, if you have written a script that makes a regular backup of all the files in your home directory whose names end in &quot;.dat&quot;. If there are a lot of those files, or  there are more being made each day with new names each time, then you do not want to have to name all those files explicitly in your backup script.

We have also seen another example of not wanting to be too explicit: in the section on the '''case'''-statement, there is an example where we claim that somebody is a vegetarian if he likes fruit or anything starting with &quot;veg&quot;. We could have included all sorts of options there and been explicit (although there are an infinite number of words you can make that start with &quot;veg&quot;). But we used a ''pattern'' instead and saved ourselves a lot of time.

For exactly these cases the shell supports a (limited) form of ''regular expressions'': patterns that allow you to say something like &quot;I mean every string, every sequence of characters, that looks sort of like this&quot;. The shell allows you to use these regular expressions anywhere (although they don't always make sense &amp;mdash; for example, it makes no sense to use a regular expression to say ''where'' you want to copy a file). That means in shell scripts, in the interactive shell, as part of the '''case'''-statement, to select files, general strings, anything.

In order to create regular expressions you use one or more ''metacharacters''. Metacharacters are characters that have special meaning to the shell and are automatically recognized as part of regular expressions. The Bourne shell recognizes the following metacharacters:

;'''*''':Matches any string.
;?:Matches any single character.
;[''characters'']:Matches any character enclosed in the angle brackets.
;[!''characters'']:Matches any character ''not'' enclosed in the angle brackets.
;''pat0''|''pat1'':Matches any string that matches ''pat0'' '''or''' ''pat1'' (only in '''case'''-statement patterns!)

Here are some examples of how you might use regular expressions in the shell:

{{code:Basic|List all files whose names end in &quot;.dat&quot;|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls *.dat&lt;/source&gt;}}
{{code:Basic|List all files whose names are &quot;file-&quot; followed by two characters followed by &quot;.txt&quot;|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file-??.txt&lt;/source&gt;}}
{{code:Basic|Make a backup copy of all text files, with a datestamp|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;for i in *.txt; do cp $i backup/$i-`date +%Y%m%d`; done&lt;/source&gt;}}
{{code:Basic|List all files in the directories Backup0 and Backup1|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls Backup[01]&lt;/source&gt;}}
{{code:Basic|List all files in the ''other'' backup directories|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls Backup[!01]&lt;/source&gt;}}
{{code:Basic|Execute all shell scripts whose names start with &quot;myscript&quot; and end in &quot;.sh&quot;|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;myscript*.sh&lt;/source&gt;}}

====Regular expressions and hidden files====
When selecting files, the metacharacters match all files except files whose names start with a period (&quot;.&quot;). Files that start with a period are either special files or are assumed to be configuration files. For that reason these files are semi-protected, in the sense that you cannot just pick them up with the metacharacters. In order to include these files when selecting with regular expressions, you must include the leading period explicitly. For example:

{{code:Output|Lising all files whose names start with a period|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;/home$ ls .*&lt;/source&gt;
|.&lt;br/&gt;..&lt;br/&gt;.profile
|The period files in a home directory}}

The example above shows a listing of period files. In this example the listing includes '.profile', which is the user configuration file for the Bourne Shell. It also includes the special directories '.' (which means &quot;the current directory&quot;) and '..' (which is the parent directory of the current directory). You can address these special directories like any other. So for instance

{{bcode:Example|ls .}}

is the same semantically as just 'ls' and 

{{bcode:Example|cd ..}}

changes your working directory to the parent directory of the directory that was your working directory before.

===Quoting===
When you introduce special characters like the metacharacters discussed in the previous section, you automatically get into situations when you really don't want those special characters evaluated. For example, assume that you have a file whose name includes an asterisk ('*'). How would you address that file? For example:

{{code:Output|Metacharacters in file names can cause problems
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo Test0 &gt; asterisk*.file
echo Test1 &gt; asteriskSTAR.file
cat asterisk*.file&lt;/source&gt;
|Test0&lt;br/&gt;
Test1
|Oops; that clearly wasn't the idea...}}

Clearly what is needed is a way of temporarily turning metacharacters off. The Bourne Shell built-in quoting mechanisms do exactly that. In fact, they do a lot more than that. For instance, if you have a file name with spaces in it (so that the shell cannot tell the different words in the file name belong together) the quoting mechanisms will help you deal with that problem as well.

There are three quoting mechanisms in the Bourne Shell:

;\:backslash, for single character quoting.
;&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;:single quotes, to quote entire strings.
;&quot;&quot;:double quotes, to quote entire strings but still allow for some special characters.

The simplest of these is the backslash, which quotes the character that immediately follows it. So, for example:

{{code:Output|Echo with an asterisk|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo *&lt;/source&gt;|
asterisk*.file asterisking.file backup biep.txt BLAAT.txt conditional1.sh condit&lt;br/&gt;ional1.sh~ conditional.sh conditional.sh~ dates error_test.sh error_test.sh~ fil&lt;br/&gt;e with spaces.txt looping0.sh looping1.sh out_nok out_ok preferences.sh pre&lt;br/&gt;ferences.sh~ test.txt|}}
{{code:Output|Echoing an asterisk|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo \*&lt;/source&gt;|*|}}

So the backslash basically disables special character interpretation for the duration of one character. Interestingly, the newline character is also considered a special character in this context, so you can use the backslash to split commands to the interpreter over multiple lines. Like so:

{{code:Output|A multiline command|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo This is a \
&gt;very long command!&lt;/source&gt;
|This is a very long command!
|Note: you don't have to type the &amp;gt;; the shell puts it in as a hint that you're continuing on a new line.}}

The backslash escape also works for file names with spaces:

{{code:Output|Difficult file to list...|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file with spaces.txt&lt;/source&gt;|
ls: cannot access file: No such file or directory&lt;br/&gt;ls: cannot access with: No such file or directory&lt;br/&gt;ls: cannot access spaces.txt: No such file or directory|}}
{{code:Output|Listing the file using escapes|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ls file\ with\ spaces.txt&lt;/source&gt;|file with spaces.txt|}}

But what if you want to pass a backslash to the shell? Well, think about it. Backslash disables interpretation of one character, so if you want to use a backslash for anything else... then '\\' will do it!

So we've seen that a backslash allows you to disable special character interpretation for a single character by quoting it. But what if you want to quote a lot of special characters all at once? As you've seen above with the filename with spaces, you ''can'' quote each special character separately, but that gets to be a drag really quickly. Usually it's quicker, easier and less error-prone simply to quote an entire string of characters in one go. To do exactly that you use single quotes. Two single quotes quote the entire string they surround, disabling interpretation of all special characters in that string &amp;mdash; with the exception of the single quote (so that you can ''stop'' quoting as well). For example:

{{code:Output|Quoting to use lots of asterisks|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo '*******'&lt;/source&gt;|*******|}}

So let's try something. Let's assume that for some strange reason we would like to print three asterisks (&quot;***&quot;), then a space, then the current working directory, a space and three more asterisks. We know we can disable metacharater interpretation with single quotes so this should be no biggy, right? And to make life easy, the built-in command 'pwd' '''p'''rints the '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory, so this is really easy:

{{code:Output|Printing the working directory with decorations|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo '*** `pwd` ***'&lt;/source&gt;|*** `pwd` ***|Uh... wait... that's not right...}}

So what went wrong? Well, the single quotes disable interpretation of all special characters. So the grave accents we used for the command substitution didn't work! Can we make it work a different way? Like by using the Path of Working Directory environmentvariable ($PWD)? Nope, the $-character won't work either.

This is a typical Goldilocks problem. We want to quote some special characters, but not all. We could use backslashes, but that doesn't do enough to be convenient (it's too cold). We can use single quotes, but that kills too many special characters (it's too hot). What we need is quoting that's ''juuuust riiiiight''. More to the point, what we want (and more often than you think) is to disable all special character interpretation except
variable and command substitution. Because this is a common desire the shell supports it through a separate quoting mechanism: the double quote. The double quote disables all special character interpretation except the grave accent (command substitution), the $ (variable substitution) and the double quote (so you can ''stop'' quoting). So the solution to our problem above is:

{{code:Output|Printing the working directory with decorations, take II|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo &quot;*** `pwd` ***&quot;&lt;/source&gt;|*** /home/user/examples ***|}}

By the way, we actually cheated a little bit above for educational purposes (hey, you try coming up with these examples); we could also have solved the problem like this:

{{code:Output|Printing the working directory with decorations, alternative|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;echo '***' `pwd` '***'&lt;/source&gt;|*** /home/user/examples ***|}}

This template generates a [[w:pseudo-random|pseudo-random]] integer between 0 and ''count''-1.

; Usage&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;Rand&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''count''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''seed''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;''prime''&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* All parameters are optional and have default values. They must be integers.
* The default ''count'' is 100 (so by default, this template generates values between 0 and 99) and must be non-zero.
* The default ''seed'' is &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#time:z}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and can be set to any other integer value (used to generate distinct values on the same page).
* The default ''prime'' is 67 and should be a prime number above 17 (used to generate distinct values on the same page).

; Examples generating numbers between 0 and 999&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{#time:z}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|67}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|{{#time:z}}|67}} (same as above)
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{#time:z}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|61}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|{{#time:z}}|61}} (this and others should all be different)
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|6}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|6}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|5}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|5}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|4}}

* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|17}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|17}} (varying the prime number)
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|19}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|19}}

* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|53}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|53}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|59}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|59}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|61}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|61}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|67}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|67}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|71}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|71}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|73}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|73}}
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Rand|1000|1|79}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; = {{Rand|1000|0|79}}

; Note&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Varying ''seed'' linearly generates numbers that generate a linear sequence on the same page, with equal cyclic steps;
* Varying ''prime'' (provided that they are odd prime numbers) generates pseudo-random that have independent random distribution.
* Note that when ''count'' is even (such as 100 by default, or 1000 in the examples above), the generated numbers (on the same page) are all odd or all even when you are varying the ''seed'' or ''prime'', unless half of the calls use an even ''seed'' and the others used an odd ''seed''. However, later invokations will still alternate odd and even numbers on output (this problem only occurs on the same page where multiple random numbers are invoked).
* On the same page, multiple invokations of this template with the same parameters will generate the same output value, so it is possible to create multiple links related to the same article.

Implements the mathematical [[w:modulo|modulo]] operator. The returned result is always of the same sign as the ''modulus'' or nul, and its absolute value is lower than the absolute value of the ''modulus''. However, this template returns 0 if the ''modulus'' is nul (this template should never return a division by zero error). This template is '''not''' the same as the mod operator in the #expr [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser function]].

; Usage&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;mod|&lt;/code&gt;''dividend''&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;''modulus''&lt;code&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;
:: Computes the modulo dynamically.
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;subst:mod|&lt;/code&gt;''dividend''&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;''modulus''&lt;code&gt;|subst=subst:}}&lt;/code&gt;
:: Substitute the template invokation by its computed value when saving an article wiki source.

; Examples with positive integer modulus&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{mod|12|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{mod|12|10}}.

{{Random subpage|page=&lt;page name&gt;|start=&lt;number&gt;|end=&lt;number&gt;|seed=&lt;number&gt;}}
or
{{Random subpage|&lt;page name&gt;|&lt;number&gt;|&lt;number&gt;|&lt;number&gt;}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template transcludes a numbered sub-page that is randomly selected between the &quot;start&quot;-numbered sub-page and the &quot;end&quot;-numbered sub-page as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;page name&gt;/&lt;randomly selected number between &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It may be used with or without parameters as follows:
* '''1|page''': The name of the page to be displayed (without the subpage number). The default is empty.
* '''2|start''': The starting sub-subpage number. Must be a positive integer. The default is 1.
* '''3|end''': The ending sub-subpage number. Must be a positive integer. The default is 2.
* '''4|seed''': (optional) The default seed is 2 and can be set to any other integer value (used to generate distinct values on the same page).  Prime numbers work best, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, and 113.

==== Example ====
This template can be used to display a list of randomly selected items from a group of numbered subpages. For example, portals that use &quot;Did you know...&quot; sections can randomly display four items from a page named &quot;Foo/Did you know&quot; that has sixteen numbered subpages as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Random subpage|page=Foo/Did you know|start=1|end=4|seed=2}}
{{Random subpage|page=Foo/Did you know|start=5|end=8|seed=3}}
{{Random subpage|page=Foo/Did you know|start=9|end=12|seed=5}}
{{Random subpage|page=Foo/Did you know|start=13|end=16|seed=7}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|fmbox}} or '''footer &amp; header message box''' template.

It can be used to build message boxes for system messages such as [[MediaWiki:Sp-contributions-footer-anon]]. It can also be used for footer and header boxes on user pages and for [[w:Wikipedia:Editnotice|editnotices]].

This template works similarly to {{tl|ambox}} and mostly uses the same parameters. The main differences are that this box is 100% wide and has different colour styles.

=== Usage ===

Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{fmbox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{fmbox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{fmbox
| type      = editnotice
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = border: 1px solid #f4c430;
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{fmbox
| type = editnotice
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = border: 1px solid #f4c430;
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}

=== Footer and header message box types ===

The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{fmbox
| type = warning
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;warning&lt;/u&gt; – System warning notices such as [[MediaWiki:Revision-info]] and [[MediaWiki:Protectedpagewarning]].
}}

{{fmbox
| type = editnotice
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;editnotice&lt;/u&gt; – Transparent background for [[Wikipedia:Editnotice|editnotices]].
}}

{{fmbox
| type = system
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;system&lt;/u&gt; – Light grey system message background (default).
}}

=== Other images ===

The default images shown above are mostly for testing and demonstration. In most cases it is more appropriate to use a more specific image or no image at all. These examples use the '''image''' parameter to specify an image other than the default image.

{{fmbox
| image = [[Image:User-info.svg|40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:User-info.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; This image is used for [[MediaWiki:Sp-contributions-footer]]. 
}}
{{fmbox
| image = [[Image:Commons-logo.svg|40x40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Commons-logo.svg|40x40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; Note the use of &quot;40x40px&quot; to also limit the height of the image. This image is used for [[MediaWiki:Sharedupload]].
}}

=== Special ===

Some other parameter combinations.

{{fmbox
| text  = No image given ('''default''')
}}
{{fmbox
| image = none
| text  = '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}
{{fmbox
| image = [[Image:User-info.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:User-info.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

=== Parameters ===

List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{fmbox
| type  = system / editnotice / warning
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| id = CSS id
| class = CSS class names
| style = CSS values
| textstyle = CSS values
| text  = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''system'''. That means it gets a light grey background.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:User-info.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''id'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] id used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Mostly meant to be used to tag a message box with its name, to make it easy to detect the presence of the message from javascript. For instance [[MediaWiki:Sp-contributions-footer]] would use:
::&lt;code&gt;id = sp-contributions-footer&lt;/code&gt;

'''class'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] class names used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Mostly meant to be used to tag a message box with its name so it can be individually skinned. For instance [[MediaWiki:Sp-contributions-footer]] would use:
::&lt;code&gt;class = sp-contributions-footer&lt;/code&gt;

'''style'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; but with the ending semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-top: 1em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = font-size: 90%; text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

=== Technical details ===

This template currently uses hard coded styles and class names. Later it will only use CSS classes making it easier to skin. (In the meantime it can be skinned by using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt;&quot; keyword.)

If you need to make a box that is less than 100% wide, then do ''not'' use this box, instead use the {{tl|ombox}}. Since this box doesn't have the &quot;1px empty image cell&quot; code that makes it so the other mboxes get proper box flow in all browsers when less than 100% wide.

If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{fmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{fmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

Internally this meta-template uses HTML wikimarkup instead of wikimarkup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wikimarkup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and some special characters in parameters. 

The default images for this meta-template are in png format instead of svg format. The main reason is that some older web browsers have trouble with the transparent background that MediaWiki renders for svg images. The png images here have hand optimised transparent background colour so they look good in all browsers. Note that svg icons only look somewhat bad in the old browsers, thus such hand optimisation is only worth the trouble for very widely used icons.

'''Note to admins:''' MediaWiki does not parse and convert HTML wikimarkup in system messages the same way as it does for normal pages. This means for instance that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not automatically converted to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and missing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/td&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags are not automatically added. Thus see to that any HTML code you use in system messages are valid XHTML. That is, close all tags that you begin. However, regular wikimarkup works fine in most system messages.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template resolves page names as they would be handled by MediaWiki's template-transclusion process.  It thereby removes ambiguity when doing ''other'' things with template pagenames, e.g. linking.

Key usage is in [[Template:Navbox|navboxes']] view, discuss, edit (v,d,e) menu.

=== Usage ===

*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transclude| Template:Foo }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; '''{{transclude|Template:Foo}}'''
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transclude| Category:Foo }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; '''{{transclude|Category:Foo}}'''
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transclude| Foo }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; '''{{transclude|Foo}}'''
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transclude| :Foo }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; '''{{transclude|:Foo}}'''
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{transclude| :File:Foo }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; '''{{transclude|:File:Foo}}'''

Is it necessary to have a Checking and then a Checklist -- same thing with the Reviewing? What if we just put it as one thing instead of two separate things?

I wonder if it's necessary to have a section within this section that addresses citing sources since section 4:3 is entirely devoted to citing sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A Great Multitude Praises God==

It is in this chapter of Revelation that most of the words used in Handel's Hallelujah! Chorus are found.

===Verses 1-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''After these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, “Alleluia! Salvation, glory, honour, and power to the Lord our God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''for true and righteous are his judgments, for he has judged the great whore which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And again they said, “Alleluia!” And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.'''''

''Commentary:''
Alleluia literally means “praise Yhwh” and is used only in the Old Testament, with the exception of this chapter of Revelation.  This is one of several signs throughout the book that John was a Jewish Christian.  The following verses present those worshipping God, beginning with the 4 creatures and 24 elders we first met in chapter 4.  Beyond this inner group is the multitude, most likely referring to the inhabitants of earth.  While it may seem strange to the modern reader to follow such dramatic violence with songs, God is being praised and worshipped for the righteous judgment he exacted on Rome.  Judgment and worship go together.    &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God who sat on the throne, saying, “Amen. Alleluia.”'''''

''Commentary:''
These 24 elders and 4 creatures is a second group of praise and worship.  This group has appeared throughout Revelation. They appear whenever hymnody is involved--if there is worshipping to be done, they are there to do it.  “Amen! Hallelujah!” is seen in Chapter 5 verse 14 by the same group.

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And a voice came out of the throne, saying, “Praise our God, all of you his servants and you that fear him, both small and great.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This voice’s true identity is not known.  But the voice must be a worshiper of God as it indicates “our God”.  The voice calls the servants to action.  But where these servants are, heaven or earth is not known; they could be hiding on earth, but it is more likely that they are in heaven. Many believe that they are in heaven.  The terms small and great refer to the status of the servants.  (See also Chapter 11:18 and  Matthew 25:14-30)

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I heard the sound of a great multitude, and the sound of many waters, and the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, “Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigns!&quot;''''' 

''Commentary:''
People are rejoicing because God reigns. The sound of this rejoicement sounds like great rushing waters. This shows the power of God and how he ultimately wins in the end and the people who are saved rejoice! The people are rejoicing because God has demonstrated his power by destroying the great harlot and the beast. His fulfillment of his promises have left his followers to give endless praise and this praise will last for eternity.

==The Marriage of the Lamb==

===Verses 7-8===

:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''&quot;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.”''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''To her it was granted that she should be clothed in fine linen, clean and white, for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.'''''

''Commentary:'' Paul grouped the coming of Christ together with the Resurrection and the Rapture&lt;sup&gt;[1 Thess 4:16-17]&lt;/sup&gt; (see commentary on 20:4-5). After Christ meets his followers “in the air,” the marriage of the Lamb takes place. There is clear symbolism here. Christ is represented throughout Revelation as “the Lamb,” symbolizing the giving of his life as an atoning sacrifice for the people of the world, just as lambs were sacrificed on the altar for the sins of Israel. Jesus' wife is the holy Christian church and the Communion of Saints, the people who remained faithful to Christ throughout the many plagues and trials. The linens in which the bride is clothed in are clean and white representing purity, this could be symbolizing salvation. Without Christ's salvation, we are clothed in rags. 

This marriage is worthy of celebration and praise because it is during this marriage that God's people will become united for eternity. The people will wear the linens of salvation and be saved and never tempted by the devil again because they will be in the Lord's embrace in Heaven.

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true sayings of God.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This is one of seven blessings in the book of Revelation. This is a forewshadowing or an introduction to the next chapter of the book, which is about the Great Supper of God. This shows the true bliss of this section. This is interesting because it is referring to the guest of the marriage. God is saying that this event is also by invitation only.
The Lamb refers to Jesus and this wedding imagergy and the marriage supper has strong ties to the Jewish Wedding traditions.During the wedding customs a marriage contract was signed by the bride's parents and the bridegroom. The bride's parents would also give a dowry to the groom and/or his parents, in a period familiar to us: engagement. The second phase of this tradition would occur approximately a calendar year later. The groom would go to the house of the bride, accompanied by groom's men in a parade-like ceremony. The bride, cognizant of this event, would be ready along with the bride's maids and the bridal party would venture to the groom's household. The last phase was the marriage supper that could continue on for several days. John's vision speaks of the third phase. Symbolically the first phase may have been the church's faith in Christ and the acknowledgement of Jesus being their Lord and Savior. The Lamb or groom is Jesus and His bride is the church. The second phase or dowry may be symbolic of Jesus's blood shed on the cross at Calvary. The preparatory state and expectance of the Bridgegroom arriving could be symbolic of Christ's Second Coming and the Rapture of the Church going to Heaven.
This invitation only event not only includes the Church, but also the martyred saints during the tribulation and the saints mentioned in the Old Testament. The celebration is a joyous occasion of all those who have placed their faith in Christ.

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “See that you do not do that. I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”'''''
,
''Commentary:''
John, awestruck, by what the angel revealed to him fell at the angel's feet to worship him. 
This verse emphasizes an important point:  that no one and nothing other than God should be worshiped.  However, John himself makes the same mistake that many have made which points to the idea that most of the people previously punished for worshiping the Beast could have easily been forgiven by God had they repented.  This could also mean that John recognized the worship of angels by fellow Christians during his time and wished to prevent the practice from happening further. The beast demanded the worship, but the angels in Heaven would not permit anyone worshipping them, but the worship was redirected to God.

For a Protestant, this passage is very interesting.  As stated above, this passage very clearly demonstrates that God, and God alone is to be worshiped. As the Catholic tradition developed, it became and still is common practice to pray to and venerate the Virgin Mary, saints, and angels.  While these actions may not necessarily constitute actual worship, but for many Protestants now, and those who began the reform movements, it is very similar and is not to be tolerated.  As a result of these religious tensions, this passage is often pointed to when Protestants are constructing arguments against the veneration of the virgin, saints, or angels.

==The Heavenly Army==

===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse, and he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.'''''

''Commentary:'' We now see Christ, not as a lamb, but as a warrior, ready to make war against the forces of evil. There is a passage in Zechariah —- sometimes called the apocalypse of the Old Testament —- that foretells this event: “I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. The city will be taken, the houses looted, and the women ravaged. Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations… Thus the Lord my God will come, and all the saints with you.”&lt;sup&gt;[Zech 14:2-5]&lt;/sup&gt; In Matthew, Jesus says, &quot;The sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Mt 24:30]&lt;/sup&gt; Isaiah also speaks of such a battle: &quot;The Lord will come with fire and with his chariots, like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword the Lord will judge all flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Is 66:15-16]&lt;/sup&gt; Many have speculated about the nature of this fire, whether it is a nuclear holocaust, a huge meteor, something supernatural, or merely symbolic. The image of the sword is used symbolically in Revelation, where the “Lamb” judges by the sword which proceeds from his mouth, i.e., his words are the standard by which people are judged. It may be that the fire and the sword of Isaiah are also symbolic. Regardless, the prophet Zephaniah says ominously, &quot;All the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Zeph 3:8]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Verses 12-13===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written that no one knew, except he himself.''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word of God.'''''

''Commentary:'' Note that Verse 12 states the rider of this white horse is said to wear many crows or diadems.  John is likely making a direct contrast to the diadems that the dragon wore (Revelation 12:3).  This verse also reveals that no one knows the rider's name except the rider himself.  As scholars have discussed, a name stands for a person and knowledge of a name confers power over the person.  That his name is known only to himself implies that the rider's power is sovereign and unlimited.

Verse 13 states that the rider' garment is dipped in blood.  While there are many ways to interpret this passage, two interpretations are dominant with Biblical scholars.  First, this blood is that of Christ's enemies.  This interpretation draws from Isaiah 63:1-6 in which the garment is stained with blood from walking in the winepress (i.e., God's judgement).  The obvious problem with this interpretation is that Armageddon has not yet been fought.  The second dominant interpretation is that this is Jesus' own blood.  This interpretation draws off the image of Jesus being the sacrificial lamb.

===Verse 14===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.'''''

''Commentary:'' The army of heaven is described in similar terms as the resurrected and raptured believers. They are ''clothed in fine linen, white and clean.''The army could be angelic hosts or saints. It should be noted that the seven bowl carrying angels from earlier were also clothed this way. It signifies their purity and righteousness as believers of God. It is interesting to think this is an army that never fights, and go into &quot;battle&quot; wearing ceremonial garments rather than armor or gear for battle.

===Verse 15===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron, and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.'''''

''Commentary:''
The army does not ride through the winepress, but mearly are witnesses as God executes his judgment. We can imagine that the sword in the rider's mouth is not a typical weapon, but the Word of God as weapon. We have seen in many other places in Revelation and the Bible where a sword if symbolically used as the word of God. In any case, it slaughters at least as competently as any other weapon of destruction.

The word is used to &quot;smite the nations&quot; and destroy those who do not follow or believe in God with the &quot;rod of iron&quot;, which we have seen in previous chapters of Revelation to he Jesus. 

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.'''''

''Commentary:'' For a while, Satan's victory seemed to be complete, but it is short-lived. He barely has time to establish his authority before Christ appears, no longer the sacrificial lamb, but “King of Kings and Lord of Lords.” He rides forth to do battle with Satan in a final showdown between the forces of good and evil.

==The Beast and His Army Are Defeated==

===Verses 17-18===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of the sky, “Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty ones, and the flesh of horses and those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, both free and bond, both small and great.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The call for the carrion to feast on the corpses is, according to Beasley-Murray, a reversal of the sacrificial feast when humans typically feasted on animals.

===Verse 19===
:&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.'''''

''Commentary:''





===Verse 20===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that performed miracles in his presence, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.'''''

''Commentary:''It's interesting to note that the battle never really happens. Armies are assembled, and conflict presumably occurs, yet none of the actual fighting is shown. This reflects the absolutely overwhelming power that God holds. His might is so great that not even the strongest forces of evil assembled together are a non-threat to him. This reflects that a powerful force of evil isn't just a threat to God, it would be a threat to monotheism. If the forces of evil were really a challenge to God, then perhaps he would by definition not be all powerful. This can be used to explain why the battle isn't shown; if God is all powerful then there would not be a need for a battle because he could bind evil before it could do anything against him.

Just as Christ is described by Paul as “the firstfruits of the resurrection” (1 Cor 15:20), the Antichrist and the false prophet are the firstfruits of the lake of fire, for they are sent there in the first judgment at the end of this age. In Revelation, no one else goes there until the last judgment, at the end of the world. Satan and the followers of the Antichrist do not go there at this time, but are imprisoned in the abyss, or bottomless pit, for a thousand years (the &quot;Millennium&quot;). That the beast and his false prophet are cast living into the fire suggests to Witherington that hell is not a place of annihilation, but of punishment.

===Verse 21===
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The remainder were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse, which proceeded out of his mouth, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.'''''

''Commentary:''
Witherington suggests that we are to consider this battle not a battle at all, but a judgment on supernatural evil because the armies are not &quot;thrown into the lake of fire.&quot; But in this verse we see that the followers of the beast are indeed massacred.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This simple template provides an alternative to using a [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions##switch|switch statement]]. Instead, it may be replaced by a call to this template. This allows the syntax to be simplified slightly by using unnamed parameters.

=== Usage ===
Instead of using the following:
&lt;pre&gt;{{#switch:{{{n}}}
 |1=entry1
 |2=entry2
 |3=entry3
  ...
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

the following may be used:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Select parameter|n={{{n}}}
 |entry1
 |entry2
 |entry3
  ...
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

The only named parameter {{{n}}} which is passed to this template should be a [[w:natural number|natural number]].

&lt;includeonly&gt;

----&lt;br /&gt;
== Introduction == 

Whether you believe the stories surrounding the source of the Vedic Mathematics techniques or not, what is important are the techniques themselves. By mastering these techniques you will not only radically improve your numeracy and arithmetic ability, you will also begin to understand that mathematics is a fluid and fascinating subject in which there are usually many different ways to solve any particular problem. You will see that many of the tedious algorithms that you were taught in school, (e.g. long division and multiplication), are but one way to solve a problem. While these 'school' techniques are often ''general purpose'', (e.g. long multiplication allows you to multiply any pair of numbers), in many cases they are very inefficient; their very generality means they have to cover all possibilities and so can't take advantage of the specifics of any particular problem. If instead you use a technique optimised for the particular problem you are working on, you can take advantage of properties that aren't always present in the general case and so solve the problem with a lot less work&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It should be noted that, although many of the following techniques may be contained in the 1965 book ''Vedic Mathematics'' by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji, they are not unique to that book. Many of the techniques are also part of other arithmetic systems, (e.g. the Trachtenberg system), and most are common knowledge among those who enjoy the challenge of mental arithmetic. In fact the term 'Vedic Mathematics' is now sometimes used to encompass the general idea of solving arithmetic problems with a wide range of different techniques, each optimised for particular circumstances, these techniques not being limited to those in Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji's book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, do you want to know how to multiply 89 and 97 in your head in seconds? Read on.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
Chipewyan comes from a Cree term meaning ‘pointed skins,’ but they called themselves ‘Dene’ which means people. They speak a language which belongs to a branch the northeastern Athapaskan language family. Their ancestors were the Taltheilei.

== Fur trade ==
Before the Europeans’ arrival, they inhabited the Northwest, an area dominated by the Canadian shield, along with three other nations: the Ojibwa, the Assiniboin, and the Cree. Historically, the Chipewyan lived on the tundra for parts of the year and hunted the migratory herds of Barren Ground caribou. Families would gather to form hunting groups that would coalesce and disperse with the herds. Leaders were chosen for ability, wisdom and generosity and had limited authority. Later, lured by the fur trade, they left the tundra to take up year-round residence in the boreal forests to the south. This opened up a gap in the tundra for the Caribou Inuit who had traded their traditional marine lifestyle to follow the caribou.

Because of the location of their land, the Chipewyan played a large part in establishing the fur trade. In the 1770s, guides from the Chipewyan nation helped guide Samuel Hearne’s exploration of Rupert’s Land. As posts were built around Lake Athabasca, they became the main suppliers. According to Chipewyan tradition, it was a young woman named Thanadelthur who introduced her people to the Europeans. This successful meeting led to the establishing of Prince of Wales Fort, or Churchill, in 1760 by the Hudson Bay Company for the Chipewyan fur trade. Competition in the fur trade created hostility between many first native groups, including the Chipewyan with their southern neighbours, the Cree and the Inuits, who were to the north.

== Expansion ==
By the early 19th century, the fur trade has expanded west from Hudson Bay to Great Slave Lake. Likewise, the Chipewyan extended their territories south to the full boreal forest, where fur-bearing animals were more abundant. Some even ventured into the northern edge of the parkland to hunt bison. Not all Chipewyan worked in the trade business though, some only traded for food provisions. By late 19th century, they were occupying most of the regions they do today.

== Exposure to disease ==
The Chipewyan’s close contact with Europeans exposed them to deadly for which they hadn’t built up an immunity for. Smallpox and measles were two of the most deadly and contributed largely to native population decline. An example is the outbreak of smallpox in 1780-82 which killed off much of the Chipewyan and Cree population around Hudson Bay.

This is the {{tl|anontools}} template.

It lists a number of tools to help investigate a user IP. It is used in [[MediaWiki:Anontalkpagetext]] and [[MediaWiki:Sp-contributions-footer-anon]] to link to these external sources with the user's IP as a parameter.

=== Usage ===

Takes the user IP address as a parameter. Like this:
:{{tlx|anontools|91.198.174.2}}

Renders this:

{{anontools|91.198.174.2}}

If you follow those links you will find out that the IP address used in this example is for a server in Wikimedia's Amsterdam cluster in the Netherlands.

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|ambox}} or '''article message box''' meta-template.

It is used to build ''article message box'' templates. It offers several different colors, uses default images if no image parameter is given and it has some other features.

This meta-template uses the ambox CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]]. The classes can also be used directly in a [[w:Help:Table|wikitable]] if special functionality is needed. See the [[w:Wikipedia:Ambox CSS classes|how-to guide]] for that.

=== Usage ===
Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ambox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox
| type       = style
| small      = left
| image      = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| smallimage = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|20px]]
| textstyle  = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text       = Text for a big box, for the top of articles.
| smalltext  = Text for the top of article sections.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ambox
| type       = style
| small      = left
| image      = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| smallimage = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|20px]]
| textstyle  = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text       = Text for a big box, for the top of articles.
| smalltext  = Text for the top of article sections.
}}

But you are not really supposed to use red bold italic text.

=== Page message box types ===
The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{ambox
| type  = speedy
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;speedy&lt;/u&gt; – Speedy deletion issues.
}}
{{ambox
| type  = delete
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; – Deletion issues.
}}
{{ambox
| type  = content
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; – Content issues.
}}
{{ambox
| type  = style
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;style&lt;/u&gt; – Style issues. 
}}
{{ambox
| type  = notice
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;notice&lt;/u&gt; – Page notices. 
}}
{{ambox
| type  = move
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;move&lt;/u&gt; – Merge, split and transwiki proposals. 
}}
{{ambox
| type  = protection
| text  = type=&lt;u&gt;protection&lt;/u&gt; – Protection notices.
}}

=== Other images ===
The default images shown above are mostly for convenience. In many cases it is more appropriate to use more specific images. These examples use the '''image''' parameter to specify an image other than the default images.

{{ambox
| type  = content
| image = [[Image:Unbalanced scales.svg|40px]]
| text  = type = content &lt;br&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Unbalanced scales.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; This image is often used for {{tl|POV}} and similar issues.
}}
{{ambox
| type  = move
| image = [[Image:Merge-arrows.svg|50px]]
| text  = type = move &lt;br&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Merge-arrows.svg|50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; This image is used for {{tl|merge}} etc. 
}}

=== More examples ===

Some other parameter combinations.

{{ambox
| text  = No type and no image given ('''default''')
}}
{{ambox
| image = none
| text  = No type and '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}

{{ambox
| image = [[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / move / protection
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS values
| textstyle = CSS values
| text  = The message body text. 
| small = {{{small|}}} / left
| smallimage = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|20px]]
| smallimageright = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|20px]]
| smalltext  = A shorter message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''notice'''. That means it gets a blue side bar.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter. 
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (Images over 52 pixels width will cause padding problems.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:Unbalanced scales.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.
:&lt;s&gt;'''blank'''&lt;/s&gt; = This parameter is now deprecated. If you see it in use, change it to &quot;image=none&quot;.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (Images over 52 pixels width will cause padding problems.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''style'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; but with the ending semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-bottom: 0.5em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

==== The small parameters ====

The small article message boxes are meant for the top of sections. Normally they should only contain one or two lines of text.

{{ambox
| small = left
| text = small = yes
}}
{{ambox
| type = style
| small = left
| text = type = style &lt;br&gt; small = left
}}
'''small'''
:'''left''' = Makes it a smaller left aligned message box. This also makes the default images smaller. Note that any data fed to the '''smallimage''', '''smallimageright''' and '''smalltext''' parameters is only used if &quot;small=left&quot;. To make it so your template also understands the small parameter you can use this code:
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;small = {{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{ambox
| small = left
| image      = [[File:Gnome globe current event.svg|50px]]
| smallimage = [[File:Gnome globe current event.svg|25px]]
| text = 
small = left &lt;br&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; smallimage = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|25px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}
'''smallimage'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimage''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''image''' parameter. If the '''image''' parameter also is empty then a small default image is used.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 20px width is usually about right for boxes with one line of text, while 25px width is usually about right for boxes with two lines of text. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimage = [[File:Gnome globe current event.svg|20px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''image''', when &quot;small=left&quot;.

{{ambox
| small = left
| imageright = [[File:Gnome globe current event.svg|50px]]
| smallimageright = none
| text = 
small = yes &lt;br&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Gnome globe current event.svg|50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; smallimageright = none
}}
'''smallimageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimageright''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''imageright''' parameter. If the '''imageright''' parameter also is empty then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 20px - 25px width is usually about right. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|20px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.
:'''none''' = Means that no right side image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''imageright''', when &quot;small=left&quot;.

'''smalltext'''
:A shorter version of the message body text. If no '''smalltext''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''text''' parameter.

=== Technical details ===
If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ambox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe &amp;amp;#124; and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ambox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe &amp;#124; and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags that surround the text in the example above are usually not needed. But if the text contains line breaks then sometimes we get weird line spacing. This especially happens when using vertical dotted lists. Then use the div tags to fix that.

This template uses CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]] for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable. 

This template calls {{tl|ambox/core}} which holds most of the code for {{tl|ambox}}, while {{tl|ambox}} itself does parameter preprocessing. 

Internally this meta-template uses HTML wikimarkup instead of wikimarkup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wikimarkup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and some special characters in parameters.

This is the {{tl|ambox/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|ambox}} instead.

This template is called from {{tl|ambox}}. It holds almost all of the code for {{tl|ambox}}, while {{tl|ambox}} does parameter preprocessing. Thus simplifying the code in {{tl|ambox/core}}.

For more documentation see {{tl|ambox}}.

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|tmbox}} or '''talk page message box''' meta-template.

It is used to build message box templates for talk pages. It offers several different colors, uses default images if no image parameter is given and it has some other features.

This template should normally not be used for WikiProject banners. They have special needs and thus have their own meta-templates. See the &quot;See also&quot; section below for links.

This template works similarly to {{tl|ambox}} and uses the same parameters.

=== Suggested style standard ===

The types of talkpage messageboxes follow the same naming convention as the boxes for all other namespaces, but the type of any particular talkpage messagebox may not be as obvious as in other namespaces.  When deciding on the type to use for a talkpage messagebox, please consider the following guidelines:
* '''speedy''' should ''only'' be used for speedy deletion templates.
* '''delete''' should ''only'' be used for templates relating to ''ongoing'' deletion discussions.  Please do ''not'' use this type just to get a red border for a messagebox.
* '''content''' and '''style''' should be used for warnings and alerts.  Use '''content''' (which has an orange border) for more important and immediate alerts, and '''style''' (yellow border) for less important warnings.  Messageboxes of these types should ideally be ''transitory'': they should not be expected to remain on a talkpage indefinitely.  
* '''move''' and '''protection''' should only be used for messageboxes relating to moves and merges, and page protection, respectively. 
* The '''notice''' type should be used for the majority of talkpage messageboxes; those that are intended to convey or summarize information.  If a talkpage messagebox does not obviously fit into one of the other types, it is probably a notice type.

=== Usage ===

Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{tmbox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{tmbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}

=== Talk page message box types ===

The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{tmbox
| type = speedy
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;speedy&lt;/u&gt; – Speedy deletion templates.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = delete
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; – Deletion templates.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = content
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; – Major warnings and problems.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = style
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;style&lt;/u&gt; – Minor warnings and problems.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = notice
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;notice&lt;/u&gt; – Notices and messages of any kind, both permanent and temporary.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = move
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;move&lt;/u&gt; – Merge, split, rename and transwiki messages and proposals.
}}
{{tmbox
| type = protection
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;protection&lt;/u&gt; – Protection templates.
}}

=== Special ===
Some other parameter combinations.

{{tmbox
| text  = No type and no image given ('''default''')
}}
{{tmbox
| image = none
| text  = No type and '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}
{{tmbox
| image = [[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / move / protection
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS values
| textstyle = CSS values
| text  = The message body text. 
| small = {{{small|}}} / yes
| smallimage = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smallimageright = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smalltext  = A shorter message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''notice'''. That means it gets a gray border.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter. 
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:Crystal package settings.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''style'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; but with the ending semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-bottom: 0.5em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

==== The small parameters ====
{{tmbox
| small = yes
| text = small = yes
}}
{{tmbox
| type = style
| small = yes
| text = type = style &lt;br /&gt; small = yes
}}
'''small'''
:'''yes''' = Makes it a smaller right floating message box. This also makes the default images smaller. Note that any data fed to the '''smallimage''', '''smallimageright''' and '''smalltext''' parameters is only used if &quot;small=yes&quot;. To make it so your template also understands the small parameter you can use this code:
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;small = {{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{tmbox
| small = yes

}}
'''smallimage'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimage''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''image''' parameter. If the '''image''' parameter also is empty then a small default image is used.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 30px width is usually about right. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimage = [[Image:Crystal package settings.png|30px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''image''', when &quot;small=yes&quot;.

}}

'''smallimageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimageright''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''imageright''' parameter. If the '''imageright''' parameter also is empty then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 30px width is usually about right. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|30px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.
:'''none''' = Means that no right side image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''imageright''', when &quot;small=yes&quot;.

'''smalltext'''
:A shorter version of the message body text. If no '''smalltext''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''text''' parameter.

=== Technical details ===
If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{tmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{tmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

This template uses the tmbox CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]] for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.

This template calls {{tl|tmbox/core}} which holds most of the code for {{tl|tmbox}}, while {{tl|tmbox}} itself does parameter preprocessing. 

Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and special characters in parameters.

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|cmbox}} or '''category message box''' meta-template.

It is used to build message box templates for category pages. It offers several different colours, uses default images if no image parameter is given and it has some other features.

This template works almost exactly like {{tl|ambox}} and uses the same parameters.

=== Usage ===
Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cmbox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{cmbox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cmbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{cmbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[Image:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}

=== Category message box types ===

The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{cmbox
| type = speedy
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;speedy&lt;/u&gt; – Speedy deletion templates.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = delete
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; – Deletion templates.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = content
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; – Major warnings and problems.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = style
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;style&lt;/u&gt; – Minor warnings and problems.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = notice
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;notice&lt;/u&gt; – Notices and messages of any kind, both permanent and temporary.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = move
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;move&lt;/u&gt; – Move, merge and split messages and proposals.
}}
{{cmbox
| type = protection
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;protection&lt;/u&gt; – Protection templates when shown on a category page.
}}

=== Other images ===
The default images shown above are mostly for convenience. In many cases it is more appropriate to use more specific images. These examples use the '''image''' parameter to specify an image other than the default images.

{{cmbox
| type  = style
| image = [[Image:Sub-arrows.svg|40px]]
| text  = type = style &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Sub-arrows.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}
{{cmbox
| type  = move
| image = [[Image:Redirect arrow.svg|52px]]
| text  = type = move &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Redirect arrow.svg|52px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

=== Special ===

Some other parameter combinations.

{{cmbox
| text  = No type and no image given ('''default''')
}}
{{cmbox
| image = none
| text  = No type and '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}

{{cmbox
| image = [[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]
| text  = image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

{{cmbox
| image = [[Image:Gnome globe current event.svg|42px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Shuttle.svg|20px]]
| text  = '''This category lists articles about current and recent spaceflights.'''
}}

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cmbox
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / move / protection
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS values
| textstyle = CSS values
| text  = The message body text. 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''notice'''. That means it gets a blue background.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter. 
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:Sub-arrows.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''style'''
:An optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] value used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-bottom: 0.5em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:An optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] value used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

=== Technical details ===
If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{cmbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}


This template uses the cmbox CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]] for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.

Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and special characters in parameters.

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|ombox}} or '''other pages message box''' meta-template.

It is used to build message box templates for pages of the types: User, Wikibooks, MediaWiki, Template, Help, Subject, and any new future namespaces. That is, page types not covered by {{tl|ambox}}, {{tl|tmbox}}, {{tl|imbox}} or {{tl|cmbox}}. Thus it should ''not'' be used for boxes for articles, talk pages, image pages or category pages.

This template works almost exactly like {{tl|ambox}} and uses the same parameters.

=== Usage ===
Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ombox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ombox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ombox
| type      = style
| image     = [[File:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px|link=]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ombox
| type      = style
| image     = [[File:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px|link=]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}

=== Other pages message box types ===
The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{ombox
| type = speedy
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;speedy&lt;/u&gt; – Speedy deletion templates.
}}
{{ombox
| type = delete
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; – Deletion templates.
}}
{{ombox
| type = content
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; – Major warnings and problems.
}}
{{ombox
| type = style
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;style&lt;/u&gt; – Minor warnings and problems.
}}
{{ombox
| type = notice
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;notice&lt;/u&gt; – Notices and messages of any kind, both permanent and temporary.
}}
{{ombox
| type = move
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;move&lt;/u&gt; – Merge, split, rename and transwiki messages and proposals.
}}
{{ombox
| type = protection
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;protection&lt;/u&gt; – Protection templates when shown on &quot;other pages&quot;.
}}

=== Examples ===
Some examples using the &quot;notice&quot; style:

{{ombox
| text  = No type and no image given ('''default''')
}}
{{ombox
| image = none
| text  = No type and '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}
{{ombox

'''This page in a nutshell:''' This template is used to build message boxes for all pages that are ''not'' book pages, talk pages, image pages or category pages.
}}

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ombox
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / move / protection
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS values
| textstyle = CSS values
| text  = The message body text. 
| small = {{{small|}}} / yes
| smallimage = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smallimageright = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|30px]]
| smalltext  = A shorter message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''notice'''. That means it gets a gray border.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter. 
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:Crystal package settings.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''style'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; but with the ending semicolons &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-bottom: 0.5em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:Optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] values used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

==== The small parameters ====
{{ombox
| small = yes
| text = small = yes
}}
{{ombox
| type = style
| small = yes
| text = type = style &lt;br /&gt; small = yes
}}
'''small'''
:'''yes''' = Makes it a smaller right floating message box. This also makes the default images smaller. Note that any data fed to the '''smallimage''', '''smallimageright''' and '''smalltext''' parameters is only used if &quot;small=yes&quot;. To make it so your template also understands the small parameter you can use this code:
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;small = {{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{ombox
| small = yes
| image      = [[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|50px]]
| smallimage = [[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|32px]]
| text = 
small = yes &lt;br&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; smallimage = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|32px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}
'''smallimage'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimage''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''image''' parameter. If the '''image''' parameter also is empty then a small default image is used.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 30px width is usually about right. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimage = [[Image:Replacement filing cabinet.svg|30px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''image''', when &quot;small=yes&quot;.

{{ombox
| small = yes
| imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|50px]]
| smallimageright = none
| text = 
small = yes &lt;br&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|50px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt; smallimageright = none
}}
'''smallimageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''smallimageright''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''imageright''' parameter. If the '''imageright''' parameter also is empty then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 30px width is usually about right. For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;smallimageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|30px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.
:'''none''' = Means that no right side image is used. This overrides any image fed to '''imageright''', when &quot;small=yes&quot;.

'''smalltext'''
:A shorter version of the message body text. If no '''smalltext''' parameter is given then this template falls back to use the '''text''' parameter.

=== Technical details ===
If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{ombox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{ombox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

This template uses the ombox CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]] for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.

This template calls {{tl|ombox/core}} which holds most of the code for {{tl|ombox}}, while {{tl|ombox}} itself does parameter preprocessing. 

Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and special characters in parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Satan Is Imprisoned for a Thousand Years==
===Verses 1-3===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He took hold of the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.''''' &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up and set a seal upon him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished, but after that he must be set free for a short time.'''''

''Commentary:''
These first three verses function more as a conclusion to the preceding chapter than as a beginning to the rest of this chapter.  The Beast and his prophet have already been handled.  Now it is time for the third member of this unholy trinity.  His various names are listed in verse 2 to remind readers of his various characteristics: dragon – ancient enemy of God; serpent – tempter and liar of humankind; and Ha Satan or the Devil – the accuser.  He is then bound and thrown in a bottomless (i.e., inescapable) pit for a thousand years.  The triple imagery of being thrown in, locked in, and sealed off show how completely Satan is out of the game, at least for now.  It is important to note, however, that Satan is not killed.  It seems that evil can never be completely destroyed, only contained.  This should serve as a warning against complacency to the believer.   Christ’s victory on the cross and the promise of his final victory do not allow us to let down our guards.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also interesting to note that since the angel comes down from heaven with the key, this would indicate that these events occur somewhere other than heaven. Perhaps they are even to have happened on earth's surface.

It is safe to say that the bottomless pit is not in Heaven, but is representative of a place for those separated from God and demonic spirits. Satan's dominion and influence has now become curtailed because of the victory Christ had when he conquered the grave.

==The First Resurrection==
===Verses 4-5===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, nor his image, nor had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years,''''' &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''but the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.''''

''Commentary:'' In the New Testament, the resurrection was exemplified in Jesus, who is said to have risen from the dead after three days. Paul writes, &quot;Since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all will be made alive. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at his coming.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[1 Cor 15:21-23]&lt;/sup&gt; Another development in the New Testament is the understanding, principally from this passage, that there are two resurrections: one for the people of God before the Millennium; the other for the rest of the people after the Millennium. Those who are a part of the first resurrection will not have to worry about the &quot;second death&quot; and the &quot;lake of fire” associated with the Last Judgment (see below). Jesus’ words agree with those of Revelation: &quot;He who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has everlasting life, and will not come into judgment… The hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear his voice and come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Jn 5:24-26]&lt;/sup&gt;

The persecuted and martyered saints are once again mentioned. The reference to the martyrs once again seems to appear quite a few times in Revelation. Given the context that John writes his revelation in, this reoccurring theme is not surprising. During this time the early church was undergoing persecution and John's words served to bring solace and encouragement. 

The [[Bible]] teaches that our resurrected bodies will be different from those we have now. [[Jesus]] said, &quot;In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Mt22:30]&lt;/sup&gt; The resurrected body, therefore, is a spiritual body which does not have the needs of the physical body. [[Paul]] adds, “So also is the resurrection of the dead: the body is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[1 Cor 15:42-44]&lt;/sup&gt; For Paul, the words of the prophet [[Hosea]]&lt;sup&gt;[Hos 13:14]&lt;/sup&gt; find their fulfilment in the resurrection: &quot;O death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[1Cor 15:55]&lt;/sup&gt;

In his letter to the church at Thessalonica, Paul writes, &quot;The Lord himself will descend from heaven... and the dead in Christ will rise first.” But he adds that “we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[1Th 4:16-17]&lt;/sup&gt; The rising of those who are still alive to join the resurrected dead is known as the ''Rapture''. Paul's words imply that he believed the three events —- the coming of the Lord, the Resurrection, and the Rapture —- would be more or less simultaneous.

This passage also has a great deal to do with Rome. Beheading was a common method of Roman execution. However, it was not a punishment that was given to just anyone. It was an execution designed for Roman citizens, since it was considered to be less humiliating than crucifixion. It is interesting to note that John never directly says anything about those who followed Christ, but were not martyred for their beliefs. It can be assumed from the passage about the faithful in the book of life that they are rewarded, but the book uses passages like these to comfort and console those who find themselves on trial for their beliefs.

===Verse 6===

:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Blessed and holy are those who have a part in the first resurrection. On such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.'''''

''Commentary:'' Although there are other passages in the Bible which speak of an age of peace, only Revelation tells us how long it lasts. The word ''millennium'' simply means &quot;one thousand years&quot; and could refer to any thousand-year period, but through common usage, ''the'' Millennium has come to be understood as referring to the age of peace of Revelation. In the Millennium, the forces of darkness have no power on the Earth. It is a time of love and unity, of peace and harmony. Isaiah speaks of such a time and describes it in Edenic terms: 
: The wolf will dwell with the lamb; the leopard will lie down with the young goat; the calf, and the young lion, and the yearling together, and a little child will lead them. The cow and the bear will graze; their young ones will lie down together; and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole; and the weaned child will put his hand in the viper's den. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&lt;sup&gt;[Is 11:5-9]&lt;/sup&gt;

Just as the physical bodies of people are changed into spiritual bodies in the resurrection, so Isaiah implies that animals will undergo a transformation which enables them to live in peace with human beings and with each other. There is no more killing, either in the human or the animal kingdoms. God reverses the covenant made with Noah in which he said, &quot;The fear and the dread of you will be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that moves on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Gen 9:2]&lt;/sup&gt; If the passage in Isaiah is interpreted literally, a return to the vegetarian diet of Eden&lt;sup&gt;[cf. Gen 1:29-30]&lt;/sup&gt; seems to be a natural conclusion.

Micah expresses similarly lofty thoughts, adding that Jerusalem will be the Lord’s capital in those days:

: Out of Zion the word of the law will go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples, and rebuke strong nations afar off. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more. But everyone will sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one will make them afraid.&lt;sup&gt;[Micah 4:2-4]&lt;/sup&gt;

John continues to encourage his readers, especially those in persecuted regions and lifts their spirits helping them to endure. It is interesting to note that the martyrs are given a priestly role. This may suggest that these priests can intercede for those that still remain on earth.

==The Final Confrontation between Good and Evil ==
===Verses 7-8===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''After the thousand years have expired, Satan will be freed from his prison,''''' &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.'''''

''Commentary:'' There is continuing discussion over the identity of Gog and Magog. In the context of the passage, they seem to equate to something like “east and west.” There is a passage in Ezekiel, however, where God says to the prophet, &quot;Set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Ezek 38:2]&lt;/sup&gt; Gog, in this instance, is the name of a person of the land of Magog, who is ruler (“prince”) over the regions of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Ezekiel says of him: &quot;You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you...&quot;&lt;sup&gt;Ezek 38:2&lt;/sup&gt; Despite this huge show of force, the battle will be short-lived, for Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation all tell us that this last desperate attempt to destroy the people and the city of God will end in disaster: &quot;I [i.e. God] will bring him to judgement with pestilence and bloodshed. I will rain down on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him: flooding rain, great hailstones, fire and brimstone.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Ezek 38:22]&lt;/sup&gt; 

===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, but fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.'''''

''Commentary:'' It may be that the images of fire raining down are an ancient vision of modern weapons, though these passages may also be interpreted as a supernatural intervention by God, or they may be interpreted symbolically.It is hard to distinguish if the beloved city here is referring to Jerusalem or a different place. Some believe that the beloved city is actually referring to the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;, the city of God, because old Jerusalem was earlier in the book equated with Sodom and Gomorrah. Witherington guesses that the beloved city is neither Jerusalem nor Rome nor any other city we've heard of before, but only a metaphor for the society of the saints. The battle is not fight by the saints, but by God, as He is the one that brings down the fire. This attack is similar to the results and methods of destruction used in the battle of God and Magog, as described by Ezekiel.

===Verse 10===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and he will be tormented day and night forever and ever.'''''

''Commentary:'' This verse shows Satan joining the beast and the false prophet in the lake of fire.  (Recall the beast and the false prophet were condemned at the beginning of the Millennium in Revelation 19:20, and now we are at the end of the 1,000 years.)  In other words, this is the final overthrow of Satan.  It is important to note that this punishment is clearly described as a permanent, eternal one, quite unlike Satan's earlier punishment of Revelation 20:2 in which Satan is captured for a thousand years.  It is interesting to note that many Christians conceive of Satan as the tormenter of the damned, but this verse clearly indicates that Satan will also be tormented for all of eternity, a punishment worse than death because there is no escape.

==The Last Judgment==
===Verse 11===
:&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them.'''''

''Commentary:'' The Last, or Final, Judgement is sometimes called the Great White Throne Judgement because of this description. Jesus sits on the throne, and this is where He, the Judge will do the final judgment. This throne is different from any mentioned previously in the book of Revelation and signifies that the person who is seated there is more important than any mentioned before (it could be Jesus or God himself). The white throne represents the righteous and holy ways that the judgment will convey.  All must pass before this throne to be judged. The fact that the earth and heaven attempt to flee is metaphorically saying there was no place for anyone to escape too to hide from God's judgment, and that it is so overwhelming they try and escape it but can't.

===Verses 12-13===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God. The books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life, and the dead were judged according to those things which were written in the books, according to their works.''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead who were in them, and they were judged everyone according to their works.'''''

''Commentary:'' Everyone must stand before and be judged before God, this is everyone who has ever lived since the biginning of time. It even states in these verses that the sea will give yo the dead, symbolizing that no one is able to escape the judgement. This is the seventh vision of the prophet which begins in Chapter 19. All are reunited with their bodies to be judged. This is the second resurrection. The fact that God is using to books to judge implies that he is doing it justly and fairly, taking all actions into account. Every person's name will either be in the Book of Life or in the book of damnation. The people will not be able to give excuses or become sorrowful. Their destination is chosen and written in the books. Despite the comfort of just and fair judgement, this passage has a dark focus on death, the sea, and the wicked.  This verse toys with the idea of salvation being dependent by faith or works, as the dead are judged by their works. Witherington suggests that we consider the dead coming from the sea as people who have not made it into Hades due to incomplete or improper burial rituals.

===Verses 14-15===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.''''' &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And whoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.'''''

''Commentary:'' Just as the Bible speaks of two births (the physical and the spiritual), it speaks of two deaths. The first death is physical death, and the second is the death of the soul in the lake of fire. 

While the Antichrist and False Prophet, who are thrown into the lake of fire before the Millennium, are said in Revelation to suffer eternal torments, no mention is made of eternal torment in connection with those who are banished to the lake of fire at the last judgment. The description of the lake of fire as the &quot;second death&quot; implies that the souls of those who go there at the last judgment do not live forever, but die, either immediately or after a suitable period of punishment. Many people believe that the souls of the lost will, nevertheless, suffer eternally, and offer scriptural passages to support their argument. Others offer passages which indicate that the nature of God only allows for punishment until such a time as justice has been served, and no more. There are therefore conflicting viewpoints on the subject.

While it is not specifically stated, it is implied that those who are a part of the second resurrection, i.e. the rest of humanity that were not martyrs, go on to suffer the second death in the lake of fire.  Also, the specific mention of Death and Hades being cast into the lake of fire make it clear that those two entities were not associated with Hell itself.

Much of the judgment of Revelation 20 is echoed in Daniel 7.  Both texts speak of a divine judgment, the defeat of a beast, and those in whom God finds favor.  There may also be an allusion to Daniel 7:10 in Revelation 20:15's mention of the Book of Life as Daniel 7:10 speaks of books which are part of the process of divine judgement at the end of times.  Isiah 24 and Ezekiel 36-39 also contain similarities to Revelation 20.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
{{Navbox suite}}
This template is designed to be used with {{tl|Navbox}} or other navigational templates that allow creating lists of links with groups headers or titles. This template allows the creation of subgroups that can be assigned to a list item within {{tl|Navbox}}. A subgroup may contain up to 20 list items.

== Blank template ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Navbox subgroup
| groupstyle = 
| liststyle  = 

| group1 = 
| list1  = 
| group2 = 
| list2  = 
...
| group20 = 
| list20  = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameters ==
This template employs all parameters of {{tl|Navbox}}.  Please see the documentation there for more complete descriptions.  In fact, the only differences between this template and {{tl|Navbox}} are as follows:
*The border parameter defaults to &quot;child&quot;
*The group padding defaults to 0.75em on the left/right, and can only be changed with the &lt;code&gt;grouppadding&lt;/code&gt; parameter.  This is done to prevent the [[w:Internet Explorer box model bug|Internet Explorer box model bug]] from affecting the width of groups.
Everything else is ''exactly'' the same as {{tl|Navbox}}.

Only the most common parameters are listed below.
=== Cells ===
:; ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
::  (i.e. ''list1'', ''list2'', ... ''list20'') The body of the template, usually a list of links. Format is inline.  At least one ''list'' parameter is required; each additional ''list'' is displayed in a separate row of the table. Each ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be preceded by a corresponding ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter, if provided (see below). The background color of the list items (and the entire table) defaults to &lt;code&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt;, therefore it displays the same background color used in the parent navigation box.

:; ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
:: (i.e. ''group1'', ''group2'', ..., ''group20'') If specified, text appears in a header cell displayed to the left of ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. If omitted, ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' uses the full width of the table. The background color defaults to &lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background:#e6e6ff; color:black;&quot;&gt;#e6e6ff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but can be changed via the ''groupstyle'' parameter (see below).

=== Styles ===
:; ''bodystyle''
:: Specifies [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles to apply to the template body. Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;text-align:[''right/center/left/justified''];&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''groupstyle''
:: CSS styles to apply to the ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' cells. This option overrides any styles that are applied to the entire table. Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;text-align:[''left/center/right''];&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;vertical-align:[''top/middle/bottom''];&lt;/code&gt;
::: &lt;code&gt;white-space:nowrap;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''grouppadding''
:: CSS style to specify group padding.  Should usually be specified using em units.  It is recommended to leave this parameter alone and use the default padding.  Examples:
::: &lt;code&gt;grouppadding = 0em 1em;&lt;/code&gt; (1em on left/right, 0em on top/bottom)
::: &lt;code&gt;grouppadding = 0em 0.5em 0em 1em;&lt;/code&gt; (0em top, 0.5em right, 0em bottom, 1em left)

:; ''liststyle''
:: CSS styles to apply to all lists. Overridden by the ''oddstyle'' and ''evenstyle'' parameters (if specified) below.

:; ''oddstyle''
:; ''evenstyle''
:: CSS styles to apply to the odd-numbered list items (''list1'', ''list3'', etc) or even-numbered list items (''list2'', ''list4'', etc), respectively. Typically used to set background color (&lt;code&gt;background:#''nnnnnn'';&lt;/code&gt;) in order to achieve an alternating background color between odd and even-numbered lists.

:; ''evenodd'' &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[swap, even, odd, off]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
:: If set to &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt;, then the automatic striping of even and odd rows is reversed.  Normally, even rows get a light gray background for striping; when this parameter is used, the odd rows receive the gray striping instead of the even rows.  Setting to &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;odd&lt;/code&gt; sets all rows to have that striping color.  Setting to &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt; disables automatic row striping. NOTE: Due to system limitations, do '''not''' use a semi-colon to close this command. 

==Setting the width of groups==
If multiple {{tl|Navbox subgroup}} templates are used inside of a parent {{tl|Navbox}}, it generally looks better if the width of the groups matches up.  In order to do this, one must set the &lt;code&gt;groupstyle&lt;/code&gt; parameters to contain the desired width, and the &lt;code&gt;liststyle&lt;/code&gt; parameters to have width:auto (due to HTML/CSS reasons).  For example, place the following code in each {{tl|Navbox subgroup}} to adjust the widths:
:&lt;code&gt;groupstyle = width:10em;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;liststyle = width:auto;&lt;/code&gt;
*NOTE: For the &lt;code&gt;groupstyle&lt;/code&gt; widths to work, you '''must''' set the &lt;code&gt;liststyle&lt;/code&gt; width to &quot;auto&quot;.
If you also use the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;imageleft&lt;/code&gt; parameters, then you will most likely also need to set their width manually using the &lt;code&gt;imagestyle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;imageleftstyle&lt;/code&gt; parameters.

==Examples==
=== Example 1 ===
The following is an example of ''Navbox subgroup'' used within a ''Navbox'' template.

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:scroll;&quot;&gt;
{{Navbox

| name   = Protected Areas of Colorado
| title  = Protected Areas of Colorado
| group1 = National Park Service

  | group1 = National Parks
  | list1  = Black Canyon of the Gunnison{{·}} |Great Sand Dunes{{·}} Mesa Verde{{·}} Rocky Mountain
  | group2 = National Monuments
  | list2  = Colorado{{·}} Florissant Fossil Beds{{·}} Hovenweep{{·}} Yucca House
  | group3 = National Historic Sites
  | list3  = Bent's Old Fort{{·}} Sand Creek Massacre
  | group4 = National Recreation Area
  | list4  = Curecanti
  }}
| group2 = National Forests
| list2  = Arapaho{{·}} Grand Mesa{{·}} Gunnison{{·}} |Pike{{·}} Rio Grande{{·}} Roosevelt{{·}} Medicine Bow - Routt{{·}} San Isabel{{·}} San Juan{{·}} Uncompahgre{{·}} White River
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Navbox
| state  = uncollapsed
| name   = Protected Areas of Colorado
| title  = Protected Areas of Colorado
| group1 = National Park Service
| list1  =
  {{Navbox subgroup
  | group1 = National Parks
  | list1  = Black Canyon of the Gunnison{{·}} |Great Sand Dunes{{·}} Mesa Verde{{·}} Rocky Mountain
  | group2 = National Monuments
  | list2  = Colorado{{·}} Florissant Fossil Beds{{·}} Hovenweep{{·}} Yucca House

}}

=== Example 2 ===
This example implements horizontal group headings by assigning the headings to &lt;code&gt;list1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list3&lt;/code&gt; and the links to &lt;code&gt;list2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list4&lt;/code&gt;), then using &lt;code&gt;list1style&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list3style&lt;/code&gt; to set the background color of the headings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A New Heaven and Earth==
===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea.''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.'''''

''Commentary:'' The Last Judgement has marked the end of history as we have previously known it. The drama of this earth has reached its conclusion and the curtain is lowered on the stage of human history. Isaiah also speaks of a new heaven and earth: &quot;Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former will not be remembered nor come to mind.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Isa 65:17]&lt;/sup&gt;

Here John describes the New Jerusalem as a bride who is a gift from God.  This imagery fits with other early Jewish apocalyptic work.  One particular idea that may be in mind is the belief that the new city already existed and would soon be made visible.  In fitting this to his audience, John may be suggesting that the New Jerusalem is currently in heaven as the dwelling place of the martyrs and will descend to earth.  The details are not the important part.  The message is that the new city and the fellowship of the believers will be beautiful.  God will finally finish the work he began at the start of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In verse 1 it states that there is no more sea.  We as a people have for the most part a love for the sea and its beaches.  In biblical times, the sea was seen as being rough and unstable, so taking this away is symbolic for removing that unstableness from the earth.  People who went out to sea on boats were sometimes never heard from again.  For one to truly understand why the sea may be seen as a bad thing one must look at this from the eyes of a person living in biblical times.

===Verse 3===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I heard a loud voice out of heaven, saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them, and be their God.'''''

''Commentary:''
This is an exciting verse for numerous reasons. It will be the first time humanity will see God and be in his presence. The believers will all be &quot;his people&quot; with no more references to race or diversity. There will be no more deaths, for all the people will be part of God's eternal life. Some translations use the word peoples instead of just people, which implies that there should be no racial or cultural division between the people of God. This shows early Christianity's nature; while Judaism was essentially a closed-off religion to outsiders, Christianity went out to the gentiles as well. Another well known instance of this occurring in the bible is the event of Pentecost.

This verse foreshadows Revelation 21:22 which says that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem.  Instead &quot;the tabernacle of God is with men.&quot;  Verse 3 depicts God dwelling among men as a set up for the revelation that no temple will be required in the New Jerusalem.  The temple's importance was based on it being the dwelling place of God on earth.  In the New Jerusalem God dwells not in the temple, but throughout the city.
The verse is also a reference to Leviticus 26.11 and Exzekiel 37.27, which indicates that this passage would have special meaning for Jewish Christians.

===Verse 4===
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor will there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away.'''''

''Commentary:''
After the period of judgment, God will make a new Heaven and earth that is pure and free from evil and mourning, there will no longer be suffering or a reason for tears. Just as our mothers have wiped away our tears in our earthly life, God will wipe away our tears in the heavenly life. The pain and suffering has passed and the people can now move forward into bliss. This heaven will now be a place of happiness and love rather than the turmoil previously experienced. The curse placed upon the world for the original sins will be removed. 

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He who sat upon the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” And he said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”'''''

''Commentary:''
God is making a new world. But this time, Satan is not around to tempt and corrupt the people. The people who populate this new world are the people that have chosen God over evil. Thus, they deserve the utter bliss of this new earth. The people will not remember the pain and suffering that was endured to get to this place and they will inhabit newly created transformation that is free from all previous evil.

This is a very important passage because it is one of the few times God is mentioned directly in the book of Revelation. And his instructions to write are informing John to write the whole book, not just this passage.

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''And he said to me, “It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give from the fountain of the water of life freely to the one who thirsts.”'''''

''Commentary:''
The phrase it is done is similar to Jesus Christ’s last words on the cross.  However, this time the reader does not know what is finished.  Perhaps it is what is finished is God’s new creation.  The Alpha and Omega, beginning and end it has been previously mentioned, and is a very important phrase in the Christian faith.  This phrase is showing absolute sovereignty and power, and saying the same thing twice brings attention to its importance. This water of life is also mentioned in the Gospels, and it is a symbol of eternal life (free of cost as water is most often free of cost).  Unlike Chapter 20, this passage as well as the rest of this Chapter is very comforting and gives great hope to followers of Christ.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''&quot;The one who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be my child.&quot;'''''

''Commentary:''
He who overcomes is promised “all things”  it is a promise to those who are strong in faith and hope. This title is for the people of God.  Note that it does not directly call God the Father, even through he takes on a father like role. The idea of a personal relashionship is established in this verse between God and God's people. This goes back to Genesis 17:7 KJV where God made a covenant with Abraham: &quot;7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.&quot;

===Verse 8===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, whoremongers, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”'''''

''Commentary:''  Scholars have questioned why John would include this list of censured activities.  It is imperative to remember that John's target audience is Christians under pressure and threat of persecution.  Therefore, it was important to remind the recipients of this work that these types of activities were not to be tolerated.  As Ben Witherington III notes, &quot;The intended rhetorical effect of this verse was not to castigate the lost or gloat over their demise, but rather to warn the faithful of the dangers of spiritual or moral apostasy.&quot;  

This verse actually concludes the chronological narrative of the Book of Revelation. The next verse commences John's tour of the New Jerusalem.  The remainder of the book is essentially the rhetoric of praise, encomiums, and blame.

==The New Jerusalem==
===Verse 9===
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''There came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and he talked with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The reader is given the identity of John's &quot;tour guide&quot; of the New Jerusalem (one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues). This is the same angel who showed him the &quot;harlot city of Babylon&quot; in Revelation 17, a contrast city to the New Jerusalem. Given that the people of God are earlier represented as a bride&lt;sup&gt;[19:7-8]&lt;/sup&gt;, there may be a connection with the new Jerusalem, which is &quot;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[Rev 21:2]&lt;/sup&gt; Some interpreters suggest that the new Jerusalem is actually a symbol of the people of God themselves, rather than a location, as such.

===Verses 10-11===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''having the glory of God. Her light was like a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.'''''

''Commentary:''

John is transported in the spirit to a mountain in order to gain a deeper understanding of the bride and the Holy city.
This is a contrast to chapter 17 where John is also carried away in the spirit and brought to a desert, in order to see the woman riding the beast. This great and high mountain may be an allusion to Mt. Zion (often referenced throughout the Scripture). The precious jasper stone is also referenced in Revelation 4:3: &quot;And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.&quot; Initially, the jasper was a descriptor of the illuminious beauty of God radiating from His throne. The holy city, Jerusalem also shines like a jasper stone may be represented as the Church, &quot;clear as crystal&quot; or free from blemish. God's glory shines over this city and therefore the comparison to such a precious stone is made once again.

==The City’s Walls, Gates, and Foundations==
===Verses 12-14===

:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''She had a great and high wall, and twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:''''' &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''three gates on the east; three gates on the north; three gates on the south; and three gates on the west.''''' &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.'''''

''Commentary:'' The gates (tribes of Israel) and foundations (apostles) are often interpreted as symbolizing Israel (the people, not the land) and the Church.

Each gate allows one tribe to enter, thus, each tribe has access to the city. There is also a reference to Ezekiel because he prophesied that King David would be one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

===Verses 15-17===
:&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.''''' &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth, and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.''''' &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.'''''

''Commentary:'' If these are comparable to earthly measurements, the city will cover an area about half the size of the contiguous United States. Oddly enough, the height is the same as the length and breadth, which implies a shape like a cube or a pyramid.

===Verses 18-21===

:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The wall was built of jasper, and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.''''' &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;''''' &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.''''' &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate was of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse is basically explaining that the city's brilliance is like that of jasper and other precious stones.  In Revelation 4.3, God's own presence is described as thus when describing his appearance on the throne.  John is stating that the city is like God and equally beautiful and precious.  This is also a direct contrast to Rome which was called the eternal city stating that only God can hand down a truly eternal city and that God needs to be at the center of any city for it to be truly brilliant.  The twelve gates are a comparison to the twelve tribes of Israel suggesting a continuity of the twelve tribes of old and the new people of God.

In Ezek. 28.13 precious stones are symbolic of God's own delling in Paradise.  The list of stones is also taken from Ezek. 28.16 including nine stones that appear in both lists although no one stone list is exactly the same as John's.  This could also be symbolic that the city has unlimited resources.

==The City’s Inhabitants==
===Verse 22===
:&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.'''''

''Commentary:''
The lack of a temple is the main difference between New Jerusalem and any other city in John's time. In the Old Testament, the temple was one of the most important establishments for the Israelites. The Glory of God was said to reside in the temple. Witherington suggests that the lack of temple shows a total blending of sacred and secular. Also, this image of a city without a temple stands in contrast to Old Testament expectations. Witherington supposes that the city without a temple shows a deep intimacy between God and his people, so that they can themselves come within the presence of God without intermediaries such as priests or sacrifices or incense. No longer are sacrifices needed, there is no longer a barrier between God and his people. 

There are implications in this verse of the role of Christ in heaven; that the lamb and God are mentioned together shows a kind of equality in power and importance.

===Verse 23===
:&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The city had no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light.'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse could be symbolizing that there is no need to see because God will guide his believers as long as the follow his &quot;light&quot;.

===Verse 24===
:&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The nations of those who are saved will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour into it.'''''

''Commentary:''
Witherington guesses that these kings are folks who realized the extent of Satan's deceit (after he's tosses into the lake of fire). If he is right this verse may demonstrate some kind of reconciliation, considering that the last time we heard about the kings of earth was when they were Satan's vassals.

===Verse 25===
:&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Its gates will not be shut at all by day, and there will be no night there.'''''

''Commentary:''

===Verse 26-27===
:&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;'''''They will bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.''''' &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;'''''By  no means will anything enter it that defiles, or whatever works abomination or makes a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.'''''

''Commentary:''

This is the {{tl|template other}} meta-template.

It helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;Template:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===

This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{template other | Template page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Template:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{template other | Template page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{template other | demospace=other | Template page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when not on a template page. Thus not adding the template itself and other templates that are built with it to the category. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{template other | | [[Category:Some maintenance category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the example above the &quot;template&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===

For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''template''' it returns the template page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{template other 
| Template page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = template
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{template other 
| Template page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = template
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{template other 
| Template page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Template talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}, for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

This is the {{tl|pp-template}} protection notice.

It is used on protected templates and on protected file (image) pages.

This template does not show on pages that are not protected, instead it reports an error. Please note that only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] can protect pages, this template only informs about the protection status of the page.

This template should usually not be manually placed on template pages, since it is automatically loaded by the {{tl|Documentation}} template of protected template pages. Protected templates (both semi and full) should preferably have a documentation subpage (/doc) so that any editor can update the documentation, categories and interwiki links of the template.

This template automatically detects the edit protection level (semi or full) of a page, and if it is on a template or file page, and modifies its appearance and how it categorizes the page.

* Use {{tlx|pp-template}} for the normal appearance (a small icon at the top).
* Use {{tlx|pp-template|small&amp;#61;no}} for the large message box. On file pages we recommend using the large box.

When {{tl|pp-template}} is added to a protected template, it should be placed inside &amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt; tags (otherwise, every page which uses the template will load the protection notice, which will result in an error message). On file (image) pages the &amp;lt;noinclude&gt;&amp;lt;/noinclude&gt; tags are not necessary.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This is {{tl|pp-meta}}, a meta-template used to create protection message boxes. 

This meta-template automatically uses the right style for each namespace. It also takes care of the code for the &quot;small&quot; case with just a small padlock icon at the top right corner of the page.

=== Examples ===
Note that the small padlock in the top right corner of this page also is an example created with this meta-template. This template uses a position that does not collide with icons such as the {{tl|status}} icon, or other top-right-hand-corner icons.

&lt;!-- Example showing the small padlock in the top right corner. --&gt;

=== Parameters ===
This template is designed to be both defining of the major types of protection notice, but flexible enough to allow exceptions. All parameters have some fallback to allow for graceful failure, but some should almost always be applied.

====&quot;Usually&quot; required parameters====
;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;:The '''type''' parameter applies most default settings for the broad classes of protection templates. It can have values equal to any of the following: &lt;code&gt;full&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;semi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;indef&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;office&lt;/code&gt; (all case-insensitive). These values apply default boilerplate text, images, and links. This parameter should almost always be used, as the default settings require little other input, making the code of templates such as {{tl|pp-protected}} very clean. Note that not supplying this parameter causes the image to default to [[:File:Transparent.gif]].
;&lt;code&gt;small&lt;/code&gt;: The '''small''' parameter lets the template decide whether to display a small icon version or a large boilerplate version. It can take any value, but the only one which will be acted on is &quot;&lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (case-insensitive). As instance templates should be able to decide, using their input, whether or not to apply &lt;code&gt;small&lt;/code&gt;, this should usually be set to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{small|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which defaults to non-small but allows small to be specified. Not supplying this parameter will cause the template to always be expanded big.
;&lt;code&gt;expiry&lt;/code&gt;: This '''expiry''' parameter allows, when &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is defined normally, the expiry date to be automatically displayed properly for both the tooltip of the small version and in text for the large version. It should typically take the input &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{expiry|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which allows instances using this template to be provided input specifying the expiry date. It should be left blank for templates where &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;indef&lt;/code&gt;, as it has no effect because indefinite protection templates clearly do not need expiry dates to be specified.
;&lt;code&gt;dispute&lt;/code&gt;:The '''dispute''' parameter adds some boilerplate text disclaiming against endorsement of the protected version or title. It is not dependent on the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parameter, but the &lt;code&gt;explanation-text&lt;/code&gt; parameter described below overrides it when applicable.
;&lt;code&gt;reason&lt;/code&gt;:The '''reason''' parameter allows a particular reason to be applied to the template to explain why the page is protected. The code used in this parameter should be prefixed with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#32;&lt;/code&gt; so that there are proper spaces between words as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{reason|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the code is not prefixed with a space, such that the requisite full stop is not prefixed by a space when &lt;code&gt;reason&lt;/code&gt; is null. Instances which want to pass through the reason should use code along the general lines of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{reason|a default reason}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;code&gt;categories&lt;/code&gt;: The '''categories''' parameter is relatively strict in the input form instances of this template should use: if the template has categories that it should apply to pages upon which it is placed, they should be implemented within the container of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{categories|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which will cause categories to be disabled in the instances if they are given &lt;code&gt;|categories=no&lt;/code&gt; as an argument. If the template applies no categories, there is no use for this parameter.
;&lt;code&gt;demospace&lt;/code&gt;: Although the '''demospace''' parameter is primarily useful for testing purposes, its name betrays its purpose: demonstration. Instances should generally use the code &lt;code&gt;demospace=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{demospace|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so as to allow them to be forced to display as though they were in a particular namespace. If a template is to be always used in a particular namespace and never in another, it is also possible to set &lt;code&gt;demospace&lt;/code&gt; to any of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;talk&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; (all case-insensitive) to specify the messagebox type typical for that namespace or namespace family such that it will never change from that type.
;&lt;code&gt;demolevel&lt;/code&gt;: The '''demolevel''' parameter, like the &lt;code&gt;demospace&lt;/code&gt; parameter, is useful for demonstration and testing. Instances should generally use the code &lt;code&gt;demospace=&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{demolevel|undefined}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so as to allow them to be forced to display as though they were on a page with a particular level of protection. This must have the default of &quot;undefined&quot; if it is used, as a null value will cause the template to fail. Failing the demolevel test causes the template to disappear.

====Type-dependent parameters====
;&lt;code&gt;rfd&lt;/code&gt;: If the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; applied is &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;explanation-text&lt;/code&gt; as below does not over-ride it, then the parameter '''rfd''' should be applied as equal to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{rfd|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so that this input is passed through and the explanation can be more descriptive.

====Optional parameters====
;&lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;:The '''image''' parameter allows an alternate icon to be chosen if so desired. This image should typically be chosen from [[Commons:Padlock icons]], though any image can be chosen. Only the name of the alternate image should be applied; ''do not'' supply the &quot;Image:&quot; prefix.
;&lt;code&gt;icon-link&lt;/code&gt;:The '''icon-link''' parameter allows one to change the page to which the small version's icon links. This probably shouldn't generally be used if &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is in use as &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; applies proper links to [[Wikibooks:Protection policy]], but it allows for exceptions and can define the link to sections within that page. Input given to this parameter should ''not'' be supplied within &lt;nowiki&gt;[[double brackets]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
;&lt;code&gt;icon-text&lt;/code&gt;: The '''icon-text''' parameter, like the &lt;code&gt;icon-link&lt;/code&gt; parameter, affects only the small version. This one, however, affects the text outputted as the tooltip for the protection icon. It completely replaces, when used, the default text and any specified by &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, ''including'' the final full stop.
;&lt;code&gt;icon-reason&lt;/code&gt;: The '''icon-reason''' parameter allows text to be added to the default text of the small version's tooltip as supplied by &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;. It is over-written by &lt;code&gt;icon-text&lt;/code&gt; if that parameter is used.
;&lt;code&gt;reason-text&lt;/code&gt;: This parameter, '''reason-text''', allows one to over-ride the first, bolded line of the text of the expanded version of any instance. It, when used, over-rides input as initially defined by &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;expiry&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;reason&lt;/code&gt;, ''including'' the final full stop.
;&lt;code&gt;explanation-text&lt;/code&gt;:This code over-rides the explanation text following the bolded reason line; it over-rides text initially provided by the template itself, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dispute&lt;/code&gt;, and, if applicable, &lt;code&gt;rfd&lt;/code&gt;.
;&lt;code&gt;disallowlevel&lt;/code&gt;:This code disallows a particular level of protection for templates which do not have the type &lt;code&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;. It can be set to either &lt;code&gt;autoconfirmed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sysop&lt;/code&gt; to disable the template on semi-protected or full-protected pages respectively. If the page is protected at the disallowed level and &lt;code&gt;demolevel&lt;/code&gt; is not set to the allowed level, the template will not appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The New Jerusalem (cont.)==

===Verses 1-2===
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.''''' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''In the midst of its course, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruit and yielded its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.'''''

''Commentary:'' At the beginning of the Bible, in Genesis, Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden of Eden so that they might be denied access to the &quot;tree of life&quot; (symbolizing eternal life) in their corrupt state (Gen 3:22-24). Now, at the end of Revelation, the tree of life reappears.

The water that flows is a healing water because it comes from the Throne of God. The water is always providing, like the Tree of Life. The tree continues to bring fruit and never dies. This proves that our spiritual lives will be sustained in Heaven. 

The fact that God and the Lamb share one throne again emphasizes their unity.  There can be no doubt that John views Christ as untied with God.  A pure, clear river symbolizes the pure life God gives forth to God’s people.  The idea of a river flowing from God or the Temple is consistent with Old Testament imagery, including Zech. 14 and Ezek. 47.  The text is unclear how many trees of life are being described.  Tree is in the singular, suggesting one, which would also parallel with the Garden of Eden.  However, can one tree be on both sides of a river?  Perhaps it is a large tree that is somehow straddling the river.  The idea that the tree bears fruit each month and that the leaves are good for healing again relates back to Ezek. 47.  &lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben.  Revelation.  Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verses 3-4===
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''There will be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him,''''' &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'''''and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.'''''

''Commentary:'' In Genesis, the earth is cursed because of Adam's sin (Gen 3:17). Here we are told that &quot;there will be no more curse.&quot; In Genesis, the eternal paradise is lost; in Revelation, it is restored completely and man is satisfied both spiritually and physically. 

Jesus remains God's physical presence. We will be able to feel God, but still be unable to see him. Since the Father is invisible, the sense of the Lord’s words refers to the presence of God. The angels are continually in the presence of God (revelationcommentary.org). 

&quot;...his name will be on their foreheads&quot;: See notes on 3:12 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biblical_Studies/New_Testament_Commentaries/Revelation/Chapter_3#Verse_12].

===Verse 5===
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''There will be no night there, and they will need no candle, nor the light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light, and they will reign forever and ever.'''''

''Commentary:''
Since God will conintuously be looking out for the people he will be the light of the world. Thus, night shall never fall upon the people. Night and day are used to measure time and there will be no time in Heaven for those there will be there for an eternity and need not measure the days. Therefore,night is taken away because it is associated with evil and harm. Jesus was betrayed in the night time,and night is when sin is committed. But the saints are the son of the light and God is light. Thus, light is a good omen and has good connotation.

==Epilogue: Final Observations and Exhortations==

===Verse 6===
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He said to me, “These sayings are faithful and true.” The Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things which must shortly be done.''''' 

''Commentary:''
John is validating his vision by saying that his vision is faithful and true.  He is saying that his vision is authentic and divine. This is likely saying that God is te source of the prophet's inspiration. This verse begins the conclusion of his revelation.

===Verse 7===
:&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'''''”Behold, I come quickly.” Blessed is the one who keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.'''''

''Commentary:''
The second coming of Christ Jesus is not coming quickly.  But when he comes, it will be a quick return.  Blessings are being wished upon by John to the readers of this vision.

===Verses 8-9===
:&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I, John, saw these things and heard them, and when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.''''' &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He said to me, “See that you do not do that, for I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the sayings of this book. Worship God.”'''''

''Commentary:'' The first sentence of Verse 8 echoes Revelation 1 in that John reaffirms himself as the author of this work, as it was revealed to him from God via angelic beings.  The second sentence echoes Revelation 19:10 in that again we see John falling to the ground so as to worship the angelic messenger.  It is not clear whether this is indeed an additional attempt to worship the angel or if John is merely repeating his previous mistake for a rhetorical effect.  In any event, perhaps John is attempting to identify with his audience's tendency to worship something less than God as God.  Verse 9 indicates that God's people are essentially equal with angelic beings.

===Verses 10-11===
:&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He said to me, “Do not seal the sayings of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.''''' &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The one who is unjust, let him be unjust still. The one who is filthy, let him be filthy still. The one who is righteous, let him be righteous still. And the one who is holy, let him be holy still.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Verse eleven here implies that beyond this point there will be no more repentance.

The command to not seal up the prophecy of revelation stands in direct contrast to Daniel 12:4 which says,  “But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end.&quot;  It is possible that John is directly referencing this verse here, emphasizing that in Daniel's vision, the time had not yet come and so the scroll should be sealed up, but it is possible that for John the events he witnessed are close at hand and thus the command to not seal up the prophecy of Revelation.

===Verse 12===
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to everyone according to his work.”'''''

''Commentary:''
This verse is confusing as it leaves discussion on salvation being by works rather than faith.  Certainly the verse John 3:16 and others refer to the God given reward of eternal life to be based on faith, but many other verses refer to salvation being dependent on good works. &lt;----??? What if they are one in the same? Strive to live like Jesus did and your faith is your work.

===Verse 13===
:&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Once again brings significance to the power and soverignty of the Lord. As mentioned before in Chapter 1:8 and 21:6,  He is the beginning and the end, and encompasses all in between. This is a significant attribute of God.

===Verse 14-15===
:&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Blessed are those who keep his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.''''' &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;'''''Outside are dogs, sorcerers, whoremongers, murderers, idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.'''''

''Commentary:''
This is the 7th blessing and the last in Revelation. The tree of life and the access to it is eternal life. It may tie into the cross of calvary in which Jesus shed His blood, so that people could have life. The people enter through the gate which is symbolic of Christ and the city is a representation of the New Jerusalem in the Heavenly realm. As stated in Chapter 7 v 14 the people must wash their robes in the Lamb's blood in order to gain access into this city where they will live eternally. Those who do not follow Christ and obey fully God will not be rewarded with the Heavenly realm because even though they may recognize God, they do not have faith in Christ. This is stating that there will be eternal life for all who believed, but the quality of that eternal life will be determined by the amount of faithfulness each individual achieved.

===Verse 16===
:&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;'''''“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.”'''''

''Commentary:''
Jesus is varifying that he sent the interpreting angel to John. He specifically states that this work is to be presented to churches plural, and not to be restrained as private property.

===Verse 17===
:&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” And let the one who thirsts come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.'''''

''Commentary:''
The bride is represented as the church, and so the Spirit and Church are participants in the invitation to spread the gospel (good news). The gift of salvation is given freely to those that are thirsty for God and looking to have a relationship with Christ. This water of life will quench and satisfy their thirst and those who accept this will be rewarded.

===Verses 18-19===
:&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;'''''I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book that if anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.''''' &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;'''''If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part in the book of life, and the holy city, and the things which are written in this book.'''''

''Commentary:''
There are three aspects to this verse: an integrity formula (&quot;do not add, do not delete&quot;), a conditional curse (&quot;if you add things then plagues are added; if you remove things then you'll be removed from the book&quot;), and a protection formula. The integrity formula was common to Mediterranean civilizations and was used in treaties, histories, and books. The conditional curse is another common agent seen first in the Code of Hammurabi (&quot;eye for an eye&quot;) and frequently echoed in Judaic law. The protective aspect has been considered by modern interpreters to be a proof of canonical status of Revelation, although it is just as likely (if not more) that it was meant to protect the text in a world where texts were not printed by copied by hand and carried by messengers. There texts risked doctrinal adjustment as well as day-to-day worries of smudging or ripping.

===Verse 20===
:&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;'''''He who testifies of these things says, “Surely, I am coming quickly.” Amen. Even so: Come, Lord Jesus!'''''

''Commentary:''
There is no known time in which the Lord will have his second coming. His followers must be prepared and continuously awaiting his arrivel with their faith and actions.

==Benediction==

===Verse 21===
:&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;'''''The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.'''''

''Commentary: May this be our prayer.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sampled Systems ==

Digital signals are by essence sampled signals.
In a circuit node, the numbers change at a given rate: the ''sampling rate'' or ''sampling frequency''.
The time between two changes of the signal is the inverse of the sampling frequency: it is the ''sampling period''.

In processor systems, samples are stored in memory.
In logic ciruits, they correspond to register outputs.
The sampling period is used to compute the next value of all signals in the system.

Digital circuits are not the only sampled systems: analog circuits such as switched capacitor filters also rely on switches and are sampled too.

== Sampling a signal ==

=== The Nyquist Rate ===

Sampling a signal raises a major question: does one lose information during this process?

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Example:''' Checking (= sampling) the traffic lights once an hour certainly makes one erratically react to their signalling (= lose information).

On the other side, sampling the traffic lights once per microsecond doesn't bring much more information than sampling it every millisecond.

Obviously, the traffic lights, as any other signals, have to be sampled at a faster rate than they change, but sampling them very much faster doesn't bring more information.
&lt;/div&gt;

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate Nyquist rate] is the minimum sampling rate required to avoid loss of information.

:&lt;math&gt;f_N \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   2 f_b&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_b&lt;/math&gt; is the highest frequency of the signal to be sampled, also called ''bandwidth''.  

To avoid losing information, the sampling rate must be higher than the Nyquist rate:

:&lt;math&gt;f_s &gt; f_N&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, the sampling rate is taken with some margin, in order to more easily reconstruct the original signal.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Example:''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate audio content sampling rates]

The full range of human hearing is between 20 Hz and 20 kHz.
Thus, audio content has to be sampled at more than 40 kHz.

And indeed:
* CD audio samples the signals at 44.1 kHz.
* Professional digital video equipment samples them at 48 kHz.
* DVD audio samples them at 96 kHz.
* High end DVD audio doubles this frequency to 192 kHz.
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Aliasing ===

Sampling a signal with a rate lower than the Nyquist Rate produces [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing aliasing] or ''folding''.

[[File:AliasingSines.svg|thumb|right|350px|Effect of aliasing.]]
The picture on the right shows a red sinewave of frequency 0.9 (and thus of a period close to 1.1).
This signal should be sampled with a frequency larger than 1.8.
However, the signal has been sampled with a rate of 1 (vertical lines and black dots).
If one tries to draw a line between the samples, the result will look like the blue curve wich is a sinewave of period 10, or of frequency 0.1.

If the signal would have been sampled at a rate of 0.9, the sampling points would always fall on the same point in the sine function and the resulting signal would seem to be a constant.

Sampling a signal of frequency 0.9 with a rate of 1 creates an alias with the frequency of &lt;math&gt;1 - 0.9 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

Sampling a signal of frequency 0.9 with a rate of 0.9 creates an alias at DC, and so with the frequency of &lt;math&gt;0.9 - 0.9 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Sampling a signal of frequency 0.9 with a rate of 0.8 also creates an alias with the frequency of &lt;math&gt;0.9 - 0.8 = 0.1&lt;/math&gt;, but with a different phase.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Example:''' A well known example of aliasing is the stroboscope.

Illuminating a motor turning at a frequency of 90 Hz with a stroboscope switching at 100 Hz gives us the impression that is it turning at 100 Hz - 90 Hz = 10 Hz.

Illuminating a motor turning at a frequency of 90 Hz with a stroboscope switching at 90 Hz gives us the impression that is it standing still.

Illuminating a motor turning at a frequency of 90 Hz with a stroboscope switching at 80 Hz gives us the impression that is it turning at 90 Hz - 80 Hz = 10 Hz, but in the opposite direction.

This is the same effect seen in many American Western movies containing stagecoach scenes.  At various rotational rates, the wheels on the stagecoach will appear to rotate forward, stand still, or rotate backward.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect Wagon-wheel effect].
&lt;/div&gt;

It is as if the spectrum of the signal has been folded back down at a point equal to half the sampling frequency.

=== Undersampling ===

Sampling a a frequency lower than the Nyquist rate, also called ''undersampling'', creates sinewave aliases at a lower frequency.
If the original signal also has content at these lower frequencies, then they will be mixed and there is a loss of information.

However, if the signal has only high-frequency content, then the undersampling process modulates the signal at a lower frequency.

This is a cheap alternative to modulating by the multiplication with a modulation sinewave.

=== Oversampling ===

Oversampling corresponds to sampling with a frequency much higher (typically 100 to 1000) than the Nyquist rate.
The interest of oversampling is to be able to represent the signal with a smaller amount of bits.

This can be explained by the mechanism used to gain the additional bits back:
a signal sampled at 10 kHz can be downsampled at 5 kHz as long as the new sampling frequency remains greater than the Nyquist frequency.
The downsampling implies having two times fewer samples.
Rather than throwing every second sample away, one can calculate the mean value of two consecutive samples and use this result to build one sample of the new signal.
Calculating the mean value corresponds to add the values and divide them by two.
Rather than dividing the result by two and throwing away the bit after the decimal point, one can only add the consecutive samples two by two.
With this, the amplitude of the 5 kHz signal is twice the one of the original 10 kHz signal.
In other words, it has to be represented by 1 more bits.

A largely used application of oversampling is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_width_modulation Pulse Width Modulation] (PWM).
The modulated signal is represented with a single bit switching at a frequency equal to &lt;math&gt;{2^n} \cdot f_N&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;f_N&lt;/math&gt; is the Nyquist frequency of the original signal and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the number of bits with which it is represented.
This one bit signal is ideal to drive high-current loads with a single power switch.
PWM is typically used for driving electric motors.

A more complex coding scheme for a result on a single bit is found in every CD player: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation sigma-delta] modulation.
There is more theory required for understanding its working.
Let us state that it is able to represent a signal on a single bit at a lower sampling frequency than the PWM.
On the other hand, the one bit signal switches back and forth more frequently at its sampling frequency and is thus less indicated for driving slower high-current switches.
Sigma-delta modulation is used for driving lighter loads such as the cable between the CD player and the audio amplifier.

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]]'''Example:''' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Audio_CD Super Audio CD] (SACD)

The SACD  codes the audio in the form of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital Direct Stream Digital] signal coded on a single bit at 64 times the CD sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Z Transform ==

The ''Z Transform'' is used to represent sampled signals and [[Signals_and_Systems/Time_Domain_Analysis#Linear_Time_Invariant_.28LTI.29_Systems|Linear Time Invariant]] (LTI) systems, such as filters, in a way similar to the Laplace transform representing continuous-time signals.

=== Signal representation ===

The ''Z Transform'' is used to represent sampled signals in a way similar to the Laplace transform representing continuous-time signals.

A sampled signal is given by the sum of its samples, each one delayed by a different multiple of the sampling period.
The Laplace transform represents a delay of one sampling period &lt;math&gt;T_s&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;z^{-1} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} e^{-sT_s}&lt;/math&gt;

With this, the Z-transform can be represented as

:&lt;math&gt;X(z) = \mathcal{Z}\{x[n]\} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n} &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; are the consecutive values of the sampled signal.

=== Linear time invariant systems ===

Continuous-time Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems can be represented by a transfer function which is a fraction of two polynomials of the complex variable &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{num(s)}{den(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Their frequency response is estimated by taking &lt;math&gt;s = j\omega&lt;/math&gt;, this is by estimating the transfer function along the imaginary axis.

In order to ensure stability, the poles of the transfer function (the roots of the denominator polynomial) must be on the left half plane of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Z-transform unit circle.svg|thumb|right|Z-plane unit circle]]
Discrete-time LTI systems can be represented by the fraction of two polynomials of the complex variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{num(z)}{den(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition:

:&lt;math&gt;z \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} e^{sT_s}&lt;/math&gt;

we find that their frequency response can be estimated by taking &lt;math&gt;z = e^{j\omega T_s}&lt;/math&gt;, this is by estimating the transfer function around the unit circle.

In order to ensure stability, the poles of the transfer function (the roots of the denominator polynomial) must be inside the unit circle.

=== Transfer function periodicity ===

The transfer function is estimated around the unit circle:
* The point at coordinate &lt;math&gt;z = 1 +  j 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to frequency &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is DC.
* The point at coordinate &lt;math&gt;z = 0 +  j 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to frequency &lt;math&gt;f = f_s / 4&lt;/math&gt;, the quarter of the sampling frequency.
* The point at coordinate &lt;math&gt;z = -1 +  j 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to frequency &lt;math&gt;f = f_s / 2&lt;/math&gt;, half the sampling frequency.
* The point at coordinate &lt;math&gt;z = 0 -  j 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to frequency &lt;math&gt;f = 3 / 4 f_s&lt;/math&gt;.
* The point at coordinate &lt;math&gt;z = 1 +  j 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to frequency &lt;math&gt;f = f_s&lt;/math&gt; which is the sampling frequency.

So having turned once around the unit circle, one falls back to the starting point &lt;math&gt;z = 1 +  j 0&lt;/math&gt;.
From there, one can make another turn from &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2 f_s&lt;/math&gt;, and one more from &lt;math&gt;2 f_s&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;3 f_s&lt;/math&gt; and so on...
On each of these turns, the frequency response will be the same.
In other words, the transfer function of a sampled system is periodic of period equal to the sampling frequency.

With real (as opposed to complex) signals, the transfer function is symmetric around half the sampling frequency: &lt;math&gt;f = f_s / 2&lt;/math&gt;.
So the transfer function of a sampled system is usually only considered between &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = f_s / 2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|str ≤ len}} meta-template.

It helps other templates check if a string is &quot;shorter or equally long&quot; vs. &quot;longer&quot; than a given length.

=== Usage ===
This template takes 3 to 4 unnamed parameters.

Here is how to check if the string &quot;abcde&quot; is 4 characters or less:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ len | abcde | 4
| Equal or shorter.
| Longer.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≤ len | abcde | 4
| Equal or shorter.
| Longer.
}}

Templates have a problem to handle parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Here we check if the string &quot;ab=cde&quot; is 100 characters or less:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Equal &quot;=&quot; or shorter.
| 4 = Longer, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≤ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Equal &quot;=&quot; or shorter.
| 4 = Longer, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}

It probably is a good habit to always use the numbered parameters, since you might not know beforehand exactly how the data will look that your template will feed to this meta-template.

=== Parameters ===
Detailed parameter explanation:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≤ len 
| 1 = A string, 0-500 characters long.
| 2 = 0 - 500
| 3 = Data to return/render when &quot;shorter than or equally long&quot;.
| 4 = Data to return/render when &quot;longer than&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Empty or undefined strings are considered to be of 0 length. Strings longer than 500 are not truncated to 500.

Length values below 0 are considered to be 0. Length values above 500 are considered to be 500.

Thus a string longer than 500 is always considered to be &quot;longer&quot;, even if it is compared with the &quot;correct&quot; length value.

=== Technical details ===
This template would be equivalent to templates named &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str &lt;= len}} or {{str &gt; len}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but we can't use those template names since they don't work in MediaWiki.

Even though this is a string handling template it uses efficient code. (While some of the other string handling templates are probably so heavy on the servers that we perhaps should not use them.)

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This template adds a non-breaking space followed by a pipe (|) character.  It is useful in lists where a line break is only wanted after the pipe.  For example, in the string &quot;Item1 | Item2 | Item3&quot; one probably does not want a line break between each pipe and its preceding space.  This could be used to fix it: &quot;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;Item1{{-!}} Item2{{-!}} Item3&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&quot;.

This is the {{tl|string templates see also}} template.

It is used in the &quot;See also&quot; section of the documentation of the string handling templates, such as {{tl|str ≥ len}}. It takes no parameters.

This is the {{tl|str ≥ len}} meta-template.

It helps other templates check if a string is &quot;longer or equally long&quot; vs. &quot;shorter&quot; than a given length.

=== Usage ===
This template takes 3 to 4 unnamed parameters.

Here is how to check if the string &quot;abcde&quot; is 4 characters or more:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≥ len | abcde | 4
| Equal or longer.
| Shorter.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≥ len | abcde | 4
| Equal or longer.
| Shorter.
}}

Templates have a problem to handle parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Here we check if the string &quot;ab=cde&quot; is 100 characters or more:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≥ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Equal &quot;=&quot; or longer.
| 4 = Shorter, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which returns this:

:{{str ≥ len 
| 1 = ab=cde 
| 2 = 100
| 3 = Equal &quot;=&quot; or longer.
| 4 = Shorter, not &quot;=&quot;.
}}

It probably is a good habit to always use the numbered parameters, since you might not know beforehand exactly how the data will look that your template will feed to this meta-template.

=== Parameters ===
Detailed parameter explanation:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{str ≥ len 
| 1 = A string, 0-500 characters long.
| 2 = 0 - 500
| 3 = Data to return/render when &quot;longer than or equally long&quot;.
| 4 = Data to return/render when &quot;shorter than&quot;.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Empty or undefined strings are considered to be of 0 length. Strings longer than 500 are not truncated to 500.

Length values below 0 are considered to be 0. Length values above 500 are considered to be 500.

Thus a string of 500 length or more are always considered to be &quot;longer than or equally long&quot;, no matter what length value it is compared with.

=== Technical details ===
This template would be equivalent to templates named &lt;nowiki&gt;{{str &gt;= len}} or {{str &lt; len}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but we can't use those template names since they don't work in MediaWiki.

Even though this is a string handling template it uses very efficient code. (While some of the other string handling templates are probably so heavy on the servers that we perhaps should not use them.)

{{Navbox suite}}
A navigation box that presents its content in columns. Originally intended to provide a relatively straightforward means to align links prefixed by flag icons, e.g. in templates offering links to country articles.

== Basic syntax ==
Only required parameters and ''colwidth'' included.

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{Navbox with columns
|name  = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
|title = 
|colwidth =  &lt;!--(to set a default width for each column,
                  preferably in a proportional unit such as 'em'*)--&gt;
|col1  = 
|col2  = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;line-height:1.35em; font-size:90%;&quot;&gt;*Using proportional units means the template should still be displayed correctly across a range of browser font-sizes. If ''colwidth'' not specified, a default 10em is used.&lt;/div&gt;

== Parameters ==
Required parameters in '''bold'''. Parameters marked with a cross'''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''' are parameters in common with the sister templates {{tl|Navbox}} and {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}. A much more complete description of those parameters is available at {{tl|Navbox}}.

=== Setup parameters ===
:;name&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The name of the template. The name of this template, for example, is &quot;Navbox with columns&quot;.

:;state&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Possible values are &lt;code&gt;collapsed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uncollapsed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, and the default &lt;code&gt;autocollapse&lt;/code&gt;.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information.

:;''navbar''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Possible values are &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, and the default value of blank.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information.

:;''border''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Possible values are &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, and the default value of blank.  Set to &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; if you wish to use the navbox inside of another navbox; with this option, the child navbox is borderless and fits snuggly inside of its parent navbox.  The parent navbox may be the list area of {{tl|Navbox}}, a columns of another {{tl|Navbox with columns}}, or a section of {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information and examples.

===Basic data parameters===
:;'''''title'''''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The title of the template, displayed centered in the titlebar at the top of the template.

:;''above''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Text or other elements to appear above the columns.

:;''image''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Image to the right of all of the columns.

:;''imageleft''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Image to the left of all of the columns.

:;''below''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Text or other elements to appear below the columns.

===Style parameters===
:;''bodystyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the template's body (i.e. including space not used by columns)

:;''titlestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::[[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] style/s to apply to titlebar; usually &lt;code&gt;background:''color''&lt;/code&gt;.

:;''abovestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:;''belowstyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''above'' and ''below'' parameters, respectively.

:;''basestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''title'', ''above'', and ''below'', parameters, all at the same time.

:;''imagestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''image'' parameter.

:;''imageleftstyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''imageleft'' parameter 

:;''colstyle''
::CSS style/s to apply across all columns; if used, usually &lt;code&gt;background:''color''&lt;/code&gt; per ''titlestyle'' above.

:;''oddcolstyle''
:;''evencolstyle''
::CSS style/s to apply to all odd/even-numbered columns, respectively.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;style''
::CSS style/s to apply to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column only.

:;''colheaderstyle''
::CSS style/s to apply to all column headers.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;headerstyle''
::CSS style/s to apply to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column header.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;footerstyle''
::CSS style/s to apply to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column footer cell.

===Columns parameters===
:;''colwidth''
::Width, preferably in a proportional unit such as 'em', or as a percentage, used for each column whose width not specified by ''colNwidth'' below. Defaults to 10em.  Examples:
:::&lt;code&gt;colwidth = 15em&lt;/code&gt;
:::&lt;code&gt;colwidth = 25%&lt;/code&gt;

:;''fullwidth''
::If set to anything, then the total width of the columns are scaled linearly to make the sum of the widths 100%.  A rather advanced parameter, this usually need not be used and should be left blank.  If a colheader or colfooter is used, then fullwidth is used automatically.  Example:
:::&lt;code&gt;fullwidth = true&lt;/code&gt;

:;''padding''
::Padding before first column, preferably in a proportional unit. Defaults to 5em.  Padding is disabled by setting it to 0 (or 0em, or 0%).

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;width''
::The n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column's width (overrides ''colwidth'' above).

:;'''''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'''''
::The content of the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column.  If any columns are used, then &lt;code&gt;col1&lt;/code&gt; is required.  There can be a maximum of 20 columns.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;header''
::A header cell for the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column that appears above the column.  See below for examples.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;footer
::A footer cell that appears below the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;headercolspan
::A number specifying how many columns the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column header should span.  It defaults to 1.  If it is greater than one, then do not specify column headers that it covers.  For example, if &lt;code&gt;col1headercolspan = 3&lt;/code&gt;, then leave &lt;code&gt;col2header&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;col3header&lt;/code&gt; blank.

:;''col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;footercolspan
::A number specifying how many columns the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; column footer should span.  It defaults to 1.  If it is greater than one, then do not specify column footers that it covers.  For example, if &lt;code&gt;col1footercolspan = 3&lt;/code&gt;, then leave &lt;code&gt;col2footer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;col3footer&lt;/code&gt; blank.

===Additional groups/lists===
You may wish to add a few extra groups and/or lists below the columns.  The following parameters are given to provide such functionality.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for a more complete description of how they work, and for more examples.

:;''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Allows up to 6 additional groups to go along with the lists below the columns.

:;''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Allows up to 6 additional lists below the columns.

:;''groupstyle&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The general CSS style/s for the groups.

:;''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''style&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s for the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; group parameter.

:;''liststyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The general CSS style/s for the lists.

:;''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;style''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s for the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; list parameter.

:;''listpadding''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Amount of padding to have in each list cell.

:; ''oddstyle''
:; ''evenstyle''
::Applies to odd/even list numbers.  Overrules styles defined by ''liststyle''.  The default behavior is to add striped colors (white and gray) to odd/even rows, respectively, in order to improve readability.  These should not be changed except in extraordinary circumstances.

:; ''evenodd'' &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[swap, even, odd, off]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
::See {{tl|Navbox}} for description.

===Example with col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;header and col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;footer===
The gray background for the columns is added for illustration only.
{{Navbox with columns

===Example with col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;header using col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;headercolspan===
The gray background for the columns is added for illustration only.  This example shows the col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;headercolspan parameter being used, but you may also use col&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;footercolspan to adjust the span of the footer cells.
{{Navbox with columns

|col5 = col5
|col6 = col6
|col7 = col7
}}


===Example to illustrate most fields===
The gray background and centered text for the columns is for illustration only.  The columns default to an off-white background and left text alignment.  This example shows how you can use up to six additional groups/lists after the columns.

==Using child navboxes==
All three types of navbox templates, namely {{tl|Navbox}}, {{tl|Navbox with columns}}, and {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}, can be nested inside of one another using the &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt; parameter (which is common to all three).  For complex templates, it may be necessary to use nesting to achieve a desired look.

===Nesting Navbox with columns in itself===
This example shows how one can nest multiple {{tl|Navbox with columns}} templates to get the right look.  Edit this page to see the code.  There is a main {{tl|Navbox with columns}} and two additional {{tl|Navbox with columns}} templates, with the &quot;child&quot; option set (see code).
{{Navbox with columns
|name = Navbox with columns/doc
|state = uncollapsed
|title = Subgroups with nesting
|colstyle = text-align:center;background:silver;

|col1width = 33%
|col2width = 17%
|col3width = 33%
|col4width = 17%

|col1header = Col1Header
|col2header = Col2Header
|col3header = Col3Header
|col4header = Col4Header

|col1 = {{Navbox with columns|child
  |colwidth = 50%
  |colstyle = text-align:center;background:silver;

  |col1header = Col1.1Header
  |col2header = Col1.2Header

  |col1 = Col1.1
  |col2 = Col1.2
 }}

|col2 = Col2

|col3 = {{Navbox with columns|child
  |colwidth = 33%
  |colstyle = text-align:center;background:silver;

  |col1header = Col3.1Header
  |col2header = Col3.2Header
  |col3header = Col3.3Header

  |col1 = Col3.1
  |col2 = Col3.2
  |col3 = Col3.3
 }}

|col4 = Col4
}}

===Nesting other Navbox forms===
This example shows {{tl|Navbox}}, {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}} and {{tl|Navbox with columns}} all working together.  Edit this page to see the code.  Note that each of the child navboxes has the first parameter set to &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;.

==[[Blender 2.5]]==
{{mbox|type=notice|msg=
Thank you for your interest in Wikibooks, but [[Blender 2.5|this page]] appears as though it may have been created in error (such as due to a test or a misplaced edit). Why not contribute to the very extensive [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]?. [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 21 April 2010 (UTC)

Blender 3D: Noob to pro is really good and I've used to for 2.49 but it's not up todate for 2.5. I'm only using blender 2.5 as a sourch for myself
:It just seems like it'd be less work to tweak a few things on the pages for the newer version than to try to start from scratch.  Just trying to save you any extra trouble.  Another option to put out there would be adding pages to Blender 3D and marking them with, say, (version 2.5) in the contents page.  It's up to you; I just wanted to make sure you're aware of your options. Good luck with whatever route you decide to take. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:45, 23 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

This template will not be visible on pages that are not protected. Only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] can protect pages.

=== Usage ===

* Use {{tlx|{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}}} for the normal template
* Use {{tlx|{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}|reason&amp;#61;text}} for applying a specific reason
* Use {{tlx|{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}|expiry&amp;#61;{{#time:F j, Y|+1 month}}}} for a specific expiration date
* Use {{tlx|{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}|small&amp;#61;yes}} for just an icon at the top
* Use {{tlx|{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}|expiry&amp;#61;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:#time:F j, Y|+7 days}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for a specific expiration time period

Note that ''(UTC)'' will be added automatically.

This template will categorize depending on the namespace in a subcategory of [[:Category:Protected pages]].

* Other templates of book&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Wikijunior:Languages&lt;/tt&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would have names of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;Template:Wikijunior:Languages/Foo&lt;/tt&gt;}}, and could be called using syntax of the form&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Foo|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}}.

&lt;includeonly&gt;{{Intricate template}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
{{Navbox suite}}
This template produces a navigational template that has groups of relevant articles on a certain topic. All groups are hidden by default. However, with a parameter call, an individual group can be shown that has the other articles in the same group.

== Usage ==
Please remove the parameters that are left blank. The template currently supports up to 10 groups/lists but more can be added if needed.  You should use a minimum of two groups/lists; otherwise, use {{tl|Navbox}} instead.

&lt;pre&gt;{{Navbox with collapsible groups
|name = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
|state = 
|selected = {{{1|}}}

|title = 
|titlestyle = 
|groupstyle = 
|image = 

|group1 = 
|abbr1 = 
|list1 =

|group2 = 
|abbr2 = 
|list2 = 

 ...

|group10 = 
|abbr10 = 
|list10 = 
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameters ==
This template shares many common parameters with its sister templates {{tl|Navbox}} and {{tl|Navbox with columns}}.  The common parameters are marked with a cross&lt;sup&gt;'''†'''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Please refer to the documentation of {{tl|Navbox}} for more in depth descriptions and examples of those parameters.

===Setup parameters===
:;name&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The name of the template. The name of this template, for example, is &quot;Navbox with collapsible groups&quot;.

:; ''state''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;[&lt;code&gt;autocollapse, uncollapsed, collapsed, plain, off&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
::The initial state of the show/hide feature for the main title.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information.  Does not affect display or hiding of group items, see ''state&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', below.

:;''navbar''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Possible values are &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;off&lt;/code&gt;, and the default value of blank.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information.

:;''border''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Possible values are &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, and the default value of blank.  Set to &lt;code&gt;child&lt;/code&gt; if you wish to use the navbox inside of another navbox; with this option, the child navbox is borderless and fits snuggly inside of its parent navbox.  The parent navbox may be the list area of {{tl|Navbox}}, the columns of a {{tl|Navbox with columns}}, or a list area of {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}.  See {{tl|Navbox}} for more information and examples.

===Basic data parameters===
:;'''''title'''''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::The title of the template, displayed centered in the titlebar at the top of the template.

:;''above''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Text or other elements to appear above groups/lists.

:;''image''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Image to the right of all of the groups/lists.

:;''imageleft''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Image to the left of all of the groups/lists.

:;''below''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::Text or other elements to appear below the groups/lists.

===Group/list parameters===
:; ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: The title of each section.

:; ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: The content/wikilinks that will be shown in the group. Use dots or bullets as separators (see the [[#See also|See also]] section).  A {{tl|Navbox}} or {{tl|Navbox with columns}} can optionally be used here with its &lt;code&gt;border = child&lt;/code&gt; parameter set.  If this is done, leave the corresponding group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; blank, as the child navbox will already provide the collapsible feature.

:; ''abbr&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
:: This is the abbreviation of the group.  See &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; parameter below to see how to use this parameter.  This parameter is optional, but recommended.

:; ''selected''
:: If the value of &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; equals the value of &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is uncollapsed and all other lists are collapsed.  If &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; is left blank, or if it does not match any &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, then all groups are collapsed.  Usually this parameter should be set to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this template is a base template for others, there has to be a way to pass the group parameter from the article, to the secondary template to this one.

:; ''state&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;[&lt;code&gt;autocollapse, uncollapsed, collapsed, plain, off&lt;/code&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
:: The initial collapsible state of list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  Set to collapsed by default.  Overridden to uncollapsed if &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

:; ''image&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
:: An image to appear in the list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; content area on the right side.

:; ''imageleft&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
:: An image to appear in the list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; content area on the left side.

===Style parameters===
:;''bodystyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the entire template

:;''titlestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::[[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] style/s to apply to titlebar; usually &lt;code&gt;background:''color''&lt;/code&gt;.  The color of wikilink text must be manually changed using span tags.  For example use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;title = [[Main Page|&lt;span style=&quot;color:ivory;&quot;&gt;Main Page&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to change the color of the link to ivory.  The [show]/[hide] button and the vde link button use the color set in the titlestyle parameter.  Here is an example of setting the titlestyle:
:::&lt;code&gt;titlestyle = background:darkgreen;color:ivory;&lt;/code&gt;

:;''abovestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:;''belowstyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''above'' and ''below'' parameters, respectively.

:;''basestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''title'', ''above'', ''below'', and ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameters, all at the same time.

:;''imagestyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''image'' parameter.  Does not get applied to the image&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; parameters.

:;''imageleftstyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
::CSS style/s to apply to the ''imageleft'' parameter.  Does not get applied to the imageleft&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; parameters.

:; ''groupstyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: CSS style/s to apply to all group heading parameters.  Visit [http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/ this website] to get a lighter color similar to the title background color. Example:
:::&lt;code&gt;groupstyle = background:lightgreen;&lt;/code&gt;

:; ''group&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''style&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: CSS style/s to apply to a specific group heading; overrides any CSS styles set in ''groupstyle''.

:; ''liststyle''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: CSS style/s to apply to all list content parameters.

:; ''list&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''style&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: CSS style/s to apply to specific list content parameters; overrides any CSS styles set in ''liststyle''.

:; ''listpadding''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
:: Padding to have in each list cell; defaults to 0.25em on the left/right and 0em on the top/bottom.

===Nesting Navboxes to get more groups/lists===
You can conveniently nest Navboxes, including {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}}, to get an unlimited number of groups/lists.  The following example uses one instance of {{tl|Navbox with collapsible groups}} to get the first 10 collapsible groups, a nested instance to get the next 10, and another nested instance to get the last 6.  See the code to learn how it works.  It is fairly simple to extend this to as many groups/lists as you like:

{{Navbox with collapsible groups
|name = {{PAGENAME}}
|state = collapsed
|title = Title
|selected = {{{1|}}}

|group1 = A
|list1 = List A
|group2 = B
|list2 = List B
|group3 = C
|list3 = List C
|group4 = D
|list4 = List D
|group5 = E
|list5 = List E
|group6 = F
|list6 = List F
|group7 = G
|list7 = List G
|group8 = H
|list8 = List H
|group9 = I
|list9 = List I

|list10 = {{Navbox with collapsible groups|child
  |selected = {{{1|}}}

  |group1 = J
  |list1 = List J
  |group2 = K
  |list2 = List K
  |group3 = L
  |list3 = List L
  |group4 = M
  |list4 = List M
  |group5 = N
  |list5 = List N
  |group6 = O
  |list6 = List O
  |group7 = P
  |list7 = List P
  |group8 = Q
  |list8 = List Q
  |group9 = R
  |list9 = List R

|list10 = {{Navbox with collapsible groups|child
  |selected = {{{1|}}}

  |group1 = S
  |list1 = List S
  |group2 = T
  |list2 = List T
  |group3 = U
  |list3 = List U
  |group4 = V
  |list4 = List V
  |group5 = W
  |list5 = List W
  |group6 = X
  |list6 = List X
  |group7 = Y
  |list7 = List Y
  |group8 = Z
  |list8 = List Z
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Outline of Revelation==

The following outline does not attempt to interpret Revelation, but presents the details of the book in the manner, and in the order, that they appear. Some words (e.g. &quot;locusts&quot;) are placed in quotes to indicate that their description in the text does not match our normal conception of them. Each of the seven churches is listed with the opening words of the message to that church.

This template returns the cyclic integer month number (between 1 and 12) of the month whose real number is in parameter. Alternatively, the month can be given with its English name (complete or abbreviated to 3 characters, with capitals or small letters).

Does not play nicely with &quot;subst:&quot;

; Syntax&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;MONTHNUMBER|&lt;/tt&gt;''month''&lt;tt&gt;}}&lt;/tt&gt;
* The ''month'' value is interpreted modulo 12 (extra leading zeroes are ignored, negative numbers are accepted, all numbers are rounded to floor).

&lt;includeonly&gt;{{high-risk|35,000+}} {{intricate template}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template puts the page on which it's used (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{FULLPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) into appropriate categories, based on certain page-naming and page-categorization conventions.

=== Usage ===
When used without parameters, it
*places subpages of a book in the book's category ({{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:{{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}&lt;/code&gt;}}) and sorts them by chapter name.
*places a book's templates in the book's template category ({{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:{{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}/Templates&lt;/code&gt;}}). ''This only works if a book's templates begin with''&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:{{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.
*places a book's template category in the book's category and in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;[[:Category:Book-specific templates]]&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.
*places any other category in its parent, sorted by the category's last name.  The parent has the same name except removing everything from the last slash on; and the last name is the part that was removed after that last slash.  For example, {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:My Book/Images&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would go in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:My Book&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; with sort key&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Images&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;.

===Parameters===
Optional parameter&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;filing=deep&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; changes the behavior on book pages, so that a book page with more than one slash in its name is placed in a subcategory of the category where its parent page would be placed, sorted by the page's last name.  For example, using&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{BookCat|filing=deep}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; on page&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;My Book/Maps/Asia&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would put that page in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:My Book/Maps&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; with sort key&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Asia&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;.

Optional parameter&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;template-filing=deep&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; changes the behavior on template pages to deep filing (so&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:My book/Maps/Asia&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; would go in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:My book/Templates/Maps&lt;/code&gt;}}).

=== Examples ===
&lt;tt&gt;Wikijunior:Biology&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME|Wikijunior:Biology}}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Chess/Puzzles/Directmates&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME|Chess/Puzzles/Directmates}}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Apatosaurus&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME|Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Apatosaurus}}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;Category:Horticulture/Templates/Boxes&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;{{ROOTBOOKNAME|Category:Horticulture/Templates/Boxes}}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|documentation/core}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|documentation}} instead.

{{tl|documentation}} calls {{tl|documentation/core2}} which in turn calls this template. This template holds most of the code for {{tl|documentation}}, while {{tl|documentation}} and {{tl|documentation/core2}} do parameter preprocessing. Thus simplifying the code.

=== Technical details ===
This sub-template currently expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{documentation/core
| heading = {{{heading|¬}}}   &lt;!--Note that the &quot;¬&quot; is necessary 
     so we can detect the difference between empty and undefined--&gt;
| heading-style = {{{heading-style|}}}
| content = {{{content|}}}    &lt;!--Text instead of a /doc page--&gt;
| link box = {{{link box|}}}  &lt;!--So &quot;link box=off&quot; works--&gt;

| docpage =     &lt;!--Full pagename of the doc page--&gt;
| doc exist =   &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if the doc page exists, empty string if not--&gt;
| docname fed = &lt;!--&quot;yes&quot; if a docname was manually fed--&gt;

| sandbox =     &lt;!--Full pagename of the /sandbox--&gt;
| testcases =   &lt;!--Full pagename of the /testcases--&gt;

| template page =   &lt;!--Full pagename where the {{documentation}}
    template is placed, but without ending /sandbox or /testcases.
    Note: Unfortunately might not be the &quot;correct&quot; namespace if 
    the template is in subject space and the {{documentation}} 
    template is in talk space or the other way around.--&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For more documentation see {{tl|documentation}}.

__NOTOC__
==Usage==
 {{tl|documentation subpage}}
'''OR'''
 {{tlx|documentation subpage|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;main page to link to&lt;/var&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

===Customization of text===
To manually change the text of the template, the &quot;&lt;code&gt;text1=&lt;var&gt;your text here&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and/or &quot;&lt;code&gt;text2=&lt;var&gt;your other text here&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameters can be specified. &quot;&lt;code&gt;text1=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; changes the automatic text on the first line to your own word(s). &quot;&lt;code&gt;text2=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; changes the automatic text on the second line to your own word(s). If &quot;&lt;code&gt;text1=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter is specified without the &quot;&lt;code&gt;text2=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter, both the first and second line of text will be custom based on the text given in the &quot;&lt;code&gt;text1=&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter.

Example usage:
 {{tlx|documentation subpage|text1&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;custom first and second line text&lt;/var&gt;}}

 {{tlx|documentation subpage|text2&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;custom second line text only&lt;/var&gt;}}

 {{tlx|documentation subpage|text1&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;custom first line text&lt;/var&gt;|text2&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;custom second line text&lt;/var&gt;}}

==How it is displayed==
This template should be placed at the top of &quot;/doc&quot; pages. It changes output depending on where it is viewed:
* On a &quot;/doc&quot; page, it displays a box explaining template documentation and links to the template page.
* On other pages (ie, pages transcluding the &quot;/doc&quot; page), the template will not show. The template page itself (which contains &lt;code&gt;{{tl|Documentation}}&lt;/code&gt;) will automatically note that the documentation is transcluded from a subpage.

==Functions==
In addition to the output message, the template categorizes pages to [[:Category:Template documentation]], [[:Category:User documentation]], or similar (named after the subject space), but only for documentation pages in namespaces with the subpage feature. It defaults the [[m:Help:Categories#Sort order|sort key]] to the page name without namespace (ie, &quot;Foo&quot; on &quot;Template:Foo&quot;, so it would be sorted in categories under 'F').

  PLEASE ADD METADATA WITHIN THE &lt;includeonly&gt; SECTION AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE
  ---&gt;
This template and its sister {{tl|end infobox page}} are intended to facilitate the presentation of an infobox template and its documentation on the infobox template's own page. The documentation should be prepared as a {{tl|documentation}} page. This template then assigns it the lefthand side of the infobox template's page, while the infobox template itself appears on the righthand side of the page, using this code:
&lt;pre&gt;
{| style=&quot;width:100%; background:transparent;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
| &lt;!-----Lefthand side: documentation-----&gt;
{{documentation}}
| &lt;!-------Righthand side: template-------&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This template should be placed between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; and &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags at the very top of an infobox template page, immediately before the start of the infobox's code thus:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;{{start infobox page}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''infobox code starts here''&lt;/code&gt;

The start and end-comment markers (&quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) are important as they remove the possibility of a spurious space appearing. The {{tl|end infobox page}} template should then be placed within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; and &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags on the first line after the end of the template code. For an example, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_Machinima&amp;action=edit Infobox Machinima].

__NOTOC__
=== Usage ===
This template ends any table (with bar-brace &quot;|}&quot;) and may be used with any other templates that begin a one-level table, except with template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Top}} &amp; {{Mid}} which require {{Bottom}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to end a Top-table (which has a double-level format).

===Severe limitations===
WARNING: Template {{tl|end}} must be placed on a separate line for ending a table; otherwise, it inserts a literal bar-brace &quot;|}&quot; into the text.

===Examples===
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}{{col-2}}AA{{col-2}}BB&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
''Result:''
{{col-begin}}{{col-2}}AA{{col-2}}BB
{{end}}
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-begin}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-2}}AA&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{col-2}}BB&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{end}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
''Result:''
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}AA
{{col-2}}BB

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2 style=&quot;font-size: 10em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-family: serif; text-align: center; color: yellow; text-shadow: #99ffff 5px -5px 2px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: 1em; border-bottom: 0px;&quot;&gt;Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;

The first part of speech is a '''noun'''. 

&lt;big&gt;A noun is a word that is a '''person''', an '''animal''', a '''place''' or a '''thing'''.&lt;/big&gt; 

&quot;Mailman&quot;, &quot;library&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot; and &quot;book&quot; are all nouns. &quot;Mailman&quot; is a person, &quot;elephant&quot; is an animal, &quot;library&quot; is a place and &quot;book&quot; is a thing. &quot;Eat&quot;, &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;quickly&quot; are not nouns. They are not people, animals, places or things. They are other parts of speech. &quot;Eat&quot; is a [[Gramma's Grammar/Parts of Speech/Verbs|verb]], &quot;happy&quot; is an [[Gramma's Grammar/Parts of Speech/Adjectives|adjective]] and &quot;quickly&quot; is an [[Gramma's Grammar/Parts of Speech/Adverbs|adverb]]. You may not know what verbs, adjectives and adverbs are yet, but that's OK.

==Exercise==
Tell if the words in '''bold''' are nouns. 

# I went to the '''store''' today.
# I don't '''care'''.
# It seems the '''monkey''' fell out of the '''tree'''. 
# '''Many''' people think that grammar is fun. 
# If you eat eyeballs, you will get '''sick'''. 
# I went to '''Washington''' on the '''weekend'''.

{{HideNseek|title=Click here for answers|text=
# '''Store''' is a noun.
# '''Care''' is not a noun in that sentence.
# '''Monkey''' and '''tree''' are both nouns.
# '''Many''' is not a noun.
# '''Sick''' is not a noun. 
# '''Washington'''  and '''weekend''' are nouns.}}

&lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt; all the nouns.

# Jason doesn't want to go the play.
# Dad watched TV so much yesterday that his eyes started to hurt.
# I feel like having hamburgers.
# My sister is a singer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Natural sciences are both entertaining and educative - and science shows is all about awakening the curiosity for the natural sciences. There are many initiatives around the world for this.

This book is about how you can perform or teach others to perform scientific experiments in a safe and 'edutaining' way, with emphasis on ensuring people learn something on the way.

We hope that teachers and students will have as much pleasure of these experiments as the many thousand people we have shown them to so far.

With help from the Wiki system, we hope to achieve an easy and quick reviewing and updating of the guides and recipes for the experiments, as well as a lot of people participating in developing new experiments and giving a good description of these.
In addition the wiki system makes it possible to have a discussion running about the content of the book, so where optimizations and problems can be shared. Finally wiki makes is possible to share the content in various languages - this english version will hopefully quickly expand faster than the Danish version I have started based on our show notes.

A possible problem is if people start changing the contents of recipes so they don't work or become dangerous. This is avoided by eveyone carefully following rule No 1 for experimental work:

{| Border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; Backgroundcolor=&quot;0f0f0f&quot;
||''Practice yourself, for heaven’s sake, in little things; and thence proceed to greater.''
(Epictetus, Discourses IV)
|}

In wiki books you can also follow the history of changes to a page and the discussion - and everyone can correct the mistakes and typos. The disadvantage of occasional vandalism is by far overwun by all the people who will contribute to make everything as good as possible - as in the marvellous Wikipedia.

===How YOU can contribute to the book===

If you want to '''add a guide to an experiment or recipe''' then edit in the page [[Scienceshow/Guides| 'Guides']] and insert a link to the comming new guide where it's appropriate in the index.

The link should look like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Scienceshow/Guides/Title on the new page| Title on the new page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Do not use abbrevations but write everything out in full. Check your addition by looking at the preview and then save it when you're satisfied.

Press on the link you have just made and then you'll come to your new and fresh page you can edit.

Cut n' paste from [[Scienceshow/Template for new guide| Template for new guide]] to ensure you get all the sub-sections in the new page.

Maybe you don't have time to add text to all the sections - but you can get that later and others will hopefully also help. It's probably a good idea to keep most of the points, even if you think some seem pointless - its important to tell newbies that an experiments is in fact considered harmless, and to explain them how ridiculesly harmless the most harmless part of it is. This will make them feel safe about testing the experiment.

Once the page has been made, you can add links to it in the subject areas or include it in descriptions of longer show series there.

*[[commons:scienceshow| Wikimedia Commons ScienceShow]] is where we upload the media files for this book

===Science Shows Around the World===
Some shows only cover a single subject, such as physics, but the hope with this book is to create a source for all subjects, since many experiments are cross disciplinary and science as such seems to be moving towards a higher degree of cross disciplinarity.

Please add shows you know of to this list:
*[http://www.scienceshow.dtu.dk Science show from Copenhagen, Denmark]
*[http://www.phys.au.dk/~fysshow/ Physics show from Århus, Denmark]
*[http://www.chem.au.dk/~kemishow/ Chemistry show from Århus, Denmark]
*[http://www.fysikshow.aau.dk/ Physics show from Ålborg, Denmark]
*[http://kemishow.bio.aau.dk Chemistry show from Ålborg, Denmark]
*[http://www.fys.sdu.dk/fysikshow/ Physics show from Odense, Denmark]
*[http://www.kemishow.sdu.dk/ Chemistry show from Odense, Denmark]
*[http://www.skyone.co.uk/programmes/brainiac/ Science show from England]
*[http://www.chaosscience.org.uk/pub/public_html/index.php Chaos Science Show from England]
*[http://www.stichtingrino.nl/ Physics show from Leiden, The Netherlands]

===Wiki Science Show History===
The book was started by [http://kristian.molhave.dk Kristian Molhave ][[User:KristianMolhave|(wiki user page)]] 12. Oct. 2005. In the coming time I'll begin adding descriptions of experiments based on the descriptions we have in danish. There's a [[:da:scienceshow| Wiki Science show book in Danish]] as well. I do hope others will begin to join the work too :-)

===Good Entertainment and Good Education===
A show is not just entertainment but educating entertainment aiming at inspiring and activating people.

I hope you will contribute!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yaws is a HTTP high performance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited for dynamic-content web applications. Two separate modes of operations are supported.

    * Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular web server daemon. This is the default mode.
    * Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded web server in another Erlang application.

Yaws is entirely written in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29 Erlang] furthermore it is a multithreaded webserver where one Erlang light weight process is used to handle each client.

The main advantages of yaws compared to other Web technologies are performance and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficient way. Its elegance comes from Erlang as well. Web applications do not have to be written in ugly adhoc languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
{{TOCright}}
It should be understood that there is no magic in the the many techniques described in the other chapters, indeed there is no magic in mathematics in general, it can be argued that mathematics is the purest of all sciences as there is no opinion and mathematics needs no experiments or interpretation of results; things are either true, (i.e. they are proven to be true), or they are not. That being the case, there must be sound reasons why all the previously described techniques work.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason some of the techniques work is simply that they perform a well understood algorithm (e.g. long multiplication) in a more efficient way, (often due to particular problem properties, e.g. the technique of multiplying any number by 11), even if it is difficult to see this at first. Other techniques work by making use of less widely understood mathematical laws, (e.g. algebra, quadratic equations, modular or 'clock' arithmetic, etc.). In either case, it is not necessary to know why a technique works to be able to use it, (much like you don't need to know how a car works to be able to drive one). It is for this reason, as well as to make the previous chapters more immediately usable, that the description of why each technique works has been omitted.&lt;br /&gt;
However, for those that are curious and want to investigate further, this chapter describes why many of the Vedic mathematics techniques work. Remember that some of the descriptions below will require knowledge of areas of mathematics that you may not be familiar with. Hopefully this will give you the impetus to investigate these areas and expand your mathematical knowledge, (this is a very rewarding way to discover new aspects of a subject). However even if this is not the case, you can (and should) still use the techniques and be happy in the knowledge that even if you don't know how the techniques work, they will still improve your numerical and arithmetic skills.&lt;br /&gt;
Think of this section as an appendix, useful for further study, but not essential to the understanding of the main theme of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Addition and Subtraction Techniques ==

=== Subtracting from a power of 10 ===

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Multiplication Techniques ==

=== Multiplying by 11 ===
When multiplying by 11 using long multiplication a pattern to the working out can be discovered e.g.

  46     876     4386      432672
  11x     11x      11x         11x
  --     ---     ----     -------
  46     876     4386      432672
 460+   8760+   43860+    4326720+
 ---    ----    -----    --------
 506    9636    48246     4759392
 ---    ----    -----    --------
You can see that in the addition section of each long multiplication above, each column apart from the first and last is the sum of the original digit in the column and the next one (to the right). Once you know this you can just write down the result of multiplying any number by 11.&lt;br /&gt;
Working from right to left:
# Write the rightmost digit down.
# Add each pair of digits and write the result down right to left (carrying digits where necessary).
# Finally write down the left most digit.
e.g.
&lt;br /&gt;
* Multiply 712x11
 &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix} &amp; 7 &amp;  &amp; 1 &amp;  &amp; 2 \\ &amp; \swarrow \searrow &amp; + &amp; \swarrow \searrow &amp; + &amp; \swarrow \searrow \\ 7 &amp; &amp; 8 &amp; &amp; 3 &amp; &amp; 2 \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
712x11=7832&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason for working from right to left instead of the more usual left to right is so any carries can be added in as you go along. e.g.
* Multiply 8738x11
 &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix} &amp; 8 &amp; &amp; 7 &amp; &amp; 3 &amp; &amp; 8 \\ &amp; \swarrow \searrow &amp; + &amp; \swarrow \searrow &amp; + &amp; \swarrow \searrow &amp; + &amp; \swarrow \searrow \\ 9 &amp; \leftarrow _1 &amp; 6 &amp; \leftarrow _1 &amp; 1 &amp; \leftarrow _1 &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; 8 \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
8738x11=96118&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== Multiplying by 12 ===

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== Multiplying numbers close to a power of 10 ===

In the techniques section it is shown that the '''Vertically and Crosswise''' sutra can be used to  easily multiply numbers that are close to 100. It is then shown that the same technique can be used to multiply any numbers near a power of 10, and that in fact the general technique will work for any numbers near any base, the key factor being that the technique is useful if the initial subtractions result in numbers that are easier to multiply. To understand why this technique works, you need a basic understanding of algebra, and quadratic equations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider two numbers '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' that are to be multiplied together and a third number '''''X''''' that is close to both numbers (we will call '''''X''''' the 'base' ). We assume that the numbers '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' are difficult to multiply and so we are looking for an easier alternative that only involves addition, subtraction and the multiplication of easier (e.g. smaller or simpler) numbers. The key is to realise that since '''''X''''' is close to both numbers we can generate smaller numbers (that are hopefully easier to work with) related to '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' by subtracting each from '''''X''''' (we will call these smaller numbers '''''a''''' and '''''b'''''). i.e.&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
      &amp; a = X - A \\
      &amp; b = X - B \\
      Thus: \\
      &amp; A = X - a \quad (1) \\
      &amp; B = X - b \quad (2)
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
We can multiply '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' by substituting for them using equations (1) and (2) above, i.e.
  &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
      AB &amp; = (X - a)(X - b) \\
         &amp; = X^2 - aX - bX + ab \\
         &amp; = X(X-a-b) + ab
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
Now we have something we can work with! You can see from the equation above that we can replace the multiplication of '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' with some subtractions of small numbers '''''(X-a-b)''''' a multiplication of the result of this subtraction by the 'base' number '''''X''''' and then the addition of a small multiplication '''''ab'''''. (Remember '''''a''''' and '''''b''''' are small because '''''X''''' is close to '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' and '''''a=X-A''''', '''''b=X-B'''''). The only multiplication that might be difficult is the multiplication of '''''X''''' by the result of the initial subtraction '''''(X-a-b)''''', however if we choose '''''X''''' carefully (e.g. by making '''''X''''' a power of 10) we can make sure that this multiplication is simple too. With this knowledge we can now make sense of the '''Vertically and Crosswise''' multiplication technique. i.e.
 &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{matrix} A &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; (X-A) \\  \\ B &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; (X-B) \\ \hline \quad \end{matrix}
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \begin{matrix} A &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; a \\  \\ B &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; b \\ \hline \quad \end{matrix}
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \begin{matrix} A &amp; &amp; a \\ &amp;  &amp; \downarrow \\ B &amp; &amp; b \\ \hline &amp; &amp; ab \end{matrix}
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \begin{matrix} \quad \quad A &amp; &amp; a \\ &amp; \nwarrow &amp; \\ \quad \quad B &amp; &amp; b \\ \hline (A - b) &amp; &amp; ab \end{matrix}
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
  \begin{matrix} \quad \quad A &amp; &amp; a \\ &amp; &amp; \\ \quad \quad B &amp; &amp; b \\ \hline (X - a - b) &amp; &amp; ab \end{matrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Perhaps the cleverest bit is that if the base number '''''X''''' is an appropriate power of 10, both the multiplication of '''''(X-a-b)''''' by '''''X''''' and the subsequent addition of '''''ab''''' is handled automatically by the positional shift of the digits caused by appending the '''''ab''''' digits to the end of the '''''(X-a-b)''''' digits. The only potential problem left is if the product '''''ab''''' is equal to or larger than the base '''''X'''''. In this case the positional shift of the '''''(X-a-b)''''' digits will be one too many, so instead the leading digit of the product '''''ab''''' must be 'carried' and then added to the '''''(X-a-b)''''' value.

&lt;big&gt;'''Ovarian Cancer Staging'''&lt;/big&gt;


== AJCC 7th Edition (2009) ==
* Ovarian cancer staging is by FIGO staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which should include a total abdominal hysterectomy, removal of (usually) both ovaries, pelvic (peritoneal) washings for cytology, and biopsies (omentum, mesentery, diaphragm, peritoneal surfaces, pelvic and para-aortic nodes) 
* The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage
* Also includes ''primary peritoneal carcinoma''


'''Primary Tumor:''' (FIGO stage in parentheses)
* T1 (I) - limited to one or both ovaries
** T1a (IA) - involves one ovary; capsule intact; no tumor on ovarian surface; no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings
** T1b (IB) - involves both ovaries; capsule intact; no tumor on ovarian surface; negative washings
** T1c (IC) - tumor limited to ovaries with any of the following: capsule ruptured, tumor on ovarian surface, positive washings
* T2 (II) - pelvic extension or implants
** T2a (IIA) - extension or implants onto uterus or fallopian tube; negative washings
** T2b (IIB) - extension or implants onto other pelvic structures; negative washings
** T2c (IIC) - pelvic extension or implants (T2a or T2b) with positive peritoneal washings
* T3 (III) - microscopic peritoneal implants outside of the pelvis
** T3a (IIIA) - microscopic peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis
** T3b (IIIB) - macroscopic peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis less than 2cm in size
** T3c (IIIC) - peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis &gt; 2 cm. (lymph node metastasis is also IIIC for FIGO)

'''Regional Lymph Nodes:''' includes pelvic, para-aortic, inguinal, retroperitoneal
* N0 - no
* N1 (IIIC) - yes

'''Distant Metastases:'''
* M0 - no
* M1 (IV) - yes


'''Stage Grouping:'''
:Follows FIGO staging above (in parentheses). T3c and N1 are both IIIC. 
:''Note:'' primary peritoneal tumors are usually either Stage III or IV
:''Note'': seeding of the liver capsule is Stage III but liver parenchymal mets are Stage IV.


''Changes from 6th Edition:''
:No changes, except included primary peritoneal carcinoma (which was previously always M1)

=== Older staging systems ===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br /&gt;
:Same as 7th Edition, except primary peritoneal carcinoma is always metastatic (M1) at diagnosis</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi. Please feel free to leave any messages to me here. [[User:GandalfUK|GandalfUK]] ([[User talk:GandalfUK|talk]]) 18:56, 22 April 2010 (UTC)

==[[WB:WikiProject Mathematics|WikiProject Mathematics]]==
I was attempting to restart the Mathematics Project here at wikibooks. The aim is simply to provide some community for the editors interested in improving the mathematics/statistics coverage here. Give a place to discuss issues with wikibooks (such as &quot;hey this won't TeX correctly&quot; or &quot;how do I make a nice picture&quot;); or actual mathematics content. I know you haven't been around in a few months, but a comment at [[Vedic Mathematics]] called my attention to the great work you've done cleaning up that abandoned book.  When/if ever you back you might be interested in checking it out the project. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:36, 13 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Ovarian Cancer Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Median age 60's, peak incidence 80's
*22K cases per year in US; 4th most common cancer in women
*14K deaths per year in US; 5th most common cause of cancer death in women


==Risk factors==
*Genetics
**One first-degree relative: 4-5% lifetime risk
**Two first-degree relatives: 25-50% lifetime risk
**BRCA1/BRCA2
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Cancer_Syndromes#Lynch_syndrome.2C_Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer_.28HNPCC.29|HNPCC]]
*Hormone exposure: nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, hormone replacement
*Ovarian trauma, including multiple cycles of ovulation
*Environmental: endometriosis, obesity, smoking, diet


==Screening==
*'''Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Screening Trial''' (1993-2001)
**Randomized. 34,261 women in the screening arm. General population, age 55-74. Transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125. Screening compliance 83% to 78%
**'''2009''' PMID 19305319 -- &quot;Results from four rounds of ovarian cancer screening in a randomized trial.&quot; (Partridge E, Obstet Gynecol. 2009 Apr;113(4):775-82.)
***Outcome: Data from first 4 annual screens. Positive screen ~5% (about 2/3 TVU and 1/3 CA-125). Ratio of surgery to cancer detection 20:1. Overall yield ~5/10,000 screened. Majority (72%) late stage. 
***Conclusion: Ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers high, and most were late stage


==Presentation==
*Generally present with ill-defined symptoms and diagnosis may be delayed
**Abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, early satiety or constipation.
**Irregular vaginal bleeding
**Dyspareunia
**Urinary symptoms
*Palpable adnexal mass
**Pre-menopausal: 5% risk of malignancy
**Post-menopausal: 30-60% risk of malignancy
*Paraneoplastic presentation (rare):
**[[w:Leser-Trelat_sign|Leser-Trelat Sign]] – Sudden multiple seborrheic keratoses
**[[w:Trousseau%27s_sign_of_malignancy|Trousseau’s Syn]] – Migratory thrombophlebitis
*Hormonal effects – Germ Cell Tumors
**Precocious puberty, amenorrhea, virilization
*[[w:Meig%27s_syndrome|Meigs' syndrome]] - Ascites, an ovarian tumor, and right-sided pleural effusion
*80% have spread beyond the ovary at presentation. 


==Anatomy==
*Located in lateral pelvis, beneath external illiac artery and in front of internal illiac artery
*Attached to the uterus by ovarian ligament and the body wall by suspensory ligament; within the broad ligament
*There are 3 major tissue types in the ovary, which give rise to different types of tumors:
**Surface: covered by ovarian epithelium
**Stroma: 
***Soft tissue consisting of spindle-shaped cells (regarded by some anatomists as unstiped muscle cells and others as connective-tissue cells)
***On the surface of the ovary, this tissue is much condensed, and forms a layer (tunica albuginea) composed of short connective-tissue fibers, with fusiform cells between them
**Follicle:
***Single oocyte
***Granulosa cells surround the oocyte and respond to FSH and LH
***Theca is the surrounding protective layer


==Work Up==
*Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) is more sensitive compared to CT
**Classic TVU finding is a “complex” cyst, defined as containing both solid and cystic components
**&quot;Simple&quot; cyst, defined as having thin walls, fluid-filled, without a mass component, septations, or internal echogenicity is frequently benign but workup must be individualized
*Percutaneous biopsy should be avoided due to risk of cyst rupture and seeding into peritoneal cavity
*Surgery
**Exploratory laparotomy perfomed to 1) confirm pathology, 2) stage patient, and 3) perform maximum cyto-reduction (residual disease &lt;1cm)
**Should be performed by a GYN Oncologist
**Ascites or peritoneal washings
**Inspection of serosal surfaces with biopsy of any suspicious lesions
**Inspect stomach, small bowel, large bowel, peritoneum, mesentery, and solid organs
**TAH/BSO
**Infracolic omentectomy
**Pelvic and paraortic LN sampling
**Peritoneal biopsies
**Pelvic cul-de-sac biopsy
**Bladder
**Bil Sidewalls
**Bil Paracolic gutters
**Diaphragm

==Pathology==
[[Image:Ovarian_surface_papillary_serous_tumor_submerged_in_water.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[Image:Ovarian_serous_adenocarcinoma_%282%29.jpg|thumb|right]]
*'''[[Radiation_Oncology/Ovary/Epithelial_ovarian|Epithelial tumors]]''' - most common, 65%
**Serous tumors: 25% of ovarian tumors, 40% of epithelial tumors
***Benign (60%): Serous cystadenoma, cystadenofibroma
***Borderline (15%): Serous borderline tumors, microinvasive serous carcinoma
***Malignant (25%): Serous cystadenocarcinoma, serous carcinoma, serous micropapillary carcinoma, serous psammomacarcinoma
**Mucinous tumors: 15% of ovarian tumors, 25% of epithelial tumors
***Benign (80%): Mucinous cystadenoma, mucinous adenofibroma
***Borderline (10%): Mucinous borderline tumors, microinvasive mucinous carcinoma
***Malignant (10%): Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, mucinous carcinoma
**Endometrioid tumors: 20% of ovarian tumors, 35% of epithelial tumors
***Benign: Endometrioid cystadenoma, endometrioid adenofibroma
***Borderline: Endometrioid borderline tumors
***Malignant (Majority): Endometrioid carcinoma
**Brenner tumors (benign, borderline, or malignant) - composed of urothelial-like cells
**Other: Clear cell adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell), mixed epithelial-papillary cystadenoma of borderline malignancy of mullerian type
*'''Sex cord - stromal tumors''' - 8%
**Stromal cells: fibroblasts, theca cells, Leydig cells
**Primitive sex cords: granulosa cells, Sertoli cells
**Are hormonally active. Affect all age groups. 70% are Stage I at diagnosis (unlike epithelial tumors which are usually Stage III-IV).
*'''Germ cell tumors''' - 15%
**Benign: mature teratoma
**Malignant: 90% of malignant tumors are epithelial: dysgerminoma, immature teratoma, yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor), embryonal carcinoma


*Note: Borderline tumors (tumors of Low Malignant Potential; LMP) have absence of stromal invasion


==Epithelial Ovarian Cancer==
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Ovary/Epithelial_ovarian|epithelial ovarian cancer]] page


==Sex cord-stromal tumors==
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Ovary/Granulosa_Cell_Tumor|Granulosa cell tumors]]
**About 5% of malignant ovarian tumors. The most common malignant sex cord-stromal tumor
**More common in post-menopausal women
**Present with vaginal bleeding (due to hormone)
**May be associated with endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyps, or endometrial carcinoma
**Most patients have an excellent prognosis, 90% 10-year survival
**May have late recurrence, 10-20 years after treatment
*Fibroma, Fibrothecoma, and Thecoma
**4% of ovarian tumors
**These 3 tumors form a spectrum of benign tumors
**Occur in pre- and post-menopausal women
**Fibroma is most common sex cord tumor
**Thecomas are active (as compared to fibromas) and can have estrogenic activity
*Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor
**Very rare (&lt;0.5% of ovarian tumors) 
**Young women
**Symptoms are related to virilizing hormones
**Most behave in a benign fashion but can act malignant
**Recur relatively soon after treatment
*Treatment approach includes surgery, and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy for high risk Stage I and Stage II-IV


==Germ cell tumors==
*30% of ovarian tumors, but only 1-3% of malignant ovarian tumors
*More common in younger women and also more likely to be malignant (up to 1/3)
*Symptoms
**Due to rapid growth of tumor, resulting in stretching of the ovarian capsule; leads to early diagnosis
**Abdominal pain, distension, pelvic fullness, and urinary symptoms 
*Histology:
**Dysgerminoma (counterpart to seminoma)
**Nondysgerminoma
*Serum levels
**Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor): AFP elevated
**Embryonal carcinoma: AFP and bHCG elevated
**Choriocarcinoma: bHCG elevated
**Pure immature teratoma: normal AFP and bHCG; though AFP may be elevated in 30%
**Mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst): normal AFP and bHCG
*Most common malignant germ cell tumor is dysgerminoma which occur most commonly in adolescence
*Stage I 60-70%
*Surgery: Principles of management similar to epithelial ovarian CA, except fertility can be preserved with ipsilateral salpingo-oopherectomy
*Adjuvant chemotherapy: 
**Adjuvant BEP for 3-4 cycles
**Stage I disgerminoma can be observed (DeVita, 8th ed.) if fertility preservation is important, with 15-20% recurrence rate. Salvage with chemotherapy is high
*Role for RT limited, due to excellent chemo responsiveness and impact on fertility</text>

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template is for pages actively undergoing a major edit. If the page instead is actively undergoing construction, please use {{tl|under construction}}.

The '''In use''' template message is placed at the top of a page you are actively editing for a short period of time. The tag is intended to inform people that someone is currently working on the article, thereby reducing edit conflicts. Please do not leave it in place for more than the few hours at most that should be necessary, as doing so may unnecessarily discourage others from contributing to the page. If it has been up for more than two hours since the last edit, it should be removed. Specifying periods of several days or longer for this template goes against the spirit of simply avoiding edit conflicts; please only use it for sessions where you are actively editing the page. 

If you wish to indicate that a page is being rebuilt over a longer period of time consider the {{Tl|under construction}} template. That template encourages others to edit the page while indicating that it is a work in progress.

To use, just add  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{in use|time=~~~~~}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the page you want to work on. If you want to reserve it for a specific length of time and optionally, a message, use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{in use|time (message)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, if only one section of the page is being edited, you may place this template at the top of that section using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{in use|section}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. '''Please remember to remove the ''in use'' note''' as soon as you're finished editing.

=== Examples ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{In use}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{In use}}

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{In use|section}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{In use|section}}

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{In use|5 minutes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{In use|5 minutes}}

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{In use|30 minutes to fix the information in the History section|time=20:49, 27 February 2009 (UTC)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Epithelial Ovarian Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*CA-125 elevated in &gt;80% of patients (though can be also elevated in endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or pregnancy)
*Hereditary: 5-10% (majority due to BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, some HNPCC)
**Lifetime risk BRCA1: 20-60%
**Lifetime risk BRCA2: 10-35%
*Stage I-II in ~30%

==BRCA Mutations==
:See also page at [[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Breast overview#BRCA Mutations]]

'''''Impact of oophorectomy:'''''
*'''Toronto'''
**'''2014''' PMID 24567435 -- &quot;Impact of Oophorectomy on Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Women With a BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation.&quot; (Finch AP, J Clin Oncol. 2014 Feb 24. [Epub ahead of print])
***5,783 pts from international registry with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. 
***Average f/u 5.6 yrs. 186 women developed either ovarian (n = 132), fallopian (n = 22), or peritoneal (n = 32) cancer, of whom 68 have died. Bilateral oophorectomy associated with HR 0.20 for development of cancer, HR 0.23 for all-cause mortality.
***Conclusion: &quot;Preventive oophorectomy was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers and a 77% reduction in all-cause mortality.&quot;

==Pathology==
*Most likely arise from the surface epithelium covering the ovary (contiguous with peritoneal mesothelium)
*Malignant transformation likely occurs within epithelium that becomes trapped within ovarian inclusion cysts during ovulation
*Mutations: p53 in ~50%, her2 in 8%


==Patterns of Spread==
*Intraperitoneal Spread
**Cells exfoliate from the ovarian surface, and spread into peritonum
**Papillary serous has highest predilection
*Direct extension
**Bladder or rectosigmoid
*Lymphatics
**10-15% of Stage I patients are LN+
**Along blood supply through infundibulopelvic ligmanent to para-aorticl LNs 
**Through broad ligament to pelvic sidewall LNs (including external illiac, and obturator)
**Rarely along round ligament to inguinal LNs
**Paraortic and Pelvic LNs
**Occasionally Inguinal LNs via round ligament
*Hematogenous (2-3%)
**Lung and Liver


'''''Serous Tumors'''''
*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18854563 -- &quot;New insights into the pathogenesis of serous ovarian cancer and its clinical impact.&quot; (Levanon K, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 10;26(32):5284-93. Epub 2008 Oct 14.)

*Role for adjuvant radiation therapy appears minimal at this time
*Whole abdominal RT was removed as a treatment option from NCCN guidelines in the 2007 version
*Typical role for RT is in palliative care

==Whole Abdomen Irradiation (WAI)==
*Several randomized trials generally found that WAI was less effective and/or more toxic than chemotherapy, particularly platinum-containing regimens
*As a result, adjuvant RT is no longer routinely used for patients with high-risk, early stage ovarian cancer


===Adjuvant treatment===
====WAI vs. Chemo====
*'''GONA''' (Italy)(1985-1989) -- adjuvant WAI vs. cyclophosphamide
**Randomized. ''Closed prematurely due to poor compliance.'' 70 patients, high-risk Stage I-II. Arm 1) chemo cisplatin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 x6 courses vs. Arm 2) WAI open field 30.2 Gy upper abdomen and 43.2/24 pelvis
**'''5-years; 1994''' PMID 8311013 -- &quot;High-risk early-stage ovarian cancer. Randomized clinical trial comparing cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide versus whole abdominal radiotherapy.&quot; (Chiara S, Am J Clin Oncol. 1994 Feb;17(1):72-6.)
***Outcome: 5-year RFS chemo 74% vs. WAI 50% (p=0.07); OS 71% vs. 53% (NS)
***Toxicity: WAI Grade 3-4 diarrhea 28%, late GI toxicity requiring surgery in 1 patient
***Conclusion: No difference, but chemotherapy appears safe in comparison with WAI

*'''West Midlands; UK''' (1981-1987) -- adjuvant WAI vs. cisplatin
**Randomized. 40 patients, surgery, with no macroscopic residual disease. Treated with Arm 1) cisplatin vs. Arm 2) WAI moving strip
**'''5-years; 1993''' PMID 8424908 -- &quot;The West Midlands epithelial ovarian cancer adjuvant therapy trial.&quot; (Redman CW, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1993;5(1):1-5.)
***Outcome: 5-year OS 58% vs 62% (NS)
***Toxicity: 11% long-term disability
***Conclusion: No difference between chemo and WAI

*'''MD Anderson''' -- adjuvant WAI vs. melphalan
**'''2-years; 1975''' PMID 1234631 -- &quot;Postoperative treatment of early cancer of the ovary: a random trial between postoperative irradiation and chemotherapy.&quot; (Smith JP, Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 1975 Oct;42:149-53.)
**Randomized. 149 patients, Stage I-II. Arm 1) WAI vs. Arm 2) melphalan. RT technique moving strip 
***Outcome: Stage I RFS 85% vs. 90% (NS); Stage II 55% vs. 58% (NS)
***Toxicity: melphalan well tolerated, WAI 7 patients with GI toxicity requiring surgery
***Conclusion: Significant toxicity for moving-strip WAI, no outcome difference

====WAI vs. Pelvic RT + chemo====
*'''Denmark''' (1981-1987) -- WAI vs. pelvic RT + cyclophosphamide
**Randomized. 118 patients, Stage IB-IIC epithelial ovarian CA. Arm 1) WAI vs. Arm 2) pelvic RT + cyclophosphamide
**'''4-years; 1990''' PMID 2351321 -- &quot;Randomized study of whole-abdomen irradiation versus pelvic irradiation plus cyclophosphamide in treatment of early ovarian cancer.&quot; (Sell A, Gynecol Oncol. 1990 Jun;37(3):367-73.)
***Outcome: 4-year OS: 63% (NS), RFS 55% (NS)
***Toxicity: in pelvic RT + cyclophosphamide arm, 25% hemorrhagic cystis; 8% late GI toxicity requiring surgery
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''NCIC Canada''' (1975-1984)
**Randomized. ''Arm C discontinued early due to toxicity.'' 257 patients, Stage I-III ovarian, surgery + whole pelvis RT 45/20, then Arm A) WAI 22.5/20 vs. Arm B) melphalan 8 mg/m2/d vs. Arm C) intraperitoneal chromic phosphate 10-20 mCi
**'''5-years; 1988''' PMID 3045264 -- &quot;Early stage ovarian cancer: a randomized clinical trial comparing whole abdominal radiotherapy, melphalan, and intraperitoneal chromic phosphate: a National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group report.&quot; (Klaasen D, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Aug;6(8):1254-63.) Median F/U 8 years
***Outcome: 5-year OS 62% vs. 61% vs. 66% (NS); marginally better DFS with melphalan over WAI
***Toxicity: melphalan - 4 patients developed MDS/AML
***Conclusion: No difference

*'''Princess Margaret''' -- WAI vs. pelvic RT + chlorambucil
**Randomized. 190 patients, TAH/BSO, Stage IB-III. Arm 1) WAI vs. Arm 2) pelvic RT alone vs. Arm 3) pelvic RT + chlorambucil
**'''10-years; 1979''' PMID 463982 -- &quot;Ovarian carcinoma: improved survival following abdominopelvic irradiation in patients with a completed pelvic operation.&quot; (Dembo AJ, Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1979 Aug 1;134(7):793-800.)
***Outcome: 10-year RFS WAI 64% vs. pelvic RT +/- C 40% (SS); chlorambucil delayed time to treatment failure but not number of treatment failures
***Failure patterns: 20-25% pelvis regardless of RT, 0% abdomen alone in WAI vs. 25% abdomen alone in pelvic RT
***Conclusion: Whole abdomen RT superior to pelvic RT with/without chlorambucil

====Dose Evaluation====
*'''Princess Margaret''' (1981-1990) -- 22.5 Gy vs. 27.5 Gy abdomen 
**Randomized. 125 patients, optimally debulked Stage I-III. Arm 1) whole pelvis 22.5/10 + WART 22.5/22 vs. Arm 2) whole pelvis 22.5/10 + WART 27.5/27
**RT technique: most superior diaphragm excursion + 1-1.5cm margin; lateral peritoneum; pelvic floor + 1.5cm margin. Pelvic field at L5/S1 and 1.5 cm bony pelvis lateral margin. Renal dose &lt;20 Gy.
**'''5-years; 1998''' PMID 9635700 -- &quot;A randomized study of two doses of abdominopelvic radiation therapy for patients with optimally debulked Stage I (n=43), II (n=71), and III (n=11) ovarian cancer.&quot; (Fyles AW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Jun 1;41(3):543-9.). Median F/U 6.6 years
***5-year outcome: OS: low-dose 83% vs. high-dose 72% (NS); DFS 74% vs. 67% (NS)
***Sites of failure: pelvis alone 39%, abdomen alone 18%, pelvis+abdomen 15%, distant 28%
***Toxicity: no difference, GI Grade 3 2%, Bladder Grade 3 2%
***Conclusion: No difference in outcome, no benefit to higher WART dose

===Consolidative treatment===
*'''Swedish-Norwegian OCSG''' (1988-1993) -- WAI vs. cisplatin + doxorubicin/epirubicin vs. observation
**Randomized. 172 patients, Stage III, primary surgery, then cisplatin 50 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 or epirubicin 60 mg/m2, followed by second look surgery. Randomized to Arm 1) WAI vs. Arm 2) same chemo consolidation x6 cycles vs. Arm 3) no further treatment. WAI 20/20 + pelvic boost to L3/L4 20.4/12
**'''5-years; 2003''' PMID 12801256 -- &quot;Consolidation treatment of advanced (FIGO stage III) ovarian carcinoma in complete surgical remission after induction chemotherapy: a randomized, controlled, clinical trial comparing whole abdominal radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and no further treatment.&quot; (Sorbe B, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2003 May-Jun;13(3):278-86.)
***Outcome: 5-year PFS WAI 56% vs. chemo 36% vs. control 35% (SS)
***Subset analysis: If microscopic residual disease, no difference between groups
***Toxicity: 10% late GI in WAI group
***Conclusion: WAI may be beneficial in consolidative setting, if pCR after chemo

*'''North Thames''' (UK) -- consolidative WAI vs. carboplatin
**Randomized. 254 patients, Stage IIB-IV, surgery followed by carboplatin 400 mg/m2. If residual disease &lt;2cm at second look surgery, randomized to Arm 1) carboplatin 400 mg/m2 x5 courses vs. Arm 2) WAI 24 Gy
**'''2-years; 1993''' PMID 8445418 -- &quot;A randomized trial comparing single-agent carboplatin with carboplatin followed by radiotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer: a North Thames Ovary Group study.&quot; (Lambert HE, J Clin Oncol. 1993 Mar;11(3):440-8.)
***Outcome: Median OS 2 years, no OS or DFS difference between groups
***Toxicity: Chemo well tolerated. WAI reasonably well tolerated, but one treatment-related death from fecal fistulae
***Conclusion: No advantage to WAI over more chemo

*'''West Midlands Trial II''' (UK) -- consolidative WAI vs. chlorambucil
**Randomized. 109 patients, ovarian cancer, treated with surgery, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 x5 courses, and second look laparotomy. Then randomized to Arm 1) WAI moving strip vs. Arm 2) chlorambucil x1 year
**'''2-years; 1990''' PMID 2261388 -- &quot;A randomized trial comparing whole abdominal radiotherapy with chemotherapy following cisplatinum cytoreduction in epithelial ovarian cancer. West Midlands Ovarian Cancer Group Trial II.&quot; (Lawton F, Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1990 Jan;2(1):4-9.)
***Outcome: 2-year OS 35%, no difference between arms
***Toxicity: considerable, ~50% unable to complete treatment in both arms
***Conclusion: No indication for consolidation with WAI or chlorambucil after primary surgery and cisplatin

*'''GONA''' (Italy) -- consolidative WAI vs. chemo(type?)
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to poor outcome in WAI arm.'' 41 patients, treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and second look laparotomy. Randomized to Arm 1) more chemotherapy vs. Arm 2) WAI
**'''1990''' PMID 2227553 -- &quot;Chemotherapy versus radiotherapy in the management of ovarian cancer patients with pathological complete response or minimal residual disease at second look.&quot; (Bruzzone M, Gynecol Oncol. 1990 Sep;38(3):392-5.) Median F/U 1.8 years
***Outcome: progression WAI 55% vs. chemo 29% (SS), death 45% vs. 14%
***Conclusion: Significant advantage for chemo over WAI


===RT Technique===
*There are multiple techniques, but typically Whole Abdomen RT is given to 22.5-25 Gy, followed by boost to PA LNs and whole pelvis to 45-50.4 Gy
*Dose: 22.5-25Gy in 130-150cGy/fx.
*Simulation: Supine with Alpha cradle.
*Fields: AP/PA single fields or 4-field technique
*Blocks:
**Kidneys – 50% transmission block or block after 15Gy.
**Liver – Block at 25Gy. Block not used by some institutions.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
The '''Time ago''' template calculates the amount of time which has passed since a provided timestamp.  The result is a string similar to one of the examples below.  This template ''should not'' be used with &quot;subst&quot; unless you don't want the stamp to change as the user refreshes the page.

Note that due to Wikibooks' caching mechanisms, you may need to purge a page using this template to update the dynamic value.

=== Usage ===
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Time ago'''|''timestamp''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

The timestamp can be almost any solid, readable format but to avoid ambiguity mistakes, one of the styles below is preferred.

* &lt;code&gt;magnitude&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be set to explicitly use a certain unit. Allowed values are: &lt;code&gt;seconds&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;minutes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hours&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;days&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;weeks&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;years&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;min_magnitude&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be set to use a certain unit or bigger units. Allowed values are: &lt;code&gt;seconds&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;minutes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hours&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;days&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;years&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Examples ===
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| -83 minutes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|-83 minutes}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| -334 minutes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|-334 minutes}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago|{{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|{{REVISIONTIMESTAMP}}}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| Jan 21, 2001 3:45 PM}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|Jan 21 2001 3:45 PM}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| Nov 6 2008}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|Nov 6 2008}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| Nov 6 2008|magnitude=weeks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago| Nov 6 2008|magnitude=weeks}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| Nov 6 2008|min_magnitude=days}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|Nov 6 2008|min_magnitude=days}}'''
* &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Time ago| Nov 6 2008|min_magnitude=years}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → '''{{Time ago|Nov 6 2008|min_magnitude=years}}'''

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is a meta-template used for creating interwiki links to other sister projects of Wikibooks.  Note that links to other ''language'' Wikibooks should ''not'' use links in this form, instead use interwiki links to add them to the sidebar.  

=== Parameters ===

*{{para|text}} &amp;ndash; text of the message
*{{para|project}} &amp;ndash; the sister project to link to.  Used to select which project logo is displayed.
*{{para|below}} &amp;ndash; optional text to display in a full-width row below the main content.  Use sparingly
*{{para|position}} &amp;ndash; set to &lt;tt&gt;left&lt;/tt&gt; for a left-floating box or, ideally, pass through with {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|position={{{position|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;}} to let this be set on a per-page basis. 

===Example===
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{sister
|project=commons
|text=[[commons:Wikimedia Commons|]] has media related to: '''''[[Commons:{{{1|Special:Search/{{PAGENAME}}}}}|{{{2|{{{1|{{PAGENAME}}}}}}}}]]'''''
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sister
|project=commons
|text=[[commons:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]] has media related to: '''''[[Commons:{{{1|Special:Search/{{PAGENAME}}}}}|{{{2|{{{1|{{PAGENAME}}}}}}}}]]''''' }}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|sec link image}} template. It works like {{tl|sec link auto}}, but without any surrounding brackets. It is meant to be used for links inside images. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[File:Commons-logo.svg| link={{sec link image|commons|Special:Search}} |40x40px]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

:[[File:Commons-logo.svg| link={{sec link image|commons|Special:Search}} |40x40px]]

This template is meant to be used in pair with {{tl|sec link auto}}. Use {{tl|sec link auto}} to make a text link, and use {{tl|sec link image}} to link the image to the same target.

'''Warning!''' You may only link images that are Public Domain or owned by the Wikimedia Foundation. Almost all other images have licenses that require author attribution and a statement of what license they use, thus all other images need to keep the default linking to their image page. And you should only link the Wikimedia Foundation images to Wikimedia relevant things, like a search on another Wikimedia project.

=== Parameters ===
&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link image
| commons/wikt/en/de/...   &lt;!--Project prefix--&gt;
| Pagename
| lang = en/de/ru/...
| query = a=1&amp;b=2
| anchor = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

See {{tl|sec link auto}} for a detailed description of the parameters. But this template doesn't use the &quot;text&quot; and &quot;padlock=no/yes&quot; parameters.

This is the {{tl|sec link}} template.

It creates a secure link. The link can be local or to any other Wikimedia project. It can for instance link to Wiktionary or the Portuguese Wikipedia. 

Secure links go through the Wikimedia secure server, so they give you an encrypted connection between your browser and the Wikimedia servers.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases you should instead use {{tl|sec link auto}}. That one creates a secure link only if the user is already using the secure server, otherwise it makes a normal link. For other secure link templates see the [[#See also|see also]] section below.

=== Usage ===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link| project | Pagename | text | lang = de }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This templates takes one or more parameters: 
* The first is the prefix of the Wikimedia project you want to link to. For instance &quot;wiktionary&quot; or &quot;wikt&quot; for Wiktionary, and &quot;de&quot; for the German Wikipedia. This parameter must always be fed. For the complete list of prefixes see [[Special:SiteMatrix]] and {{sec link|meta|Wikibooks/Table|meta:Wikibooks/Table}}.
* The second parameter is the full pagename you want to link to, such as &quot;User:Example&quot; or &quot;São Paulo&quot;. If this parameter is omitted then this template links to the main page of the project.
* The third parameter is the text that will be visible as the link. If this parameter is omitted the link address is instead shown.
* There is also a named parameter &quot;lang=&quot;. This parameter is usually not used. It takes a language prefix such as &quot;de&quot; or &quot;pt&quot;. This enables to link to for instance the German version of Wiktionary. If this parameter is omitted, then this template links to the same language on the other project as you are on here. So if on the English Wikipedia, and you link to Wiktionary, per default you get a link to the English Wiktionary.

Here's some examples:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| commons }}

{{sec link| wikt }}

{{sec link| de }}

{{sec link| pt }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| commons }}

{{sec link| wikt }}

{{sec link| de }}

{{sec link| pt }}

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| commons | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| wikt | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| de | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| commons | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| wikt | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| de | São Paulo }}

{{sec link| pt | São Paulo }}


&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| pt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wikipedia. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| pt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wikipedia. }}


&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| wikt | São Paulo | lang=pt }}

{{sec link| lang=pt | wikt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wiktionary. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| wikt | São Paulo | lang=pt }}

{{sec link| lang=pt | wikt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wiktionary. }}

In the above example we fed &quot;lang=pt&quot; before the other parameters. That is okay since named parameters don't interfere with the numbering of unnamed parameters.

This template can of course also create a secure link to the same project as it currently is used on. For instance, even if already on the English Wikipedia this works:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| en | | Secure link to the main page of the English Wikipedia }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| en | | Secure link to the main page of the English Wikipedia }}

=== Anchors and queries ===
This template can also handle anchors and query parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| en | Template:Sec link | anchor = See also }}

{{sec link| en | Special:Search | query = search=secure+server&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1 }}

{{sec link| de | Wikipedia:Spielwiese | query = action=edit | Edit the German Wikipedia's sandbox }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{sec link| en | Template:Sec link | anchor = See also }}

{{sec link| en | Special:Search | query = search=secure+server&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1 }}

{{sec link| de | Wikipedia:Spielwiese | query = action=edit | Edit the German Wikipedia's sandbox }}

When feeding query parameters you must manually change any spaces &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to plus signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But feed anchors unchanged.

=== The padlock ===
The small padlock is automatically added to all https links by the global CSS in all Wikimedia projects. This template does not suppress that, since it makes it clearer it is a secure link. But if you want to suppress the padlock, then there are two ways. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| padlock=no | pt | São Paulo }}

&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;
{{sec link| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{sec link| padlock=no | pt | São Paulo }}

&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;
{{sec link| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/span&gt;

Using &quot;&lt;code&gt;padlock=no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is easier for a single link. But when having many links then surrounding the whole area with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; can be more convenient. 

Many templates such as the mboxes, navboxes and infoboxes use the &quot;plainlinks&quot; class since it also prevents the external link icon [[File:External.png|10x10px]]. Thus when this template is used inside such boxes it looses the padlock. Then you can turn on the padlock like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link| padlock=yes | pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link| padlock=yes | pt | São Paulo }}

=== Technical details ===
When you are connected to the secure server, then most local links in a project is automatically secure links. But hardcoded links and links to other projects are unfortunately not auto-changed to secure links. With this template you can work around that.

This template doesn't handle the &quot;[[bugzilla:]]&quot; prefix, since it already points to a secure server.

Some languages on Wikisource don't have their own language project, instead they are pages under the main &quot;{{sec link| oldwikisource }}&quot; address. For instance the Afrikaans main page on Wikisourse is not &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link|wikisource|lang=af}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, but instead &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link|oldwikisource|Tuisblad}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

This template internally uses the sub-templates {{tl|sec link/relative url}} and {{tl|sec link/text}}.

This is the {{tl|sec link auto}} template. It can be used to link to any wikimedia project while using the type of connection the user prefers. It is mostly meant to replace hardcoded external links to wikimedia projects such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example?action=history Example history]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, because these links don't change to reflect the user's preference, like the normal wikilink notation &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; automatically does. If you want to use a link that forces ''all'' users to use a secure connection, then use {{tl|sec link}} instead. For other secure link templates see the [[#See also|see also]] section below.

=== Usage ===

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link auto| project | Pagename | text | lang = de }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This templates takes one or more parameters: 
* The first is the prefix of the Wikimedia project you want to link to. For instance &quot;wiktionary&quot; or &quot;wikt&quot; for Wiktionary, and &quot;de&quot; for the German Wikipedia. This parameter must always be fed. For the complete list of prefixes see [[Special:SiteMatrix]] and {{sec link auto|meta|Wikibooks/Table}}.
* The second parameter is the full pagename you want to link to, such as &quot;User:Example&quot; or &quot;São Paulo&quot;. If this parameter is omitted then this template links to the main page of the project.
* The third parameter is the text that will be visible as the link. If this parameter is omitted the link address is instead shown.
* There is also a named parameter &quot;lang=&quot;. This parameter is usually not used. It takes a language prefix such as &quot;de&quot; or &quot;pt&quot;. This enables to link to for instance the German version of Wiktionary. If this parameter is omitted, then this template links to the same language on the other project as you are on here. So if on the English Wikipedia, and you link to Wiktionary, per default you get a link to the English Wiktionary.

To compare how the links on this page look and behave when using the secure server, follow this link: {{sec link| en | Template:Sec link auto | &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link auto}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

And here's some examples:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| commons }}

{{sec link auto| wikt }}

{{sec link auto| de }}

{{sec link auto| pt }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| commons }}

{{sec link auto| wikt }}

{{sec link auto| de }}

{{sec link auto| pt }}


&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| commons | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| wikt | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| de | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| commons | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| wikt | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| de | São Paulo }}

{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo }}


&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wikipedia. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wikipedia. }}


&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| wikt | São Paulo | lang=pt }}

{{sec link auto| lang=pt | wikt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wiktionary. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| wikt | São Paulo | lang=pt }}

{{sec link auto| lang=pt | wikt | São Paulo | São Paulo, in the Portuguese Wiktionary. }}

In the above example we fed &quot;lang=pt&quot; before the other parameters. That is okay since named parameters don't interfere with the numbering of unnamed parameters.

=== Anchors and queries ===
This template can also handle anchors and query parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| en | Template:Sec link auto | anchor = See also }}

{{sec link auto| en | Special:Search | query = search=secure+server&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1 }}

{{sec link auto| de | Wikipedia:Spielwiese | query = action=edit | Edit the German Wikipedia's sandbox }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{sec link auto| en | Template:Sec link auto | anchor = See also }}

{{sec link auto| en | Special:Search | query = search=secure+server&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns4=1&amp;ns5=1 }}

{{sec link auto| de | Wikipedia:Spielwiese | query = action=edit | Edit the German Wikipedia's sandbox }}

When feeding query parameters you must manually change any spaces &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to plus signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But feed anchors unchanged.

=== The padlock ===
When these links are seen from the secure server, then they all have a small padlock[[File:Lock icon blue.gif|16x13px]]. That padlock is automatically added to all https links by the global CSS in all Wikimedia projects. This template does not suppress that, since it makes it clearer when it is a secure link. 

But if you want to suppress the padlock, then there are two ways. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| padlock=no | pt | São Paulo }}

&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;
{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{sec link auto| padlock=no | pt | São Paulo }}

&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;
{{sec link auto| pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/span&gt;

Using &quot;&lt;code&gt;padlock=no&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is easier for a single link. But when having many links then surrounding the whole area with &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; can be more convenient. 

Many templates such as the mboxes, navboxes and infoboxes use the &quot;plainlinks&quot; class since it also prevents the external link icon [[File:External.png|10x10px]]. Thus when this template is used inside such boxes it looses the padlock. Then you can turn on the padlock like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| padlock=yes | pt | São Paulo }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{sec link auto| padlock=yes | pt | São Paulo }}

Note: You will only see a padlock in the above example if you {{sec link| en | {{FULLPAGENAME}} | view this page }} from the secure server, since this template only makes secure links if you already are using the secure server.

=== Technical details ===
When you are connected to the secure server, then most local links in a project is automatically secure links. But hardcoded links and links to other projects are unfortunately not auto-changed to secure links. With this template you can work around that.

This template doesn't handle the &quot;[[bugzilla:]]&quot; prefix, since it already points to a secure server.

Some languages on Wikisource don't have their own language project, instead they are pages under the main &quot;{{sec link auto| oldwikisource }}&quot; address. For instance the Afrikaans main page on Wikisourse is not &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link auto|wikisource|lang=af}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, but instead &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sec link auto|oldwikisource|Tuisblad}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

This template internally uses the sub-templates {{tl|sec link/relative url}} and {{tl|sec link/text}}. Those sub-templates are also used by its sister templates.

This is the {{tl|sec link/text}} sub-template.

Do not use this template directly, use {{tl|sec link}} or {{tl|sec link auto}} and their sister templates instead.

This template is called from the {{tl|sec link}} family of templates. 

=== Technical details ===
This sub-template returns the text (caption) for a link. It expects these parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{sec link/text
| project = 
| pagename =
| text =  
| lang = 
| query = 
| anchor = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If &quot;text&quot; is fed it simply returns that, otherwise it builds the proper default text by using the other parameters.

For more documentation see {{tl|sec link}}.

== Usage ==
This template is for giving examples of [[Wikipedia:Template messages|template]] parameter source code (useful in template documentation and talk page discussions of template code).  It must have one or two parameters itself. The first is the name of the example parameter to display (this may be ''empty'', but it '''must''' be ''present''), and the second (optional) one is a value for the first example parameter, or (if the first {{tl|para}} parameter is empty) an unnamed example parameter.

===Examples===
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|name}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|name}}
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|title|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;book title&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|title|&lt;var&gt;book title&lt;/var&gt;}}
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|3=section|2=&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para||section}}
#:(for unnamed parameters in the example code; note the empty first parameter in the {{tlx|para}} template)
#&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{tlx|para|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;parameter&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;|&amp;lt;var&amp;gt;value&amp;lt;/var&amp;gt;}}
#:renders as
#:{{para|&lt;var&gt;parameter&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;}}

When using literal, pre-specified values, simply provide the value (appearance as in example 3). When illustrating hypothetical, variable or user-definable values, use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;var&gt;value&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (appearance as in example 2), and the same should be done for non-literal, example parameters (as in example 4).

{{tl|Listen}}} allows audio files to be embedded in articles. It should be used for audio files that are set off from the text, like music clips or sound recordings.

== Simple usage ==

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename     = 
| title        = 
| description  = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

*'''filename''' ''(Required)'': the pagename of the media file, ''without'' the File: (formerly Image:) prefix
*'''title''' ''(Required)'': the title of the audio file, to be displayed
*'''description''': a description of the audio file

=== Multiple files ===
Additional files can be embedded in an article with one template by appending a number to each parameter. Up to ten files can be included.

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename     = 
| title        = 
| alt          = 
| description  = 
| filename2    = 
| title2       = 
| alt2         = 
| description2 = 
| filename3    = 
| title3       = 
| alt3         = 
| description3 = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

*'''filename''' ''(Required)'': the pagename of the media file, ''without'' the File: (formerly Image:) prefix
*'''title''' ''(Required)'': the title of the audio file, to be displayed
*'''alt''': alt text for the image displayed for the file, for visually impaired readers. This is needed for file formats such as Ogg's &lt;code&gt;.ogv&lt;/code&gt; format that include video as well as sound. The alt text should describe just the initial static image, not the entire video or its sound.
*'''description''': a description of the audio file

== Style parameters ==

The template also takes a number of style parameters to control its appearance:

*'''type''': can be used to alter the image displayed at the left depending on the type of audio content being embedded.  Acceptable values are '''sound''', '''speech''' and '''music''' (default)
*'''header''': can be used to add a header to the box.
*'''help''': if set {{para|help|no}}, suppresses the help text that normally appears at the bottom of the box.  Only do this if there are other audio files on the page which ''do'' have the help link; it ''must'' be provided on at least the first file on the article.
*'''pos''': by default the box floats to the right side of the screen.  Setting this to '''left''' will cause the box to instead float on the left-hand side.
*'''image''': define a different image.  E.g. {{nowrap|{{para|image|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Example.jps|20px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}}}.  You can set {{para|image|none}} to disable the image entirely.
*'''style''': can be used to pass specific style instructions to the box. Setting this to '''float:none''' will anchor the box when this is convenient.  Setting this to '''float:none; clear:none''' will enable the anchored box to co-exist gracefully beside another floating box.
*'''play#''': some media files cannot be displayed inline; if this is the case set {{para|play|no}} to prevent the broken inline link from displaying.
*'''plain''': if set {{para|plain|yes}}, removes most of the ornamentation (table border, image, and help links) to give a minimalist version. This also removes the left/right float and positioning, to allow the box to be manually positioned as desired using the {{para|style}} (e.g. {{Para|style|float:right}}) parameter and surrounding markup.

== Examples ==
; Basic example:

{{ listen
| filename     = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title        = Accordion chords
| description  = Chords being played on an accordion
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename     = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title        = Accordion chords
| description  = Chords being played on an accordion
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{-}}

; Example with video:

{{Listen
 |header=Inaugural Address
 |filename=Barack Obama inaugural address.ogv
 |alt=A black man in a black coat gestures and talks at a lecturn surrounded by teleprompters. Behind him, in the background, are about a dozen warmly-dressed onlookers.
 |title=Inaugural address of Barack Obama
 |description=Barack Obama delivers his inaugural address on January 20, 2009.&lt;br&gt;(Duration: 21 minutes, 21 seconds)
 |help=no
 |type=sound
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{Listen
 |header=Inaugural Address
 |filename=Barack Obama inaugural address.ogv
 |alt=A black man in a black coat gestures and talks at a lecturn surrounded by teleprompters. Behind him, in the background, are about a dozen warmly-dressed onlookers.
 |title=Inaugural address of Barack Obama
 |description=Barack Obama delivers his inaugural address on January 20, 2009.&lt;br&gt;(Duration: 21 minutes, 21 seconds)
 |help=no
 |type=sound
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{-}}

; Example with header:

{{ listen
| filename     = Frase de Neil Armstrong.ogg
| title        = &quot;One small step for a man...&quot;
| description  = First words spoken on the moon.
| type         = speech
| pos          = left
| header       = Recordings of this phrase:
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename     = Frase de Neil Armstrong.ogg
| title        = &quot;One small step for a man...&quot;
| description  = First words spoken on the moon.
| type         = speech
| pos          = left
| header       = Recordings of this phrase:
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{-}}

; Plain example:

{{ listen
| filename = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title    = Accordion chords
| plain    = yes
| style    = float:left
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title    = Accordion chords
| plain    = yes
| style    = float:left
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{-}}

; Multiple files:

{{ listen
| filename     = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title        = Accordion chords
| description  = Chords being played on an accordion
| type         = music
| filename2    = Moonlight.ogg
| title2       = ''Moonlight Sonata''
| description2 = Beethoven's &quot;Sonata in C-sharp minor&quot;
| filename3    = Au_clair_de_la_lune_mode_do.mid
| title3       = Au Clair de la Lune
| description3 = The traditional French children's song
| play3        = no
}}

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto&quot;&gt;
{{ listen
| filename     = Accordion chords-01.ogg
| title        = Accordion chords
| description  = Chords being played on an accordion
| type         = music
| filename2    = Moonlight.ogg
| title2       = ''Moonlight Sonata''
| description2 = Beethoven's &quot;Sonata in C-sharp minor&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Template:Multi-listen''' links to several audio files.  It is meant to be used for groups of audio files set off from the text, like music clips or sound recordings.  To apply it in an article use the following:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{multi-listen start}}
{{multi-listen item|filename=name_of_file_1_on_commons.ogg|title=Title of this file|description=The description of this file|format=Ogg}}
{{multi-listen item|filename=name_of_file_2_on_commons.ogg|title=Title of this file|description=The description of this file|format=Ogg}}
{{multi-listen item|filename=name_of_file_3_on_commons.ogg|title=Title of this file|description=The description of this file|format=Ogg}}
{{multi-listen end}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

For instance: 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{multi-listen start}}
{{multi-listen item
|filename    = Kimi ga Yo 1930.ogg
|title       = '''1880''' – Kimi ga Yo
|description = 1930 recording of the Japanese national anthem, Kimi ga Yo. Includes both the vocal and instrumental parts.
|format      = Ogg
}}
{{multi-listen item
|filename    = Skye Boat Song.ogg
|title       = '''1884''' – The Skye Boat Song
|description = An adaptation of the Skye Boat Song for bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.
|format      = Ogg
}}
{{multi-listen item
|filename=Enrico Caruso - Geraldine Farrar - Jules Massenet - Manon - On L'appelle Manon.ogg
|title='''1884''' – ''Manon'': &quot;Manon! avez-vous peur...On l'appelle Manon&quot;
|description=1912 recording by Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar of a scene from Act II of Jules Massenet's ''Manon'' (1884).
|format=Ogg
}}
{{multi-listen end}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

is rendered like this:

{{multi-listen start}}
{{multi-listen item
|filename    = Kimi ga Yo 1930.ogg
|title       = '''1880''' – Kimi ga Yo
|description = 1930 recording of the Japanese national anthem, Kimi ga Yo. Includes both the vocal and instrumental parts.
|format      = Ogg
}}
{{multi-listen item
|filename    = Skye Boat Song.ogg
|title       = '''1884''' – The Skye Boat Song
|description = An adaptation of the Skye Boat Song for bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.

&lt;!--PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE--&gt;

== Purpose ==
This template links to an audio file for quick listening.  It is meant to be used inline with text, for pronunciations and the like.

== Usage ==
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Audio|name of sound file|text to use as link to soundfile}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Example:

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Paris''' ({{Audio|Fr-Paris.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the capital city of France.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

gives this:

:'''Paris''' ({{Audio|Fr-Paris.ogg|pronunciation}}) is the capital city of France.

Note that a printout of the page will remove the &quot;help·info&quot; bit and give:

:'''Paris''' (&lt;span class=&quot;unicode audiolink&quot;&gt;[[:Media:Fr-Paris.ogg|pronunciation]]&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is the capital city of France.

Setting {{para|help|no}} disables the &quot;help/info&quot; links. If this is done the template {{tl|inline audio}} ''must'' be shown on the page.

== See also ==
* {{tl|Listen}}, which sets an audio clip off from the main text.
* {{tl|Multi-listen start}}, {{tl|Multi-listen item}}, and {{tl|Multi-listen end}}, templates used to list multiple audio files in the same box

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Section 1: The Importance of Chemistry ==

So many of the luxuries we have become accustomed to today would not have been possible without recent advancements in the physical sciences, namely Chemistry. One must think of all the super strong adhesives, fibers, and building materials that are used everyday in construction, and production. Without an understanding of Chemistry, the development of these materials, in addition to the development of things like prescription drugs, would never have been possible. And while these advents are useful and interesting to the layman, an understanding of Chemistry is even more vital for an aspiring scientist. The applications that chemistry has to all scientific disciplines are enumerable. For example, it is an understanding of the behavior of '''matter''' on a small scale that allows chemical engineers to design and produce the interesting systems that run our world's infastructure.

Chemistry, as a science, studies the composition and properties of matter. Chemistry also studies the reactions between different chemicals, known as ''chemical reactions''. Basic chemical reactions are always going on around us as well as a more complex system of reactions, even just within our bodies. For example, as anyone sits down at his computer and begins to type, his body undergoes a huge amount of chemical reactions to make his eyes and hands move, and to make his brain think. This is an example of the Chemistry of biological processes. Some chemists study these biological processes, while others may study different things. In general, all chemists do the following:
*Chemists try to understand how the composition of substances affect the substance's properties. 
*Chemists seek to understand why and how substances change within chemical reactions.
*Chemists try to understand and observe the underlying structure of matter.
*Chemists attempt to understand why the properties that we observe with our senses occur in matter.


Of course, taking a first class in Chemistry does not mean you are going to become a chemist. However, Chemistry is useful in all branches of science. Even for a non science major, chemistry can improve one's understanding of the world around them, and in my experience, can help you win some arguments. Chemistry is used in Physics, Biology, Engineering, Electronics, Pharmaceuticals etc. So you know what chemists do, in a very general sense. So you may be wondering why chemistry is so important to all of the sciences. The answer is that all things are composed of chemicals. This includes your hair, your water, your computer, and your dinner. Even living things are composed entirely of chemicals. You may already know this, and say &quot;duhh&quot;, but think of the implications this has. Everything you know is made of matter, and contains chemicals that are able to participate in complex reactions. You can see why Chemistry is such a deep field of study. So, while scientific disciplines may have varying interests, they all use chemistry, and today the lines between Physics, Biology, and Chemistry are more hazy than ever.

; Matter : Matter can be defined as anything that has '''Mass''' and also takes up space (has '''volume''').
; Mass : Mass is a measure of the amount of matter an object contains. Mass is often thought to be the same as weight, but it is not. Weight refers to the force of which an object of a particular mass is attracted by gravitational forces. We will discuss mass more formally later. An easy way to understand this concept is that weight is gravity dependent, while mass is gravity independent.
; Volume : Volume can be thought of as the amount of 3-dimensional space occupied by an object.

== Pachadi ==

This is a very popular dish from the Kerala region of India. Its quick to prepare and a very tasty accompaniment to main course of rice or roti


== Ingredients ==
(Serves 4)
* 1 cucumber (large variety, with dark green and yellow skin)
* 1/2 cup grated coconut
* 1 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
* 1 tsp mustard seeds
* 1 or 2 dried red chillies
* 1 tbsp oil
* Salt according to taste

== Procedure ==
* Skin the cucumber. Cut in half along the length and remove the central core of seeds.
* Grate the cucumber. Alternatively, cut into very small pieces.
* Cook the cucumber in the microwave for about 4-5 min.
* Meanwhile, make a fine paste from the grated coconut and the cumin seeds
* In a deep dish (kadhai), heat the oil. Add the mustard seeds and red chillies. Let it splutter.
* Add the cooked cucumber and the coconut paste and salt to taste. Mix well and let it cook on slow fire. Do not allow it to boil. It just needs to be warmed. 
* As the mixture starts to boil, take it off the stove. 

Its ready to be served.</text>

The switch to ambox caused several formatting anomalies on various transcluding pages, so I reverted.  It isn't immediately obvious exactly what was causing the anomalies &amp;mdash; I'm thinking there may ''be'' a common cause even though the anomalies didn't really look all that similar to each other &amp;mdash; and I don't relish trying to track it down.  (I also, personally, dislike the look of ambox for the purpose, but that's a separate matter.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:20, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

The mbox-side -&gt; mbox dependency is a problem; countless templates that might be useful at Wikibooks can't be easily imported because the mbox here has been altered so heavily.  I think you may be using an old version of the Common.css.  If the box at right doesn't look very similar to what's on the main page of this template, then that is why you didn't see what I saw. If you look at the code, yes it requires defining some styles; maybe those styles should be updated on mbox-side instead (just calling ambox instead of mbox so it can be updated). -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:40, 23 April 2010 (UTC)


It appears to me that something quite subtle is going on &amp;mdash; subtlety of the sort that I generally deal with by finding ways not to have to deal with it, because that way lies madness.  The ambox you've shown above ''does'' look very similar to what's now in the template... but what it does &quot;in the field&quot; is another matter.  Here are three examples to illustrate the differences I'm seeing.  These aren't going to come out quite right, because (in a known but unexplained anomaly), the color on the left-hand border doesn't appear on talk pages.  (And they're going to take up rather a lot of space on this page...)

What the images on the Conlang page look like, under the mbox-side version:
{| align=right
|
[[File:Conlangflag.svg|right|border|280px|The Conlang Flag is a symbol of conlanging, designed by the community at the CONLANG mailing list.  It depicts the [[w:Tower of Babel|Tower of Babel]] against a rising sun.  Like the Tower, conlangs are built piece by piece, and their construction is an open-ended process.]]

What the the images on the Conlang page look like when the mbox-side version is replaced by an ambox version:

A variant using the ambox, with wiki table markup to force the two boxes to stack vertically:
{| align=right
| rowspan=2 |
[[File:Conlangflag.svg|right|border|280px|The Conlang Flag is a symbol of conlanging, designed by the community at the CONLANG mailing list.

|text=

}}
|}
Interestingly, the horizontal mismatch between those two right-hand boxes is ''not'' due to the fact that the blue bar shows on the ambox but not on the mbox-side:  even on the Conlang page, when I switched the template over and put this table mechanism in place, the left-hand sides misaligned this way.  My guess is that this misalignment is related to the overlapping-with-adjacent-text that I observed at Conhistory.
{{clr}}
(A general observation about the whole incompatible-mbox issue:  If the current WB mbox is incompatible with what's expected by templates elsewhere, then the mbox used elsewhere is likely just as incompatible with what's expected here.  The problems, in both directions, are likely to be many and very subtle.  It ''might'' make sense to rename WB's mbox to a different name, laboriously change ''everything'' to use the different name, and then when ''nothing'' likes to Template:MBox, bring in the uncustomized version.

--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:17, 23 April 2010 (UTC)

Adding a clear:right; takes care of the floating issue but not the horizontal position.  Current template using Mbox have to have two things change such that they Mbox doesn't have to be renamed: the msg parameter changed to text (I've added code to Mbox to take either at this point) and the use of the full image notation with size included (something that would have to be done after Mbox is updated.  In many cases that can be avoided by having a template use cmbox/ombox/ambox, not all of which existed here until recently (ambox is very similar to the current mbox except, as you've proven, when it comes to the above).  The updated mbox actually just calls one of those based on the namespace; for templates only used in a particular namespace, they are able to call a *box directly. I brought in the relevant code from Mbox to Mbox-side so that the templates can evolve independently.  Mbox-side doesn't exist at any other project so I don't foresee any conflicts. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:15, 23 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Writing Conventions/How to read this Book ==

=== Book Organization ===

This book is divided into Chapters, which are further divided into sections. The section pages are those which contain the content for reading. The book page contains the complete table of contents, while each chapter page contains the table of contents only for that chapter. Given this explanation, navigation should be self explanatory using the small links in the top left. However, additional navigation capabilities will be added in the future to make things even easier.

=== Definition of key terms ===

When key terms appear in the text they are denoted in one of two ways.
*If the key term is defined within the text, directly before or after the term appears, then it is shown as ''italicized'' text.
*If the term is left to be formally defined at the end of the section(bottom of page), then it will be shown in '''boldface''' text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tornadoes are spawned from various thunderstorms, but more commonly the supercell. A supercell is a thunderstorm characterized by the strong updrafts, downdrafts, and windshear they contain. These are all parts of forming a tornado. Many of these things are caused by instability in the atmosphere from two airmasses colliding; one, a cold dry airmass, the other being a warm moist air mass. As the atmosphere begins to stabilize itself, this causes instability, thus resulting in the formation of wind shear and updrafts. Windshear is an upper level column of horizontally rotating air, that, when combined with an updraft, may form a tornado. Inflow, air that moves inyo or towards the base of the mesocyclone, often plays a role in the formation. This inflow feeds the storm, and brings it to intensify. A mesocyclone is a mass of rapidly rotating air, where many of natures most destructive tornadoes, such as the EF-5 are produced. This mass of rapidly rotating air can form a wall cloud, which also rotates with the rest of the storm. A wall cloud is a lowering in the clouds, and can often be identified by the rotation of this cloud, and how close to the ground it is. Sometimes, however, there are cases where the storm becomes rain wrapped, making us blind to the oncoming storm. The wall cloud is the updraft base of a storm, and where many tornadoes form.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template links to a &quot;Category:&quot; name in the [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]] repository (edited using a Wikimedia login name).  If that category name is misspelled or missing, the link will still appear &quot;blue&quot; even though the link will fail. Check spelling of names carefully.

=== Usage ===
::{|
|-
|{{tlx|Commons category}}||– puts link-box with current page's name as the category.
|-
|{{tlx|Commons category|''catnam''}}||– puts link-box connecting title ''catnam''.
|-
|{{tlx|Commons category|''catnam''|''shownam''}}||– puts link-box showing the title ''shownam''.
|-
|{{tlx|Commons category|''catnam''|3=position=left}}||– floats link-box to the left side.
|}

The two parameters ''catnam'' and ''shownam'' (1 &amp; 2) are optional, and are intended for cases where the Commons category name is different from the Wikipedia page name. The first parameter is the name of the corresponding category on the Wikimedia Commons, ''without'' the &quot;&lt;code&gt;Category:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; prefix. If this first parameter is used, then the template will display the Commons category name, which may be confusing to readers. This text can be overridden by the second parameter, where the Wikipedia page name would typically be used.

The parameter &quot;position=&quot; accepts one value, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, that moves the box to the left side, instead of the default right side. More information may be found at &lt;code&gt;{{tl|Side box}}&lt;/code&gt;.

* The optional 2nd parameter gives the displayed link text.
* The {{para|position}} parameter accepts one keyword, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, to float the box to the left instead of to the right.
* To link to a ''Category,'' use {{tlx|Commonscat|''catname''}}, where ''catname'' is the name of the category.

===Defaults===
The ''pagenam'' defaults to wiki-variable &lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{PAGENAME}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, which is the end-name of the page where used. For a Template:Txxx, the &lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/small&gt; would be the end-name &quot;Txxx&quot;. For a Category:Catxxx, that page would have &lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/small&gt; as the end-name &quot;Catxxx&quot;.

The default positioning of the link-box is to the right-side.

===Examples===
{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #808080; padding:1px;&quot;
|{{tlx|Commons}}
|}
produces
{{Commons}}
{{-}}

{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #808080; padding:1px;&quot;
|{{tlx|Commons|Reconquista}}

{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #808080; padding:1px;&quot;
|{{tlx|Commons|Reconquista|position{{=}}left}}

In this section, we will talk about angles.

==Angles==
[[Image:Geom for elem angle.svg|right|300px]]
An angle (∠) is made up of a '''vertex''' (a point), two '''arms''' (rays), and an arc. They are arranged so that the endpoint of the arms are the same as the vertex, and the arc runs from one arm to another. The size of an angle depends on how big the arms are opened, and they are measured in degrees. You can measure them by putting your protractor on the vertex and looking at the degrees your second arm has reached.

An angle that is less than 90° is known as an acute angle. A 90° angle is known as a right angle. Those between 90° and 180° are obtuse angles. Exactly 180° angles are called straight angles. Those between 180° and 360° are reflex angles, while angles at 360° are round angles

An angle is usually named by the points it contains. The format is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;∠&quot; + ''a point on one arm'' + ''vertex'' + ''a point on the other arm''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, sometimes there are no angles on that vertex, and we can omit the point on the arms. In fact, when we are lazy, we can even use a lowercase letter to represent a certain angle. Note that in this case, ∠ must be omitted. Although the lowercase letter represents the value of the angle, all of these names can be used as unknowns in equations.

'''Adjacent angles''' (adj. ∠s) are angles where:
#Their opposite arms coincide (overlap);
#Their arcs do not coincide (overlap);
#Their vertices coincide (overlap).

Sometimes, two angles may add up to 90° or 180°. They are called complementary angles and supplementary angles respectively. As many angles have such properties, these will be quite handy in the future.

==Angles at a point==
[[File:Angles at a pt.svg|right|250px]]
Sometimes, two or more angles share a common vertex, and their sizes add up to 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. They are called angles at a point (∠s at a pt.). This can be very useful when we write proofs or find out angles.

For example, imagine that ''O'' is a point in the figure. The three points, ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are around the point ''O'', and a ray shoots out of ''O'' to ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' respectively. Given that ∠AOB = 120° and ∠BOC = 150°,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\angle AOB + \angle BOC + \angle COA &amp;= 360^\circ (\angle s \text{ at a pt.})\\
120^\circ + 150^\circ + \angle COA &amp;= 360^\circ \\
\angle COA&amp;= 360^\circ - 120^\circ - 150^\circ \\
&amp;= 90^\circ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Adjacent angles on a straight line==
[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|right|300px]]
When the sizes of adjacent angles add up to 180°, they are adjacent angles on a straight line. They are used when finding out the value of one of the angles. (Or more, for that matter, when you have angles that are equal or related.) The abbreviation, adj. ∠s on st. line, can be used as a reference that the angles add up to 180°.

Look at the image on the right as an example. Here, ''b'' and ''a'' are supplementary. The sum of ''b'' and ''a'' is equal to ''c''. ''b'' and ''a'' are adjacent angles on a straight line. If we know the value of ''b'', we can find out the value of ''a'' easily. Note that ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are angles at a point.

==Vertically opposite angles==
[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|150px|right]]
Vertically opposite angles are very simple. If two straight lines run into each other, the opposite angles produced must be vertically opposite angles (vert. opp. ∠s). They must be equal to each other. Note that you cannot assume that something is a straight line just by observation, so be sure that it's mentioned in the question before you do anything. Vertically opposite angles is a very common reference and will come in handy in many situations, so before you are stuck on a problem, see if you can find some vertically opposite angles first.

Look at the figure on the right. As indicated in this figure, ''D'' is equal to ''C'' and ''A'' is equal to ''B''. This is because they are vertically opposite angles. Note that here, ''D'' and ''A'', ''A'' and ''C'', ''C'' and ''B'', and ''D'' and ''B'' are all pairs of adjacent angles on a straight line. Also, the four angles are angles at a point.

Words are power. They have power over people's minds. Behind every event which changed the course of history are words of great orators. 

This book will analyze the orators and their speeches and try to find out what makes them and their words great. 

&lt;!-- Oratory is an art of effective communication with a group of people in order to influence, entertain or motivate them. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{navigate|Prev=Fractals|Next=Glossary}}
Congratulations! You have read through your elementary school geometry areas. That does not mean that your studies of geometry are over! When you get to higher forms, you will come across more complex mathematics, such as deductive geometry. When you get to those areas, don't be afraid! Remember your basics, and anything is possible.

Now that you have finished the entire course, you may want to try out the advanced geometry course, [[Geometry]]. Although some topics may be less easy to understand, some are already covered in this book, so you will be revising some of your basics before starting on more difficult topics.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|intricate template}} message box.

{{tl|esoteric}} and {{tl|intricate}} redirect here and can be used as alternative names for this template.

Actually, ''this'' template's syntax is relatively simple.

This template can be put at the top of the documentation for any templates that are intricate, i.e., complex, using less obvious techniques, [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] syntax, combining different techniques, used as parameter for other templates, built to function for a variety of calling instances, etc. 

=== Usage ===

When this template is placed on a template's /doc page it can be nice to put it within &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags so it only gets visible on the template page. The full code for a /doc page top then can look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;includeonly&gt;{{intricate template}}&lt;/includeonly&gt;

[[Image:Prosciutto di Parma - affettato2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Prosciutto di Parma]]
'''Prosciutto'''  is an Italian word for ham. In English, the term ''prosciutto'' is almost always used for a dry-cured ham that is usually sliced thinly and served uncooked; this style is called ''prosciutto crudo'' in Italian and is distinguished from cooked ham, ''prosciutto cotto''. 

Commonly associated with Tuscany and Emilia, the most renowned and expensive legs of prosciutto come from central and northern Italy, such as those of  Parma, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and San Daniele.


==Manufacture==
[[Image:ProsciuttoSeaSalt.JPG|thumb|Sea salt being added]]
The process of making prosciutto can take anywhere from nine months to two years, depending on the size of the ham. 

Writer on Italian food Bill Buford describes talking to an old Italian butcher who says: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When I was young, there was one kind of prosciutto. It was made in the winter, by hand, and aged for two years. It was sweet when you smelled it. A profound perfume. Unmistakable. To age a prosciutto is a subtle business. If it's too warm, the aging process never begins. The meat spoils. If it's too dry, the meat is ruined. It needs to be damp but cool. The summer is too hot. In the winter&amp;mdash;that's when you make salumi. Your prosciutto. Your soppressata. Your sausages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the ham is first cleaned, salted, and left for about two months. During this time the ham is pressed, gradually and carefully to avoid breaking the bone, to drain all blood left in the meat. Next it is washed several times to remove the salt and hung in a dark, well-ventilated environment. The surrounding air is important to the final quality of the ham; the best results are obtained in a cold climate. The ham is then left until dry. The amount of time this takes varies, depending on the local climate and size of the ham. When the ham is completely dry it is hung to air, either at room temperature or in a controlled environment, for up to eighteen months.

==Use==
Sliced ''prosciutto crudo'' in Italian cuisine is often served as an antipasto, wrapped around ''grissini'' or, especially in summer, cantaloupe or honeydew.  It is eaten as accompaniment to cooked spring vegetables, such as asparagus or peas. It may be included in a simple pasta sauce made with cream, or a Tuscan dish of tagliatelle and vegetables. It is used in stuffings for other meats, such as veal, as a wrap around veal or steak, in a filled bread, or as a pizza topping.</text>

This is the {{tl|namespace detect}} meta-template.

It helps other templates detect what type of page they are on.

It detects and groups all the different namespaces used on Wikibooks into several types:

:'''main''' = Main/book space, as in normal Wikibooks pages.
:'''talk''' = Any discussion page, such as page names that start with &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on.
:'''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''subject''', '''file''', '''mediawiki''', '''template''', '''help''', '''category''', '''transwiki''', '''wikijunior,''' and '''cookbook''' = The other namespaces except the discussion pages.
:'''other''' = Any namespaces that were not specified as a parameter to the template. See explanation below.

For backwards compatibility this template also understands the old name '''image''' for '''file'''. But using '''image''' is now deprecated.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases it might be better to use the simpler namespace detection templates. (See the [[#See also|see also]] section below.) Since this template is more prone to human errors such as misspelling the parameter names. 

=== Usage ===
This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed above. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect
| main  = Book page text
| talk  = Talk page text
| other = Other pages text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a main (book) page, it will return this:

:{{namespace detect| demospace=main
| main  = Book page text
| talk  = Talk page text
| other = Other pages text
}}

If the template is on any other page than a book or a talk page it will return this:

:{{namespace detect
| main  = Book page text
| talk  = Talk page text
| other = Other pages text
}}

The example above made the template return something for all page types. But if we don't use the '''other''' parameter or leave it empty then it will not return anything for the other page types. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect
| file     = File page text
| category = Category page text
| other    =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

On any pages other than file and category pages the code above will render nothing.
&lt;!-- Do not remove this one. It is supposed to render nothing, but we have it here for testing purposes. --&gt;
:{{namespace detect
| file     = File page text
| category = Category page text
| other    =
}}

By using an empty parameter you can make it so the template doesn't render anything for some specific page type. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect
| main  = 
| other = Other pages text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code above will render nothing when on mainspace (article) pages, but will return this when on other pages:

:{{namespace detect
| main  = 
| other = Other pages text
}}

=== Demospace and page ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take two parameters named '''demospace''' and '''page'''. 

Demospace understands any of the page type names used by this template, including the '''other''' type. It tells the template to behave like it is on some specific type of page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect 
| main  = Book page text
| other = Other pages text
| demospace = main
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{namespace detect 
| main  = Book page text
| other = Other pages text
| demospace = main
}}

The '''page''' parameter instead takes a normal pagename. It makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect 
| user  = User page text
| other = Other pages text
| page = User:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{namespace detect 
| user  = User page text
| other = Other pages text
| page = User:Example
}}

It can be convenient to let your template understand the demospace and/or page parameter and send it on to the {{tl|namespace detect}} template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect 
| main  = Book page text
| other = Other pages text
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
| page  = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If both the '''demospace''' and '''page''' parameters are empty or undefined then the template will detect page types as usual.

=== Parameters ===

List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect
| main  = 
...
| other =
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}} / main / talk / user / subject
              wikibooks/ file / mediawiki / template / transwiki
              help / category / wikijunior / cookbook / other
| page  = {{{page|}}} / User:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
Namespace &quot;Image&quot; was renamed to &quot;File&quot; on 11 December 2008. This template was updated to understand both names well before that, thus it still works fine. For backwards compatibility it still understands &quot;image&quot; both as a parameter name, such as &quot;image = File page text&quot;, and as a value &quot;demospace = image&quot;.

If you intend to feed tables as content to the numbered parameters of this template, then you need to know this:

[[Help:Template|Templates]] do have a problem handling parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Templates|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Tables|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the {{tl|!}} template. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

This is the {{tl|namespace detect see also}} template.

It is used in the &quot;See also&quot; section of the documentation of the namespace-detection templates. It takes no parameters.

If you update this template, then you should probably also update {{tl|pagename detect see also}}. That template holds almost the same list of templates, but with the pagename-detection templates at the top.

This is the {{tl|cookbook other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;Cookbook:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cookbook other | Cookbook page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Cookbook:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{cookbook other | demospace=cookbook | Cookbook page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{cookbook other | Cookbook page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on Cookbook pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cookbook other | [[Category:Some Cookbook category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cookbook other | | This template should only be used on Cookbook pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;book&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''cookbook''' it returns the Cookbook page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cookbook other 
| Cookbook page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = cookbook
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{cookbook other 
| Cookbook page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = cookbook
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{cookbook other 
| Cookbook page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Cookbook talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

This is the {{tl|wikijunior other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;Wikijunior:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikijunior other | Wikijunior page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Wikiunior:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{wikijunior other | demospace=wikijunior | Wikijunior page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{wikijunior other | Wikijunior page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on portal pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikijunior other | [[Category:Some Wikijunior category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikijunior other | | This template should only be used on Wikijunior pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;wikijunior&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''wikijunior''' it returns the Wikijunior page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikijunior other 
| Wikijunior page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = portal
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{wikijunior other 
| Wikijunior page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = portal
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikijunior other 
| Wikijunior page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Wikijunior talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|wikibooks other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikibooks other | Wikibooks page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{wikibooks other | demospace=wikibooks| Wikibooks page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{wikibooks other | Wikibooks page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikibooks other | [[Category:Some Wikibooks project category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikibooks other | | This template should only be used on &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;wikibooks&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''wikibooks''' it returns the Wikibooks page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikibooks other 
| Wikibooks page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = wikibooks
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{wikibooks other 
| Wikibooks page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = wikibooks
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikibooks other 
| Wikibooks page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Wikibooks talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

This is the {{tl|subject other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;Subject:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{subject other | Subject page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Subject:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{subject other | demospace=subject | Subject page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{subject other | Subject page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on &quot;Subject:&quot; pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{subject other | [[Category:Some Subject category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{subject other | | This template should only be used on &quot;Subject:&quot; pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;subject&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''subject''' it returns the Wikipedia page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{subject other 
| Subject page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = subject
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{subject other 
| Subject page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = subject
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{subject other 
| Subject page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Subject talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This is the {{tl|main talk other}} meta-template.

This template is used inside other templates that need to behave differently (usually look differently) depending on what type of page they are on. It detects and groups all the different namespaces used on Wikibooks into three types:

:'''main''' = Main/book space, as in normal Wikibooks pages.
:'''talk''' = Any talk space, such as page names that start with &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on.
:'''other''' = All other spaces, such as page names that start with &quot;User:&quot;, &quot;File:&quot;, &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; and so on.

=== Basic usage ===
This template usually takes three parameters, and returns one of them depending on which type a page belongs to. Like this:

:{{tlx|main talk other|Book text|Talk page text|Other pages text}}

If the template is on a main space (book) page, it will return this:

:{{main talk other|demospace=main|Book text|Talk page text|Other pages text}}

If the template is on any talk page, it will return this:

:{{main talk other|demospace=talk|Book text|Talk page text|Other pages text}}

If the template is on any other page (such as this template page and its doc page), it will return this:

:{{main talk other|Book text|Talk page text|Other pages text}}

If you only feed a parameter for one or two of the types then this template returns an empty string for the rest of the types. That is, if it for instance is used in one of these ways:

:{{tlx|main talk other||Talk text}}
:{{tlx|main talk other||Talk text|}}

Then it doesn't render anything in mainspace and other space.

:{{main talk other||Talk text|}}   &lt;!-- Don't remove this line. It is supposed to render nothing. But leave it so we see if it fails. --&gt;

If this template is used without any parameters or only fed empty parameters (empty strings), then it returns an empty string. That is, then it renders nothing.

:{{main talk other}}   &lt;!-- Don't remove this line. It is supposed to render nothing. But leave it so we see if it fails. --&gt;

For testing and demonstration purposes these templates can take a parameter named '''demospace''': if it has any of the values '''main''', '''talk''' or '''other''' it makes the template behave as if it is on a page of that type; if the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

=== Usage example ===
This example creates a message box, but these templates can of course be used for many other things than message boxes. This example uses numbered parameters and HTML tables, for the reasons why see the [[#Technical details|technical details section]] below.

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main talk other
| 1 = ''This messagebox should not be used in articles.''
| 2 = {{tmbox|text=Talk page notice}}
| 3 = {{ombox|text=Other pages notice}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which renders like this:

{{main talk other
| 1 = ''This messagebox should not be used in books.''
| 2 = {{tmbox|text=Talk page notice}}
| 3 = {{ombox|text=Other pages notice}}
}}

Let's see how it looks on talk pages. So we change the first line in the code to this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main talk other|demospace=talk
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is how it will render on any talk page:

{{main talk other|demospace=talk
| 1 = ''This messagebox should not be used in books.''
| 2 = {{tmbox|text=Talk page notice}}
| 3 = {{ombox|text=Other pages notice}}
}}

And now let's test it for book pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main talk other|demospace=main
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is how it will render in a book:

{{main talk other|demospace=main
| 1 = ''This messagebox should not be used in books.''
| 2 = {{tmbox|text=Talk page notice}}
| 3 = {{ombox|text=Other pages notice}}
}}

===== Additional code =====
Too make this example complete, here is the rest of the code that is needed to make it a fully equipped template:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main talk other
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
| 1 = 
| 2 = 
| 3 = 
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;

{{documentation}}
&lt;!-- Add categories and interwikis to the /doc subpage, not here! --&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The line &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; means that your template also will understand the demospace parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template.

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{documentation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; template creates a green [[Template:Documentation|documentation]] box, like the one you are reading in right now.

=== Technical details ===
===== Numbered parameters and HTML tables =====
Templates have a problem handling parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters, such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;1=First&amp;nbsp;parameter&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;2=Second&amp;nbsp;parameter&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

[[Help:Templates|Templates]] also have a problem handling parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Templates|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Tables|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the {{tl|!}} template. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|namespace detect showall}} meta-template.

It helps other templates detect what type of page they are on. It is an extended version of {{tl|namespace detect}}.

This template detects and groups all the different namespaces used on Wikibooks into several types:

:'''main''' = Main/book space, as in normal Wikibooks pages.
:'''talk''' = Any talk space, such as page names that start with &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on.
:'''user, wikibooks, subject, file, mediawiki, template, help, category, wikijunior,''' and '''cookbook''' = The other namespaces except the talk pages.
:'''other''' = Any namespaces that were not specified as a parameter to the template. See explanation below.

'''Note!''' For most usage cases it might be better to use the simpler namespace detection templates. (See the [[#See also|see also]] section below.) Since this template is more prone to human errors such as misspelling the parameter names. 

=== Usage ===
This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed above. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| 3 = Other pages text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 3
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a main (book) page, it will return this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| 3 = Other pages text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 3
| demospace = main
}}

If the template is on any ''other'' page than a book or a talk page it will return this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| 3 = Other pages text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 3
}}

Since we feed the data to the numbered parameters we can reuse the same data on several types of pages. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = File (image) and category text.
| 3 = Other pages text.
| main     = 1
| file     = 2
| category = 2
| other    = 3
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

By using an empty parameter you can make it so the template doesn't render anything for some specific page type, instead of returning what was fed to the '''other''' parameter. (Notice that the '''main''' parameter doesn't get any data in the example below.) Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = File (image) page text.
| 2 = Other pages text.
| main  = 
| file  = 1
| other = 2
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code above will render nothing when on mainspace (book) pages. 
&lt;!-- Do not remove this one. It is supposed to render nothing, but we have it here for testing purposes. --&gt;
:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = File (image) page text.
| 2 = Other pages text.
| main  = 
| file  = 1
| other = 2
| demospace = main
}}

The same goes for the '''other''' type, if it is omitted or fed no data then the template will not return any data for the page types that were not explicitly specified. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = File page text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| file  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- Do not remove this one. It is supposed to render nothing, but we have it here for testing purposes. --&gt;
:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = File page text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| file  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
}}

=== Showall ===
This template also understands a special value called '''showall'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = showall
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a main (book) page, it will as usual return this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = showall
| demospace = main
}}

If the template is on any other page than a book or a talk page it will ''show all'' the data that was fed to the numbered parameters, like this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = showall
}}

The purpose of the '''showall''' parameter is to automatically demonstrate all variations of a message when it is shown on other pages than the pages it normally is used on.

=== Demospace and page ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take two parameters named '''demospace''' and '''page'''. 

Demospace understands any of the page type names used by this template, including the '''other''' type. It tells the template to behave like it is on some specific type of page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| demospace = main
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| demospace = main
}}

The '''demospace''' parameter also understands the '''showall''' value. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| demospace = showall
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then no matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will ''show all'' the data that was fed to the numbered parameters, like this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| demospace = showall
}}

The '''page''' parameter instead takes a normal pagename. It makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| page  = User talk:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| page  = User talk:Example
}}

It can be convenient to let your template understand the demospace and/or page parameter and send it on to the {{tl|namespace detect showall}} template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Book text.
| 2 = Talk page text.
| main  = 1
| talk  = 2
| other = 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
| page  = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If both the '''demospace''' and '''page''' parameters are empty or undefined then the template will detect page types as usual.

=== Parameters ===
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{namespace detect showall
| 1 = Text one.
...
| 6 = Text six.
| main  = 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / showall
...
| other = 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / showall
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}} / showall /
              main / talk / user / wikibooks/ file / mediawiki / subject
              template / help / category / wikijunior / cookbook / other
| page  = {{{page|}}} / User:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: Empty values to the &quot;main&quot; ... &quot;cookbook&quot; parameters do have special meaning.

=== Technical details ===
Namespace &quot;Image&quot; was renamed to &quot;File&quot; on 11 December 2008. This template has been updated to understand both names, thus it still works fine. For backwards compatibility it still understands &quot;image&quot; both as a parameter name, such as &quot;image = 1&quot;, and as a value &quot;demospace = image&quot;. But using &quot;image&quot; is now deprecated.

If you intend to feed tables as content to the numbered parameters of this template, then you need to know this: 

[[Help:Templates|Templates]] have a problem handling parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Templates|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Tables|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the {{tl|!}} template. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

This is the {{tl|talkspace detect}} meta-template.

It helps other templates detect what type of page they are on.  It detects and groups all the different talkspaces used on Wikibooks into several types:

:'''main''' = Defines the output if the template is located on main/article talkspace; aka ''Talk:''.
:'''user''', '''wikibooks''', '''file''', '''subject''', '''mediawiki''', '''template''', '''help''', '''category''', '''wikijunior''', and '''cookbook''' = Defines the output if the template is located on the specified talkspaces; aka ''User talk:'', ''Wikibooks talk:'', ''File talk:'', etc.
:'''default''' = Defines the output if the template is located on any talkspaces that were not defined as a parameter to this meta-template.
:'''other''' = Defines the output if the template is located on any subject space (not the associated talkspace).

=== Usage ===
This template takes one or more parameters named after the different page types as listed above. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talkspace detect
| main    = Book talk page text
| user    = User talk page text
| default = Text for all other talkspaces
| other   = Text for all subject spaces
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

By using an empty parameter you can make it so this template doesn't render anything for some specific page type. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talkspace detect
| main    = 
| default = Text for all other talkspaces
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talkspace detect
| user = User talk text.
| default = Any talk page text.
| page = User talk:Example
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{talkspace detect
| user = User talk text.
| default = Any talk page text.
| page = User talk:Example
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. 

If the '''page''' parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talkspace detect
| user = User talk text.
| default = Any talk page text.
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is the {{tl|pagename detect see also}} template.

It is used in the &quot;See also&quot; section of the documentation of the pagename-detection templates. It takes no parameters.

If you update this template, then you should probably also update {{tl|namespace detect see also}}. That template holds almost the same list of templates, but with the namespace-detection templates at the top.

This is the {{tl|main other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a main space (book) page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Basic usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main other | Book page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a main space (book) page, it will return this:

:{{main other | demospace=main | Book page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{main other | Book page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on an article. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main other | [[Category:Some book maintenance category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main other | | This template should only be used in books. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;main&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''main''' it returns the book page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main other 
| Book page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = main
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{main other 
| Book page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = main
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{main other 
| Book page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This template detects article &quot;Talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|talk other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a talk page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talk other | Talk pages text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on any talk page, it will return this:

:{{talk other | demospace=talk | Talk pages text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{talk other | Talk page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on talk pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talk other | [[Category:Some talk page category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talk other | | This template should only be used on talk pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;talk&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''talk''' it returns the talk pages text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talk other 
| Talk pages text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = talk
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{talk other 
| Talk pages text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = talk
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{talk other 
| Talk pages text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects all types of talk pages as type '''talk'''. That is, &quot;Talk:&quot;, &quot;User talk:&quot;, &quot;File talk:&quot; and so on are all of type '''talk'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}; for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

This is the {{tl|user other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;User:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{user other | User page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;User:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{user other | demospace=user | User page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{user other | User page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on user pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{user other | [[Category:Some user category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{user other | | This template should only be used on user pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;user&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''user''' it returns the user page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{user other 
| User page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = user
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{user other 
| User page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = user
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{user other 
| User page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;User talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}, for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|file other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a &quot;File:&quot; page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page.

This template was previously named {{tl|image other}}. That name redirects here so it still works, but using the old name is now deprecated.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{file other | File page text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a file (image) page, it will return this:

:{{file other | demospace=file | File page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{file other | File page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on file pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{file other | [[Category:Some file maintenance category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{file other | | This template should only be used on file (image) pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;file&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''file''' it returns the file page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{file other 
| File page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = file
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{file other 
| File page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = file
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{file other 
| File page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;File talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

Namespace &quot;Image&quot; was renamed to &quot;File&quot; on 11 December 2008. This template was updated to understand both names well before that, thus it still works fine.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}, for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on a &quot;Category:&quot; page, it will return this:

:{{category other | demospace=category | Category page text | Other pages text }}

If the template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{category other | Category page text | Other pages text }}

A typical usage case could be to make it so that a template only adds a category when on category pages. Thus not adding other pages that just show the template. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category other | [[Category:Some category maintenance category]] }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or to warn that a template should not be used on other pages:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category other | | This template should only be used on category pages. }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the first case above the &quot;other&quot; parameter was not used, and in the second example the &quot;category&quot; parameter was left empty.

=== Demospace ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''demospace'''. 

* If it has the value '''category''' it returns the category page text.
* It if has the value '''other''' or any other value such as the name of some other namespace it returns the other pages text.
* If the parameter is empty or undefined, the actual page type determines the result.

Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category other 
| Category page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = category
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{category other 
| Category page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = category
}}

You can make it so your template also understands the '''demospace''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{category other 
| Category page text 
| Other pages text 
| demospace = {{{demospace|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
This template detects &quot;Category talk:&quot; pages as type '''other'''.

This template works like {{tl|main talk other}}, for more examples and technical details see full documentation there.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|basepage subpage}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on a '''basepage''', '''subpage''' or '''subsubpage'''.

=== Usage ===
This template takes one or more parameters, like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on the page &quot;User:Example&quot;, it will return this:

:{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| page = User:Example
}}

If the template is on &quot;User:Example/test&quot; or &quot;User:Example/test/test&quot; or any page lower than that, it will return this:

:{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| page = User:Example/test/test
}}

This template can also detect &quot;subsubpages&quot;, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| Subsubpage text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on &quot;User:Example/test/test&quot; or any page lower than that, it will return this:

:{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| Subsubpage text
| page = User:Example/test/test
}}

By using an empty parameter you can make it so the template doesn't render anything for some specific page type. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| 
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code above will render nothing when on &quot;User:Example/test/test&quot; or lower, but will return this when on &quot;User:Example/test&quot;:

:{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| 
| page = User:Example/test
}}

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| page = User:Example/test
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| page = User:Example/test
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. Thus, if a subsubpagename like &quot;User:Example/test/test&quot; is fed, then it returns the subsubpage text if there is one, otherwise it returns the subpage text. 

The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. 

If the parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| Basepage text
| Subpage text
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
Templates have a problem handling parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{basepage subpage
| 1 = Basepage text
| 2 = Subpage text
| 3 = Subsubpage text
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This template detects subpages even when used in namespaces that doesn't have the MediaWiki [[meta:Link#Subpage feature|subpage feature]] enabled. Thus this template works the same in all namespaces.

This is the {{tl|if pagename}} meta-template.

It helps other templates detect what page they are on. It uses pattern matching on the pagename.

=== Usage ===
This template takes one or more parameters. Most of the parameters don't have fixed names, instead they are part of the pattern matching. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
| /doc = Doc page text
| other = Other pages text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the template is on &quot;Template:Example/doc&quot; the code above will return this:

:{{if pagename
| /doc = Doc page text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example/doc
}}

If the template is on any ''other'' page than a /doc page it will return this:

:{{if pagename
| /doc = Doc page text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example
}}

Here is a description of the full pattern matching:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
&lt;!-- Match on full pagename --&gt;
| User:Example/test = Text for &quot;User:Example/test&quot;.
| User:Example = Text for &quot;User:Example&quot;.
| User talk:Example = Text for &quot;User talk:Example&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on full basepage name, when on a basepage or its subpages --&gt;
| User:Example/+ = Matches &quot;User:Example&quot; and &quot;User:Example/test&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on pagename, when on a basepage --&gt;
| Example = Matches &quot;User:Example&quot;, &quot;User talk:Example&quot;, &quot;Template:Example&quot; 
            and so on, but not &quot;User:Example/something&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on full basepage name, when on a subpage --&gt;
| User:Example/* = Matches &quot;User:Example/something&quot;, but not &quot;User:Example&quot;.
| User talk:Example/* = Matches &quot;User talk:Example/something&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on basepage name, when on a subpage --&gt;
| Example/* = Matches &quot;User:Example/something&quot; and &quot;User talk:Example/something&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on subpage name --&gt;
| /something = Any pagename that ends in &quot;/something&quot;.
| /doc = Any pagename that ends in &quot;/doc&quot;.

&lt;!-- Match on partial subpage name (case-insensitive) --&gt;
| /some* = Any subpage name beginning with &quot;/some&quot; or &quot;/Some&quot;.
| /arch* = Matches &quot;User talk:Example/Archive 1&quot;.

&lt;!-- Default fallbacks --&gt;
| basepage = Text for any basepage.
| subpage = Text for any subpage.
| other = Text for any page.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The matching goes from top to bottom, and returns the first parameter that matches. &quot;''Top to bottom''&quot; means the order shown above, not the order you happen to feed the parameters.

There's no limit to the number of parameters that you can use, other than what the servers and MediaWiki system can handle. 

Most of the matching is case-sensitive. For instance &quot;&lt;code&gt;/test&lt;/code&gt;&quot; matches &quot;User:Example/test&quot; but not &quot;User:Example/Test&quot;. 

Matching on partial subpage names such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;/some*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; has some limitations, see [[#Partial subpage names|its own section]] below.

If an empty (but defined) parameter matches, the matching stops and the template returns an empty string. That's on purpose and can be used like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
| /doc =
| /sandbox = Sandbox text
| other = Other pages text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code above will render nothing when on a /doc page. But when on a /sandbox page it will return this: 

:{{if pagename
| /doc =
| /sandbox = Sandbox text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example/sandbox
}}

And when on any other page it will return this:

:{{if pagename
| /doc =
| /sandbox = Sandbox text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example
}}

=== Partial subpage names ===
This template can also match on partial subpage names. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
| /archiv* = Archive page text
| other = Other pages text
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If on &quot;User:Example/Archive 1&quot; the code above will return this:

:{{if pagename
| /archiv* = Archive page text
| other = Other pages text
| page = User:Example/Archive 1
}}

The parameter name &quot;&lt;code&gt;/some*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; must be lower case. But it matches subpage names in both upper and lower case such as &quot;User:Example/SomeThing&quot; and &quot;User:Example/something&quot;.

The partial matching only supports matching on 4, 6 and 8 characters. Thus using &quot;&lt;code&gt;/some*&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;code&gt;/someth*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;/somethin*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; works, but using &quot;&lt;code&gt;/som*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;/somet*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; doesn't work.

Longer patterns match first, thus if both &quot;&lt;code&gt;/somethin*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;/some*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; are defined, and the current page is &quot;User:Example/Something&quot;, then the data from &quot;&lt;code&gt;/somethin*&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will be used.

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===
For testing and demonstration purposes this template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
| /test = Test pages text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example/test
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{if pagename
| /test = Test pages text
| other = Other pages text
| page = Template:Example/test
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. 

If the '''page''' parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{if pagename
| /test = Test pages text
| other = Other pages text
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Namespace matching ===
This template doesn't have namespace matching. If you need that then combine this template with one of the namespace-detection templates such as {{tl|template other}}. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{template other
| {{if pagename
  | /doc = Template doc page text.
  }}
| &lt;!-- Other space, do nothing --&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If on &quot;User:Example/doc&quot; the code above will return nothing. But if on &quot;Template:Example/doc&quot; it will return this:

:{{template other
| {{if pagename
  | /doc = Template doc page text.
  | page = Template:Example/doc
  }}
| &lt;!-- Other space, do nothing --&gt;
| demospace = template
}}

=== Technical details ===
This template detects subpages even when used in namespaces that doesn't have the MediaWiki [[meta:Link#Subpage feature|subpage feature]] enabled. Thus this template works the same in all namespaces.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This is the {{tl|IP-user other}} meta-template.

This template helps other templates detect if they are on an IP-user page or some &quot;other&quot; type of page. It detects both the subject page and talk page of an IP-user as &quot;IP-user&quot;. It also detects the subpages and subsubpages of an IP-user, for instance it considers &quot;User:12.34.56.78/subpage&quot; as &quot;IP-user&quot;.

=== Usage ===
This template usually takes two parameters, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{IP-user other | IP-user text | Other pages text }}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If this template is on an IP-user page, it will return this:

:{{IP-user other | page = User:12.34.56.78 | IP-user text | Other pages text }}

If this template is on any other page, it will return this:

:{{IP-user other | IP-user text | Other pages text }}

=== The &quot;page&quot; parameter ===
This template can take a parameter named '''page'''. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{IP-user other
| IP-user text 
| Other pages text
| page = User:12.34.56.78
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter on what kind of page the code above is used it will return this:

:{{IP-user other
| IP-user text 
| Other pages text
| page = User:12.34.56.78
}}

The '''page''' parameter makes this template behave exactly as if on that page. The pagename doesn't have to be an existing page. 

If the parameter is empty or undefined, the name of the current page determines the result.

You can make it so your template also understands the '''page''' parameter. That means you can demonstrate the different appearances of your template in the documentation for your template. Then do like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{IP-user other
| IP-user text 
| Other pages text
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Technical details ===
Templates have a problem handling parameter data that contains equal signs &quot;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. But that is easily solved by using numbered parameters. Like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{IP-user other
| 1 = IP-user text 
| 2 = Other pages text
| page = {{{page|}}}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If your template is using tables, then you need to know this:

Templates have a problem handling parameter data that contains pipes &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, unless the pipe is inside another template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{name|param1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or inside a piped link &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Help:Templates|help]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Thus templates can not handle [[Help:Tables|wikitables]] as input unless you escape them by using the {{tl|!}} template. This makes it hard to use wikitables as parameters to templates. Instead the usual solution is to use &quot;HTML wikimarkup&quot; for the table code, which is more robust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally, AAVE is similar to Mainstream American English (MAE), but some grammatical features are unique when compared to the standard.  For instance, a double negative (It ain't worth nothing, Now I'm not no professor but I know what you're talking about) does not make a positive, but rather signifies emphasis. Certain prepositions/verbs, e.g. &quot;be&quot;, &quot;gonna&quot;(going to) can signify [[../Verbs/Aspect|aspect]], leading to phrases such as &quot;He be working&quot; that would normally be considered off.

== Is AAVE &quot;Bad Grammar&quot;? ==
No. Though its rules differ from those of Standard English, they are internally consistent and one can tell if a grammatical concept is being misused. Though historically its teaching has been met with much controversy, the grammatical features are agreed not to be flaws in the speech of individual speakers.

&lt;li&gt; Some [[Help:Templates|templates]] and site interface pages are permanently protected due to visibility. Occasionally, pages are temporarily protected because of editing disputes. Most pages can be edited by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The reason for protection can be found in the [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=protect&amp;page={{FULLPAGENAMEE}}}} protection log]. If there are no relevant entries in the protection log, the page may have been moved after being protected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt; While most pages can be edited by anyone, semi-protection is sometimes necessary to prevent vandalism to popular pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The reason for protection can be found in the [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=protect&amp;page={{FULLPAGENAMEE}}}} protection log]. If there are no relevant entries in the protection log, the page may [{{fullurl:Special:Log|type=move&amp;page={{FULLPAGENAMEE}}}} have been moved] after being protected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; If you have a user account, [[Special:UserLogin|log in]] first. If you do not yet have an account, you may [{{fullurl:Special:UserLogin|type=signup}} create one]; after 4 days and 10 edits, you will be able to edit semi-protected pages.&lt;/li&gt;

Someone else has changed this page since you started editing it, resulting in an '''[[WB:EC|edit conflict]]'''.

&lt;li&gt;The '''upper text area''' contains the page text '''as it currently exists''' (without your changes).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;editconflict-notice-2&quot;&gt; You will have to '''merge''' your changes into the existing text in the upper text area to incorporate your edits.  Only the text in the '''upper text area will be saved''' when you press &quot;{{int:Savearticle}}&quot;; all other changes in the '''lower text area will be lost'''. &lt;br /&gt;

Please do not just copy the text from the lower text area into the upper, unless you're ''sure'' that you want to undo all other changes made while you were editing this page.  Rather, please try to compare the two versions and combine them into one text that preserves both your edits and any improvements made by others. &lt;/div&gt;
{{#switch: {{NAMESPACE}}

&lt;!-- This text is only shown on talk and project pages (and on MediaWiki pages to make editing it easier). --&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;editconflict-notice-3&quot;&gt;

----

If you were '''adding a comment to a [[WB:DISCUSS|discussion]]''', it may be easier to resolve the conflict by redoing the edit from the start: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol id=editconflict-notice-4&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locate the text you were trying to add in the lower text area, or use your browser's &quot;Back&quot; button to return to the previous page and locate it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[w:Cut, copy, and paste|Copy]] the text you were trying to add to your clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you were editing a specific section, go back to the original page and click the &quot;&amp;#91;{{int:editsection}}&amp;#93;&quot; link again.  If not, just click the &quot;{{int:edit}}&quot; tab at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[w:Cut, copy, and paste|Paste]] the text you copied into the appropriate spot on the edit form and press &quot;{{int:Savearticle}}&quot;.  This time, you will hopefully not get an edit conflict.&lt;/li&gt;

* Unless the matter is confidential, it is usually better to leave a message on the user's discussion page.

* If you are referring to a specific Wikibooks page, remember to include its exact title.
* The message is sent as plain text: wiki markup (such as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[links]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) will not work.

|text  = Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a [[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist|site registered on Wikibooks' blacklist]]. 
* '''To save your changes now''', you must go back and ''remove the blocked link'' (shown below), and then save.
* '''If you feel the link is needed''', you can: 
** ''Request that the entire website be allowed'', that is, removed from the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist|local]] or [[meta:Talk:Spam blacklist#Proposed removals|global]] spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).
** ''Request that just the specific page be allowed'', without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist|spam whitelist talk page]].
Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should '''clearly''' demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikibooks.
